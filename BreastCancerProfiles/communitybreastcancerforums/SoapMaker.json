After steriotactic bx, it inflammed and grew to 3-5 centimeters, in just weeks. After finding it, I had a mamm and SOMETHING was visible. The card they sent me in the mail said that there were some findings on the mamm that needed further investigation but \"...findings such as these are normally not cancer (benign).\" There was no family hx of bc, but lots of family hx for colon cancer and ovarian cancer, which is in the same gene pool. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Where is the cure??? www.truefacesofbreastcancer.org",

The thought of their sadness of losing me (I thought I had been given a death sentence), just broke my heart, but I didn't panic. I did a lot of research and learned so much. I joined forums and found out that BC was no longer a death sentence. When my surgeon told me I was triple negative, I said, \"Yesssssss!\", with an arm pumping action. He looked at me so strangely. I have my reasons for being happy that I am triple negative. When he called me at work and gave me my diagnosis, he paused to wait for me break down, but I calmly said, \"Okay, what do we do next?\" I was/am really strong. I was not afraid of death, but my heartbreak was for my children. I had one meltdown in the shower while going through chemo. I was just tired of it all. I did get angry at God, until I realized that He didn't give me cancer. It's just a part of living. It is good that you are strong and I don't find it strange, at all. You may have a few moments down the line, but that too shall pass. My best to you. --------------------------------------------------------------- Where is the cure??? www.truefacesofbreastcancer.org",

I was healthy all the way through, but they looked at me like I was a sick person. People were very good to me and supportive, but there was always that pity look in their eyes and the awkward sentences. For example, after my diagnosis, I lifted something one day and somebody asked, \"Can you DO that???\" Like I was suppose to be sick and not able to lift something. Another time, at a pot luck, people were shocked that I was able to eat all of my food. Somebody said, \"You were able to eat it all. That's great!\" So, we just have to chalk it up to ignorance. They have never had cancer. They do not know how to act. I know that before I had cancer, I thought that anyone who got cancer became emaciated...so when I was diagnosed, I started eating anything and everything to gain weight. I gained 20 pounds. I put on the weight so that when I started losing it, it would take a while before I looked so bad. SURPRISE. I didn't lose anything and got stuck with that 20 pounds. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Where is the cure??? www.truefacesofbreastcancer.org",

At this time, RU-486 was controversial in the US and had not entered our arena, yet. My argument was that it should be allowed in the US. Here's an interesting excerpt: RU-486 clearly has potential beyond its ability to end pregnancy. Outside of pregnancy, it has the potential of one day helping to treat cancers that have progesterone receptors. Clinical investigators in the United States should be given the chance for research and exploration. In lab studies conducted on RU-486, it has retarded the growth of tumors which have progesterone receptors. RU-486 just may be that miracle is disguise.... I didn't get diagnosed with bc til 2002, so this paper that I wrote really jumped out at me. Seems predictively scary. I didn't get bc til 12 years later. I know that RU-486 is in the US, now, but does anyone know if they are researching it as a treatment for bc? --------------------------------------------------------- Where is the cure www.truefacesofbreastcancer.org Log in to post a reply",
