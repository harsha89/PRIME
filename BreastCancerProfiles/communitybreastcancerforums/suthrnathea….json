He told me he wishes he could tell me it was a fiberous cyst and not cancer because I am only 29 but he can't (that is exactly how he worded it to me). I am scheduled for a mammogram and ultrasound thursday at 10:30am. I called my mom and told her and I was right, she wanted to go into panic mode. But I think she is ok now. I wanted to wait until after the mammogram but I promised my boyfriend I'd tell her if the doctor did in fact find a lump. She is 500 miles away and I knew it would be hard for her. Haha, I'm trying not to worry and I am worried how my mom is. So I am trying to just focus on getting till Thursday. They didn't schedule a follow up so I am guessing that I will find something out Thursday. I",

Also - I see you are on Lupron. How long have you been on it and have you had any issues? I was on it for a year before my histerectomy and have been having bone and joint pain that my doctor says may be a longterm side effect from the Lupron. I haven't met anyone else that has been on it so I was just curious.",

I had my mammogram (and I'm sorry, but ouch doesn't even come close to explaining that pain) and ultrasound and they could see an area of thickening but could not find the lump that the doctor found at my exam!!!!! The radiologist doesn't think there is any reason to worry about the thickening.  Thank you!!! I also want to say that I will continue to pray for everyone here because I couldn't even begin to imagine how I would have felt if the results were different and I want to offer my thoughts and prayers to anyone who goes through that.",
