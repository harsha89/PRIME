Looked at your profile and noticed you had 40% risk of cancer and you went through the mastectomy... I guess I am not overreacting at all, and even if I am not BRACA positive, and my biopsy comes negative, I still have LCIS and my Mom had cancer twice, and I have an autoimmune desease and according to my surgeon my risk is over 50%,  so... I think I should just go for it, right?",

It got too overwhelming and I needed a mental break from information:)  Here is my update:  MRI came back totally clear.  Had my surgical biopsy done today, still groggy from sedative (insisted on twilight sedation instead of full aenestesia - so glad I did, as I always throw up afterwards, no matter how many heroic efforts they undertake to prevent it, haha).  Also groggy from the antibiotic, because, naturally, I had an allergic reaction, no surprises here.  So... benandril is my friend:)  For now, I just have to wait on the biopsy results.  My surgeon told me I am not even in a risk factor group for genetic testing, because my Mom had BC after her menapause, and although I do have  Eastern European Ashkenazi background, it is on my father's, not my mother's side?  Thought that was interesting... BS also added that, if I DO have cancer at the moment, then I AM in the risk group for BRCA mutation and then she would recommend I test.  I am thinking, in this scenario, if there IS a cancer diagnosis, even if I am NOT positive, I should still have my prophilactic mastectomy, what do you ladies think?  And, of course, IF it is cancer and if I am positive, then it is a no-brainer... But....what if there is no cancer?  Do I still insist on the testing?  And, if the testing is negative, then what?  Any input, pro and con would be highly appreciated:) Tatiana",
