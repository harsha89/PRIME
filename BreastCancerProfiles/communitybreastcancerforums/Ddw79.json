In my case anyway was not protective against breast cancer . I went into natural menopause at age 40 and then due to the family genetics of BRCA 1 ( not me though) I had prophylactic ooph at age 41. Was not protective in that sense . At 62 dxed with ADH. So I suggest ooph just to protect against ovarian cancer due to family genetics . If I were you, and I'm not of course, I would at least try the tamoxifen just to feel that I had tried everything. I wish I had the option but due to other comorbid diseases I have not been recommended these drugs. I will revisit the drug issue though and I may push to try evista. I think if you are not in menopause the best option you have is Tamoxifin.  I hope my story helps. I will keep you posted about my journey. I am struggling right there with you.... Every single day.

I am negative for 19 genetic mutations and you may very well be too. Keep that in mind ok? I know that a 50-50 proposition is crazy making and I could hardly handle it 23 years ago but try to put it into perspective . You may very well be in the negative 50.

And in the middle of all of this I get breast exams at the high risk clinic .  I have ADH noted through presence of microcalcifications on Mammogram. This new US would not have picked that up so I think it's important to have a couple of imaging modalities alternating with each other . I have also been taking Evista since January.

Are you meeting with a genetics counselor to go over these potential risks and numerical values. All we know here is what is considered \" relative risk.\" Personal risk does not seem clear to me at all in this case.  I am at high risk due to surgical findings recently but even considering that all of the women in my family died of either breast or ovarian cancer this iny case is not a high risk factor for me. O was tested along with other family members in 1992 for the recently isolated BRCA1 Gene. It took almost two years to return my test results. Two other family members tested positive for BRCA1 in study. I brought them to Boston to be studied. I tested negative . This I believe would be a high confidence or informed negative. Yet I am one step before a breast cancer diagnosis. I do not believe that there is an obvious genetic etiology in my case. Breast Cancer happens. It sounds like you will be well monitored. In addition since you are so young and to date high confidence negative I would suggest that it would be well worth while to see a genetics counselor about other possible gene involvement and it's great in so many ways that you have living family membes to test too",
