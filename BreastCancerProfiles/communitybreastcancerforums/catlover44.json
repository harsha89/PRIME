By the way, the surgery is not bad, really.  It sounds brutal to think of \"cutting your breasts off\", but if you look at it as saving your life, it's a different story.  I had virtually no pain with the mastectomy--the only part that has been uncomfortable is where the lymph nodes were removed (that armpit is sensitive!).  Anyway, if fear of the surgery is a stopping block, don't let that influence your decision. Good luck and remember to pray for guidance!",

When are you starting chemo and what kind, how long, etc?  I have to have a petscan, ab ct scan & EKG tomorrow, then I meet with the onc. Friday to see what kind of punishment she's going to dole out.  I already know she's wanting me to do 6 rounds of TAC, which is heavy duty.  I'm planning on waiting until we get back from vacation in mid-July to start so I don't have any other medical surprises occur while I'm 8 hours away from home!  (I'm not sure how to PM because I'm new to this board, but we should try that so we don't gum up the topic at hand!)",

I share your aggravation about trying not to get your bandages wet.  I'm never very successful with that either--when I was trying to do it, I ended up washing my hair in the kitchen sink, and just bathing by washing all around the bandage and trying not to drip on it.  I never felt clean!  Luckily, my surgeon likes to use the glue instead of lots of bandages, so for the actual mastectomy I didn't have to worry much after a day or so about getting the incision wet.  It was nice to get the bandages off the drainage tube area--it was very hard to keep that dry.  I'll never take a good shower for granted again.",
