PET and MRI says all the cancer they saw on previous scans is dead so the doctor says he now wants to do surgery. He agreed there is some thought that there is no point to doing the surgery after it's spread but believes it is for the best. His simplified explanation was that without the mother ship (the breast tumor), the mets do not do as well. He said there was some study started at MD Anderson to compare stage IV patients (he said just like me so I assume he meant stage IV from the start) with surgery vs without but said they stopped the study because the patients without surgery were having re-occurrences much sooner. I haven't done extensive reading up on the issue but from what I've read here, that MD Anderson story appears to be untrue but I'm ok with doing the surgery. I think I would ok with not doing it too. Another note, he did mention that the size of the breast tumor hasn't changed (originally about 5cm) but it shows no metabolic activity. I find that puzzling since his description of other spots on previous scan are now completely gone. My lymph nodes for example, they show no metabolic activity and are no longer enlarged.",

I did not get much time with either because one died when I was young and I lived in a different state from the other. So I have just a few memories of either one of their cancer stories. So the story I was told about my mother's mother, the one with breast cancer, was she was 60 at the time of diagnosis and all they know about the tumors is that it was ER+. This was in the early 90s. She did not see a doctor about her breasts until the skin had started to dimple like an orange and she had some deformity. And she had tumors in both breasts. She refused any treatment outside of surgery. (That part I remember so I know it's true). So she had modified bilateral mastectomy and ran up a bunch of debt waiting to die. Except she didn't. Several years later, 5 or so, she had some bone pain she passed off as bursitis that turned out to be bone metastasis. The only treatment after this was radiation. She tried Tamoxifen but for whatever reason she did not tolerate it and stopped. She lived to be 75. I was impressed that she lived 15 years.",
