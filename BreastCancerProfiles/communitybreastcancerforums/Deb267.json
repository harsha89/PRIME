He saw the fibro history and addressed it right away. I will make the drive to Jacksonville. The local onocologist. Rolled his eyes when I asked about chemotherapy and fibro. I am as afraid of the fibro, maybe more than the chemotherapy. I have spent years learning to live with the fibromyalgia and I am at a good place with it. The main thing is you have to keep moving. If I am down a couple days it takes weeks to get back to normal. I will have TCx4 then 5 weeks of radiation. He is rechecking the er/pr status since it is weakly +. he said several years ago it would prob been classed triple neg. The 5 year medication treatment may be effected by this. He felt this 5 year medication would be more of an issue with the Fibro than the chemo. If it is below 5% + he will not feel as strong on continuing the Aromatase inhibitor if I have problems with the Fibromyalgia.",

It would be best for a port or a pic line, we opted for the pic line the chemo nurses can remove that after the tx, and will use the single lumen that only requires flushing once a week. The nurse pract came to me in the chemo room and said I hear you want a port,you are only getting 3 more tx. What is her problem!? The nurses told her I have no veins suitable for this tx and to have veins later for blood draws or iv it would be best to save what little I have. It seems I questioned her decision and she got her fur ruffled. I don't want to see her again my next appt is with her, I will have to change that, I don't need her attitude right now. Other than that everything is good. Can't seem to hold my urine if I feel the urge I have to try to make it to the bathroom before it makes it to the exit door. It's a mad race some I win,some it wins. I think we are bout 50-50 now. I have never had this problem before. They told me to drink plenty water to flush it out, they did not say it would be on auto flush. LOL it has got to be a game, I run my husband bets whether I am gonna make it or not.

The worst has been the sore mouth and thrush, my OC gave me a rx for mircle mouth wash it has nystatin worked right away.

The 24 hour generic works as well as brand. Rachel I used Sally Hansen hard as nails base and ice this time. Also trying the olive oil swish I lost my taste within a few hours this time but after the swishing it seems to be coming and going it must be helping last time when it left it did not come back until three days before the next tx. Fingers crossed the taste thing really works on me. I usually eat one meal planning the next.",

He also asked if he could paint a pic for his web site for breast cancer awareness he did one that day and I will go back after I heal and finish treatment for an after shot. He painted the pink ribbon on my chest with doodles to cover the rest of the boobies. He paints and does the photography. That weekend brought me back to myself and made the rest of this journey acceptable in a strange way. I look at the pictures when I am down and think yeah that was me before but I am ok now too.",
