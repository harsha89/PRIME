And I am sure you all know how it goes the whole world promises to be there every step of the way but when it comes down to it no one really is so I feel like I have not really had the chance to grieve or recover because I had to get right back to life. I did see a counseler for a little while but I stopped going because I would start bawling everytime and I felt so dumb! I probably need to find a counseler that specifies in this unfortunately my oncologist is not the greatest at that kind of stuff..All they care about is getting their money! I couldn't believe the difference between them and the huntsman center when I went up there but unfortunately they are too far for me to drive for treatment. I actually had an alblation done two weeks after my mastectomy because my periods had gotten so so bad since chemo and I couldn't stand it! Ultimately I am going to have a hysterectomy but I have to wait until after reconstruction because if they need to do a tram flap they need to be able to take it from my stomach. I should be back in surgery in three weeks if all goes well. The only things that really sucks is my husbands emplyer gave him the week off the first time and I highly doubt they will again so I am really going to be on my own.. Not looking forward to that and I think that is majorly stressing me out. Oh ya and for being mad that I am only 30....I was misdiagnosed when I was 27! I went because I could feel the lump and they sent me for an ultrasound and said it was dense tissue don't worry about it..Well the lump grew and I went back and now it's too late..I will be on treatment of atleast herceptin and tamoxafin for the rest of my life. I will never get my port out and my risk of it spreading somewhere else is sky high now. Now that's what makes me mad! I should not be where I am today it should have been taken seriously before and prevented me from getting to this stage. Sigh",

I can't tell you how exciting this is to have someone say we believe you should have been treated differently and should not be in the situation you are in now. It will be a long process and no gaurentees but they don't take cases they don't feel confident about so I feel good about it. I am hoping this works out in the end so I can have piece of mind that my family will be taken care of if I die...And that it may raise some awareness in the process to show that younger women do infact get breast cancer and they should not be dismissed if they have concerns!",

And if the skin stretches enough in the next two weeks she is going to take me back in and put the expander in if not then I will be doing a tram flap. So fortunately my time is limited before I will begin reconstruction. I guess too it could be a side effect of the tamoxafin making me gloomy and moody...I am planning on doing a hysterectomy and using aromatose inhibitors eventually maybe they won't be as bad??",

I do blame myself some because I didn't push it or make them follow up for three years but I trusted the doctor... I did send my info to a lawyer siegfried and jensen they couldn't help me but I have another apointment next week to see a more local lawyer hoping they can help me. I would really like to have a sense of peace that my kids will be taken care of if it comes down to it. This is not fair my kids shouldn't have to worry about mom not living very long (not that they do I never told them that but you get what I mean)",
