I did have ultrasound and it shows 2 tumors in my left breast. One is 2cm and the other is 4.5cm but after being examined by oncologist and surgeon they kinda believe it's not two but one huge tumor. The surgeon did say he wanted me to have chemo to shrink it plus it has spread into my lymph nodes and that one is pretty big and and sore also. Oh yeah......grade 3",
