I have a friend who knows someone that was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer, had double mastectomy two years ago. She was given Tamoxifen and that was that. She is under VA care and has not been back to the dr's at the VA for any post check ups because she was not told it was required. Its been two year an still no reconstruction surgery either. I don't know much about what is required after a double mastectomy but are annual or semi annual mamos required for 5 years like a typical breast cancer survivor? what can you tell me about post care after a double mast?
