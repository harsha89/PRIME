N and she says she found a lump ( that was on a Tuesday). She scheduled me for a monogram and ultrasound the next day. When I was sitting with the radiologist he told me my monogram was fine and he wasn't sure why I was there. I explained to him the change in my size and the lump. We went over to ultrasound and he rub his finger around my breast and said I feel no lump. He told me well if you press hard enough on any breast I am sure you could find something. He made me feel really awful and I walked out of there feeling uncertain. Should I be getting a second option? Thank you Log in to post a reply",
