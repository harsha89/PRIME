Had routine mammogram last week & they found a cluster of microcalcifications Had diagnostic mammo yesterday. Dr. said she couldn't tell if it was benign or not & wanted to do a stereotactic (sp?) biopsy. I had one scheduled for tomorrow but cancelled it. I've read that only 15% of microcalcification clusters are cancer, and even those are often just Stage 0. So it doesn't seem worth the misery. I'm considering a 2nd opinion but have never had one before (I do my best to avoid doctors :) ). Have any of you sought a 2nd opinion before getting a breast biopsy? If so, do you have to start the whole process over again with new mammograms? Or can the 2nd dr. just look at the mammograms taken by the first dr. & base his or her decision on that?

They said yes that does sometimes happen but they do everything in their power to avoid surgery. They tried again & this time were able to get some calcs.

But I decided to quit being such a big baby & had the biopsy today. It was not anywhere close to being as bad as I feared. I did take 2 extra strength Tylenol & a Valium 1 hour before. And this is gonna sound weird but I also took a Dramamine. That's supposed to be for motion sickness, but I discovered years ago it helps with nausea caused by any other reason. I was feeling a little queasy from nerves. Dramamine also has a sedating effect. The dr. & 2 nurses could not have been any nicer. They explained everything they were doing & made sure I was comfortable. We chatted about our pets. The breast compression didn't hurt a bit. I barely noticed the lidocaine injection. The dr. took 3 tissue samples which hurt just a tiny bit. Just quick little twinges. It turned out he didn't get any of the calcifications because they'd gotten moved by the lidocaine injection. So he gave me more lidocaine & took 3 more samples. Those hurt a little more. The dr. offered to stop & give me more lidocaine but I told him no, I'm fine. The pain was maybe at the most a 4 on a scale of 1-10. Nowhere close to being unbearable. This time he got a bunch of calcifications. Then he inserted the tiny metal clip. I didn't even feel that. And it was done. They took a couple mammograms which was not the slightest bit painful. And home I went with an ice pack on my breast. About an hour after,the lidocaine wore off & I started having some soreness. But certainly nothing intolerable. I haven't even felt the need for more Tylenol. Not yet anyway. Maybe tomorrow there'll be more soreness. But for now the ice pack is fine. Tomorrow I get the results. I'm really not nervous right now. Mostly I'm just so relieved to have the biopsy done. Also there's probably still some Valium in my system :) To all the ladies here who had horrible experiences with your biopsies, I'm so sorry for what you went through. Years ago I had an endometrial biopsy that was excruciating beyond words. So I have some idea of the pain you're talking about. I'm extremely grateful that this biopsy was nothing like that.
