I have just had a MRI and am waiting for the results, My Onc like to use MRI as she thinks it shows more which makes it easier to catch something quickly..",

I am so upset, I just wanted to know what is going on, I have got to the point where I dont care what it is that they have found I just want to get things moving as all this not knowing is driving me mad.  All I know is that from the first biopsy they found ADH/DCIS but the BS was not sure if there was any invasive cells or not.

I cant belive just how emotional I am right now, one minute I am ok and thinking I will deal with this with no problems and all is going to be ok and then five minutes later I am crying and thinking the worst.  I have MS as well and I need to use a wheelchair to get about at work and my BS has told me that I will need to be off work for at least 10 days after the surgery to allow myself to heal.  I am so worried about having to take this time off and that on top of everything else makes me feel like its all to much and I just it to all go away. I agree that the waiting is the worst bit of all this, I just want to know what it is and how can it be treated..",

I also had to have bloods done and a urine test. The Doctor that was doing the evaluation asked me to tell him what I was having done and what I had been told by my BS and PCP.  I told him about the biopsy results of ADH and that my BS want me to be seen by a Med Oncologist about further treatment. We talked about the surgery and how I felt about it and how I was dealing with the emotions that come with this situation.  I told him about being emotional and he said he would have been very worried if I was not bothered by all that is going on.  I told him about the support that I have found here and he said that knowledge is my best friend and any help and support I can find to help me deal with all this is a good thing.  So now I have to wait again for the surgery on May 7th...",

I arrived at Brigham & Womens Hospital at 8:30am on Fri morning, after checking in at the day surgery unit I was sent to the Breast Imiging center to have the wire inserted,  They did numb me up before they put the wire in.  It was almost exactly the same as when I had the Biopsy done but it only took 45 minutes to do it.  I was then taken in a wheelchair back to the day surgery unit where I was seen by my BS just to go over what was going to happen. They took much more tissue than I thought they would, they took about a 3inch diameter section so my boob is looking quite odd. I have a 4inch scar running from my nipple back towards my arm pit.  The BS has said that she thinks we have clear margins but we need to wait for the results to come back. I am very sore and I have never been so bruised in all my life, I have to wear a surgical bra day and night for the next 5 days  and I go back to see the BS on the 13th. so I am hoping to get good news then...",

I was taken from the ultra sound to the doctors office where she told me that they has found some calcium deposits and they needed to do a biopsy to make sure it was nothing to worry about.  I was booked to have the biopsy done on  April 8th.  The Biopsy went ok it was uncomfortable being squashed in the mamo machine for the whole time but I just wanted it to be over and everything to be ok. I got a call 2 days later from my PCP to say that the results were back and they did show a cause for concern and she wanted me to come into her office that day.  I drove to her office in a total state of shock.. The results she gave me were: 1. Benign brest parenchyma with microcyst formation and sclerosing adnosis with associated microcalcifications. 2. Focal (multi) atypical ductal hyperplasia with microcalcifications. BI_RADS 4 She said that there is a possiblity that the ADH could be a DCIS and we needed to get a breast surgeon on board. My PCP called a BS that she has know for some time and she faxes over all the images and path report to the BS.  The BS phoned me later that day to say she would like to meet with me in 2 days time so we can go over everything and see where we go from here.  I met with the BS and she explained about the ADH and that it could be DCIS as there is not much difference between them but they must be treated in a different way.  I am scheduled to have an excisional biopsy/lumpectomy done on May 7th, she also talked about seeing a medical oncoligist once we have the results as I may need radiation therapy or other treatment. I am going for my pre-op tests on thursday and I am starting to get worried.  I have read so many posts on here from people who are so strong, I just feel weak and a wreck.. Any guidance on how to cope with all this would be welcome. 1st mamo 03/22 2nd mamo 03/26 1st biopsy 04/06 Surgical wide excisional biopsy 05/07 HERE WE GO AGAIN: - MRI 07/29 Biopsy 08/12 - IBC stage3 Dx 8/20/2010, IBC, 3cm, Stage IIIC, Grade 3, 5/0 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
