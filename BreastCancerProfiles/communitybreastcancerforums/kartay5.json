They tried, but couldn't do a stereotactic biopsy because of the location...so I met with a bs last week and am scheduled for excisional biopsy next Wednesday. It feels like I've been in the twilight zone for a month! Best wishes to you. I know the waiting is awful.",

My radiologist used almost the same words...can't say it is cancer, but I can't say it is not....He tried a sterotactic biopsy, but it was too close to the chest wall to get a good angle. He decided to send me for a surgical, which I have my consult with the surgeon tomorrow. I hope you can enjoy your vacation! I've been trying to stay EXTRA busy just to keep my mind off everything.",
