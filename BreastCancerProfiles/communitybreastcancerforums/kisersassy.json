It would be great to give her some advice on it.  I already warned her about the Utter Smooth cream and the Immodium AD she had my grandpa go get it for her to be prepared. I dont know yet, but I am under the assumption that they are putting her on just one pill a day and one pill of Tykerb a day because of all her other health problems. They also gave her oxicodone for the pain and silly her said she was only going to take them in dire straights so that she doesnt run out.  I told her to take them whenever she wanted for pain no need to suffer because when they run out the Dr will give her more and more.  But she will be 76 years old on the 8th and she hates meds, but again she doesnt need to suffer with pain in this day and age.

It shows that compared to her last PET, she has increased findings in her humerous heads, sternum, and spine.  A bone scan was done today and we will find out the results on the 19th to see if it is just arthritis.  But can you get arthritis in the sternum? It shows moderate right plueral effusion and pericardial effusion moderate. Calcification and enlargement of the spleen. Plus harding of her carotid arteries.  She has had this but it is worst.

In updates I told you about grandmas increased activity in her spine, sternum, knees, humurous heads, and a new spot along with the other spots on her ribs from the PET scan she had done in May of 08 to the one she had in January of 09.  Also a new spot on a new rib showed up on her bone scan from the previous bone scan.  Welllllll, my grandma was in so much pain we took her to the hospital yesterday and they gave her 3 doses of morphine and then told her to go home and take Oxicodone that her Onc (which is a Nurse Practitioner) prescribed her.  These were prescribed months ago and my grandpa refused to let her take them because he did not want her to get addicted to them.  So finally with the updates on the scans and from yesterday he finally agreed to let her take them.  Well, My aunt in the mean time had called her Onc and the Onc finally got back to her today.  What I am frustrated with totally is that the Onc told my Aunt 100% different story than what she told me.  She told my Aunt that she does not have mets to any organ, any bone, nor her brain, nor her lungs.  THIS IS GREAT NEWS SO DONT GET ME WRONG.  Ok so if that is the case she would be considered a Stage 1?  If so why did she tell me 3 months or so ago my grandma was a Late Stage III definatley and probably a Stage IV?  She told my Aunt that grandma just has Arthritis and Osteoporosis.  She also said that her breast are clear with no signs of cancer.  Well, her Mammo report showed a spot but they said it is probably benign (I read this report personally along with her PET reports) The Onc had set her up to seek Radiation Treatments especially on the Rib that showed up and possible later the spine.  They also tried Zometa about 7 months ago which she could only do a half dose as it messed with her kidneys so no more Zometa was given.  Why then are they treating her for BC if she doesnt have it?  Why give a 76 year old who has severe CHF Chemo tx etc... for something she doesnt have?  Why is the Onc telling me personally one thing in front of my face, but when other family members call tell them on the phone something completely different?  Now again my grandpa thinks I was overexagerating her condition and is spreading it to the other members of the family.  Mind you II am the one taking her to all her appointments which is about 3 appointments a week.  If she is NED why are we going to the Onc 2 times a week?  I just dont understand any of this.  All I want is my grandma to have the correct care, the correct diagnosis. Please someone explain to me whats going on????? why is the definitions of Stage I to Stage IV different in my grandmas case?  Why are they treating her for something they are telling my aunt she doesnt have?

So we all have been coming to terms with this until this kidney Dr out of know where says lets prolong her suffering and try dialysis which is a 50-50 chance he said.  But, me not having any say so on her care has to sit by and watch her suffer in this pain even longer.

I am now living right behind maybe 100 ft from my grandparents.  had some bad news yesterday that my Aunts husband's mother passed away from her cancer 2 days ago. My mom was going to come in to visit me today, but my step-father (who has cancer) has taken a major change for the worst so they are rushing there. now, about my Grandma, I went over today, I am guilty because of moving I havent walked over there in a few days, and she looks awful.  Her face is swollen again, her eyes are so puffy.  She is very weak and tired.  She says she doesnt even have interest in watching her soaps anymore.  And, today she said she thinks her son (My Uncle who passed away 4 years ago) is coming to get her to be with him.  She did seem a little depressed, but I really think that hearing the bad news about my Aunts MIL, and my step-dads father both having cancer, is making her look at her cancer.  Then, my grandpa who is 82 is having major prostate problems and is in so much pain etc... he is finally going to the Dr next week. (He is very stubborn and thinks he is immortal God love him), so I am thinking this is all weighing heavy on her mind. She goes back to the Dr on Tuesday and Im going to go with her as I havent got to on the last few appointments.  I am thinking they need to update her scans.  Do they do them every 3 months or so?  She hasnt had any since she was diagnosed with the mets about 5 months ago I am thinking.  they still have her on 1500 mgs of Tykerb and 2 doses of Xeloda (1000 Mgs) one week on and one week off.
