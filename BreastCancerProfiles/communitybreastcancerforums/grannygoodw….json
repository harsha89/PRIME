It sounds crazy but it stopped the itching I think my skin got too dry, It stopped for 2 days and started back a few minutes ago and I realized today I was a bit depressed maybe that is causing my itchiness. ",

She is sending me to an internal medicine and respirologist Dr. to see why platelets low.  I am now thinking the itchiness might be brought on by stress. Hope this Dr. can find out what is wrong. what are some of the tests that show Diabetes.  ",
