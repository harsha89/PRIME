Port went in day before thanksgiving and was much more painful than I anticipated. That part passed quickly though. I tolerated the first treatment very well with day 4 being the worst - shoulder and neck pain plus mild flu like symptoms. Mild nausea on days 6-7. Hair started to come out on Christmas Eve (day 17) but isn't noticeable yet. I have my buzz cut and wig styling scheduled for Weds so hoping it hangs on till then. The hair loss is absolutely the hardest part for me to handle so far. The rational part of my brain knows that this is cosmetic and temporary but... I think the hardest part is the loss of privacy (looking like a cancer patient). I am working and have two teenagers so will try to wear the wig as much as possible. I'm also using the Bryan Joseph gel. I still have eyebrows and lashes. My MO told me my regimen doesn't usually cause eyebrow loss. We'll see. I'm still not exercising much because my incision opened a bit after surgery (7 weeks post) and I needed more stitches which are still in. I think they expanded me too much too early but who knows. I'm hoping for an uneventful second round this week. Kind of tired of well intentioned people telling me that I shouldn't expect to feel so good the second time around. Happy holidays!   ",

Jezikah - I'm on the same regimen as you and have not had any issues with rash or peeling. Three treatments down and my hair is still there and growing in spots too. Looks very strange.",

My hair is very thin but not noticeable to others yet. Scalp tingles on top and hurts. I put the shaving off as long as possible but the time has come. I hope the wig is reasonably comfortable! GI issues- we are all so different. I had constipation for a week followed by 2 days of loose stools. This time I am going to try more fiber plus prune juice and only take the Miralax if really needed. Is anyone else experiencing eye twitching? It's only in one eye.",

I'm near you - my treatments are in Warrenville. Surgery and reconstruction at NW downtown. I got the shave and wig today. Although the hair loss was not yet noticeable to others, my stylist said that I had lost quite a bit already. I had a small pity party on the way there. I have to say that I feel such a sense of relief that it is over with and I really do like my wig. Once my head was shaved, the tingling and pain stopped. Now I'm off to take the steroid and prep for tomorrow's treatment. My teenage daughter is coming with me and is a little frightened. She stayed with me during the surgery so I assured her that this was much more tolerable than that.",

I also get the print out. I assumed that was standard! My white blood cell numbers are slightly elevated from the Neulasta. They did not seem worried about that. Question - I had read that icing my hands and feet during the taxotere portion could help with neuropathy and nail damage so I did that both times. The first time, the nurse was sweet and said she had seen a few patients do this. Yesterday's nurse told me she had never seen that before and was questioning me about why I was doing it. Is anyone else trying this? I don't know if it works, and if it does not then I am very happy to give it up!",

Jezikah- I wear my wig every day I work in the office (which is most days) and occasionally on the weekends. The first week, I had to build up to it because it was a bit irritating but now I don't even think about it. My new favorite product is the baseball hat with the hair attached that I got from headcovers.com. That is my go to piece for errands and something to wear when the kids have their friends over. For me, this is about privacy more than looks. I am taking TCH and wondering if anyone else has this experience \u2013 I had my head buzzed one day before my second treatment when my hair begin seriously shedding. It was not noticeable yet to others. Since then, it may have shed a bit some more, but it never fell out and what's there is actually growing. I had my third treatment Thursday and I asked the oncologist about it. He said that it is a gradual loss and some will grow back. Is anyone else having this happen? Wishing I would have not shaved when I did but also not understanding why it is still hanging in there after three TCH treatments! ",
