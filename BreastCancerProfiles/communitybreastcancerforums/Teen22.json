If you're feeling weak again, ask to check for your HBG numbers again. You may need another transfusion. Also ask your MO the status of your bone marrow as it may be packed with cancer cells?

Anyways, I asked her the same question: Is Femara healing my bone lesions too and how so if I am hurting? She said \"absolutely\" it is healing my bones because these bone lesions have estrogen receptors similar to my tumor. The pain may be due to flares killing the buggers and of course there are still the mets. I can't help being a skeptic here because I know that mets are both blastic and lytic. How is the AI to know which bone to patch or file? I guess it's best to just take all the good for now. I start Zometa in a couple of weeks...hope it really strengthens these rickety bones.

Bisphosphonate drugs can effectively prevent loss of bone that occurs from metastatic lesions, reduce the risk of fractures, and decrease pain. Bisphosphonate drugs work by inhibiting bone resorption, or breakdown. Bone is constantly being \u201cremodeled\u201d by two types of cells: osteoclasts, which break down bone; and osteoblasts, which rebuild bone. Although the exact process by which bisphosphonates work is not completely understood, it is thought that bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclasts and induce apoptosis (cell death) in these cells, thereby reducing bone loss. There is also evidence that these drugs bind to bone, thereby blocking osteoclasts from breaking down bone. Cancer cells release various factors that stimulate osteoclastic activity, causing increased breakdown of bone. By inhibiting osteoclasts, bisphosphonate drugs effectively reduce the detrimental impact that cancer cells have on bone density. An analysis of the results from 30 clinical trials demonstrates that patients with bone metastases treated with a bisphosphonate had a delayed time to skeletal fractures, a reduced need for radiation therapy to treat bone metastasis, a reduction in hypercalcemia (high blood levels of calcium), and a reduction in the need for orthopedic surgery.3 Bisphosphonate drugs that are FDA-approved for the treatment of cancer-related skeletal complications include Zometa® (zoledronic acid) and Aredia® (pamidronate). Of these two drugs, Zometa® appears to demonstrate the strongest activity. An added benefit of Zometa® is that it is administered in a dose ten times lower than Aredia®, which considerably reduces the administration time from several hours to 15 minutes, resulting in a more convenient regimen for patients. Bisphosphonates have been shown to prevent or delay bone destruction and related pain in clinical trials involving patients with bone metastases related to:",

My platelets were only 13K (very low and hence the easy bruising), but my MO does not believe in platelet transfusion as it only lasts for 4-5 days. BTW, it may help if you post your profile.
