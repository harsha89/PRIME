Wishing you the best possible experience through all of this.  Feel free to PM me since you are having the exact same treatment as me and we are about the same age!",

Despite what is now mild neuropathy, I am still glad I had at least 3 of the Taxol treatments.  Even though my nodes were negative, my tumor was large and I was considered \"young\" at 43, which is why I think maximum chemo was recommended.  I do feel like any little cancer cells that had escaped and were floating around got well zapped.  Many people don't seem to get any neuropathy, and if you do start getting symptoms you can always stop the treatment. Best of luck with your decision - nothing is easy in this whole process, that's for sure!",

My node biopsy was uncomfortable, but not painful, and nowhere near as difficult as my original breast biopsy.  It was also negative for cancer, which did give me a little peace of mind. Even though I am highly ER+ and PR+, the AC-T chemo completely wiped out my 4cm tumor, allowing for a lumpectomy.  My left breast is now slightly smaller than the right, but other than that no-one could ever tell that I have had anything done at all.

To give you a sense of the timing, I had my last dose dense Taxol on April 26th and my last surgery was July 5th.  Rads didn't finish until about 3 weeks ago.  There is no way I could have started my fitness and diet program during that time.  Just like you, I was pretty depressed about my weight gain and couldn't see a light at the end of the tunnel, but I promise you it does come.  Please be kind to yourself and patient and remember that your most important job right now is to fight cancer.  My acupunturist told me that having a healthy appetite during treatment was a good sign, because it meant my body wanted nutrients to stay strong.  I also thought it was the steroids...but that excuse ran out during surgery and rads LOL!  So his explanation made me feel good, like my body was fighting and doing what it was supposed to do to rebuild after chemo. You are doing great, and this too shall pass once you are through treatments!",

I love seeing everyone's pictures also, and hope we will all keep posting. Getting a sense of the hair growth timeline and hearing from all the beautiful, brave women who were ahead of me on this journey was such an inspiration when I was bald and felt like crap.  We need to keep paying it forward!  In this spirit, I updated my timeline for Ann and others at the beginning of the hair regrowth adventure.  I have had three trims to clean up the back and around my ears, but the top has been growing the whole time.  I also use a non-ammonia color from Sally's to cover a few grays around my ears, but mostly this is my natural color.  Oh, and I have also lost 15 lbs since the end of treatment which is why my face looks thinner (yay!)!

He doesn't want me to have the surgery.  It's mostly annoying for getting a bra that fits properly because one side has a muffin top while the other side is barely filling the cup, but I have found some soft stretchy bra's that are supportive and minimize this issue (called Warner's Friday bra).  In terms of weight loss, I have both lost 10 lbs and and then gained them back again since rads and haven't noticed a big difference i.e. the size difference and perkiness difference stays about the same. Hopefully the shrinkage you are seeing will stay about where it is now.   And as to whether a new man will find you appealing with slightly lopsided breasts, my experience is that men don't always notice these things or care about them the same way we do.  They are just happy to have a real, warm, affectionate woman to be with!  Remember they are not perfect either...they may have receding hair or a little extra padding in the middle that they are self conscious about.  I try to focus on doing things that help me feel good about myself.  Your confidence and shining, positive personality are always what's most appealing!",

So now, 11 weeks out, I do still have some lingering neuropathy in my fingers and toes but it seems to be getting better all the time, and doesn't really limit me in any way.  My toes are much less noticable than my fingers because of the typing.  As I am typing this, I am favoring my right pointer finger because it's a little sore today and the nail has looked like it might start lifting.  After keeping my nails in good shape this whole time, I don't want to lose one now!  I have been getting acupuncture, and hope it's helping! I didn't experience any hair re-growth while on DD Taxol, and also lost 100% of my eyelashes and brows.  They both grew back very quickly about 6 weeks later.  My hair is now about and inch long and growing like crazy.  I go without a hat sometimes and it doesn't look very stylish, but I'm happy to have any hair!  Hope this helps.  I know many ladies don't get any neuropathy at all, and you might be one of them!  Main message is that even though I did get mild neuropathy, Taxol shrunk my tumor down to almost nothing so I am glad I had it.",

Hopefully someone else will weigh in on your specific diagnosis.  Hang in there - once you have some more information and plan it will get better.  You can do this!",
