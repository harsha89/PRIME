Also I started on arimitex a couple weeks ago-probably for the rest of my life. Initially doctors said no chemo for me and maybe radiation depending on which surgery I qualified for but because my tumor was > 7cm they have given me the full on treatment. I was in perfect health (hahaha) going into this so my physical side affects have been minimal. My biggest complaint has been the bad taste in my mouth through chemo. It's still slightly off. Oh and I have slight case of lymphedema so am wearing compression wrap daily. As for emotionally I have been in good spirits the whole way but occasionally I realize I am getting the full dose of treatment which is serious business and I wonder if the cancer will metastasize in the future? I don't dwell and the thought passes but I am not in denial either. I have several friends and acquaintanceswho are survivors or near the end or who have died. It's a crap shoot but I strongly believe a positive attitude helps me heal. I fight this all the while continuing to live my life as normal as is possible during this first year of treatment. I am amazed at the number of women who go through this--before I was \"one of them\" I didn't realize what a challenging journey this was. I have \"handled\" it well but that doesn't mean it's been easy. God bless to you all!",
