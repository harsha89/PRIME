Iam so frustrated i have been on so many drugÂ  coctails and nothing works. it started out like a small red bump here and there.the onc biopsied them and they were cancer consistant with breast primary. Navalbine knocked them out for a year but then stopped working. They have spread and gotten much worse! all over abdomen and breast reconstruction. Now starting on my shoulder. I have had radiation and hypothermia to no avail. just finished tykerb and herceptin but nothing now starting gemzar on tues. I have no other mets thank god but the skin is so out of control i feel it is just a matter of time scared silly! Good luck to all",

Organs and bones clean but lots of lymph node involvement and nasty frustrating skin mets. Been on every chemotherapy out there including hormone blockers xeloda tykerb faslodex you name it and I have been on it. Even have done drugs twice. In July I felt very scared skin mets out of control and running out of options. Searching clinical trials I did all the research on TDM1 and I felt this is the drug I need to be on. My onc did not agree and said I was not a candidate. I emailed all the sites with my story and sure enough got an appt. In Fairfax Va cancer center. I live in N.Y. But trial was not offered here. After a ton of tests and 3weeks of no treatment they let me in the trial. Not a blind study the expanded access trial. So I knew I was getting the real thing. I did six cycles in Va. After six cycles and a much improved pet and healing skin mets, they allowed me to transition to Sloan Kettering in N.Y. I just finished my 2nd cycle here at Sloan and another good scan. Skin mets not gone but under control. I have felt better in the last six months than I have in 6 years. I have not a side effect. nothing! My labs are all great and my energy level is like new. I feel so blessed to be on TDM1 and pray it works for a very long time! We really have to be our own advocates when it comes to this horrible disease. This drug needs to be approved! I started this trial in Aug and they closed it in sept. I just made it, but I definitely fought to get it! Peace to all!",

I had a local recurrance to skin only a few months after finishing treatment. Stinks right? any way it showed up in the skin of my reconstruction. It started out looking like a rash but got lumpy & bumpy.Also was clustered together not seperate like moms. Also not sores for me just lumpy. They did punch biopsies on them and were cancerous. Very hard to clear up skin mets and they all can be different but moms sound more like sores good luck ! sorry it took me so long to find your post Karen",

I just had a treatment yesterday at Sloan in New York where I live. I started getting the drug down in Va under the expanded access trial. After doing quite well on it after 6 infusions they let me get it here at Sloan thank God! Yesterday was cycle 11. I get scanned again on 4/12. My blood work and tumor markers are nml and I have never felt better on this drug. There are very few side affects but to be honest I don't have any! This drug needs to be on the market now! The nurse told me yesterday it actually has a name now but couldn't say it or spell it for that matter lol! Anyway thanks for all your posts and keeping us informed. I am more of a stalker than a poster, but I am so impressed by all the amazing people and info from this board. Fitz have you been on TDM and if so what was outcome and if not why? Thanks Karen!",
