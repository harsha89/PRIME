I've had an axillary ultrasound that showed enlarged but normal lymph nodes and I have an area of thickening that the doctor isn't concerned about and wants me back in 6 months to re-ultrasound to make sure there are no changes. I had come to terms with all this in the past few weeks and was actually starting to relax a bit, till today. The burning feeling I have been getting in my breast/armpit came back out of nowhere and also I was wearing a tank top without a bra and sitting on the couch with my arm slightly raised and I happened to catch a glimpse of my breast and it looked like it was dimpled. Thinking I might be seeing something I looked at both breasts and only saw it on the left. Which just so happens to be the side with all my issues. The thing is, I can only see the dimpling if my arm is slightly elevated to completely raised up. It looks like a crescent and it isn't overly pronounced, but enough that I can eyeball it in the mirror. It is below the area of thickening I have, which is why I am slightly concerned. My question is, since I have had all this testing done since end of March till the beginning of May, should I just ride it out till November for my 6 month follow up? I don't want to come off as a hypocondriach or anything but I also have started paying very close attention to my breasts since this whole stressful ride has started and I know for a fact that wasn't there before. Any input would be fabulous. Log in to post a reply",

It is a constant pain thats about 5/10 but at times it goes up to like a 9. It gets worse everyday. Is that normal? And is removal most likely going to be my only relief? Im uninsured so surgery is not at the top of my list of things I want to do. Log in to post a reply",
