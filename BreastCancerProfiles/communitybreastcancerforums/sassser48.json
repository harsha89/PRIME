I have thought about just getting it checked and not letting anyone know but I guess I just dont know if I'm ready to go through all this and if I find out anything can I enjoy our celebration knowing what is coming. Thanks again I guess I have more thinking to do. I just can't believe after getting through all the heartÂ  crap how can this now be happening. I cried and worried as did my family thinking I wans't going to make it through thesurgery and now do we have to go through this as well. I am sorry to rant I guess I just need somewhere to put my feelings. thank you ladies I know you have all been so brave and through this so I guess it is just buck up and go on right",

I found a lump about 3 weeks funny enough the night before having major surgery for heart and vascular. so I think how can this be can't I get through one thing at a time. Haven't I put my family through enough what do I do. Let it go and hope it goes away I have felt little lumps before but they have been cyst like boils that I have gotten rid of and went away.this lump is not a boil no redness no pain and its not going away. What do I do now. My daughter and I have a trip scheduled for the end of december celebrating the heart thing can I wait till I get back to get it checked. I am so scared and can't tell anyone friends or family can't put them through that. Please I need someone to talk to Log in to post a reply",
