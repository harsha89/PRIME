The idea of children having to endure these treatments is so heartbreaking. My boss's 7 year old daughter was diagnosed with leukemia about a year ago and has been undergoing treatments ever since. She's doing well, and her prognosis is quite good, but I know how grueling it has been for her now that I've experienced the chemo myself. This little girl is my inspiration. Her daddy told her about my diagnosis, as much as she could understand, and she sent me a handmade get well card, and he told me she always includes me when she does her prayers. Now I'm not a religious person, but that's humbling. The children shall lead.",

      "Content": "Mar 24, 2015 07:03PM - edited Mar 24, 2015 07:04PM by sybilskelton Y'all talking about the birthdate thing reminded me of someone I saw at chemo one week. An elderly lady who came in under her own power sat a couple of chairs down from me. Then the nurse brought over a bag of medicine and asked her birthdate, something you hear repeatedly in there so you barely listen. When this lady got to the year part I nearly fell out of my chair. She was born in 1919. Do that math. She's doing chemo so I guess she ain't planning on going anywhere any time soon. Good for her.",

I've done rads before for cervical cancer and that was a nightmare because it affects surrounding organs. (Think diarrhea from hell.) I made it through that without so much as a sunburn though. Strange. I'm concerned about the skin problems that nearly everyone seems to have and the whole bra issue. Your suggestions are invaluable. I too am one of those D cup folks, actually after the lumpectomy one D and one DD. I am also 62 years old, and after carrying those girls around for the last 50 years, gravity has taken its toll and going braless is simply not an option, especially since I'm still working full time. I've been wondering what I was going to do if my skin gets bad, and I've got some great ideas here. So thanks, ladies.",

I have decent coverage through my employer, not great but good enough. The numbers have been staggering and I can't imagine what one would do without coverage. That's not politics, it's criminal. During the enrollment period at work last fall when folks were whining about increasing premiums and deductibles (which were miniscule BTW) I just said I'd happily pay whatever it costs. I am so far ahead of the insurance company at this point they'll never recoup from me all they've paid out. Ha!",

Apart from the side effects like bone/joint pain, I'm quite torn about the potential for osteoporosis. I need to get the doctor to be more quantitative on just how much will this reduce the risk of more cancer and how much it increases my risk of not being able to walk across a room without breaking a bone. Numbers, I want numbers. I had the bone density test and it showed mild osteopenia, which is probably quite normal for my age. So it's a quandary.",
