So far, I'm getting pink and my chest muscles are getting tight. I'm almost halfway through the whole chest (no reconstruction yet) treatments. Regarding the bolus: my RO said that it was a skin-like substance to the machine. Passing through the extra layer gets the beam closer to the surface of the skin. I'm getting a total of 10 bolus treatments, every other day, and have had 6 so far. Regard lotions, etc.: my RO said that using them wasn't to \"save the skin\" (prevent damage) but to help us tolerate the damage. Which makes a kind of horrible sense. My RO also said (noticing a theme?) that if I wasn't a decent shade of pink that he would intensify treatment (yikes!). And that the effects of treatment, including skin damage and fatigue, would continue to grow for a week or two after treatment stops. Once the skin starts to heal, it will heal rapidly. Shopgal and Peabrain, my MO told me no diet restrictions during or after chemo, including sushi (which I had for lunch yesterday). Just to be careful and eat from places I trusted. There's so much variation in what they tell us! Neen56: boosts are radiation directly to the tumor bed and/or LX/MX scar, which are apparently common recurrence sites. Ask your RO why they think you do or do not need it. He/she is the one looking at your chart and assessing your recurrence risk.",

My foob stays put, but I doubt anyone would notice if it didn't because it's so small. My rads side definitely feels off. I'll bet it would feel worse except for the mastectomy numbness. My bone/joint pain and weakness magically lifted a few weeks after I finished Taxol, just before I started rads. While I'm not as strong and have less endurance than I did before, it seems normal considering I haven't done much since last July.",

Now that my skin is starting to look a bit irritated, they don't want to pull any stickers off for fear of damaging the skin. Once they're finished with them, I can let them fall off on their own.

Apparently, this is common. Who knew? My armpit will certainly enjoy the break: it is becoming increasingly unhappy. They did routine blood work on me before I started rads (and a pregnancy test), but nothing since. X-rays every week. JuniperCat: the shooting pains can last for years? Yikes! Peabrain: the fatigue is also plaguing me. Early morning and late afternoon are the worst. Exercise seems to help temporarily. There are times that I know if I sit down, it's over",
