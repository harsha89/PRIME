I did nothing but think about my cancer and death... and I felt like I cried every five minutes... the minute we scheduled the chemo, I really felt better, like I had some control... And then I order my wigs... I'm not going to lie, I'm still scared, but as soon as I got this process started, I felt better. I did my first treatment on December 6th. and my next treatment is December 27th. you can do this!!! It will be hard, but you can do it!!! And we are all here for you!!!! I don't cry as often any more, but hell yeah, I still cry... By the way, I took my blond wig, out for test run today, as my hair is starting to fall out when I comb it a little... it was a little weird, but it was okay... my husband said it is sexy... he is such a nerd... and I love him for that.....",

The chemo effecting my nerves in my face which will go away.... b. The same thing as the numbness thing with your fingers, I can't remember the name, because my nose and upper lip are also going numb, in which case they don't know if it will go away, or c.

I don't know if he was saying I am a baby or if he felt bad for me... he did say that it was my choice to have my last treatment or not... if I was older he would say to stop at this point, but because of my age he would continue, but it was my choice.. last week I would have said, NO, NO, AND HELL NO!!!!
