I wish you all the best. I seem to be at that needy stage right now. Seeking answers and comfort. It takes me back to when, as I mentioned, my daughter was diagnosed with epilepsy. Ironically, I remember some folks saying things like, at least it's not cancer. But it was my child and my worry. Anywho, I sought out every parent I could find to give me some guidance, some comfort, some information. It all worked out, and later down the road, I was the parent new moms called for comfort and info. Hopefully, one day that can happen again.",

I took the week off from work, but truth be told, I could have gone back sooner. And speaking of boobs, mine looks a bit deflated. I took the ace bandage and gauze off last Sunday and finally removed all of the steristips today. The incision from the lymph node test was much more tender and sore than the lumpectomy. My post-op appointment is 6/25. I have no results of lymph nodes or the oncotest yet. One thing I've learned so far, is patience is a virtue . Well it's off to my granddaughter's dance recital tonight. The fastest 4 hours a grand mom can sit through, but wouldn't trade one second of it.",

I had no pain when I first saw the surgeon, the medical oncologist, the radio-logical oncologist, but now I do. I'm waiting on my date for surgery. I guess I know my first step is to tell my doctors about this pain. Can breast cancer spread that quickly to the bones or am I going crazy.
