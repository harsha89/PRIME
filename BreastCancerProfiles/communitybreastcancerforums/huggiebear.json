Well, dr called and read the results and wanted me to see surgeon about a biopsy. they still don't know if it's a node or what and I also have a microcalcification by it and the calcified wall of a cyst in the same area. I just had a wedge biopsy done in June on the right breast and now this on the left. I told the dr I can't afford surgery right now, so he suggested motrin or aleve for 6 weeks than another ultrasound to see if it's smaller. I'm confused and wondering does motrin or aleve shrink the microcalcifications? I'm not sure what to do, whether to see another dr or what. Log in to post a reply",
