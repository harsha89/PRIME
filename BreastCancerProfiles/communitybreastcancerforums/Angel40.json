Obsiously it's a nice support group (National Fibromyalgia Association) but each person is different and react different with the medications. I ONLY stayed for a week with Cymbalta. My pain was gone but I cannot function at work. Headaches everyday, can't sleep at night and the loss of appetite. I stopped the cymbalta and taking (Ultram) tramadol at night. It just help me to function, but the pain is tolerable.  I had a bad day Monday and I called in sick, took percocet, slept the whole day and then I was good again. Today, I have moderate pain. I will start physical therapy for my legs this afternoon. Twice a week for 4 weeks. The good part of this therapy is land therapy(regular) and Water therapy(pool).  I really hope Rose that you could get the right medication/treatment for your pain. I know this tramadol is not the only medicine for my fibro so my next rheumatologist Appt. is on May 5. take care Edith",

I had bilateral mastectomy Oct-08 with recon. Dec. 08 I felt a terrible pain around my right shoulder. The pain progress to my neck and upper back. Last week of Dec.08 I went for 6 weeks radiation for right breast only. The  pain was worse around my neck, shoulder, back but on top of this is chronic fatigue. I'm so tired that I feel like my whole body ache, joints, muscle, thinking even my bones hurt because of too tired and just ALL aches. After radiation I have a bad burn right on my chest. I went from doctor to doctor to asked about the whole body ache. I went to rheumatologist last April-09 and all my blood work are normal excecpt  low on vit D. The doctor gave me prescription. Then went for physical therapy for 4 weeks then it did help for my neck, shoulder and arm. My exchange surgery for permanet implant was Nov.-09 then after 3 weeks had another surgery for right hematoma.  After a month I felt all the body aches again, now especially with my legs. I do not see any connection with legs and breast? So I have some good days and some bad days.  I'm not even sure what kind of doctor to go to anymore about these body pain.  My co worker said maybe I have another sickness like fibromyalgia.",

I will let you guys know the outcome of my rheumatologist appointment tomorrwo, Monday. I'm so anxious to see the doctor. I get so negative and paranoid to explain myself over and over again with the doctors with my pain but nobody could help me. my neck and arms right now are really bothering me. at the end of the day even my legs. My lymph node is negative and only in my right arm and only 1 node but both arms are painful. I'm tired of all these pain and I feel I'm now more of a mental case than a cancer patient. I really hope we get an answer. take care and prayers to all ! Happy mother's day to all the mother.",
