I've had a chance to think, to realize I have cancer, to realize this is my life, and I don't want to be doing it anymore. For me it's also this: radiation is completely ALONE. No one gets to stay in the room with me. I'm laid bare in an uncomfortable position, and then everyone leaves. I know it's for less than 10 minutes, but still. I get \"dumped\" on a daily basis. At least with chemo I got to talk to people while being posioned. Not that knowing this makes it any easier. I'm just using it as an excuse/reason why I've lost my ever loving mind.",

Keep plugging along, drink water like it's your second job, walk a lot, and find a physical therapist that can do lymphatic drainage massage (it will also help with cording that develops and comes out of nowhere 2 months out).",

After Hell on Wheels with the rads, ended up doing 16 with no boosts. They said it would cause \"constant and chronic pain\" if they did the boosts. As it was, after 6 weeks landed in the emergency room from absolute pain and Costochondritis and the inability to pull in a full breath. A month later the oncologist mentioned possible breast Lymphedema. This sent me to a specialist to do massage and, what a game changer. After dipping into surgery meds and contemplating a mastectomy because it hurt so badly, this was the answer to my prayers. Chemo was a walk in the park compared to rads, for me. In all of this, I have had Herceptin every three weeks. My last one is December 26th and the port is scheduled to come out December 27th! My daughter says my gift is to \"have the plug pulled\". Ummmm. I will not have my next mammogram until \"six months after radiation.\" This puts my first scan in February. This is good because my Porno Swollen Boob cannot take being mashed right now! I cold capped and kept most of my hair. It got thin and dry and I've had several haircuts since. It has grown in completely curly in the back and straight in the front. It is super thick! No regrets with cold-capping. No one knew I was undergoing chemo unless I told them. I never stopped teaching, but did take a week off after each chemo and a week after each surgery. I even taught summer school during radiation. What a difference a year makes! A year ago this month, I was going in for my first-ever mammogram.",

We noticed it on round three, stopped three and four, tried half dose round five and nothing round six. It doesn't hurt - just constant buzzing. Ear, nose throat doc said it's probably permanent along with the hearing loss.",

My first (ever) mammogram was November 28th 2017 when the lump was found. I only ask because my chemo ends in December and the port comes out the day after last chemo. I feel like I should have some sort of scan before it comes out? (Although, with the oncologists blessing, I'm the one wanting the port out.)",

The only side effect I have left (besides the ringing in the ear from the Carbo and some distance vision loss) is that my hips are incredibly painful. I'm working on getting that taken care of. Otherwise, just happy I don't have to be at the doctor's every week! I don't go back to the oncologist until September!!!!",
