    "Content": "Nov 9, 2007 07:42PM - edited Nov 9, 2007 07:42PM by afreshstart The boxes that the silicone forms come in are called \"cradles\".  They retain the shape of the form so that it doesn't split.  Most of the manufacturers cover the forms for a period of two years, but the warranties are voided if they are not stored properly. We have women bring in forms to our mastectomy shop from time to time with a split like this.  Most of the time it is a result of lying them flat for storage.  Always wash your form at night with a mild soap, just as you would a natural breast or other body part, then pat it dry and store it in the molded cradle box that came with it.   Hope that helps! - Leslie ",
