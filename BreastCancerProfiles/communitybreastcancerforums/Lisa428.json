Is everyone here on a 3-week schedule or is anyone on a weekly schedule like me? All going well (aside from all the usual side effects) - but I have a question about hair loss. It seems with weekly doses, the hair loss is delayed a bit. I get my 6th treatment today and it is just now starting to shed. Can anyone tell me what their experience is with this? How fast does it go from shedding to needing to shave and jump to the wig? I have a wig at the ready, but it would be helpful for some sense of when I might need to head to the hairdresser. For now my hair still looks normal. Thanks in advance - any info appreciated!",
