      "Content": "bondiblonde wrote: In 2005 I was diagnosed with IDC of 16mm, had a lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy followed by radiation, 18 months tamoxifen and 5 years of femara. I have lots of scar tissue on the lumpectomy site and so have had a further 2 surgical biopsies to rule out suspicious areas but were both benign. In the past month I now have stated to get pain, sometimes just a general ache but at other times a specific sore spot in that breast along with a dull ache in my arm and tingling through my elbow to my fingers. The sore spots are close to the lumpectomy scar. They are just tender areas and I cannot feel a specific lump. Could this be nerve pan after all these years? Has anyone else had this experience?

Think I am going nuts as I cant pinpoint where the pain is coming from. Sometimes the lumpectomy scar area but then at other times it is no where near that. Somedays I think I can feel a hardness but then an hour or so later even that has disappeared. I wake up during the night and my whole breast is sore but in the morning it's OK. Fingers crossed........",
