The waiting is torturous. It utterly is the worst thing about this process. Just because she had 5 biopsies, doesn't necessarily mean anything bad. The docs are just trying to be precautious. I had three biopsies done, and only one spot was abnormal. So again, try not to let it overwhelm you. Easier said than done, yes. Did they indicate when her biopsy results should be back? Will they call you or do you have to have an appointment? That's definitely something to find out. That way, you don't have to guess and if you need an appointment, you can get one hopefully asap. This is something that both of you will get through... its tough, yes. But one day it will all be a distant memory.  I wish all of you the best of luck.",

Nothing I can say or do will make this better for anyone at this moment. But, know that you have found the BEST site to obtain knowledge and insight. Once your biopsy results come in, whether positive or negative, a plan will be put into place. And once that treatment plan, If needed, is set in stone, you will feel much, much better.

It's s club no one wants to join, but you've definitely come to the right place. I, too, was dx with DCIS in March of this year. I decided on a bilateral mastectomy, (w/reconstruction) which I had approximately 2.5 weeks after diagnosis. I know many people on here that have had lumpectomies as their choice of treatment. My DCIS was a grade 3, so I personally wanted it out of me ASAP. Radiation is a must after a LX, but not after a BMX. (Per my understanding) May I ask why you don't want treatment right away?",

Will they call you, or will the doctor call you? Knowing these things helped the anxiety a bit for me. Hoping for B9 results. Please Let us know.",

The initial shock... wow... are there really any words? I, Like you, am a marathon runner, exercise loving fool. I was downright angry. How could my body do this to me? I treated it so well with exercise and organic foods/products. I'm a devout Catholic. BUT, none of us are invincible. So, once I finally \"accepted\" the diagnosis and had a plan in place, I hit the ground running (no pun intended😂!). My advice to you: do not search the internet. Listen to your doctors and the women and men on this forum. The internet is a very scary place, and it will bring you to dark places. You owe yourself the time to grieve, but know that you have many many people right behind you cheering you on. This is your body, you can do it!!!! ❤❤",
