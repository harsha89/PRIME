Do you still have a lot of pain? What is involved with your condition? Drewmon: I am happy that you made a decision I know how difficult it is. I think you are correct in waiting unless you find something negative in your next appointment. I run a daycare and find breastfed babies are so much healthier than formula fed babies. Please keep us informed and if you ever need more information please contact me I am very willing to share my experiences with anyone.",

I called the PS office and they haven't heard anything yet either. The Office Manager had a few choice words about dealing with the insurance company though.... I guess she felt I was someone she could vent to! I was happy to listen!  I'm not sure what type of implants I have now because it's been almost 20 years and all of her records were switched to digital and all hard copies were purged if they were older than 10 years. This is Standard in my state. I used to work in Radiology. I am amazed how easy yours were to remove and that you didn't have them removed in a hospital! Are you still happy with your decision not to replace them? I think I am going to replace, she told me they now have new implants that will not leak even if the shell is ruptured. I, until recently have never had a problem with my implants and I guess I am just used to the way they feel under the pectoral mussel. I was 37 when I had my bmx and after having all of the pain from fibrocystic lumps the tightness was way better than the pain. Anyway thanks again for your reply and I wish you an easy recovery and I hope all goes well for you. Kat",

To me they don't look as full as they use too and now they have a different funny shape. I have had mine for 20 years. I saw a PS two weeks ago and she suspects the same plus she says I have capsular contracture . I am waiting for my insurance to see if it is covered which is another question I have if anyone knows the answer to it. Is the surgery to remove and replace with new ones covered? I had my mx because of fibrocystic disease and not cancer. Do you have any answers? Kat",

I will pray that you find the answer and the swelling goes down. My prayers are going to everyone who is struggling and thank god to everyone who is getting good results. I do have one question, a couple of ladies questioned me on how I was able to keep my old implants.....the Dr. just asked me if I wanted them. Has anyone else got to keep theirs after the surgery. Recap.....mine were 19 years old and I had CC and even though I would have bet that they were leaking they were still in perfect shape so after the surgery she came to make sure I was ok and then just asked me if I wanted them.

Mamasixtaz you have such kind words always, you are a blessing, your day is almost here may your wait be a peaceful one. Hobbesla4 good luck on the MRI...I had two, you can always ask your dr. for meds to help relax you before the MRI, during ask for music, and the contrast is not bad, if you are ok with an IV you will do fine.  There is a lot of banging and it is loud and you do have to stay still or the text will take longer. Just try to relax! I will be thinking about you!",
