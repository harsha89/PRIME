The new onc did the blood work throu quest diagnostic center on may31 and he got the results of 188 which I thought was great my tumors are shrinking. Than I go see my org onc and it turns out his nurse did tumar marking on June 08th and it was 338. My original onc said 338 does not count because you have to wait a while for the Meds to kick in but keep in mind My original onc. Does not know I am switching yet so he does not know about my results with new onc. What do I do?????",

But at night nothing works I can't sleep I can't sit I basically can't do anything because of the pain and the pain is not in one area I have musle pain all over the body. I can't even move my neck and it all hurts like hell I eventually fall asleep around 4:30am but I don't think that is normal. It's kinda hard to fell asleep so late than get up for work at 7am. My body is so tired and the funny part I was just on a 2 week leave just to rest it helped a lot but I feel like I will need another one. This sucks because my job is important I bring the most money home and I cover most of the bills. My husband works but does not do as well as me.. I am scared how he will be able to support us after I can't do it anymore and it looks like I am approaching that stage I pray I am wrong so much... I am 43 years old I did not plain to retire so young so I did not make great choices as far as saving. Know I save every penny but it's not enough. So all us women, moms, wife, daughters and sister it's not easy because I don't only worry about dying I worry about leaving them broke too. It's just not fare when I go to the park or my sons school and I see the mothers out there decked out looking so happy and healthy and then u see me who is thin as a rail, no color to skin due to anemia and frail and depressed looking it really SUCKS. I try not to go much to sons school because I don't want a pitty party there for him or myself. Something very and interesting happened last night. By the way we had a great day with lots of walking which I did it when we came home I was so beat I laid in the couch and everything started hurt I guess to much time on my hands.. So played a little joke on my boy like omg my legs hurt he ran to me and kept saying what can I do. I said u ate my leg where is it don't u see it he looked at me like I was a nut job. I kept repeating myself and saying where is my leg. All of sudden he broke out crying it took me twenty min to calm him down. I guess I know this kid keeps everything in. I might have to take him to see someone. I don't want him to stressed out like this I want him as normal as possible... He must ask me in a daily basis if I am ok 5-6 times. He is nine he should have other things on his mind",

I really don't want to die I have to much to live for but all the pain just turns you into a different person. I cry myself to sleep most nights. I don't remember last time I smiled or did something for myself. It's like nothing matters anymore. Sometimes I wonder if they should just out me in hospice and go on with there life's. But I know it's not practical I am not near hospice level I am just so tired of making everyone around me very unhappy. They don't say it but I see it in there eyes.

I have to say I am always lurking posting here because women on this site really do understand and have so much knowledge. When I first was diagnosed I almost jump out the window. I don't even remember half of it but with time and learning more about our diseases you sort of learn to live with it. Will it always be jolly absolutely not but in today's time there are so many options for us and new treatment are still coming. Just remember this is not curable but it is TREATABLE and you could live long time with it. None of us have experations dates on us and no person is same. Everybody reacts different to every treatment. sometimes you may go through alot of different treatments before the right one fits you. Stay strong.",
