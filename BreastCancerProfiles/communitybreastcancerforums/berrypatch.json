I am so anxious to have my hair back that I dreamt last night that I was shampooing my hair and conditioning it.  Weird part was that I could not get the cap back on the shampoo and conditioner bottles and the stuff was running down the drain, I was trying to stop it...Then I woke up... Mombos, it feels like FOREVER that I have been dealing with this *%#*&!@ disease too!  I'm just coming up on 6 mos.  DH goes on ahead and does things by himself now, because I usually feel like CRAP!  How carefree life was 6 months ago compared to now!  Those things that i thought were \"problems\" are nothing compared to this.  Will that ever be again? I have always heard people say, \"If you have your health, you have everything.\"  How true that is!  I will never again take good health for granted!  All I know is that I just must get through the next 2 chemo tx's so I can start the rads.  I do have an appt with the rad Dr. on 3/11 so it does feel like I am moving forward.  Spring needs to get here soon! I just want my life back!!!!!!! Carol  berrypatch",

I have been having hot flashes for 5 years now.  I also had a hysterectomy because of fibroids in 2000.  I wish that I had gotten those ovaries removed too.  Maybe I wouldn't be where I am now.......oh well...hindsight is 20/20!   Anyway, I really don't know where I am in the cycle of menopause.  I will have to ask my onc if there is a blood test for determining that.  So I am kind of assuming that I'll not be taking Tamoxifen, but an AI instead.  I've been reading about the se's for these meds.  Lots of talk about osteoporosis, anad other bits of unpleasantness.  All of this is so confusing! But chemo is almost over, and that is/was REAL UNPLEASANT, and that's putting it mildly!  I have had just about every SE that you ladies post here except for the finger nails lifting and the neuropathy.  Believe or not, my nails have remained normal, I just had to clip them because they got too long.  Right now the SE bothering me the most is the constant eye watering.  I'm going to ask my onc to send me to an opthamologist, because my eyesight has been screwy too. Knowing that all of you have been out there, somewhere, being bald, being sick, and making this journey with me virtually has made it ever so much easier.  I don't feel all alone.  I can't imagine doing this without you ladies.  What did we do before the internet?! Sure am looking forward to getting through this next week and then it's over!  Remember, \"that what doesn't kill us, makes us stronger\". Have a good evening!         Carol",

Don't think that this is weird, but I am so glad to read that others are bald, gaining weight, blurry vision, chemo brain, hand and foot syndrome, weird smells...etc...because I don't feel so alone. I have had every one of those SE's and more.  Right now I am dealing with pneumonia.  Even though you ladies are \"right here beside me\", I can't see you, but it is truly comforting to know that you are out there somewhere!  Somethimes I read something about what emotions someone is feeling or an SE, and I thank God for this thread!  I truly do not remember what it feels like to feel GOOD! I will be going back to work on 4/13.  My last TX is 3/24.  I'm probably cutting it pretty close, but I have to go back.  The chemo brain is truly worrying me, besides the fact that I will have not been at work for 7 months by then.  I don't think that I can remember how to sign on to my computer or the other numerous passwords that I have to use.  I hope that they cut me a little slack for a few weeks.  Winter has been hard.  But I know that spring holds the promise of chemo being done, working again, maybe some hair, and getting back to a \"normal\" life.  We will all get there, and it will be SWEET! We can do this!!!!! Hugs to all of you!       Carol   (berrypatch)",

Do this! Do that!  I felt very well cared for.  As soon as they turned off the Taxotere, I felt better.
