Pathology is back and good, and my drain was removed last wed at 8 days post surgery. I now seem to have more swelling in my underarm, well the area about 1/4 inch out of my underarm and my mobility in that arm is lessening. I can't put my arm to my side and now I can't reach as high up as I could last week. I swear my it feels like I'm toting a porcupine covered pork chop around. No fever, redness or finger tingling so I don't think it is lymphedema. Does anyone know if this is normal. The pain isn't too bad i take maybe 2 doses of ibuprofen per day but I'm aware of any stretching. Thanks",
