My mamo was negative, but my doctor wants more tests and has forwarded me. Not sure what test (s) they will perform. Hoping to have more concrete information but I have learned from the forum it is never fast coming. Again, congrats Bendi on such good news.",

      "Content": "Apr 16, 2015 11:03PM - edited Apr 16, 2015 11:05PM by Sunbeams I am also a case where I don't know why my issue.  In hopes I can help anyone similar to my case, I will tell you my final steps. For approx. 6 weeks I have 1/3 of my breast showing a pink color across the underside of the breast. I have no other symptoms but it continues to remain the same. I was sent for a mamo which came back negative. I was given ten days of an antibiotic called Cefadroxil. I had no change or a very slight paler coloring.  It was decided last week to do an ultrasound. Results came back also clear, thank goodness. Finally today, I had a skin biopsy. Wasn't so bad. They froze the breast with a needle, felt like 3 bee stings and it took one minute to take the piece of skin. I'm taped up and the stitches are the dissolving kind. I'm told it could take a couple of weeks for the results. Both my doctor and the surgeon feel it is more some kind of a skin infection/irritation since it has not rapidly progressed with any other symptoms typical of IBC. Nonetheless I do have one of the hallmark symptoms of IBC. I was told by the surgeon that the pink color could stay for months and months if not as long as a year. If the biopsy also comes back fine (I'm expecting this to be the case) then at last I am relieved to no longer be concerned about cancer.  It will remain a mystery as to why, but I just may be one of the examples with an IBC symptom but not have it. I hope this story helps another with concerns.  I applaud this very needed site with incredible people.",
