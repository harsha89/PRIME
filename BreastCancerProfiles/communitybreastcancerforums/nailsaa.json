So it all started about 6 or 7 weeks ago. Her leg was hurting and she assumed it was her sciatica. She went to her medical doctor who basically just told her she was fine, she had arthritis and basically did nothing for her. We have since found her a new doctor. He drew blood and found her platelets to be very high. He referred her to a blood doctor (hemotologist). During her exam with the blood doctor, we found out she is very anemic and we also found out that she had fallen and not said anything to anyone. She had no choice but to say she fell because she had a large bruise on her breast. When the dr. checked her breast, he felt a mass so of course, she had to go for a mammogram. So we made the appointment and had the mammogram done. While waiting for the nurse to tell us we can leave, we find out they wanted to do an ultrasound. After the ultrasound was over, he came and told us she needed to follow-up with her primary doctor and will need to have a biopsy. We asked the radiologist if the mass they found could have anything to do with the fall she had that caused bruising on her breast. He said no, one thing had nothing to do with the other and that the report would be sent to the dr. in a couple of days. So, here is where my nerves become shot. When we called her primary dr. for her results, he told us she was given a birad score of 5 and that if they were to look at 10 patients with the results like my moms, majority of them would be malignant. We asked him if he thought her fall could have anything to do with her fall and he asked us when did she fall. (clearly, no one is paying attention to the fact that she fell and bruised her breast-the only dr. that new was the hemotologist and he never communicated that to the primary doctor or made note of it on her script for the mammo. My heart dropped and I became sick to my stomach. She now has an appointment with a breast surgeon on Monday. There is no history of breast or any other cancer in the family. As a matter of fact, my grandmother, grandfather, and a couple aunts have lived till they were 95. I know that really doesn't matter but I'm just trying to help myself get through this. As I began researching the internet I found information about hematomas and fat necrosis. I am really hoping that she has one of those which to me makes sense since she had such a bad bruise. the fact that her platelets were high, she is anemic just makes more since that she may have a large blood clot/mass. I read that hematomas take a while to go away even though the bruising color goes away and that if a hematoma is to large it has to be cut out. Again, I dont know if I'm just trying to convince myself that its not cancer but the radiologist and her primary dr. basically has lead me to believe she has C. I am so scared and nervous and I know my mom is too. This has been an extremely long week and I'm sure next week is going to feel just as long. Is my thinking making since or do you think its more than likely going to be C. Please, please please if there is anyone that can help calm my nerves I would appreciate it. I cant help to think about it every minute, every second. Thanks so much for any and all support.",
