I underwent a right mastectomy due to the size of area and size of breast. Most women have success with lumpectomy and rads. I come from a family of 5 girls and mom none of which had BC so I am the first that I know of although one of dad's sister's died from BC. I guess you were up against some pretty big odds! Have you done the gene testing for BC? I can sympathize with you about your worry for your daughters as I have a 22 year old daughter as well and hope they never have to go through this stuff! All I can say is HANG TOUGH for now till you get through the lumpectomy and be assured that your odds are great........thankgoodness they got it early. Stick around and you'll meet some great ladies, this is the place to chat or vent or ask whatever you want. Take Care.......((((HUGS)))) and Hang in There! Viv",

DCIS comedo form, comedo necrosis, nuclear grade 2, margins involved, size 4cm. At first my surgeon implied mastectomy. I went back 2wks later and he said we could try a re-excision with follow up rads 4-6wks if he gets it all. My problem is wondering what kind of outcome this would be as I am small breasted and he said he would have to take out a golf ball size area this time! That's like taking a golf ball out of a tennis ball or less! The size taken out during biopsy was 4cmx3cmx2cm already, isn't that kind of large???? Would mastectomy be better in this case?? From all the literature I've read that's what it looks like the recommended approach to my situation. Scared and freaked out now! Want to do the right thing tho!

The surgeon did a very neat job and it looks like it will leave minimal scarring down the road. It has already healed amazingly well, just feels tight. Try to deal with one thing at a time if you can....learn about it then move to the next. It won't be as overwhelming then. Keep in touch and keep putting one foot in front of the other.

Don't let those side effects keep you down girl, you'll get through it Where do you go for treatments?? Hope they are good to you there or I'll have to have a talk with them. Things are going good with me, healed up well after the mast but still kinda puffy under the arm and above and below scar. Small sernoma says the doc and I don't take it too easy either. I fell this summer at the cottage and really wrecked myself, thought I broke my ankle but turned out I had a deep hole (open wound) that is taking forever to heal. Got infected so took antibiotics and it is still healing! This happened 2nd week of July! AGH! I still get fatigued easier if I do to much or if I stay up to late like now....lol! I'm also trying hard to convince my daughter IT IS TIME TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL!!! Nothing like rushing her out huh?? But, I sure do look forward to having the house back to myself and DH for a while, I just want the space and quiet to chill out and do my own thing for a while. How about you??

      "Content": "Apr 10, 2008 09:55AM crazydaisy wrote: Okay Honey......here goes, I'll try to remember all. Scared as he%# the night before and didn't sleep much....feeling like an actor in an awful movie. Arrived at hospital at 8:30 am and was taken in to be prepped with the IV and gowns. The nurse was really sweet and kept me talking. The surgeon came out to have a few words also, then shortly after I was walked down to the OR by the nurse who got me ready in there making sure I was comfortable and as okay as can be.....she put some music on in there too. When the surgeon and others arrived they also said their hellos and explained how I would go to sleep.....in a few minutes I was out. I have no recollection of the recovery room time but remember hearing them say my family was waiting to see me so when I was awake enough they wheeled me into an area where my family could join me. The amazing thing for me was that this time I woke up and felt no pain......must have been pain meds in the IV. Back when I had the lumpectomy I remember waking to sharp pain.....first words then were....it hurts..........not this time though. That was one of my biggest fears but it did not happen. I was released a couple hours later per my request and everything was arranged for a homecare nurse to come at that time. The nursing company called the house shortly after my arrival home to set up a schedule.  I went home with a thick pad across my right chest and one drain. Underneath that was a steri strip across the incision. This all stayed on till day the 3rd day when the nurse replaced the dressing and said what a great job the surgeon had done.....I still had not looked, only had small glimpses from under the padding........the padding was comforting to me and gave me a bit of protection. I continued to take my prescription of pain medication so I felt nothing other than tightness across the chest and underarm.....like someone took a bottle of crazy glue to it. After day 3 or 4 I cut the meds in half to see how I really felt and found that I was okay and could use regular Advil or Tylenol for any discomfort. I slept in a lazyboy or on the couch as lying flat was uncomfortable. When I really finally got the guts to look fully in the mirror I was not totally shocked, just picture a little boys chest. It was neat and flat with only a small pucker at the very end under my arm area. I was rather taken aback at the length....from the center of my chest to my armpit, for some stupid reason I thought because my breast was small I would not have such a large incision.....DUH! I did not have skin sparing or anything sparing because I could not bring myself to the point of considering reconstruction at this time. I just wanted to be done.....fast...and get past the cancer part first.But thats me.....kinda like wanting to run away from it all and not having to go there again ever......I am a slow digester and can only do one step at a time for now. The drain was not half as horrible as I thought either. It was a little irritating where it entered the mast site. The nurse showed me how to manage it. My\"vacuum was not on when they sent me home\". She explained that after you record the measurement and empty it, you need to squeeze all the air out of the bulb before putting the plug back in.....this helps draw things down out of the wound. The little drain tube which is about the size around of a small straw is what you need to \"milk\". This is done by holding it firmly \"so you don't pull it out\" and giving it a few really good stretches, which you do a few times a day and whenever you empty the bulb. The more frequent you empty the bulb, the better the suction from it works. If clot appear, don't freak, it's normal for there to be bits of tissue. If you feel they are plugging the drain, work them down the tube gently by squeezing the tubing and sliding it along or rolling it to break it up, as long as fluid continues to flow you are okay. My output was low....75cc.....down to 50cc then by days 6 7 days below 25cc. The part of it inside your chest can be annoying as you can begin to feel it when your tissues start to go down and are trying to adhere back to your chest. I was freaked about removing the drain and took a couple T1's before the nurse removed it, but it was all for nothing because I never felt it come out......removing the stitch which held it in place was the only OWW because she did not have the proper tool to cut through it. Man....you almost feel like a new woman when those are gone!!! By one week out I could get in my car and drive short distance. The incision was looking great, just a little scabbing here and there. It amazes me how well these guys can sew! With mine there was no visible stitches at all and it was as if all of it was done from inside , like a seam on your clothes....all of which is self dissolving which is great! It is now just a thin red line. By the third week things a much better and that tightness is letting up, it still pulls a little but my ROM is pretty well back to normal. Yours may take a while longer if you have ALND, so make sure you do your exercises. All in all it has been a relative uneventful fairly easy recovery physically. I hope this helps. (((HUGS)))) Viv",

It may have come back if some was missed even tho you had rads which they say will take care of any stray cells. DCIS is also known to \"skip\" in the ducts, so even tho it looks like they had it all, it can continue on a little further on in the ducts. One thing I have also learned is that the margins of lumpectomy should be good and wide as well to give you better chance that it won't come back along with rads. Dirty margins or ones that are too close are not good even with rads. Sorry you had to go thru all of this. You've had a rough go of it and I hope you will feel much better soon! Have you had genetic testing done? It may be something you want to look into seeing that your sisters also had ovarian cancer. Hotflashes.....ugh, mine were so bad I was not getting any sleep! I had just started an estrogen replacement about one month prior to my diagnosis. It worked like a charm.....relief..ahhh. After my DX the doc wanted me to stop it but I asked for a reprieve on that since it had nothing to do with causing my cancer in the first place. He agreed to let me continue on a low dose for a while. I am happy for you that your family is so supportive, sounds like you have a fine man too! That makes a world of difference!

After much agonizing over this and reading/research I have come to the conclusion (by putting emotion aside and taking into account all the facts pertaining to my situation) ......that a mastectomy is in my best interest. I am currently still waiting and will have surgery march 18th. Sucks Huge but that's what I have to do. Has your doctor talked to you yet about your treatment options?? Please inform yourself so you can make the best decisions for your case......try to not let emotion rule the decisions you make .....I know that's hard........but take factual and best practices into account for your decisions as well. The threads are tricky to follow....you'll get the hang of it........put a little check mark in the boxes of the ones you want to keep track of, you can also click on ppl's names and add them as a favourite if you want to keep in touch. Also, if you go back to the main page at the top click on home then scroll down to the topic headings....all in sections or you can use the search box as well.

They compress your breast same as a mammo and then take pictures and compare them to your other pictures, when they are sure everything is in the correct position and after numbing the area a hollow core needle is inserted, they watch this carefully as well for positioning, the wire is inserted through the needle into the area of concern so the surgeon can find it. Then off to surgery to remove the affected area. My size tissue they removed was 4cmx3cmx2cm. I had a couple days off but I was fine.",

March was a month full of surgeries here.....you can read through them. I was just as scared but once it was over and I went home, it was a huge relief to be past it and it really wasn't nearly as bad as I had envisioned. I went home the same day. I had a right breast mastectomy for DCIS. I am now 12 days past the surgery and feel really well, just a little tenderness and discomfort at times due to everything healing. I was so surprised to wake up from it and have really no pain, they do give you good medication for that too.

I am a good old canuck too and wouldn't have it any other way. Middle class I guess you could say and am dam lucky we have universal health care!! I could not fathom having to pay for medical care and treatments, we\"d be in the poor house for sure!! Sure, having to wait for some things at times may be frustrating but that's when some canucks go south of the boarder to get immediate treatment if they can afford it. Many do so and all the power to them. In Canada usually the sickest get priority and that's how it should be. The way our health care gets paid for is through mandatory employer and employee contibutions every pay period. Sort of the same way everyone pays into employment insurance as well. Everyone weather rich or poor has the same priviledge (altho there are some who opt to go elsewhere and pay for quicker treatment). Access to health care is a basic human right and should not depend on the ability to pay!! You gotta love it......I hope it stays!! Just looked at my pay stub and my health care contribution was $11.56 for this past 2 week pay period. Although this covers any medical visits or hospitalizations it does not cover prescriptions. Any medication etc you recieve in hospital are all covered.",

I must say a 5 minute post op visit with your surgeon was not enough. She obviously has not made anything clear to you at all. Sometimes women do not want to know anything else because of fear or whatever. I think what everyone is trying to say is that at the very least there are some important factors your doctor did not go over with you that you should know so that you can make more informed decisions. The last thing you would want to happen is a recurrence of this happening because of not knowing the specifics of your pathology. I find your surgeons way of handling this far to lax in this regard. It may be that everything is fine but there are a few things that are important for you for the future if you want it to stay that way. Here are some things you need to ask about that pathology report and the surgery.  1 How large was the affected area 2 What was the grade of the DCIS 3 How large of a clear margin did they get 4 What was the hormone status of the tumor 5 Why was radiation not recommended 6 Why was hormone therapy not discussed for further protection to prevent recurrence These are some very important things you need to know for your future health and wellbeing. Once you have these questions answered then you can decide that if what they've done is adequate for your protection. Get those answers hun.",

You will get stronger as you move along your path but we also need to allow for all the emotional upheaval. It's better to get that out and then get on with our day or week.

Unfortunately it's not always that way. If the tumor is large or in more than one quadrant of the breast, mastectomy is usually the recommendation. BLAH! Well that was my shock too. Also if your breast size is small in relation to the involved area...again mastectomy is usually recommended. Often times a first lumpectomy leads to a second rexcision to get clear margins....that may happen more than once.....after a couple tries at rexcisions again a mastectomy may be required. Sorry hun. It's a shocker but this is the stuff we learn about fast once it's thrown in our laps. Take care.....TTYL",

They will be able to do a total assessment of your home, your physical abilities and needs and how you can modify things to make it easier to live in your home. I work with people in wheelchairs every single day. I also have a girlfriend who is paraplegic and does almost everything independently, her house had to be totally modified in order for her to be able to be self sufficient. If possible, it is important to have physical therapy as well so your muscles don't atrophy. Upper body strength is really important if your legs are weak.......you can learn to use a transfer board to transfer yourself while sitting, from WC to chair or to commode or bed. Grab bars in the bathroom on both sides of toilet and on the walls as well and a raised seat. There are many styles of bath chairs and benches as well that will make transferring easier. We also use ceiling lifts for those who can not weight bear or are no longer safe to pivot transfer. These are easily installed where needed and where space allows. Keep the faith, there are lots of helpful options to help make it easier.",

I had a right breast mastectomy for DCIS in March(18) 2008. After getting over the surgery I was due for a mammo on remaining breast, which I dragged my feet on big time but went in the 2nd half of June, approx. 3 months after my MX. A few days later I got a recall, I thought I'd be sick! So back I went for more views and an US which seemed to take forever, going over and over one area. Then I had to wait a week for results all the while freaking out that now I had something in remaining breast. Finally I got the call that all was okay........sheeesh! I think I felt worse that time knowing what I had just gone through. Hoping for the best for you Krissy..........like SoCal says.....one step at a time ((((HUGS)))) Viv",

Another thing is that it does not all always show up during diagnostic tests so often margins after surgery come back \"dirty\" requiring further surgery to remove it all. For me it was right breast mastectomy.....definitely a hard pill to swallow when we initially think a lumpectomy will get it all and we'll be done. It's a fast learning curve to those of us who are new to all of this. I am almost 4 weeks out now and have returned to work and am feeling just fine. Just kinda lopsided for now which I am working on! I am not doing recon at this point.....maybe later. I am an \"A\" so for now some inserts work easy. Good luck with your decisions!",

      "Content": "Apr 19, 2008 01:22AM crazydaisy wrote: kaye First let me say.....cancer sucks, ya. It's definitely lousy that you have to do this and believe me....I know where your coming from. I'm sorry you have to as well. I am 4.5 weeks out from having had a unilateral mastectomy. I'm 49. And I have had no reconstruction. Being scared is being human and real. If your anxiety is extreme, ask your doctor for something to help you sleep or calm you down. Some cope better than others so don't feel like you have to go it alone if your really stressed out. For weeks I tried to visualize having only one breast. I would stand in front of the bathroom mirror covering and flattening my bad boob. I also followed all the surgery threads and talked to others who went before me. I gained strength and some feeling of control talking to them and gaining an insight as to how the mastectomy procedure went and how everyone felt after wards. They helped me get through it. It all seemed so surreal, the closer the time got, the more it hit home that my turn was next and I felt like a two bit actor in a bad play......was this really happening??? To me??? I hung on to my \"buddies\" here and gained the courage from all of them while we in turn encouraged each other. When my turn came, I was up most the night......talking here and waiting for fatigue to set in. In the morning I was anxious to just get in there and be put out...fast and hoped for a nice long sleep. After surgery and waking up, I did not feel much....no pain and had a nice big soft bandage across my chest. That stayed there and right then I did not want to look anyway, I just wanted out and to go home. They let me go a few hours later because I lived close by and also was able to have a nurse come to my home until the drain came out. Not being a brave one and not wanting to see....I left well enough alone till my first visit from the nurse the next day who checked the dressing and site and also the drain. On her next visit she did a dressing change.....I looked down briefly.....then just looked up the rest of the time. That was 3 days post op. After that I started looking down under the padded dressing......the incision didn't look to bad and I was surprised to not see a big ugly railroad track, it was just a fine line which was healing....dark because of scabbing a little. Each day I gained more courage to look a little more for periodic glimpses, looking down, not in mirror....it doesn't look as scary that way. I continued to keep my padding for comfort and would wash around the area....just a psychological work up for me. By day 5 or so I was more ready to see it all at once and look in the mirror full frontal. I was not shocked but the image looking back sure looked strange.....it still does but now it isn't as weird....it's different. The scar has healed dramatically already and is a very fine pink line now, very neat and flat except for a small \"bubble\" under my arm that has a tiny bit of fluid buildup. I just say....envision a little boys chest on that side......smooth and flat.....not ugly once it heals. I am also only an \"A\" cup so the lopsided effect isn't to pronounced and is easy to fill on the missing side. For now I am okay with it and have found easy ways to balance out. I have just made an appointment to go for a prosthetic fitting next week. My co-workers are great and I can joke about my \"foob\" with them being all women anyway. My DH is okay with it too, his main concern was just getting through this and to know I was alright. I hope this helps a little, it does take some \"getting ready\" psychologically.",

      "Content": "Apr 7, 2008 09:53AM - edited Apr 7, 2008 09:55AM by crazydaisy Good morning Ladies......well it's first day back to work today! I can finally look in the mirror without getting all worked up. I still am uncomfortable about anyone seeing me in the buff though, probably always will be but was never much of a streaker to begin with. For the past 3 weeks I have just been going lopsided because of the sensitivity and redesigned underarm. This has been okay for at home or for short trips out as most of my clothing camoflaged things well and I was quite flat to begin with. This weekend the challenge set in to look balanced! AHHHH! I recieved zip....zero from the hospital or anywhere else except for suggestions from here and have not been fitted for anything yet. SO, to solve my problem for now, out the door I went to bra shop. My biggest problem was my size....36A.....very hard to find, also hard to find anything with no underwire. Most of the cute and fancy ones have wires. What I ended up with were some soft bras from La Vie En Rose that had a double lining inside. I found some silicone inserts at walmart that are meant to enhance boobs but turned out to be just the right size to fill an A cup. Taking these home I then slit the inside lining of the new bras and popped the silicone inserts inside(2 pieces stacked) which filled the cup perfectly. Once I had assembled my new homemade foob I paraded around and got DH and DD opinions. They both gave it the thumbs up and I must admit it looks pretty good! All in all the cost was cheap.......20.00 for the bra and 15.00 for a pair of silicone inserts! I think I'll make a few more and just sew them in permanently since the silicone can be used in water(swimming) as well and just hang to dry, that way they are ready to go. Well......lets hope everything stays put until something better comes along. Next step......getting fitted properly, until then ya gotta be creative!",

If they suspect anything else, they may want to do a Sentinal lymph node biopsy, you can also ask about having that done as some women have had it done. It is just not the standard yet everywhere. The SNB consists of a tracer dye injection into your breast and the dye goes to the first nodes where the Sentinal Node is identified and removed to check for any sign of invasive CA. Also with a mastectomy....radiation afterwards normally is not required.......hormone therapy may be offered to you for further protection. Like Otter says.....a mastectomy is emotional but the surgery isn't as difficult as we imagine. I am just 4 weeks past mine and back to work now.",

I am 3 weeks past mastectomy and have just gone back to work this week. The surgery went better than I ever anticipated and I experienced very little pain, mostly discomfort and tightness, pulling across the incision. I did take medication the first week because I wanted to be more comfortable especially for sleeping.......which alternated between a recliner and the couch, till the drain was out. Truthfully I think I was just as afraid of pain as of the surgery(I am a Wuss) I went home the same day and was relieved to be able to do that but had a home care nurse till the drain came out. The hardest part in all of this is the beforehand and the not knowing. I am healing well and the scarring will be minimal, not doing recon now. Hope you visit the surgery threads as well as the treatment threads to connect and read how others have done....you'll see most have done extremely well. Best wishes and Hugs. You'll get through.",

Like many others here I could not fathom undergoing more surgery immediatly, especially one that I knew very little about. I found it enough to deal with the loss of a breast first and my mind was telling me I sure was not ready to deal with more worries then. I have no problem wearing my foob and even forget at times that I am. At home I am comfortable to just go without. I do think our minds and bodies need time to heal and accept before we try to replace what has been taken. It's a decision that should not be rushed into. Femme, love who you are first, the rest will follow. Since losing my breast I found I have been more than ever loving who I am and where I'm at. It has helped me to be more daring actually in the way I dress and trying new looks. I have a sense of adventure now when shopping for new clothes that make me look and feel good and wear things I never would have before!!!! I'm quite impressed with how the foob looks and feels in clothing and no one is the wiser. Don't let this take from you anymore than what it already has. You need to stake your claim.......I AM WOMAN!!!",

The surgery itself was about 45min....you will want comfy clothes and easy to get on stuff, a suppotive bra is a must.

I didn't realize you had to squeeze all the air from the bulb to get good suction till I was told. The clots concerned me too but what I found worked was to pinch the tubing where the clot was and work at breaking it up by squeezing and rolling the clot and trying to slide it slowly down the tube. As long as liquid is still getting past it I was told it was okay. I think I would just go to emerg and let them deal with it there.",

I can't believe this and hearing from you and all your logic makes my eyes sting with tears but helps a little to try to think logically (numbers) and reasons why. It does really stink tho but I'll try to stay focused. Anne........I don't know how I'd deal with having to go \"there\" right now. I just want the nearest hole in the ground right now. Otter......thanks for the bucket, I'll keep it handy, bad enough I felt nausea all morning at work before that phone call and what timing too......I am doing a all night cancer walk tomorrow. Wishiwere.....thanks, I was just starting to get back to things and trying to put it out of mind for a while.....now this.......hope it's nothing and just over precaution. They had a cancelation for tomorrow so I can get in right away........thankgoodness for that, I am not joining the waiting game this time around.",

It's not just a forum, it's a connection of women coming together and getting to know eachother as well. That for me keeps me connected. When I first came, I came looking for knowledge, advice and reassurances for the fear I had as a newbie. That relationship here has grown past just that now and I come to share this space with women who I have grown to know and love and care about. We each are precious and enrich this place with what we have to offer even when we need a shoulder or ear......we all give so much back that written words can't always express.",

Usually if it's multifocal, mast is the best route to go as it would be difficult to remove it all when it;s spread out. Keep looking you'll find lots of info and stay posted, you'll get lots of answers. Sorry you had to join the site but it's good for learning and being supported!",
