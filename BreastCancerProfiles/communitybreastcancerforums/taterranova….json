I did a bit of researching because my daughters and I are struggling a bit. I was actually looking for some sort of relief that the loan holders could do for me and came across the discharge info on this forum but it was a little outdated. They have changed the \"rules\" a couple times since that person had received their discharge, supposedly to make things easier - we'll see. The main qualification is that you absolutely cannot work IN ANY FIELD and/or your condition results in death...Also, student loans must not be privately owned...as I get information on my application process I'll be sure to update here so others can have an idea of the timeline that I experienced as well as any other pertinent info you may need to get yours discharged if needed...",

I guess my questions are: 1. Has anybody been successful since the new law change last year? 2. What did the physicians section \"have\" to say? Mine is completed but I haven't sent it in yet. I don't want to spend too much time or stress on this - it's bad for you... 3. How long did it take? Any info would be greatly appreciated!

Also, they are bound to the rules of the Fair Credit Act, which is why the changes in the laws last July (2010)... How long ago did you try? I can be a lot like a bulldog in my tenacity, so depending upon what happens, I'll definitely post up or provide the information I had on my application. I was also told that I couldn't do anymore deferments, so that option was out for me. My daughter had cancer at the same time and one of her medical bills was $29k! They still told me, \"oh well, pay up\" so that set off the chain of events now, being a single parent it's hard. It sucks but I'm going to enjoy my days / months / years (hopefully) that I have with my kids...I'll fight and keep trying. Gotta be positive and nothing good is easy.",
