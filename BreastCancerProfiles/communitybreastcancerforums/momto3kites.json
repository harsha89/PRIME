If that makes sense.  I got into my ob/gyn a week later and he did an exam.  He said he felt the lump and found another (I have never been able to feel this other one).  He set me up for mammo and ultrasound.  I met with a surgeon (general)  Dec 3 for the radiology results.  The mammo stated benign mass (solid) found...........Birad 1.  The ultrasound showed nothing with a Birad of 0.   The surgeon basically read the report word for word.  He didn't ask to look at my mammo or ultrasound films or go over them with my husband and I.  He said it probably got bigger because I was touching it too much.  He said we should take it out and that it was probably a fibroadenoma, he doubted it was cancer.  He said it may just keep getting bigger and if I have it taken out we could do a biopsy on it to make sure it's not cancer.  Unfortunately, he's out of my network so now I'm searching for another surgeon.  I'm trying to find a surgeon that specializes in the breast, but I'm not having much luck.  Should I just go ahead and have a lumpectomy with a general surgeon?  Should I see another surgeon and get a second opinion?  And should I be making this a priority or do you think I have time to find a new surgeon and schedule surgery for after the holidays. I have to say I'm no longer a mad mess since they said this lump is benign.  I thought I was going to lose my mind during the waiting process, but I do feel a bit relieved now.  But at the same time I have this weighing in the back of my mind.  I don't think I will totally convinced until the biopsy in done and comes back negative.  Thank you all very very much for your support, thoughts and opinions.  God bless you!!!

So this has been a plan for a few weeks now and then I get the call yesterday that my surgeries are scheduled for March 11, ugh!   I don't know if I should reschedule the surgeries after all this...............do you think it would hurt anything to wait another month, because that's how long I'd have to wait.  I'm feeling so torn that I can't think straight.  I want this mass out of me and tested, so that I can move on with my life.  It's basically held me hostage for the last 4 months.  However, I feel the pressure to keep our plans for the birthday bash.  What would you ladies do?  No one else can even get what it's like to walk in our shoes and sit and wonder what is going on inside our bodies, unless of course they have been there.  So I don't feel that my husband gets it, or my friends would get it, I feel that I would be letting everyone down if I go through with my surgery.  Sad huh?  Any input is appreciated.  And I'm sorry for the long long ramble.  But like I said, I am an emotional mess right now, thinking about the \"what ifs\".  Thank you all for your continued support and I'm praying for b9 results for me and you.  Continued thoughts and prayers go out to those of you who have already been diagnosed.....................I'm wishing you all much strength, hope, courage and faith!!!!  ~Stacey Log in to post a reply",
