    "Content": "pennypennypenny wrote: After an exam, my wife's physician has referred her to a surgeon.  The surgeon is suspicious of a lump (maybe lumps) on one of her breasts and has suggested a biopsy.  Prior to the biopsy, the doctor suggested having an MRI done to have a clear picture of the breast before any disturbance is done to the area.  The insurance company, though under appeal, refuses to pay for an MRI before the biopsy.  An MRI after the biopsy they would pay for, however, but not prior to the biopsy.  Can anyone discuss if they had an MRI done prior to biopsy?  Or why it matters if MRI is done before or after the biopsy? Can you expand on why a doctor would want the MRI prior to the biopsy other than a \"clear picture\"?  Please tell me of your experience. Thank You Log in to post a reply",
