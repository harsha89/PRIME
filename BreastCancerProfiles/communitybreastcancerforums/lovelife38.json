I went to my primary doctor who treated me with antibiotics for 10 days which didn't help. I had to demand a mammo. My mammo came back negative, but I still knew something was wrong because of the redness, swelling and shooting pain. I asked for a ultrasound and there was the lump found!! 0.6mm. My skin punch biopsy was negative. IBC is very aggressive and needs to be treated immediately, due to the aggressiveness. Please push for ultrasound because IBC usually presents without a lump. Be your own advocate.",
