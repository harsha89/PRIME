My experience was similar to hers in that the women there were lovely and gave me lots of instruction and encouragement. I needed someone to say \"the darker color washes you out\" and show me how to wash a wig. I don't have Aetna, but my insurance covered $500 of the cost. My wig is a combination of real and synthetic hair. One of the infusion nurses that I met for the first time later in treatment asked me \"Wait, did you lose your hair?\" So, worth the expense to me.",

I went back to the salon where I bought my wig, which I still have worn daily, where the stylist has a lot of experience with post-chemo hair. She said it's perfectly normal to have the top coming in more slowly than the sides. To recap the start of my hair journey: 8 weeks:  10 weeks:  12 weeks:  14 weeks:  Because the growth wasn't as obvious and I was discouraged by having bangs like Kramer's, I didn't take photos for a while. I finally have enough length to weigh it down so it's not standing up straight on top. If any of you are wondering what happens if you don't cut your hair for a year, this is this morning:   And a post-salon car selfie, with the benefit of a trim and a blow dry. This is the first time I've been in public without a wig since August of last year!   ",

I really like it!\" I've been wearing the wig for five months, and comments about my \"hair\" still take me a little off guard.

In an effort to get my hair to look more like Barbara Corcoran's and less like Kramer's I had hair experiment day. The hair at the top of my forehead is very curly and crazy. And annoyingly, shorter than the hair on the crown of my head. First, Clairol Natural Instincts hair color instead of my usual Age Defy, which was not particularly effective in covering the gray. I will, however, be excited to see roots because they mean growth! Next, followed Sloan's program from her January post for using multicultural hair products. Applied a ton of styling mousse, wrapped with a wig cap, and let dry. It works! Finally, used the 3/4\" flat iron that I bought at Target. This helped, though I do need a bit more length to keep from burning my fingers. ",

I was feeling pretty smug! Four weeks after my last Taxol treatment I was down to two eyelashes above my right eye, the remaining hair on my head fell out, and my eyebrows were almost non-existent. They all started growing back immediately afterward. I had hoped to have the remaining hair as a \"starter kit\" but it didn't hang on. It was brown, and the new growth is almost black.",

And he's telling me \"Mom, when your hair gets as long as mine, you won't need your wig! \" Ah, yes I will! I didn't have the grandpa hair stage, somehow. Just baby chick fuzz, then hair, and the gray hairs are outpacing the dark hairs. I knew they always seemed to grow faster! Extreme facial fuzz has also arrived, and will need to be addressed this weekend.",

Can you imagine? The whole session I ogled her great, full straight hair. At the end she asked \"How do you cope when you look in the mirror and don't recognize yourself? Your breasts are different, you have soccer mom hair...\" Afterward I told her that I thought she had fantastic hair and I'd been admiring it. She is 7 months pfc and you'd never know that her hair is regrowth. I told her that I look like Kramer's sister without my wig right now (LorieKG, I think we are hair twins).

You have more than I did at 8 weeks, and in the next four weeks you'll probably see a lot of progress. (My post was on January 29 if you want to go back that far to see.) I think I expected every hair on my head to start growing simultaneously like a guy's face when he doesn't shave. They were more gradual, so now I have hairs that are anywhere between 1 1/2 inches and 2 1/2 inches long. I've been going to a series of educational sessions for breast cancer patients at my hospital. Most of us in the group are saying \"I want to look like myself again.\" We'll get there!",

Just that \"out of body experience\" feeling a few days after treatment, and some fatigue, but no mouth sores and I didn't even feel queasy. I had treatments on Thursdays, and was back at work on Mondays. Usually on Monday my breast cancer survivor co-worker would march into my office at 3:30 and say \"Go home! Go home before you get tired!!\" Then at 4:30 saying \"Why are you still here?\" The nurses all said that Taxol would be even easier. The only issues that I had with Taxol were neuropathy in my fingers and toes, but I really didn't feel any more tired than with AC. The neuropathy felt a little like being out in the cold so long that you can't feel the tips of your fingers. Not painful, just annoying. It went away in about six weeks. Good luck!",

Excellent name. :) HappyHammer and Catfurr, the customized metal plate is used for boosts to target the tumor cavity. It is about 5\" x 6\" and has a specialized cut-out in the middle designed by your RO, and slides into a bracket on the machine. You get a coordinating sharpie outline around your scar to go with it! Etnasgirl, it sounds like you are well prepared to get started. I used regular Aveeno lotion for the first week or so, until I started getting flushed in the treatment area. Then I switched to a combination of Aquafor and some cream that a friend gave samples of, My Girls, which has calendula in it. (http://mygirlscream.com/) ",

This is unusual for me. Usually I also gain five pounds out of nowhere when the clocks change back and the days get shorter, but that also didn't happen. I still need to lose 10 pounds to get my BMI to the recommended level to reduce rate of recurrence, though the holidays and radiation didn't add to that challenge. Tamoxifen might, though. ",

Mine might be about 4\" at the widest point? I put a tissue on top of it the first day to keep it from rubbing off on my bra, but because the tissue was a Puffs with lotion it ended up making a nice tie-dyed effect on my skin. It had to be re-traced. I half-joking asked if I could have the metal template as a souvenir when I'm done, since it has my name on it. The tech said yes.",

RE: Swelling - yes, I had that a bit too. It made the area on either side of my LX scar puffy, but has gone down now. Today was my last treatment! I got a certificate, and the tech chose We Are The Champions to play during my treatment. \"It's been no bed of roses... no pleasure cruise...\" Indeed! They said they'd asked if they could give me the molded plate for boosts that I asked for, but turns out it has some toxic metal in it so the couldn't.
