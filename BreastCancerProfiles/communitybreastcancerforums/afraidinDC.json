My GP found a lump in my right breast that is right in the area where my pain is. I saw a breast surgeon years ago for a lump in that same area, but this does not feel the same. I'm having the mammogram and ultrasound tomorrow. Everyone says not to worry, but honestly, I find that hard. I am 34 with 3 kids, 2 of whom have special needs. The thing is that I have not felt like myself since August. I feel so exhausted and wiped out! I am hoping that everything is ok, but my gut says otherwise. :( Will the radiologist be able to give me any information at all tomorrow? The waiting just sucks. :( Thanks for letting me vent!

I am relieved, BUT he did feel the lump as well and was puzzled about it. He told me to follow up with a breast surgeon. The strange thing was that when I showed my husband a picture of the mammogram (I had taken one off the screen), he and I both saw a white spot right where the lump is... but if it was so obvious I am thinking the radiologist couldn't have missed that. I have very dense breasts though. I will follow up with the breast surgeon and go from there. I am certainly not as concerned anymore, but I don't want to ignore my symptoms either. It's not like they disappeared after hearing those news.",
