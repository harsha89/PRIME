I finally got so frustrated I told them I refused treatment until they explained what happened. I talked with the manager who gave me quite the song and dance. When he was done I told him he had not answered my questions and insisted on speaking to the radiologist. I went home that day without treatment but felt OK with that decision. The next day the radiologist explained what happened in detail. She was very nice about it and apologized. I would try going to your dr. and asking these questions. Keep asking until you feel you have the answers. K",

      "Content": "Sep 12, 2007 06:21PM swimmingmom wrote: Hello everyone. I was diagnosed in Dec 2006, surgery in jan, Chemo started in Feb and just finished rads in Aug. I would be happy to answer any questions, feel free to PM me. Just had my port out and while it didn't really hurt, I was always aware that it was there. More mentally than physically. But yes, it will stop hurting soon. Be cautious using the EMLA cream. A woman going to my onc. used it and when they accessed her port the needle was not all the way in and some of the chemo leaked into her chest. Because of the EMLA she did not feel it. My onc did not allow its use and wanted you to be able to tell the nurse if you felt the fluid going in or it hurt. The needle stick does hurt a bit but it is quite brief. Ovaries come out as someone said because of the link between breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer usually does not have any symptoms until it is far long. Many woman have the BRCA1 and 2 testing done and based on the results make that decision. Mine was negative and so I decided not to have my ovaries out. I did not do a study because I wanted to do dose dense treatment. But many are out there and you can even choose your onc based on what studies are available in their office. Other Suggestions: Take your nausea medication exactly as prescribed such as the Emend. If your medication is ineffective call, many options are out there Avoid dehydration it will make you feel even more nauseated. I went in for IV fluids after each AC treatment Avoid reading too much. You can make yourself crazy with all the information and trying to learn it all. But at the same time be an informed patient! I had a hard time concentrating during chemo and found the time went faster when I had someone go with me and we chatted. Couldn't really read well I was nervous too and took Ativan. It is also great for nausea and insomnia Let people help you. I am not good at that but people want to do something. Let them! I had a hard time taking time off work. Thought I could do it all. But I felt so much better when I finally went on leave and I could not worry about being up all night from the decadron and then going to work. These boards were a great source of information for me, better than the drs office. You really can do this!!!! K.",
