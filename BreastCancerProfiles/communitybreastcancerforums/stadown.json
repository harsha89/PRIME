I am scheduled for PetScan on Monday and dreading it.  The last one showed further progression to my liver but the size of the finding was unable to be determined due to poor differentiation of the adjacent soft tissues (right of the report).  My onc says that means they just can't measure it.  So i have no idea of the size to even compare to my next scan. ",
