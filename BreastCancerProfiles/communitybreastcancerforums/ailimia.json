      "Content": "ailimia wrote: I went for my mammogram a couple of weeks ago and the radiologist found a problem in my left breast, and immediately switched me from �screening� mode to �diagnostic� mode, and took additional films and consulted with the doctor on site. I was told that I have a tumor (a bout 2 cm)and also areas of calcification throughout the breast. The doctor had me do the ultrasound and biopsy of both the tumor and calcifications on that same day. Two days later, the biopsy results came back and I was told the tumor was ICS (Invasive Ductal Carcinoma), and that the calcifications in the breast were Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS). A few days later I saw the breast surgeon and after additional tests (MRI, PET Scan) she told me that because I have the two types of cancers, I would need a mastectomy vs. a lumpectomy and that the cancer is hormone receptor positive. So, after thinking a while about it, I decided to have a bilateral mastectomy (since there is a history of cancer in my family), but the plastic surgeon said that since I have a weight problem and also am diabetic, he would not recommend immediate reconstruction. I need to have the cancer removed, do whatever treatment is needed, then lose weight before I do the reconstruction. Anyway, my surgery is scheduled for June 11. I have lots of questions I need to ask my doctor, but a few of them are probably better answered by women who have gone through this process before, such as: - Since I am not having immediate reconstruction, do I start using breast forms immediately, or do I need to wait until a few weeks after surgery? - Do insurance companies usually cover the purchase of the breast prosthesis and mastectomy bras? - Where do you buy these and what products are recommended? - How long do the drains typically stay in after surgery? Are they very uncomfortable? I know I have a million other questions, but can�t think of them right off the top of my head. Log in to post a reply",
