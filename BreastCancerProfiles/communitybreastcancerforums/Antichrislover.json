It gives me peace to see so many women fighting with courage in the face of the worst. So here's what's going on with me. I found a lump in my right breast about 6 months ago and ignored it. It's about the size of a quarter now, almost rock hard and doesn't move (i know that doesn't sound big but I have small a cups so I notice it all the time) my gyn found it on wednesday and is sending me for a US and mammo if needed this week. I couldn't think of the right questions to ask my dr at the time because I felt like a deer in headlights. So at 25, I'm the 3rd oldest female surviving in my family after my 2 aunts and didn't know much about my family history. I don't have a lot to go off of In that respect. I asked my aunt if anybody in my family has had breast cancer and she said yes, my great grandma and my great aunt on my mothers side and I have no idea about my fathers side. Over the past year I've also had a lot of pain and swelling under my right armpit but it comes and goes but I didn't think to tell my dr at the time. So I've been overwhelmed by the fear that comes along with uncertainty the past few days. I'm being strong for my husband and still playing with hot wheels and watching spongebob with my son. But inside I feel like my body has been invaded and I don't know where to turn. I don't know where I'm going with this but thanks for giving me an outlet for getting it off my chest.(figuratively anyway) Log in to post a reply",

I went for my yearly check up last week and they are sending me for a mammogram on tuesday. I was only a little worried until last night when I noticed I have a lot of little lumps on the areola of the breast with the lump. My other nipple looks normal. I think the lumps are montgomery tubercles. Does anybody know if those type of nipple spots are linked to cancer Log in to post a reply",
