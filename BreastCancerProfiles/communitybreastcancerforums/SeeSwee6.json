Not familiar with this X drug. My understanding is that traditional AI's don't really help with TNBC. Chemo supposed to be best treatment. I feel like going off my AI at this point (Arimidex) because I have poor appetite, weight gain, joint & muscle pain, fatigue. I find it difficult to eat well & exercise while on AI's. When I go off (for a week) I feel so much better. Catch-22 much?",

Food tasted awful, metallic. I ate sweets because they were the only things that had a taste. I indulged in ice cream, fruit, a lot of comfort foods. Everything the nutritionist told me not to eat! A lot of fatigue (even one year post-chemo). I took Claritin, helped w/joint pain relief believe it or not. Given all the side effects from chemo, they won't last forever. You'll get through it. I was 64 when I had chemo. No kids, husband, but friends and family helped me get through it. Also, very important to know: With TNBC (which I have) chemo is best option. I also had double mastectomy (had cancer in both breasts, plus a positive PALB gene). Good luck , keep us posted how you feel.  ",
