My routine: most days I barely have to wait at all; some days they come grab me before I even sit down in the waiting room. There is a changing area with the paper gowns. Sometimes I have to wait a minute or two for the previous patient to come out but oftentimes they just send me right in. I leave my shirt in a locker in the changing area but keep my purse. My name is on the monitor. There is a sheet on the table and they stick a wedge under my legs and put a rubber band around my feet to keep me still. I have the same techs: Jean, John, Megan and sometimes Jake. All are pleasant. On bolus days they lay it on my legs until needed. If I have on a skirt they put a sheet over my legs, either for warmth or modesty I guess. I'm usually in the room about 10 minutes, a little longer on bolus days. My doctor days start with the nurse weighing me and taking vital signs. She asks me questions and looks at my skin. The RO looks now too and basically confirms I'm doing ok. He was on vacation last week and the visiting RO did look me over more closely and give some detailed instructions on lotion application (I wasn't covering enough ground), but it was only last week that I had any SEs. This guy also thought I had barely started filling my TEs and when I told him they were full he said, oh, that's great, some women want these ginormous breasts .... LOL. Not very good cover, doc.

Unfortunately there isn't one correct answer. I will say that I find radiation much less bothersome than chemo was--I can't see or feel anything.

I bought a wig this weekend and to my own shock and surprise, I liked a synthetic one so much I ended up buying it instead of holding out for human hair. I actually think it looks really good and my husband likes it. It's a bob, much shorter than my current shoulder length but I've had tons of bobs in the past and always liked them. It's weird, I never worried about drastic changes to my actual hair but feel I need to warn my office before my first wig day. I also ended up getting a hat with hair, whatever they're called, and a head cover so I'm ready. It was kind of fun playing with all that stuff. I bought from a shop that specializes in cancer hair issues and the owner was so sweet and helpful. She could have ordered a human hair wig for me (she just doesn't keep them on hand) but I really did get swept away.

I don't think the wig place I checked out first will be giving away any freebies, sadly, but given their same day service I'll probably end up buying from them. I assume the cost would be an appropriate deduction if we otherwise qualify to deduct medical expenses but regardless, I have to buy one and it's just another delightful cancer expense, I guess.

He had called the lab because he picked up on a tiny discrepancy on the lab report about the positive margin (which my husband had also noticed) and to clarify that I did NOT have skin involvement which my MO had feared. I would expect and want a thorough consult, and every member of your wife's team has a different role and expertise. My surgeon said at my diagnosis that he doesn't like it when the oncs make surgical calls and he doesn't get into their territory. Keep us posted!",

I did have my hair cut when it was colored (I do not color my own hair, leaving it to the professionals), but if I cut the back short(er) I'm just delaying the inevitable hideous grow-out, especially with no guarantee the chemo curls will go and delaying my highlights further.

So, right away they thought that. I had a 2.5 cm IDC on the left and 9mm IDC on the right (they thought the right breast was DCIS but nope). I had a I think 0.4 mm margin on the left and a positive margin on the right. After we got the path report in, they scheduled me with the radiation oncologist. The surgeon had said he deferred to the RO. The RO said for sure on the right and perhaps on the left because it was so close. We ended up doing radiation to both sides and I'm in the middle of that treatment, having finished chemo. Remember, I had IDC. I was also 45 at diagnosis and in otherwise good health, but I had bilateral disease which was one of the factors going into aggressive treatment. As my surgeon said: your breasts like to make cancer. But as I understand it, my close margin was a bit of a judgment call. I actually thought my insurer might balk but they didn't. Good luck to you and your wife. It's very sweet of you to advocate for her. I have leaned on my husband hard to help me make sense out of everything. He's a PhD chemist, son of an oncologist, and he was with me at the RO appointment and co-signed that it all made sense.",

Luckily all went well. Right now is the scary, overwhelming time--you won't know exactly what you're dealing with until you get your surgical pathology report. And yeah, it's not fun adjusting to the reality of a permanent change to your body, but you will. I too am on the young side for BC so I know how you feel about that too! You and your family have a lot on your plate right now. How awful that your husband is suffering and out of commission too! I hope you will have some help at home. I definitely needed my husband to help me out of bed for a while, monitor my meds, etc. Best of luck to you tomorrow--keep us posted! It helps me always when I'm scared to remember there are a lot of brave ladies who've been through everything you're going through, and you and I can do it too. Edit--I see you will have family help--that's great!",
