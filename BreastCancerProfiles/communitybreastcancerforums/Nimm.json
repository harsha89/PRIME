However I think they have to check the rest during surgery. Do they normally enlarge if there is cancer??Radiologist  said only one was and that's what he biopsied? ",

I was diagnosed last Thursday...woke up three days thinking \"I have cancer\"...in shock and sad......past that!!! I'm feeling stronger now! Thank God! I have an oncologist appointment on the 27th and although I feel I can't take anymore bad news I'm ready and staying hopeful.  All I know now is that cancer was not in the lymph node they biopsied and my cancer is grade 1. Have researched and know that the grade is important in breast cancer. Being grade 1 gives me some hope. However, the thought that this could have  spread to the lungs, liver, bones, and/or brain makes me sick to my stomach! Not knowing is very scary but staying hopeful. ",
