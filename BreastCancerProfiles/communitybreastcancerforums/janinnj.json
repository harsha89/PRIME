No worries about gettinbg to a different location.  Lena- hope you solve the mystery illness soon, it has been long enough.  I mentioned the baby oil because the head tech is the one that suggested it to me and it worked for me.  I have my tattoos now so no more markers.  Just the smallest little dots that you wouldn't even know are there unless you know where to look.  Jan",
