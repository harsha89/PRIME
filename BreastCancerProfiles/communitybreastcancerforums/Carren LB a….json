So, I jokingly said, 'Do you want it as short as mine?\"  He reached out and lifted my wig and said - not that short - you are like at a -1cm!  I am actually bald; he wants it a bit longer - lol - I called him a Wuss!",

I needed to dial it back to -one day at a time- and just living in the moment of the day and not in the 'what if's' of the future. Maybe that might help you too. Radiation: Got a call on Friday. April 7th will be my Radiation Education Class and Video followed by the Scan and Tattoo. Takes about an hour. I told my husband last night I was getting a tattoo. We have joked about this for 38 years! LOL He said I would never do it because I could never make a decision on WHAT to get and there was pain involved. I told him, that (1) I was getting a tattoo (2) the decision was out of my hands and (3) no ONE was ever going to see it without a magnifying glass! LOL It was my way of bringing in some humour - he is such a sensitive guy when it comes to me and pain. Sometimes I forget that I am not the only one going through this adventure. I think I need to dial it back myself sometimes and be sensitive to others. Hmmm. Carren",

If I were to get it from the Cancer Clinic pharmacy, my coverage would have been only 65% and I would have to pay the difference. SO, anyone out there - make sure you get all the information up front about what it will cost YOU for the Neulasta. I talked to my NP/MO about the Claritin and she didn't have any idea why I would want to take it? Uh huh. I have my last chemo this coming Thursday. I will request (again) Benedryl drip (pre-chemo drugs), have my TC 'cocktail' and the Neulasta the next day.  I am call this system - \"Benny and the Jets\" - for those Elton John fans out there - yes, I do hum this to myself at treatments.

After which I will have 16 - 25 radiation treatments; depending on the 'Planning CT Scan'. For Chemo I will be having the TC cocktail; Taxotere/Docetaxel and Cytoxan/Cyclophosphamide. In preparation - I had my hair cut into a pixie style on Jan 3rd and it was long enough to send off to Locks of Love. I also dyed my hair Blonde and added Fuchia Pink highlights - which I forget about all the time - and wonder why people are always looking at me and smiling. I suppose they do not expect it for a 60 yo women.  I had a lumpectomy -Nov 26 and am currently cancer free including the lymph nodes. The chemo and radiation is adjunctive treatment. I have had quite a few people 'judge' my decision to go through with chemo/rads when I am cancer free. I wonder, but haven't asked anyone yet, if they think this was an easy decision. However, given that I am Triple Negative, 30% chance of recurrance and only 48% chance of survival in 10 years if NO therapy - I figure this was a 'no brainer'. Radiation will bring the recurrance down by 70% to under 10% and the chemo will bring the survival rate up to 66%. Anyways, everyone stay positive! This is what will get us all through this. And for those nay sayers I run into this is what I say ... Adjunctive treatment is like car insurance ... \"it is better to have it and not need it, than to need it and not have it.\" God bless us all and keep us in His Peace, humour and fellowship.",
