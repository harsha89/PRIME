I'm not really a candidate because I had a pos. node.  The cost is $3500 and my husband said he will pay it if insurance doesn't. I think the studies for Oncotype are on Stage I & II node neg AND on node pos post-menopausal.  I'm Stage IIa, one node pos, pre-menopausal. If I can get Oncotype I will but it will postpone treatment until that comes in. I heard it takes 12-14 days.",

He gave me all the statistics. I had a lumpectomy and had one sentinel node positive for a micromet. I will get radiation which will put my chance of recurrence at 25%.  If I get Tamoxifen also (which I am definitely getting) for 5 years, the recurrence goes down to 17%.  If I add chemo, it goes down to 11%.  So I guess he wants me to weigh the 5-6% benefit with the negative side effects. Do I want chemo? NO, but I don't want to spend the next 10 years wondering if I made a mistake. If I do have a recurrence, I don't want to blame myself because I could have done something more.  I'm so confused!",

It nearly made me cry. It took a couple days, but warm baths and Advil (600 mg) helped.I also thought I was going to be one of the lucky ones not to lose my hair and then I started to see that when I grabbed a handful of hair, 10 or more strands pulled right out. I knew this day would come and now it's hear and now I freaked. You all seem like you handled it really well. I'm trying to follow your example. I guess I'll handle it like I've handled everything else - with my head held high! Did you all just take the clippers to your hair? Did you have a guard on them? I think I'll have my son buzz me tomorrow. We go back to school after a 2 week break on Monday.",

I got my first treatment of TC on Dec. 19. (2nd is Jan.9)It went pretty well. Mostly felt real tired and in a chemo fog. The Neulasta shot gave me some sharp pains in my ankles after a few days and then on Christmas Eve I had horrible lower back pain almost bringing me to tears. It's been about 13 days and I still have hair. I am feeling some pain in my scalp. I've heard that's a sign. I teach school and have been out for Christmas vacation since I started my treatments. I'm hoping the hair comes out before I go back on January 5. I went to a wig/hat/scarf shop and tried on all kinds of headwear. The woman who owns the shop liked the way I looked in almost everything and asked me to model them for her website! She said I'll get some products in exchange for my time. I got some scarves and caps so I'm ready for the big reveal. Thanks again for letting me listen in on your postings. You've been a big help in my experience.",
