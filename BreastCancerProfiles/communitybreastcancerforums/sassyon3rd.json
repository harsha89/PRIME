Don't know if there is a correlation but I'm sure hoping that may be a cause. I was thankful for the sleep last night AND the dream. It helped ease my mind today.  Plus I cleaned out 2 closets trying to stay busy.",

I heard the word \"shadowing\" a couple of times when they were imaging me again right before I left.  Anyone else experienced anything like this?",
