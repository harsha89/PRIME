He has a link to a YouTube video of her and it just tore.. me.. up. Anyway, I sorta screamed on that thread and I feel bad.

I've been on one chemo after another for 3 1/2 yrs ,with one break during which I had 33 radiation. I had one 12 week break after doxil about ruined my ability to walk. this week has been another rough week, Im going at noon today for chemo. I have to take shots or my counts wont hold up even during my break my counts never came up that to me meant my body is wearing out. How long can you do this stuff before it is actually doing more harm then good? I keep doing it because I scared of dieing and knowing that I'm on my last chemo I can do makes it harder. I m sorry is this post is all over the place but thats exactly how I'm feeling this morning.. I want to live but I'm so tired of the fight. Tired of waking up every morning in pain, and tired because I cant sleep well. I'm scared of the next scan (next week) and scared of the next week dealing with the after effects of the chemo which is getting worse every week. I hurt my wrist 2 months ago and its still not healed, I have to wonder if its the chemo that keeps it from healing, xray and mri made no mention of cancer in my wrist. I just wonder how many of you out there have been none stop chemo for this long or longer how do you keep up, what am I doing wrong?  I get tired of people saying you look wonderful considering what your going threw... I guess they could say wow you look like sh@#$  LOL anyway thanks for hearing me out sorry about the spacieness.  I feel better already just venting this out but it is a serious question. thanks As long as I have the energy I WILL continue to fight I am so sad. I'm scared too. The picture is of her and her 20 year old son. Hugs, Traci Trip Neg BRCA + If I never look behind me, my troubles will be few. Supertramp.
