It was the worst day of my life.  She has since had a lumpectomy and 6 weeks of rads (she just finished last week). She was a trooper (I took it worse than she did!). The good news is that the worst part is over. Waiting to hear the dreaded words and find out all the details is the worst.  Try to stay strong!",
