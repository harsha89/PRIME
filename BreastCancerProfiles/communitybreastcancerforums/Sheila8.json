Given only 3 to 5 weeks for admittedly a different cancer type he said bugger that and sought a second opinion. 3 months later he is still with us and one of the most inspirational people I have ever met. I think what I am trying to say is we are all individuals and not statistics. Even with this prognosis no one can take away your individuality and will to live. Remind your self each morning that you have given your self the chance to live again. Love and hugs to youÂ  Sheila xx",

I was searching the web when I came accross this site and now my mood has been lifted thanks to the wonderfully positive comments from you all. I have mets in hip, back and ribs. I would love to hear more about this and get some advice on painkillers as I do not normally take drugs of any kind.

I am also looking at what type of exercise I can do as I am rather limited with mets to ribs as all work is centered in the core. I think I will have to get in the pool. Hugs Sheila",

I have not seen my onc yet as I was treated badly last time and took myself out the system. I was diagnosed with mets just before I was due to get on the plane to the Uk to see my elderly father. I decided to still go and deal with it when I returned to NZ. I have got worse in last couple of weeks and have registered with a GP in England but they will not treat me as all my medical records are in NZ. I am hoping to get home in about 3 weeks if I can get this pain under control. I will then go to my own GP and see what is available to me. I have taken the alternative route for many reasons but I am not shutting out convention either and will get all my options together. As a wise old monk once said.....This too will pass. Love and hugs to you all xx",
