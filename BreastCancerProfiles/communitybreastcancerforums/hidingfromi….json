Is your Robin ok without the chest tube? I do hope so.  I think I might perfer an oxygen mask. My biggest fear is sufficating. Eeeeck. I used to be on Abraxane and it just absolutely stopped working. (In my first post I said I had been on Arixtra...that stuff is for thinning my blood so I don't make clots for a cozy place for tumors to grow). Anyway, I pray Halaven works many months for all of us!!!",

I have had 2 cycles of Havelin after Arixtra stopped working. My CA marker jumped up to over 700 when it had been 400 5 months ago and 55 back in May 2011. Without Avastin I am so worried that my previous brain met will return. It was a miracle to fry that brain tumor last January. I believe the Avastin kept it from coming back since it could cross the blood brain barrier. I'd just hate to go stupider than I already am. Ha Ha Ha. My lung has been tapped for draining liquid 3 times now. I'm terribly short of breath. Will that get better? I don't know.  At least I don't have as much pain on Havelin!!! Yeah! I, too, need, laughter. I'd be interested in the sea sponge (Havalen) t-shirt.   Warm virtual hugs to all. {this is my first post} :-)",

I have the infusion along with 5 mg of a steroid and an antiemetic on Thursday. I can't sleep Thursday night. Friday I am really productive. Day 3 and 4 I am so tired and need to sleep long hours or I bark at the world. Nobody who loves me and hangs around me deserves me being irritable. The ONLY DAY I feel good is the day before the next cycle starts.I need the Neupogen shot after the first dose.  In a few weekends I plan to go spend the weekend at my son's college to watch him sing with the glee club. I will be meeting his girlfriend's mom. I have to work with my Onc. to be sure I can have a feeling-ok-weekend for that date.  I haven't felt any neuropathy with this regime. Is it inevitable? Come to think of it, I am walking a little less fluidly.My white count is low and I need a nap. Happy Super Bowl Sunday.",
