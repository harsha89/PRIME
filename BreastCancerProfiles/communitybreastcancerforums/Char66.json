Tired also of the wait and see every 6 months, waiting for the changes to happen. A friend ( survivor) asked last night if I would do it again, my answer was definite yes but maybe a little different route. I had BMX with direct silicone implants, if I had known then what I do now, I do think I would have had the TEs with implants after. I think getting the skin and muscles to stretch and get prepared for the implants over many weeks (months) would have been easier on my body and probably could have missed the skin necrosis. But that is not what decision was made and now will just continue with the healing. Char",

Don't think I can manage the every 3 month exams, MRI, or mammos and wait and see. And definitely do not want to do chemo unless would actually be invasive CA, so that leaves the preventive mastectomys. I do think that will be my final choice. Would rather pick the time for surgery than have cancer pick the time and go thru the chemo and radiation. It was really interesting about not letting medical field know my nursing background. Have found that true over all these years. char",

She walked in and her first two sentences were: 1)I believe in conserving all breast tissue 2)I do not do preventive mastectomies. She went on to tell me that I NEEDED to do chemo but it wasn't really chemo - just a PILL. When I had a \"chance\" to interupt her (which was very difficult) I explained that I did not want to do chemo or the wait and watch. She then asked \"if I had melonoma in one thumb would I cut off both of them?\" and \"Once your breasts are removed they can not be put back on.\" Oh really, never thought of that! Husband response was-arrogant know it all.  Really knocked me for a loop to say the least. Char",

Have talked with 3 daughters and DH, they all agree to have the BMX, but they don't have a clue what is all involved in it (I probably am underestimating it also, but as having assisted with mastectomys in the past, have a pretty good understanding of the surgury itself) But not the aftermath. NM-I don't plan on telling them I am a RN. We have moved to Phoenix area to retire, so do not know any BS (other than initial biopsy surgeon), MO, or really anything about the medical community here.  My NP that I was going to just retired while we have been gone for summer-so now have to find a new family provider also. Oh yes-gets more complicated daily. But will talk with MD Anderson and make decision. Again thanks to all.",
