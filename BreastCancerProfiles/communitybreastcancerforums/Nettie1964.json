I complied and sailed right through, no skin issues at all. Once done, he recommended an ointment which I used liberally even though there were no.issues.  And with that, I had NO skin issues at all.  My issues come from the damage done inside and I'm still having them.",

I think it was about a month and 1/2 after my last treatment!  I have always worn my hair at shoulder length, but I'm getting compliments on the short style, so I may just keep it! But I do have a question, have any of you had soreness on your scalp as the hair is coming in.  I don't really know how to describe it, it's just every now and then, as I pass a comb or brush it is a little painful, yet when I try to find the spot with my hand, I can't seem to find it!  Weird, I know!  Just wondering if there were any others that experienced this.

Anyway, just venting!  Thanks for listening!",

I'm beginning to wonder if the tenderness will ever go away!  I go to massage weekly and when he even get's remotely close to the breast, like around collar bone and underarm, that whole area is still very painful!  Just wondering if/when it will stop hurting!  I also wear compression cami most of the time, but found that on these hot days, it is almost unbearable! The other issue I have, and I had this before BC, I can NOT find a bra that does not either ride up or curl up under my breast creating extra undue pressure!  Therefore, when I wear a bra, I'm always pulling at it to unroll it or pull it down!",
