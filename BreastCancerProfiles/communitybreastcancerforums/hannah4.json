My mom has just been diagnosed stage IV breast to bone numerous sites. she's got back pain but otherwise asymptomatic. taking 1st round zometa and on femara 14days. pain still there. still waiting on her2/neu status. her ctc test came back high. oncologist dismissed saying 'jury is out\" on this test in predicting patient's prognosis. wondering if anyone has closely followed their ctc tests and what you think. also trying to research the very top oncologist(s)/researchers having success with arresting patients with bone mets, estrogen fed. any name(s)?. in particular interested in md anderson, duke or sloan kettering but open for your suggestions. no soft tissue involvement. mets patchy in skull and mets in ribs, sternum, pelvis, lower left femur. 13yrs out from stage 2lob carcinoma, 100% her2/neu(96). partial mastectomy 96. markers good all these years. 1 marker now slightly higher. i'm concerned about mom's ctc test numbers(24). I read on ctc site she should get another ctc test at end of this first zometa treatment. thank you so much.

This is no \"journey.\" It's a terrifying walk on a dark, scary, path. I don't know how my mom's been able to keep her spirits up these last 2 years but she has done very well. My Mom is physically a very beautiful woman. The idea of hair loss, sunken eyes etc. is something she is not choosing...for now. Both her consulting oncologists seem just fine with that..continuing on the hormonals. From what I've heard the side effects of chemo are much worse. She goes for more bone scans in 2 months and they'll decide from there probably back on a hormonal. Thanks everyone.",

      "Content": "hannah4 wrote: Last night, I got to speak to Mom's MDAnderson oncologist. Tamoxifen is no longer working for Mom. She has bone mets throughout her body, skull, ribs, sternum, femur, vertebrae with only moderate pain in her back. She looks terrific and no would ever know she has cancer. She is now 2.5 years out from original breast cancer to bone mets diagnosis. I know there are many other rounds of hormonals they say they can try on her. But last night, the oncologist did tell me that she has suggested my mom try a chemo therapy. My mom has, for now, opted not to and the oncologist said she is fine with that decision, for now. Mom is going off tamox for 2 months, getting her scans and then the docs will evaluate. She will likely go to try faslodex, or one of the others. Prior to tamoxifen mom was on femara which did not work and she has been on tamox for approximately 16 months. *Question: Why would the oncologist suggest Mom try hemo at this stage when the side effects are so much worse? What does going on chemo achieve at this stage (she's 2 yrs out from original bone mets diagnosis) versus continuing to try other hormonals.  Is chemo shown to slow the bone cancer growth that much more versus hormone inhibitors? Her local oncologist suggested another hormone inhibitor and that there are many more to try at this stage at last week's visit. He didn't suggest chemo as an option yet.

Mind you, her gynecologist had put her on estrogen for 30+ years back in the 70,80s,90s like they did i think a lot of women. her cancer was estrogen fed. when he upped her estrogen back in the 90s is when the lump popped in 95. ",

My mom's doctor at 18 months is suggesting taking her off tamoxifen and not putting her on anything for a few months to see if the \"TAMOXIFEN withdrawal effect\" staves off progression of her bone mets. her oncologist has seen a patient stay status quo for 18 months thanks to \"tamoxifen withdrawal effect\". He cited an important study and discussed it with her Monday. Mom's latest pets and scans showed bone mets slightly progressing. After 18months, which he says is about standard for Tamoxifen to work, it doesnt seem to be working anymore. Rather than jumping right onto the next drug say faslodex or aromisen, he wants to see if mom has any success just being off the tamoxifen. the study he told us about showed that in 30% of women they have no progression of bone mets coming off tamoxifen after being on it for a duration of time. Before you ask what about the 70%, let's remember all these drugs are a crap shoot to see if one will work and for how long. So his thought is to see after a few months(maybe 3-4) if scans show a status quo or progression. If there's progression of course he'll put her on another drug but I think he wants to try this, coming off TAMOX ie \"TAMOXIFEN WITHDRAWAL\" because he says he has witnessed a number of women with successful result. Have any of you done this? just come off a drug?--  PS- we are waiting to hear if mom's MD Anderson oncologist concurs with trying this or what she thinks about it. we suspect she will disagree. i'm in the process of getting the exact study mom's doctor is referring to. by the way, the oncologist suggesting she try this is VERY well regarded as the top oncologist in south florida.  Hannah Dx 8/24/2009, Stage IV, 0/0 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Hormonal Therapy 9/1/2009 Femara (letrozole) Hormonal Therapy 6/1/2010 Log in to post a reply",

My mother's mets are in her spine,ribs, sternum, lower left femur. So far pain only in the middle of her back. How long did Femara take to improve your bone pain? Did you experience fatigue on Femara? What other side effects did you have? She's been wiped out physically and takes to bed after a few hours of activity. What kind of tests did your oncologist do to see if Femara/Zometa was working? How soon did your oncol do tests from beginning treatment? I read follow-up bone scans are less effective for assessing progression or arrest of mets. Is this right? What should my mom's oncol test or do this Friday when she returns for 2nd Zometa iv?  What questions do you suggest she ask him? She's been on Femara for apr 23days. The last 2 days she THINKS..MAYBE pain has eased in her back and she hasn't had to take vicodin. Could this be the meds actually working or just a blip? I pray the meds may be working. But does pain ease and come back for you? Thank you so much.
