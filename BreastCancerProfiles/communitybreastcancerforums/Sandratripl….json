I have just been diagnosed (Dec 18).  DCI,grade 3, stage 3, lymph involvement and triple neg on the receptors.  I am just going through some more test and starting neo adj on the Jan 23rd.  So very afraid.  I am 51 and had a clear mammo on Aug 27 and now have a 4.5 cm in my left breast and now can feel it under my arm just since the biopsy. Was scheduled for surgery on the 8th but changed programs completely to a cancer center close to home. The delay in treatment came from the holidays. Everybody was on vacation and I finally left and changed course directly with a new program. Thought maybe I could come to you with some questions as this goes along since it seems we are being treated somewhat alike.  I know we are all different and you all seem to know so much more but I am learning everyday as much as I can retain.  I too, live in a rural area.  I take from some of your conversations, that walking helps with the pain/soreness?  Kinda, jumped in late  ",

Apparently they get together on Tuesdays of each week and will determine my path next week. I feel so blessed they have excepted me.  I have a mast scheduled for Tuesday of next week with another general surgeon and will not cancel until I am positive I am on the road with the Massey Cancer Center of UVA and certain they have a plan.  I am so resentful of having a clear Mammo in Sept, finding the lump in Nov, my ob put me in for test Dec 3rd and after all the test and space between, I got a surgery date of Jan 15th.  I felt like  it took 12 weeks to develop and another 6 for them to fit me in for  any type of treatment. Everyone was off during the holidays but my cancer. That is why I am desparately trying to move into a more aggressive program. Please tell your son that moving to a pump was a big step for me but once I did it has made my life so much easier.  I don't have to eat at a certain time and make sure I have carbs. What you do have to do is adjust your insilin when you do eat carbs by giving yourself a bolus.  Your base rate  or basal should keep you level.  If you eat or exercise or do anything that effects your blood sugar level (stress) you adjust your pump.  My A!C was 8 last time. Should it be lower? yes. When I check my sugars regularly, it will be.  Looks like that is in my future. I will let you know what the plan is after today.  If your son has any questions about pumping, I would be happy to discuss.  Just reality, no sales pitch.",

The lump was examined on Dec 3 and I have had test everyweek going through the steps of dianosis and then the surgeon could not operate until the 15th. My Doctor friend finally got the path report after I asked it be sent on the 27th and eventually went to the hospital myself on New Year's eve and sent it myself.  He is in another state but made some calls because he felt chemo before was in order. I am supposed to start Thursday or Friday of this week. I am most concerned of the Type 1 with the treatment.  Can you direct me with any advise or reference material? Thanking you in advance for all your help. Sandra",
