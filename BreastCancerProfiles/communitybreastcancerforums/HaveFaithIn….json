My treatment center just added it to their protocols. Mine was 3.7 and my doctor said he likes to see readings of 4 and under. 3.7 was a little too close to 4 for him but my breast antigen numbers are good so he wasn't overly concerned. I found an articlewith good info and a lot of things (per the article) can cause fluctuations in readings including supplements. If your number rises at the next reading maybe you can get an additional test done. Do you get the CA 15-3 (breast antigen) test done routinely? If so, is there an increasing number trend with this test as well?",
