I had some skin peeling in the lower part of my armpit this past friday (apparently, a result of the brass bolus every single day, said my rad onco), so I am guessing this is also induced by the rads since it's the same side. I briefly googled this and it said to get treatment for it ASAP but I couldn't find what the treatment was. Other than ending the rads, does anyone else have experience with this one? Just looking for some good questions for my doc tomorrow. Was it treated by the rad onco or oncologist? Dx 2/5/2015, DCIS, Right, 2cm, Stage 0, Grade 3, 0/2 nodes, ER+/PR- Log in to post a reply",
