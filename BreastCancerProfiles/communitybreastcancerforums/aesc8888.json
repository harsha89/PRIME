( My mother is chinese and does not know English, So it is me writing the post) Less than a week ago, my mum told me that primary care physician said she might have breast cancer b/c the result of physical examination. I was shocked and came back the city recently during spring break.      My mum had a right breast biopsy (not sure about the exact name of the biopsy), and got the result yesterday      DIAGONOSTIC INTERPRETATION: Right Breast:    -Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma, moderately differentiated, GRADE II    -Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS), Cribriform type, GRADE 2, and focal microcalcification    -Tumor size 1.2*0.8*0.6 cm (PT1c)    -Tumor is closed to inked medial margins at 0.1cm    - no lymphovascular invasion seen    My mum is going to have a MRI at saturaday to see if there is any residual accoring to the physicain. I did some research and knew that DCIS required treatements of lumpectomy and radiation theraphy or mastectomy. I think lumpectomy is beter since one can have breast left compared to mastectomy.    The physician suggested mastectomy. He holds degree of M.D. of general surgeon. I am thinking to get consult in other clinics or hospital, maybe New York clinical cancer center.. considering the fact that my mum can't speak english and I am going to leave her for college.Any one can give me suggestion of good doctor, clinics that offer consideratley lower costs?  Thank you so much!!!!  Log in to post a reply",
