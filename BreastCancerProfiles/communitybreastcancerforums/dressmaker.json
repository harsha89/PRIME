I decided it was time to come in and check on old friends. Kimmytoo was one who received one of our quilts. She wrote me such a nice thank you, it is so sad to see her gone. After Shelli left us I had a really hard time coming back here. One of my very close friends(since 1st grade) who was also on the boards from time to time as Milkweed passed away very quickly in September. I was helping her make quilts which were to be given to her children as wedding gifts. We had just finished the last quilt and I knew she was slowing down a little, and before I knew it I was sitting with her as she was dying. So so sad! When will all of this end. I'm also so sad to hear that Geeta also passed away. I didn't know that. No mother should have to say goodbye to their daughter like this. My friend Milkweed was just 51. May they all RIP Prayers for everyone. Vicky",

May God help you through this very difficult time. Shelli will be truly missed by many of us. COME TO ME God saw you getting tired, and a cure was not to be, so He put his arms around you and whispered, \"Come to Me.\" With tearful eyes we watched you, and saw you pass away, and although we loved you dearly, we could not make you stay. A golden heart stopped beating, hard working hands at rest. God broke our hearts to prove to us, He only takes the best. Vicky",

My thoughts and prayers go out to Jon and family. Karilynn was very uplifting to so many people here on the boards. She will never be forgotten. For those of you who were involved in the quilts here is an email that Kari sent ment awhile ago. Subject:QuiltFrom:KariLynnDate:Sep 24, 2007 01:54 pm Hi Vicky, Wanted to let you know that since I booted myself to a recliner (back) have wrapped up in hte quilt every night.  It's wonderful! If you need a picture of it (I remember that you lost some), let me know and I'll try to get it to you ASAP. Thanks again for sharing your time and talent with us - I know how much Shelli must have enjoyed being wrapped up in all that love. Kari   With many, many, tears! May you rest in peace KARI!!!!!
