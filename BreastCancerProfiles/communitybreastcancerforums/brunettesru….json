I am sort of in the same boat as Lisa above.  So far (2 treatments) no side affects except a dry mouth an a bit of nausea the next day.  I can't predict future treatments, but hopefully the side affects don't worsen over the next 14 treatments, but probably will.

Some rockstar SANAISA...lol. Being a single mum and having to give up work because of this, financially it is a hugh struggle, so my days are spend bumming around the house (because its cheap..lol) and doing a bit of private work for a friend.  I have a \"day time snooze\" practically every day even though I'm in bed early and wake up early.  My daughter's 12 birthday is on Saturday, so have focused on that over the last week. My rock star is my 11 year old daughter, who without her, I probably would have checked out by now permanently.  She has helped bath, dry and dress me when I came out of hospital, changed dressings and hugged me when I cried.  She loves my \"haircut\" and is always rubbing my head...lol.  She has matured alot since this all started, a lot to put on a 11 year olds shoulders, but she is all I have.  My family are 8 hours away by car and only talk on the phone, they give me support but are not here physically with me going through this. Seeing my OC on Monday and 4th fill on Tuesday then Chemo #3 on 28 Oct. Enough gabbing for now...I'm obviously bored...lol.   Hugs to everyone and will talk again soon. Jayne",

You were all correct, these weekly taxols are coming around quite fast, it only seems like yesterday I had the first one and now I am up to my 3rd.  No signs of pins and needles yet, but it will probably rear its ugly head further down the track. My hair is growing back slowly, maybe under 1cm around the back and sides, but the front is not doing anything, maybe because of the scarf rubbing against the hair all the time?

They put the Droxorubisin (sorry if incorrectly spelt)  in and then started the drip.  I said to her that I haven't been given my anti-nausea tablets yet, she checked the chart and said really you are supposed to have them one hour before treatment..GREAT!  So she gave me one pill and injected me with anti-nausea liquid.  I left the ward at 4.15pm and very annoyed. I understand they were doing their best and were very busy, but no-one had read by blood test, thats whey the chemo was so late.  I did my part on the Tuesday and had my blood test at 8.30am so it would make the 10.00am courier to the lab and then be faxed to the hospital in sufficient time. Next time there is a public holiday, either I will cancel my treatment for that week or arrive 5 hours late.  The charge in my ipod ran out and I had no-one to talk to and was sarving for food and a ciggy. Some lessons learned.  Next time take my laptop and a packed lunch. My veins are not easy to find anymore..they suggested I may need a port after a couple of more treatments....does that hurt..one lady near me had her port about the inside of her elbow..weird place to put it thought.",

I get to pick out which impant I need on March 17 and see oncologist on March 18 about going on tablets for the next 5 years.  Apparently my cancer was estergine based. Now my body can start getting back to normal.   I am over the moon. Hope everyone is feeling good and nearing completion.  I will check in again on March 19 or thereabouts.  Jayne",

Could you please answer me some questions. How long does it take for the numbness to leave your fingers and toes? and the aches and pains in legs? When does the hair start growing back (in ALL areas).  My head hair is about 1 cm and fuzzy all over except the front, must be snapping off from wigs and scarfs.  No hair anywhere else yet. My last chemo was 2 weeks ago tomorrow. Jayne",

See my OC today about tables for next 5 years...ugghh!. Loosing weight dramatically now..but I've been told its all the fluid that was stored during chemo..hopefully there is 30kg of water...lol.  Down to 87kg (was 99kg at surgery). Hair growth not doing alot...3 weeks out from chemo...I'm not very patient...lol I feel a little out of place here now, as all you ladies are having radiation and I don't need it or know anything about it, but I wish you all the luck and healing in the world to get through radiation. I suppose I should jump to another thread for exchanges coming up, but I will feel strange starting in another thread after I have talked to you guys for 7 months. Love and hugs to all and good healing. Jayne    ",

I am 9 wks post chemo and my hair has now covered my head (very thickly I might add) but is very short and very very grey.  I had brown hair before all this but needed to cover greys once a month.  Seeing \"I now have hair\" but grey I put a brown  temporary (8 wash) dye on my hair.  It turned the hair purple after the brown started to fade.  I thought even though I only have a bit of hair - brown might look better than grey.  Couldn't handle the purple anymore so put a permanent colour in (light brown), now my hair has turned a auburn/brown, very reddish.  I am very temped to shave the whole lot off and start again.  I look like an idiot.  I still wear scarves when I go out.  Hair not long enough yet, but will be soon if I let it grow.  Question, is the weird colours due to chemo still in my hair or the new regrowth is that grey that it is not taking the colour.  Should I \"buzz\" cut it down and start again or wait for it to grow and cut it out bit by bit.  I have reconstructive surgery in August and was hoping to be able to go coverless by then and a nice shade of brown.",

      "Content": "Jul 23, 2009 08:06AM - edited Jul 23, 2009 08:17AM by brunettesrule Thanks everyone.  I'll clear somethings up for you.  Being in Australia, it might be a bit different to USA.   Been diagnoised with a 5cm lump in my right breast.  My biopsy pathology says NST (no specific type) carcinoma and DCIS.  Due for surgery Aug 6.  I have no choice but to have a mast because the cancer is so big 12 o'clock position.  I have not been given the option of a bilateral mastectomy and don't know what it is..will google later.  Not sure why this is not an option.  You tend to go with what the surgeon suggests..they know more than me. The breast care nurse said I might be stage 2...don't know for sure. I have three choices before my PS can get to me....no breast, prosthesis or TE.  I have chosen the TE (which I know makes way for an implant, but I may decide later on to have a TRAM flap - as this is 2 years away, I will decide later).  My PS says the TE is unnecessary if I have the TRAM Flap, I understand this, but I need to concentrate on surgery's now...not in 2 years.  I don't want a prosthesis for 2 years and I don't want nothing for 2 years so TE is all that is left.  I will need 4-6 bouts of chemo and possibly rad (they are not sure on that yet - maybe they are waiting till after the surgery when they know more about the cancer to decide whether I need it).   In six months time (approx) the PS is doing a reduction of my left breast (non ca) from DD to C, because they cannot fill to DD and I don't want my big boobs back.  That means a total of 3 surgerys - minimum...wow a lot to deal with. My big decision (which I can't decide) is the lymp nodes.  I am having a sentinal node biopsy the day before the surgery.  That is how far I have gotten so far with all this.  Standard procedure for this size of lump is an auxillary clearance or I can be part of a SNAC2 trial in Australia in which a computer decides for me and I either get chosen for an auxillary clearance or they check the sentinal node.  Really don't want either.  Would prefer sentinal node checked first, surgeon says I can do it but standard procedure is auxillary clearance.  So confused.  I need to decide next Thursday, should have decided yesterday but all I could do is cry because I don't now what to do.  I don't want them to take out healthy nodes and run the risk of lympdomea if they are not cancerous but the back of my mind says to take all the crap out of my body..l don't want it. So that is where I am at.  I have resigned from work to give myself a year or so off to recover and get through all this treatment.  Some people think I was crazy to resign, but after being a single parent for the last 7 years and working that whole time... I think I am entitled to some time off for myself for my treatment.  When I am all well, I will go back to work. Hopefully I am understanding this all properly..its a lot to take in. With the lump being 5cm..surgeon says there is 73% chance of cancer under the armpit, but also 27% not...that is why I cannot decide.  Really need some help here. Glad I found this site..very helpful talking to people who are or have gone through what I am going through.  God bless all of you and keep you healthy.",

      "Content": "Mar 9, 2010 02:39PM - edited Mar 9, 2010 02:40PM by brunettesrule I go bald at home, but if someone knocks on the door, I immediately throw on a scarf I keep near the door.  My first scarf I brought from Katies..$35 and not hemmed...what a rip off.  I cut it in two and use it when I swim in the pool in my townhouse complex..they are a bit ratty now. I brought a heat resistant wig which looks great..people I have told its a wig told me they never would have guessed it was a wig. I have several scarfs now..brought material from spotlight or material store in 1 metre squares and use them...so much cheaper...I got 4 scarves for $20... I saw a sale for $5 per metre..great. I have never worn a hat...not a hat person, but as summer draws to a close here in Australia, I might have to thing of something for winter..doubt whether I will have enough hair not to wear anything. The only beanie I have is my daughters BRIGHT PINK one..would not wear that out in public..lol. I love wearing the scarves with the long ties down the back.. I know wear the knot below my ear and have the ties run over my mast. side. The other day I was in the shopping centre all dressed in my black work uniform with black scarf (looked like the mafia....lol) and this woman kept staring at me...I mean really staring...I walked past her down the isle and when I got to the end I turned around and she was still staring.  Gave me the shits so I walked back to her and said \"I hope you never get breast cancer and people stare at you\". She got very embarrased and walked away.  Geez I felt good after it.  I work in a suburb where there is a lot of muslim women who all wear scarfs, so I don't know why she was staring at me.  Maybe I should not have been so mean, but sometimes it bugs me that people 'stare'.  Sorry for the vent at the end.
