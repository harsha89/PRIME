It's is .4 cm and showed up nicely on the u.s..my Dr said they would like to follow up next month, but also thinks I should see abreast cancer specialist to decide on biopsy or complete removal of the lump. I'm not sure what to do. The mamm and ultrasound sdid not say if it was benign or cancerous and I dint want to continue to redo these! Should I see the surgeon and allow her to biopsy or remove the lymph node so I will at least know what the cause is? And whether it is cancerous or not? It is also uncomfortable as it's quite large and bothers my upper back and shoulder. Thank u for any advice u may hv for me. (I'm a 20 yr survivor of cervical cancer and have had several nodes removed in my groin and biopsies-under my arm over 10 yrs ago)",
