    "Content": "Jul 3, 2011 05:46PM - edited Jul 3, 2011 05:47PM by alleynei May 26, 2011, I had two tumors removed from my right breast, one of them was benign fibroadenoma and the other was a malignant phyllodes tumor. The doctor had removed a large margin of the tissues.  I visited the Oncologist who explained phylldes tumor to me, these tumors are very rare and even though it was malignant, he explained  once the margins about 1 cm was removed I do not have anything to worry about these tumors do not respond to chemo and radiation. and their growth is very slow. He also explained to me these tumors are usually confined to the breast tissues. The only thing he recommed was regular visits like every three months.",
