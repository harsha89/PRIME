I normally wear a silicone prosthetic and wanted some advice about flying whilst wearing my prosthetic. Whilst the diagnosis & treatment were fantastic the after care is not as good as in UK, so it's difficult to find any answers on this subject. I would be so grateful for any information Log in to post a reply",
