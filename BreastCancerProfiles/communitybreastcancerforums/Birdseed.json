Since then, I've had several more biopsies done and have been doing rechecks every 6 mos so I think I've gotten a little more laisez faire about the whole deal. I think one thing to keep in mind is that for a lot of doctors, even if they really AREN'T concerned, from a safety/legal standpoint, they feel they have to order the biopsies to cover their bums.  So when a doctor tells you \"I'm really not that concerned\" and you have not had issues in the past or have had benign things like the fibroadenomas, then while difficult, it's probably wise to try not to worry.  It's a process and it can take time.   Even when they tell you \"it looks like it might be X\" there's always the chance that it's benign too.  So that's what I remind myself when I'm waiting--like today.  Had three biopsies yesterday and Dr. said she thought it was probably ADH or DCIS.  Well...no good worrying about it til I know for sure because it will just drive me batty.  Don't get me wrong, it does keep bubbling up in my thoughts.  But I just try to keep busy and hold off on worrying til they really give me something worry about.
