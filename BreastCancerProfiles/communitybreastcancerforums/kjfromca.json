I do get fibers in the tubes. Also, I hear that at about 10 days a lot of people get their tubes out. Make sure that you are stripping the tubes so there is no blockage and drink a lot of water. Don't stress, your onc will know what to do. Good luck tomorrow. Kim",

I would make sure that your primary doc. is referring you over to a facility that specializes in breasts. I originally went to my local hospital for my first biopsy and ended up going to a different facility that specialized in breasts, my breast surgeon had a completely different protocol on dealing with biopsies than the hospital that I was using. Be your own advocate, stay strong, and don't do too much research on the internet right now, it will drive you crazy. I wish you the best. Kim",
