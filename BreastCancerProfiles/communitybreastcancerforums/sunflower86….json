I'm a nurse so I live this stuff. Two years ago I felt small lump. Mam neg ultrasound neg, family history neg.Life good.Wanted it out then. But, several docs said not to worry.Â Never went away didn't really get bigger. But this year got sore. Went for both again. With ultrasound on the lump saying again they saw nothing, I asked to see radiologist. He confirmed nothing on mam. just increase vascularity. So I sat up and said\"what's this\".Oh we need to get a biopsy.Two days later, lumpectomy-surgeon came out and told my family looks suspicious. Two weeks later after MRI conformed it wasn't all gotten, I was diagnosised with invasive Breast CA. Here I sit tonite, Mastectyomy and 2 rounds of chemo bald and nauseated.Good news I still caught it early, no lymph nodes etc..But in my heart I wanted it out 2 years ago. I too love my ob-gyn and still would trust him completely. But be proactive. I would have walked out this year with another mam. and next year been a very sad statistic. You know your breast better than anyone. If there's something there and you don't like it get it out. Fight for your testing and rights.I'm very grateful I did. There are too many ways to really test a lump that one should not be ignored. My big questions is if that was on a guys testicles I bet it would get checked closer.lol",
