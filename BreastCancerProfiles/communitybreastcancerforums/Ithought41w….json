Anxiety has definitely kicked in for me.  My surgery is on Wednesday.  I have woken up my last Friday morning with my girlies and I am getting nervous.  But my plastic surgeon is a dream and my hubby really likes him to.  He was very supportive and encouraging.  Have a great Friday everyone and try to enjoy the long weekend!  Lisa",

So that is my deal and I want to be your ear and support as well.  Lisa  ",
