I just had my 2nd EC yesterday and it has been so much better then the 1st round on the 20th...only tired so far.  I definitely think the steroid (decadron) has helped tremendously.  Hair started falling out last weekend so I went ahead and buzzed shorter as I had to go to a meeting and needed to look a little better than I currently was!  I also had a MUGA scan yesterday and will possibly get to start my Herceptin on June 30th with the next chemo.  I truly appreciate everyone's comments and it gives me things to write down and ask my doc!  Have a great rest of the weekend everyone!
