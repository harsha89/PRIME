I pin the cover of the form at the top,  bottom and both sides, to the bra.  If you just take a small bit of the material it won't show on the outside of the bra.  (It actually doesn't make much difference..the pins are small and I don't have anyone who's going to see it. There's no way I can show you other than say you'll just have to experiment.     Good Luck!! ",

      "Content": "Mar 8, 2011 11:59AM - edited Mar 8, 2011 12:00PM by Nokomis When I had my mastectomy (25 year ago) I was told about the elastic that you pin to your underpants and bottom of the bra.  Once in a while I do this. (Makes going to the ladies room pretty difficult though. I don't use mastectomy bras.  I find that they're too expensive and very limited in styles. I like either a non-padded bra or a softly padded one.  Each is for different occasions and clothing. I purchase very nice, regular ones, and pin my breast form into it. (Small safety pins.) After so many years it's just second nature to me, and I have the  choice of many different bras.",
