I have to find a doctor at Dana Farbar and get started making phone calls tomorrow morning. I'm trying to calm myself down but keep having panic attacks. So terrified. Crying in waves. One of the things that is scaring me is the fact that there are three lesions. I think that two of them are 1 cm and one is maybe half that. All in the same area. This makes me worry that it is more advanced somehow. I worry that I could have caught it sooner and didn't. The other thing that woke me up freaked out today is that I remembered that the results of my last pap were not totally normal but the obgyn said that we could wait until my next annual to retest. Now I'm wondering if that was some kind of sign of advanced cancer related to the breast cancer. Log in to post a reply",
