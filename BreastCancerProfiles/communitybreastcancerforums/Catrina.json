I had the same issue after MRI on my good side, left side had already been diagnosed as multi centric and mastectomy was my only option for that side. I also had two more biopsies on the right side due to hot spots that showed up on the mri which turned out to be negative. I know that it is very hard to wait for more test results, but usually this is not a medical emergency, and as my surgeon explained to me, the addional time it takes won't make a medical difference, although certainly is tough on you mentally. I think if you are not sure, it helps to have the tests to at least give you piece of mind that you are making the right decision. I know that I needed to be absolutely sure that mastectomy was my only option before making peace with it, but I realize many people feel differently. Good luck, and hang in there, it is a really tough time through the waiting and testing",
