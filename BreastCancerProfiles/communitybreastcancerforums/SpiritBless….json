I am a positive energied believer who is not shy about my faith. I do pray openly for others as I believe prayer is powerful. I hope this will be a good board to visit. Lucy",

From what I have just read you gals are awesome and I am so glad I found this board. I was on another but then found out recently I have cancer on the lung so my focused has changed and didn't feel comfortable on the other board. So a little about me: Dx in Sept of TNBC and had a CT scan but the current Onc and surgeon didn't do anything regarding the nodules that showed up. They both said focus on the breast did an MRI no other tumors so we did surgery. I then wanted another opinion because something in my gut just didn't seem right. So I went to Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) and they said I needed a PET scan. So they sent me to a facility nearer to my home in Olympia and it found those nodules were in fact TNBC as well. So that Onc sent me back to SCCA and I have been working with them since. I am so glad actually even though it is a 2 hour drive, it is the best place to be. They work with Fred Hutchison, Children's Hospital and University of Wash. I love the team I have working with me and I am currently starting on a Case Study trial and my first treatment was yesterday. It is using Abraxane (chemo weekly) and Avastin (targeted therapy bi-weekly) for 24 weeks. There is another targeted therapy called Erlotinib that is a pill but won't be started until after the 24 weeks. Depending on the results of this plan Avastin may be used after the 24 weeks as well. I know the TN makes a big difference as it is a very aggressive cancer. So just looking for any input and also hoping to find a home on a new board. Thanks in advance for your thoughts.",

I haven't really felt the fatigue that they told me about.  I did yesterday but I think I was just tired from helping my daughter cook most the early part of the day.  She gave me some lessons on how to use a food processor.  She is actually taking the charge of my nutrition program and is coming every Friday to precook meals for the week for us.  It is all organic, whole and I have learned a whole different way to eat and cook.  She pretty much eats this way everyday for the past 5 years so she is amazing. I have eliminated all sugar and flour and very limited meat.  I am getting my protein from beans, lentil, quinoa, nut butters and nuts.  Has anyone else changed their diet to aid in providing more healthier options to help fight cancer along with giving more nutrients to boost your immune system? Hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving...blessings! ",

I have done some research on alternative treatments as well so I want to get all this under my belt when I meet with the new team to run some of my questions by them. Does anyone here have any insight to alternative treatments? I am hoping to add a Naturopath Oncologist to my team as well. Hoping to start back with acupuncture, massage and going to try yoga so hopefully it will help out. I am not totally sold on the chemo treatments yet so as long as I am not 100% I will continue to do my due diligence. I would love to hear some feedback on this.

So anything you can offer or share would be appreciated.  I will be checking this thread more often.  I am on a different thread for Christian women and there are only a couple of gals with TNBC but they are not mets.  It is not the same when we share things and so I thought I would pop in here again.  Hope to hear from you all for info and encouragement.

I was dx 08/13 so we have been on the journey almost the same time. I am stage IV as well from the very beginning. Unfortunately my initial team overlooked some nodules that were on my lung and so they didn't even look into them. I had my lumpectomy and my surgeon the onc and radiologist all said not to worry about them and they just wanted to focus on the lump in Breast and to remove it. Had surgery after about 6 weeks which freaked me out that it took so long. After surgery I just didnt feel right and so I went for a second opinion. Found that they said absolutely have to check nodules so had a PET and of course cancer as well. So stayed with my new team who are 2hours away but totally worth it. I have been on a study trial since 11/25/13 which I did chemo weekly for 6 months and now am on a targeted therapy of a chemo drug every two weeks and a daily pill. So far I went from 5 nodules to 2 and 2 lymph nodes in chest to none. It's been a year and 4 months since started treatment and I have done pretty good actually and have worked most the time. I worked from home during the hard chemo but went back to work in May a few days a week and in July I was full time again except for every other Monday when I go for treatment. As part of the trial I have to have a CT scan every 8 weeks. My last one I had three weeks ago showed a lymph node behind my stomach that they want to look at so I have a PET scan on the 9th. I am new to this board but I have been on another board since my initial dx and the ladies there have been amazing and they are family to me. I have a strong Christian faith and this board is for women who are Christian and want to get and give prayer and support in their faith. It's easy to be fearful in our journeys but stay focused and positive. If you like you are welcome to PM me anytime. I am also opened to phone calls and texting for support so let me know. I in the early process of checking into applying for social security disability so hoping it goes well and just see what my options are. Beachbum what other boards would be good to check out? Have a blessed evening and restful sleep...Lucy.",

Dx in March that it is now in 2 lymph nodes one under collar bone and one in lower back area behind my stomach and in front of my back bone. Was on a Study Trial of Avastin and a pill Erlotiniib and before that it was Abraxane and Avastin. I am on Xeloda now since 4/13/15. I have my CT scan on 6/17 o see how its doing. I feel pretty good and strong so far. The se's have been a little brutal but manageable now that we have adjusted things a bit. We have to keep positive and keep fighting. I know I am expecting a miracle and I plan on shouting from the rooftops. I want to be able to say \"I am NED\"!!! I will say it!!! So hang in there and check back often. I wished more folks would post more, it sure would be helpful. Xavo, I agree about the biopsies. I had on on the lymph node underr collar bone to confirm and we went with that and didn't do the one on lower back. They said it would be a more invasive surgery and that it would be pretty certain if the one was positive it would be also as they showed up at the same time. I wished I knew more about how all this really works and why it shows up in places when there were no lymph nodes in my breast. So odd...and it took a second opinion after my lumpectomy for them to say \"what are the nodules on your lung?\" The first teams I went too said it was nothing to worry about that many people have nodules on their lungs. So they had me do a PET and low and behold...TN. Very frustrating and I am just glad we fouund out before I started any treatment Have a great day ladies...Lucy",

I will see if I can find out the website I ordered then. They have great scarfs too I have several to choose from in various colors. Rosie I had my port implanted a week before I started using it for treatment. It was more sore for me as they sent me away with no pain meds and said that Tylenol and ibuprofen should be fine. Well please make sure they have something for you because it was very bad pain for me as they had to really dig in the muscle to plant it. Now of course if they handnt perhaps the Tylenol and ibuprofen would have been ok. But I have learned now to hope for the best and plan for the worst I don't care how much it cost me after insurance. My lumpectomy was a piece of cake compared to the port. However I am so glad I have it and it has worked beautifully ever since. I have lost a lot of weight since I started this journey so you can see it more now but no biggie. Will be praying for clear data on the scans and no fear ok? So can you have eyebrows tattooed on while going through treatment? I have lost a little of my hair on this new drug but not much so I'm stoked about that. My eyebrows are pretty thin so what I have is not really much when I started out. Lol So does anyone know what the standard treatment is for TNBC? I have been on a couple of study trials and just hoping and praying it's my miracle I'm expecting. I have my treatment tomorrow then my week break WOO HOO!!! Have a relaxing rest of the night and a restful sleep. As Rosie stated, I'm glad you're all here too! Lucy ",

It doesn't state the lung as part of the mets so I was wondering if it was an oversight. I have mets to my lung.  I don't understand at all why there is a 2 year waiting period for medicare, that makes no sense at all.  The whole purpose is o get medical coverage during this time of SS disability. So what about obamacare?  They should have changed this policy during this major change on \"everyone should have medical\", right? Cat - I am glad your experience was fast with ss security, that is promising  I figured I would need a letter from my MO.  I don't think you need to wait a year to be off work.  I was told you can actually work but can't collect/earn more than $1,090.00 per month.  Which is great but I have to figure out what I need to do and how to go about it all.  I also found out that my 401k is open to me as well with a letter from my MO so that will be nice too.  I will have COBRA as an option as well for 18 months at least, then obamacare for the remaining 6 months before medicare would kick in.  I have some options with my employer hopefully so that will be good and my hope will be to talk with them in the next couple of weeks.  God willing... Well thank you so much for your input and advise.  I will share what I can and maybe help someone out here.  Thanks again...have a restful sleep...Lucy",

So for now the plan is I am off the study trial that I had been on. My MO says it's been really good for me and has done a great job but now it has failed and its time to move on to another treatment. She wants me to take a couple of weeks off to clear out system and is recommending a few options. One is Xeloda which is a pill. The other is Eribulin infusion chemo which is on a study trial as well. Anyone have experience with these? God will be with me on this journey too. It is discouraging I must admit and it makes me sad. We are going tomorrow for our camping trip and it is supposed to be a nice weekend...thank God! It will be nice to take a break for. My treatment and pills. But it will also be very odd to not have my pill to pray over. The doc said I can take 2 or 3 weeks and it would be fine and I will make a decision on what I need to do. I will be praying for God to give me wisdom and clarity in directing my decision. She gave me some info on the drugs and so I will be doing some reading after we get back on Sunday. I plan to spend some time this weekend connecting with my soul and spirit and getting back on track and grounded. Today was tough but I know it won't last long. I have to keep my eyes on God and stay focused and positive. Good nightLucy",

My job is a higher level management position and it can take a lot out of me and I really think it is time for me to cut back. My hope is to apply for disability by January so praying that will go well. Barb I am glad you're doing well on the xeloda. I did ok on it but it was hard on my feet and hands. They did lower the dose once but it still was so harsh for me. I have been off of it since July 16th and after 3 months and my poor feet still look sad. My hands are a lot better. I started a new phase II study trial and it is Eribulin weekly 3 weeks on 1 week off. Started it last week Monday and so far so good. The side effects are neuropathy of hands and feet (poor feet), possible hair thinning, possible low blood counts and possible nausea. They say possible because many of the patients on the trial are not experiencing them. I know a young gal who is 35 and has 4 kids who was dx a month ago with BC and she is leaning on doing all natural treatment. Starting to do the Gerson Therapy. She shared a lot of things with me and it all sounds interesting bad inviting but I have my reservations yet. I do use essential oils on the various pars of my body where they say there was and is cancer and I use a diffuser with the lavender oil at night when I sleep. I drink a lot of juices I make myself and eat organic. No dairy and little meat and when I do its organic chicken and wild caught salmon or halibut. There is so much out there and I really do feel that I am supposed to be on this journey with my current team. I am a Christian so I do believe in prayer and that God has lead me on this path Just wanted to share a little more about me and my journey and also put the topic of alternative medicine out there.

I was thinking about that this time around that I have had 5 different ones now and how bad that in itself is. I am thankful that I am still here after two years and will continue the fight. So here's a question for you...have you done research on any natural treatments? I know someone who is doing all treatment naturally and she has stage IV TNBC. She found out and they told her she had 6 months. It was in both breasts, chest, lungs and I'm sure more more but I stopped asking. She is doing the Gerson Therapy treatment. It's pretty extreme. Not sure how it's doing or if she has checked. She was already pretty extreme before the dx. She will be a year next month so she is surpassing what they told her. Makes me wonder sometimes. I know I really struggled at first because I always ate healthy and organic and exercised and then the dx. So much out there that's for sure. Blessings ladies...Lucy",

So he is taking oxycodone 15mg 4x a day and Gabapenten 300mg 4x a day. Sometimes it doesn't help so he has to really stay on top of it.

It did really well but then stopped after starting the pill portion of the study. Then I stopped that as it stopped working. Started on xeloda and was on that for 3 months and it didn't do too much so stopped it and now on a new trial with Eribulin 3 weeks on 1 week off.

However there are not too many ladies with TNBC and now that I am on my treatment I have some questions regarding Abraxane and Avastin that I am currently on and would like to talk with others regarding the SE. I have been doing Abraxane every Monday and Avastin every other Monday. So far everything has gone well and I have only had a few minor SE. On day 16 started losing hair and it is thinning pretty good now. Haven't taken the step to buzz it just yet. I praying it will just stop one day soon as I was told some women may just thin.  I have a little tingling at the tip of my tongue the day of treatment and last a day or two after. Constipation is the norm now but myralax and ducasate help along with diet. Blood tinged in my nose but I have saline spray and gel that helps that. Since my last treatment on the 23rd I have experienced a very slight headache, slight dizziness the first 2 days and tired today along with a slight pain/cramping in my tummy. I don't know if I just didn't drink enough water or what. I took a couple of tums last night as I woke a few times with what felt like heartburn. It seemed to help but has been present most of the day today. I will be calling my MO in the morning to find our more but thought I would put this out there and maybe get on this board with other women who are on the same drugs to gain knowledge of what to about some of the SE's that are starting to show up as I go deeper into treatment.  Also I am having neupogen shots on Tuesday and Wednesdays and I experience slight pain and more deeper pain later in the evening but Tylenol seems to work fine.  Hope everyone had a Merry Christmas and minimal SE's during the holiday.  Lucy",

Hope you are all doing well and se's are minimal to none.  Blessings Ladies...Lucy",

I have noticed after an hour or so of taking my pills I have a slight tingling in my hands and fingers but it goes away after a couple of hours. I have to keep my hands and feet moisturizer at all times to lessen the soreness. On occasion I have noticed that if I wait too long to at or drink I get a little queasy. Not really nausea to where I feel like throwing up but just queasy. So I have a light snack and drink a bit and then I am good. So they said to eat something light every couple of hours so that has helped. Sometimes just water is good enough. Have had some fatigue off and on as well. On day 2 I had a couple of mouth sores but did the rinse with salt water all day and the next morning they were gone. Had a good appt today for my followup after a week. So we shall see what week 2 holds in store. That's great you have a trial to participate in. I just got off one as they found two lymph nodes with the stupid disease. So off the trial and waited two weeks for a washout then started the Xeloda. I had a choice of another trial with one drug but it was a weekly treatment and I was just needing a break from the past year and a half so I chose the pill. The MO said they were both good choices and neither was a better choice than the other. So maybe we could talk on the phone sometime. I would love to hear more about your journey. It is too bad there is not much activity on the board. We'll have a great rest of day and week if I don't hear from you. Lucy. ",

Lana, sorry to hear of your confirmation...shoot!  I am on Xeloda as well and have been since April 13th.  It is my 3rd treatment since my dx 8/13.  I am still fighting and will continue to as I intend to be the poster child for the miracle I am expecting.  Let me know if you would like any details or chat.  Send me a private message and maybe we can exchange numbers.  I would love to chat. Have a great night ladies and thanks for responding.  Lucy",

My feet were so burned as basically it is a burn from the inside out. They were so bad after the first week on it that they had to lower the dose. They were all but blistered. For two days it was like walking on glass until they lowered it. After thatched pain was less but still very irritated and red and peeling. My hands didn't get as bad. But the other thing was the pigment of my skin on hands and feet were dark brown. They all looked just awful. Off it now as it didn't do much for me. Onto something different now since the 13th. How long have you been on it?  Lucy.",

Just had my 23 yr anniversary. It's been a great place. I have been very blessed as well with all my treatments. The last one I had the xeloda was the worst as it affected my hands and feet. It was horrible but was only on it for 3 months and it didn't do enough so the onc switched me to another. I am doing a study trial now. I truly want to find my miracle. So have you had surgery to remove any of the Mets? My onc has said if it's not causing problems or discomfort she doesn't want to operate to remove them from my lungs. I have 2 lymph nodes one in my collar bone and one between my lower back and stomach. I have cut back my hours to 8 now and planning to go to half time by end of the year. I'm actually doing some research on applying for disability. I actually feel really good and strong. I too eat very healthy wholefoods and organic. When we go out I always order a salad. I only eat chicken or turkey. I eat very little carbs but do have a little fruit. Mostly blueberries in my protein (plant based) shake and strawberries. No dairy and on occasion I eat a low sugar (naturally) treat. My treatment I am on now I started on the 13th and it is weekly on Mondays. 3 weeks on and 1 week off. The se are fatigue possible neuropathy in hands and feet hair thinning and when I went I this week for my 3rd infusion my counts were low so they didn't do it. Instead I got a neupogen shot and another on Tuesday. So I go back on Monday and hopefully will be ok to have it. My onc also said she was going to lower the dose because she didn't want my counts to drop. She said it was still plenty of drug to be administered. I have done well so far on it and have felt strong for the most part. The fatigue has been totally manageable and I have increased my protein as well. I exercise daily at curves but my onc has me down to 3 days as I was losing more weight. I have lost a total of 51 lbs since my dx last August. Wow it will be 2 years on 8/8. Well hope you have a great rest of the week. Stay strong. Thanks for posting too really is nice to have some consistant chatting. Have a good one...Lucy",

Have to keep that in mind if I loose mine again. My treatment now is ok and not loosing hair. I did a little during first cycle but just finished second cycle and no more loss so they told me yesterday I am where I will probably be now. So that made me happy. But as we know we will always be on something so I may not be so lucky next time lol. Rosie...praying your scans turn out awesome and you can get past the worry and concern. I know we always try not to worry but we are human and still do. I just always pray the whole time and leave it in Gods hands. As for alternative treatments, that has been high on my radar recently as I have a dear friend who went to school with my DD and she was dx 2 months ago and she has decided not to so chemo or rads and instead is going with a clinic that is gerson certified and is doing their therapy. She is scheduled for surgery to remove tumor in a couple of weeks. She is doing lots of juicing and coffee enamas and taking various supplements. She does not have TNBC but she has an aggressive form of her type. She is 35 and has 4 kids and is a stay at home mom and does home school and has always eaten healthy and she just can't bring herself to do chemo. I know what she is going through as it was the hardest thing for me too. I have always eaten healthy and exercised and I eat organic. But I just didn't feel like I wanted to take a chance with this type of cancer. I am currently using a lot of essential oils now so that is really all I am doing differently I am considering using cbd hemp oil, indole-3-carbinol, EGCG, and increasing my vit D to a larger amount than the 6k I am on now. I need to get this all approved by my onc first. These are the supplements she is on and so I figured I can ask Have a blessed day warriors...chat soon...Lucy!   ",

Now we are dealing with him being dx with pancreatic cancer that has mets to the liver and stomach lining (small spots). Just amazing that this is all happening right now along with my dx from 2 years ago. So I was on Xeloda and had to come off as it was so hard on my feet. They were like on fire by end of 2 months. They looked like they were burned and it was hard to walk on them. They lowered the dose and it got a little better but after a scan it didn't do a thing so they took me off did a wash out and I am on Eribulin now and have been for 3 cycles. SE's are more fatigue and my appetite is challenged. No issues with neuropathy on my hands and feet as of yet. Glad to hear the news Barbar...I hope to hear NED. I just had scans yesterday so praying it is working. Stay strong ladies...We got this, right? Lucy",
