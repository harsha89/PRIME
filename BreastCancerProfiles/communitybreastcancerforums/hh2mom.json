I have been stage 4 for 3 years and counting. In fact, we just told our girls last week. I will tell you that our decision to keep it from them for a few years was not without controversy, but it worked for us. I think I put it off for so long because I just couldn't do it. We don't want to cause our children fear, we as their mothers make their worries go away. It is so unfair, but I can tell by your posting that you are going to make it. I told my girls, Hannah and Haley, that I am not dying of cancer, but I am living with cancer. My prayers are with you. I am sorry that you have to go through this.",
