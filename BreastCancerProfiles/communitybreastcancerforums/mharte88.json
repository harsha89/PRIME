I was hoping to learn from the Group more about what happens after radiation? I too felt pressured onto Radio Therapy, I argued and stated my case (living independently and happily on my own). But my girls, 40 and 45 were so worried that I would not have \"peace of mind\" if I didn't go through with it, in the end I had 15 fractions over 4 weeks, which as I am left side lumpectomy, this included respitory gating every session. The idea it could harm your heart, terrified me, but it seemed as though, the that consulting room that day, it was only me that took that view. Together with other damaging effects some not until way after ie: lungs, bone loss and extreme cases cancer? I thought, walk away from it. When it returns (right breast maybe) go for gold. I did say I wanted to remove the cancerous breast, but it was estrogen fed, and as I was on HRT (for migraines). which I had to stop dead with (rather like coming of crack I would say), I could not see how or why it would return. My operation was 4th July 2018, followed by RT, four weeks. but now its like - well your on your own love.!! So its why I turned to this Forum, it seemed friendly and nice and what I read, I could relate to. The RT was a breeze, but four weeks on, I have had to giggle my anti-depressants, and most other things that are important to me, like wanting my flat to look clean and tidy. I just do not have the energy. Rather like your batteries simply \"run out!. You have no choice you have to lie down. A much smaller breast now too, as I should imagine it was swollen before. I am fine about that though. Mainly too, I wanted to give input so I could at least share the up side of my experience, which is positive, sorry, I appreciate it doesn't sound that way. Its because no-one gives a straight answer - like, how long does the RT stay in your system. I have this \"air balloon\" situation going on, just expel air the minute my toes touch the floor in the morning? So its not \"popping\" as my grandchildren call it. Nothing to do with \"wind\" as we know it, just all this \"air\". So I imagine I still have not lost the RT. I wanted to know, as then I have a set goal to work towards in order to try and get my life back. But apparently everyone is different etc., etc., so here I am posting on this lovely site. Thank you for reading this Molly, mummy to Milly, my little ginger girl pussycat who is 3 years old and the light of my life. :)   ",
