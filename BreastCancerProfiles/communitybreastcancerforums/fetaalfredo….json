Because I have other chronic disease issues---asthma & celiac disease the thought of needing chemo has been unbearable. I have a 9 year old & own a business so am wondering how debilitating this will be & what days will be the worst post infusion. I am normally a very active person & need to exercise to control my asthma.I guess from what I am reading each person handles this differently. The first medical oncologist I saw seemed to indicate that \"working \" women can have chemo on a Friday, recover on the weekend & resume their regular lives come Mon. This sounds very unrealistic to me??? Please help.",
