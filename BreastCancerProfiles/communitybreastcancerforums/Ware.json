I have NEVER wanted a tattoo, ever, but for some reason I'm good with the scar tattoo. If I get one I want it to be gerber daisies. My father died from cancer 5 years ago and I brought home a vase of gerber daisies from the funeral. They were my inspiration for my wedding invitations that I made. I think a Gerber daisy tattoo will be a memorial for my father and a celebration for my marriage and will always be with me. On a health note, feeling good today. Bone pain in the middle of the night last night but nothing that ibuprofen couldn't take care of.",

So I expect by this time next week it will be pretty much gone. I didn't seem to get as tired or woozy during today's treatment as last weeks. Maybe my body is figuring out how to handle all the pre chemo meds. My wbc count is back up. Thankfully. All other blood work looked good too. I hope everyone has similar easy ride as I've had (so far). I'm sorry to hear of all of the different side effects you all are experiencing. The cancer center I go to is a long room with chairs next to each other and about 5 semi private rooms if wanted. I stayed out with the \"general population\" today. Ended up sitting next to my daughter's ex/soon to be ex boyfriend's (17 and has distanced herself from him since he left for college. She says she's done with him. Time will tell) aunt and uncle. Small world. I can order as much as I want from the hospital cafeteria for free. Warm blankets available and water available. Tv for each chair available and free wi-fi.

New Year's Eve will be one heck of a celebration night! I felt sick during this round. I felt that I could vomit at any moment. I didn't but, wth? It wasn't even with the chemo but with the pre meds. Good luck to everyone who is on this ride with me. I don't like it very much but at least we all have good company.",

So far, zero SE except steroid energy boost (not such a bad thing, got the tree up last night). 2 more to go and done with chemo! I've not used any compazine either which is great because blah. Waiting for the aches and pains I seem to get a couple of days out from the neulasta. On a down note, one of my dogs has diarrhea. He has had it since sat night. He was eating up til yesterday but not today. We are going to the vet today. I'm very worried about him. I hope it's nothing too serious. Happy Thanksgiving my warrior friends! Enjoy this holiday with your family and friends. Put cancer out of your mind and just enjoy the here and now. I know I will be doing some mind work...",
