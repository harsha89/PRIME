From my first mammogram to the day of my mastectomy was about three weeks, so this sounds like an very long time to wait to me. Is there anyway you can call and try to get in sooner? My onco has a very busy practice. Occasionally, I will have to call daily to try to schedule my appointment sooner to keep it around the three month mark. I'm just wondering if something like this would work?",

My hair was VERY slow growing until I stopped the Herceptin treatments. It's growing like a weed now! :) I have had it trimmed several times to keep it looking like an intentional pixie, but am now growing it out and it's making me a little crazy at the moment. I try to focus on fact that I would have done anything for crazy hair a year ago.",
