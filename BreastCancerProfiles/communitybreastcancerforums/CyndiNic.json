I started about 10 days ago noticing a sharp tightening just under me breast when I rolled onto my stomach at night. Nothing visible but I did mention it to my MO last Wednesday. At that point I didn't have any visible signs just the pain. Last night I noticed and felt a line down my abdomen. Fortunately I am back in the chemo chair today so I see my RO. As of right now this is the only indication I have of something being off. Thanks!",

Trying to keep it all in perspective knowing that it will be an overall easier surgery with none of the prep (guide wires and dye injection) - but definitely not the news I wanted. Port goes in on the 20th so I'll be ready for chemo - then radiation in 2016. Never in a million years did I think my first ever baseline mammogram would lead to all of this. Crazy to think prior to this I only visited my doctor once a year. It's so nice to have this forum of incredible women - this site has been a wealth of information!",
