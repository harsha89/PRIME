    "Content": "Denise0704 wrote: Hi Everyone, I was diagnosed with Stage IIB, Grade 3 cells, PR+ ER+ HER- Invasive Ductal Carcinoma in May 2016. I had 2 rounds of chemotherapy followed by a lumpectomy and radiation. There was a small tumor in my right breast and a 2mm tumor in my lymph node. My tumor in my breast shrunk 90% after chemo and no trace of tumor in my lymph nodes after chemo. I wouldn't worry as much if my cells weren't Grade 3. Is Grade 3 the most aggressive form of breast cancer? Is it common to have grade 3 cells? Does anyone have Grade 1 cells. I've only come across Grade 2 and Grade 3 cells so far. Does anyone have a success story with Grade 3 cells they could share. I have a friend who had Stage 1 breast cancer while I was doing my chemo therapy. She is now dealing with a reoccurrence in her liver. How can it go from Stage 1 to Stage 4 in less than a year? Log in to post a reply",
