From what I read I will need chemo. I see medical oncologist 11/16. Ten years ago I had DCIS and radiation. Then I now have this invasive stuff on the same side. In the process I was tested and am BRCA2 positive. Sept 16 I had a hysterectomy and ovarie removal. Then 9/28 I had BMX with immediate reconstruction. My abdomen is still not healing right. In fact I go back to plastics this afternoon. Now, to find out chemo too. I am scared of all the side affects. Losing my hair will suck, but that's not even my concern.its all the other stuff. Also, every time I have surgery it takes at least five people and multiple pokes to get a good IV. BTW, I'm 45 years old, and two college aged sons, and married.
