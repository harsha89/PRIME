The Lord has everything planned for us. We don't know why we get this stuff and we are tested, I would guess, on how we handle this. Pray for Strength, wisdom, and energy! We are not being punished by any means- it's not you, I don't know the answer for that one. hey, I just got done reading some pretty depressing stuff about Triple negatives, that is what I was or am. You know, we all have enough to worry about, without this. I'm still trying to figure this all out. I was kicking ass and taking names with my business and then boom this. I'm a total control freak, and this was VERRRRRY hard for me. I didn't know how to handle the public image, I didn't know how to tell my family and friends, and most of all I didn't want to be out of the picture or helpless. I made my mind up that I wasn't going to let this get the best of me- it's hard, and I still get down and Bitchy- not just orney, I have to get back in focus and think of what's important in my life and who is there for me. I do sleep better at night with my Faith. I'm sure you've heard this one, but it really does help and The Lord wouldn't put anything on us that we can't handle. Remember, he can do anything. He is the great healer!",
