She found a lump size of jellybean at 3:00 left breast. This pain is very sharp. She ordered a mammogram and ultrasound. I'm high risk, I also had brca testing in nov 2015. Came back normal, but dralso tod me then that doesn't really matter. So I had 3D mammogram/ultrasound yesterday 7/17/17. After dr in image center reviewed my images, he wants me to have an MRI. I was really hoping today they were going to tell me it was a cyst. Im staying postive, I can't change what it is I can only change the way I react. I'm not going to lie, I'm very scared. Im only 38!
