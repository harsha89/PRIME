I didn\u2019t have Chemo as my Oncotype score was only 10 so was told that Chemo would not be effective. I did have rads and finished in Dec. I got a letter about the trial just before Christmas but asked for sometime to think about it so disnt have the initial meeting until the end of Jan. Starting the trial tomorrow with mixed feelings but being told you are high risk after getting low Oncotype score was pretty scary and enough to convince me that I have little choice. Going to London in a weeks time for a second opinion from another Prof",

I was also hoping that I would be randomised not to take the drug and then at least I could feel that I hadn't turned it down ! Your answer has given me more confidence to start the trial. How long have you been on it for ? I am going to see my Prof on Tuesday and then to get a second opinion on the week after. I will let you know how I get on Thanks for your help",

I haven\u2019t heard that this could be because I am progesterone negative but I will ask the Prof about this. Will post when I have had my second opinion It is good that you are happy to be in the trial and that also gives others confidence.",

I had a low Oncotype score of 10 following a mastectomy for a Stage 3 cancer which was a large tumour with one lympnode involved with macro 1 micro. I am confused as I have a low oncotype that puts me in the low risk category but a large tumour and some lymph node involvement which makes me high risk. I feel really unsure as to whether this is the right thing for me to do or not. I am going to start on the trial but I am also going to visit another hospital privately to discuss whether this is the right course of action for me. This is the second time I have had cancer and I think that I might be a DES daughter ( a drug that I think may have been taken by my Mother to prevent miscarriage when I was conceived ) which heightens the risk of breast cancer Has anyone got any advice or comments. ?",
