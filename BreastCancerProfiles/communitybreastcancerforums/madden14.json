I have to go back in February for another check up, can anyone tell me what they think this could be and should i try and see someone sooner? Sorry to bother everyone, just confused and worried.

After worrying and waiting for two weeks went back yesterday for results, was seen by the consultant who said the scan did not really show much and the FNA was benign, but i just dont feel convinced. I am 26 and felt a little like i was wasting their time, the consultant did not tell me what it might have been or anything, i have to go back in feb but dont understand why if he said it is fine? Sorry to bother you all, but i feel like instead of feeling relieved i have been left feeling scared and confused. Log in to post a reply",
