The CT scan showed a brand new 25mm nodule on the left lung ( happens to be the side of the original breast cancer). The last scan was three months ago and there was nothing there and my Oncologist whom I only been with for a year thinks that this thing could have grown that big in three months.. I am so confused and upset as to how something like this could even be possible? Could it grow so freakishly large in only three months? Currently I am on TDM1 and there was no progression in any other areas, except for this mass on the lung. My gut is telling me that this could be possibly of an inflammatory nature and not necessarily malignant ( I was very sick with the flu and cough on the day I took the scan and was even apprehensive about going on that day). Obviously, the only way to really find 100% is to do a biopsy. Has anyone ever found themselves in a similar predicament? Feed back would be appreciated Thanks",

I wish I was a scientist so I could cure cancer for everyone! The Onc did look at the previous scan and said nothing was there and, when i read the reports it did not mention it either. I'm waiting to get the CD's of the images so I can look at it myself and see if something was missed. Possibly even take these to the Pulminologist ASAP. My tumor marker was also 15 at the time and up to this point it's been a pretty good indication of disease progression...and this is definitely puzzling as well. How can there be a new activity without the tumor marker rising? I know that some doctors don't use tumor markers because they think it's not all that reliable and it can have mixed results for some people. Maybe for me this is NOW the case where it did a 360, although like i said up until now it was a good indicator. Weird.. I definitely feel a bit overwhelmed because my gut is telling me to go against what the Onco is saying but at this point something has to happen.  Peace and Love :) Izabella",

I scheduled a \"second opinion\" with my old Oncologist whom I was with for 4 years before I moved out to the burbs and am hoping that she will help me understand this better. I'm hoping she will approach this in a different way..so maybe biopsy this first and find out if the Taxotere+Herceptin+Perjeta is necessary or could we do xeloda+TYkerb combo instead.. Thanks for responding",
