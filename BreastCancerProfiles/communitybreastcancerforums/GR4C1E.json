I don't really notice it most of the time. I have some recurring aches and pains from chemo that (so they tell me) will lessen over time, but I have no residual pain from the BMX. I do, however, have two lovely new foobs that look fantastic in a little black cocktail dress.",

How easy or hard was it to make the transition and say \"enough!\" I don't care what people think! I feel like I'm wearing this thing to make other people comfortable around me. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice wig, but it's cut in a chin length bob, medium brown with lovely muted redish and gold streaks. My new and much appreciated hair growth is 11 weeks PFC and looks a lot like the awesome photo posted by tisthyme. It's also very gray with silver sparkles! So the difference is dramatic. I don't wear the wig at all around home or around town, but I do wear it for work. I'm actually dreading the day I go topless in a professional setting. I actually think I look cute, but I think my anxiety stems from a coworker who saw my hair while I was making some adjustments in the ladies room. She made a comment that I should be ready to ditch the wig in another couple of MONTHS. Months? I was thinking weeks. It really shook me up when she said that. Especially since she's also a BC survivor.",

I underestimated them and I'm so happy for being so wrong.",

I think it's actually fascinating that strangers are very kind and accepting of my appearance and people I know can be insensitive. You're absolutely right, it is up to me. I have an appt with my oncologist next week. Before the ladies room incident, I was planning on asking him when I could possibly use a non-amonia rinse and beef up the color a bit. I like the silver bits and I think a darker salt and pepper look would make me feel a little more confident. I'm giving it two weeks tops, and I'm ditching the wig. Besides, having hair is not a job requirement and I have more hair than most of the men I work with!",

So, I had been going topless for about three weeks, when finally, we crossed paths. He asked for my assistance on a project and I agreed to meet him to discuss. As we were walking towards eachother he asked me to stop. I obliged. He said; \"What's going on here? You cut your hair! Turn around for me. I'm deciding whether I like it or not.\" So, I stopped and twirled. After my spin, I said; \"I didn't cut my hair. It fell out after my first round of chemo. How do you like it now?\"",
