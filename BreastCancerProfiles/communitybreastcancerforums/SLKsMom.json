I'm 7.5 months PFC and my hair, leg hair, and other areas are growing as normal. But, I literally have no underarm growth. Not complaining, but just find it odd. I didn't have radiation, only chemo. Anyone else experience this?",

It's very light and appears as slight peach fuzz when I get it at the right light and angle in the mirror. :-) My question is: when will that obvious growth spurt start? I'm taking biotin and using Nioxin. All so weird since before bc, I had the hair that all my friends and family envied. Long, thick, and easily maintained. Never fully colored it - but did highlight twice a year. It was definitely my identity. Oh, to be normal again. :) Thank you! Shannon",
