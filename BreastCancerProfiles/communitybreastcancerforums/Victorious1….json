My oncologist's nurse suggested using tea tree oil (melaleuca) which I had just picked up for a friend at the local health foods store. It said on the label not to apply it directly to the skin, so I put about 10-12 drops of itÂ in a container of very warm water and soaked my fingernails and toenails until the water wasn't warm any longer. It really helped the soreness not be so bad. My fingernails and my baby toenails are essentially back to normal (4 months after the last dose of Taxol), but my big toenails still look awful (right worse than left). My oncologist said I might still lose them, but I sure hope not. I can see just a sliver of new nail on each of them, so I suspect it will take a while to be fully repaired, but at least the nail beds aren't sore anymore!",
