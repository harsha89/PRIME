You might also want to have a skin punch biopsy done along with the core biopsy.  Peace and health to you,   Tami",

Just know that chemo is not mandatory, there are a lot of different factors that play into it.  There is a thread on here called \"bottle o' tamoxifen\" that has a lot of good info. Tami",

(having a baby etc).  Hang in there and read all you can on these boards-(there is a thread about radiation) you will learn a ton.  Tami         Oh yeah, the  boosts usually come at the very end of treatment (like the last five days) boosts just treat the place you had your lump taken out.)",

I was so angry by the time I got out of there.  And to top it all off when I went 3 weeks later to have the blue dye shot into me before surgery- guess who walked in the door to do it!!??? The same Dr. that about killled me before!  It was awful.  When I had my MRI I couldnt' get a breath in because it was so tight, so they pulled me out and took all the padding off (that was comfortable) and then we did it.   I was really sore by the time I was done. (arms above head is hard for just 2 minutes, let alone 60!).  Any way if one more man says \"put your breast through this hole\" I am going to kick him somewhere he will need an MRI to figure out how to fix it!  Tami",

(correct me if I am wrong)- If  you are scared of incisional biopsy (like I was- it just didn't make sense to do a surgery and then have to do ANOTHER if it was cancer!)  DEMAND a core needle biopsy.  I did and got my way. You are awake the whole time and they just numb your breast.  The Doc I was going to had never heard of that so that was a BIG clue that I needed a new GYN.  I accidentally found it on the internet.  I think the confusion is between the punch biopsy and the core needle biopsy.  Punch biopsy does only take a few layers of skin- core needle biopsy can go as deep as needed and \"Grabs\" a sample of tissue.  It is your breast and your choice.  Do some more research and ask lots of questions here.  Peace to you- Tami",

Spread the word to everyone you know that he is not a good surgeon if that is how you feel.  soft hugs, hang in girl, Tami",
