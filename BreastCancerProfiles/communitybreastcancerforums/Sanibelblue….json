I don't tell people what stage I am be wise they would freak out or it would be too hard to explain. They just put up big flat screen tvs on the walls in one waiting room & the infusion room. To me they are annoying. They keep it on silent with texting on. I try to find a seat in the middle away from the tvs. There was once a couple that came in & the wife would bring him a cooler of food & wait on him. Once their 2 sons came & it was like a party just for them. I was not feeling well & just wanted to rest & I quietly called a nurse over & asked if she could talk to them to quiet them down. They obliged quietly & they haven't had any parties since. I don't mind chatting but I'd rather sit there quietly & rest or sleep.",
