      "Content": "DaisyK wrote: I was diagnosed in March with Invasive ductal breast cancer. Estrogen and progesterone positive, Her 2 negative.  I have a large tumor approximately 4 5/8 cm and at least one lymph node involvement-the node was biopsied along with the tumor. I'm currently waiting for genetics testing to come back. Two of my sisters had breast cancer, one is fine now, the other died from ovarian cancer 20 years after the breast diagnosis. So family history is strong. Both my sisters were pre-menopausal. I am 57 and post. I thought I had dodged it.  If I test positive for BRCA, the surgeon recommends bilateral mastectomy. I'm hoping it's negative. Anyway, the oncologist is setting me up for neoadjuvant chemo. She feels if we do the chemo first, there is a possibility the surgeon wouldn't have to take the entire axillary area. But in the same breath, she has said that my cancer is 80 percent estrogen based which responds less to chemo than the negative hormone type. But it sounded like an ok plan until I googled and found articles that stated evidence of neoadjuvant chemo fueling metastasis. It was only one study, but it spooked me. Anyone else have chemo before surgery? I am also somewhat concerned with being in a weakened state after chemo and then having surgery. Oh, the oncologist also said that if my tumor shows any sign of growth during chemo that we would schedule surgery straight away. So they will keep an eye on it. Thanks in advance for any input!

I had a meeting with the oncology nurse at the hospital today and I'm feeling better about the treatment plan. Again, thank you all so much for the input, I really appreciate it. ",
