Sigh, yet another daily reminder, but i am glad I am not crazy as you all have experienced this too.    ",

I had a mastectomy and TRAM reconstruction on Jun2, had emergency surgery the next day for bleeding, and required two units of blood. I never felt so weak, and experienced the same total exhaustion you did 10 days later. Fluid retention and constipation followed. A full six weeks later  I am still recovering, only to start chemo this week!  but can thoroughly emphasize with you and send tons of  positive energy your way.  I hope you will report in soon to tell  us all you are feeling better. hugs, Gail",
