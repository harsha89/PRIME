My situation is that I'm about to have a lumpectomy (will reduce my breast by about one quarter) and a Sentinel Node Biopsy.   She wants me to do rads afterwards and said that it meant I couldn't do any reconstructive surgeon afterwards.   But I would like symmetry if at all possible. I understand her position because I'm Stage IV with bone mets and she (and I) really want to get all the cancer out (2.4 lump with calcifications).  Although my PETSCAN/CT shows the cancer in the breast and nodes is \"dead\" or dormant.   I also want a quality of life while I'm still around and I have had a terrible history of reacting to the initial radiation(to spine), chemo, the Aromatase Inhibitors and other meds.  I also react to anesthesia.  (the reactions are very severe and I'm in bed most of the time for the past 7 months). Any input from you all?  I'd really appreciate it. much love, Christine love, blessings and peace! Dx 11/28/2008, IDC, 2cm, Stage IV, Grade 2, 2/4 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

The good news is my cancer is much better and only dealing with the mets - but I can't imagine trying any more treatments as I haven't been able to do anything on my own for 6 months (people come in and help me everyday, can't drive, walk much, etc.).  I have no quality of life (except in my heart when I conjure it up).  My doctor is a bit baffled by how reactive my body is. I have yet to read if anyone else has the same problem - are you out there and can you share with me your experiences.  I'm about to change meds once again (maybe Aromasin) and I feel pretty hopeless about my level of sensitivity as this stuff is all very caustic. If anyone has anything to offer, good or bad, please reply. thanks, you all are wonderful Christine love, blessings and peace!
