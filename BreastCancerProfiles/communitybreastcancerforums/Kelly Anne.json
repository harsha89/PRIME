Im just going to need to keep my chin up and plod along. It helps to find others with similar struggles. Today\u2019s adventure is soup. My sister brought a frozen batch before my first treatment and it was all I ate for days. Today I make my own to get ready for round 2 next week. Simple recipe: Organic Chicken, celery, onions and garlic. Cook overnight and voila something yummy to eat.",

I had a lumpectomy, but the tumour had grown significantly since the ultrasound 3 weeks earlier. Removed a 56mm tumour. The breast looks better than I expected, but it is still really sore. Im just at 3 months since surgery and am wondering how long it is likely to ache for. I hate to ask/complain to the Dr. I wanted to keep the breast, now complaining seems ungrateful. Anyone have a larger lumpectomy with lingering soreness?",

Only recommendation I have is to hold tight and bring someone you can lean on tomorrow. It is hard to listed to simple instructions when you are there. I just received my first chemo this week after surgery late July. I'm still scared, but it is going well. Of course I'm up early cause I need the throne (yippie - constipation got me yesterday). Have some time to yourself in the sun today to keep the spirits up.  ",
