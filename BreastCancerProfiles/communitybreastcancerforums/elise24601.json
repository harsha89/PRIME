Went to GP and had an xray, am waiting for results. I've gone straight to worse-case scenario (bone mets on spine/pelvis) since I'm so high risk! Questions, feel free to answer whichever ones you have experience with: 1. Can an xray detect or rule out bone mets or do I *need* MRI? If I need the MRI, can I be fully sedated (due to anxiety/claustrophobia?) 2. Will my bone biopsy (if needed) be painful? 3. How often do patients end up getting benign biopsy results and false positives on scans? 4. If I'm Stage IV, is it irresponsible of me to rescue a pet?

I want to be on board with this outlook, and I know he's a good doctor (at UCLA, been practicing for 30 years) but with stage 3, grade 3, multifocal, and initial node involvement, I can't seem to get into that headspace. I've read all the horror stories about mets, and the stats on my type of cancer and young women with BC, which makes me feel vulnerable like I won't live to see 40. For some reason, all the bad info online feels more \"real\" than my doctor's positivity. Does that make sense? He obviously knows all of the numbers too, so I don't get why he's so omptimstic.

      "Content": "elise24601 wrote: Something I've learned about MBC is that there seems to be a huge variety of patient experience and outcome. For instance, some women seem to blow through treatments quickly and die within a year or two. Many others stay stable for years without changing treatments, and tolerate the meds well. Others last even longer, but will take many different med combos and switches to get there. Besides the obvious factors like tumor receptors and location of mets (bone only vs organ), is there any pattern or rhyme or reason to this? Any way to predict who will end up in liver failure in 5 months vs who will get 5 years out of Ibrance or whatever? Does the initial tumor burden (size/number of mets?) have anything to do with this? It just seems so random, and that's hard for me to process as a newly Stage IV patient - mostly because, at my young age (34) I can't really live \"one day at a time\" - I want a sense of what the next few years will look like, in terms of making career and relationship and housing decisions. There are things that only make sense to do (adopt a pet, start a creative project, move to a new city, break up with someone and date again, etc) if I have some sort of handle on my projected lifespan.

      "Content": "elise24601 wrote: Hi, I tragically just progressed to Stage IV after a lytic lesion was discovered in my distal femur. It's too small and in the wrong spot to biopsy, so my onc is assuming the receptors have not changed since my original dx (hormone positive, her2 negative), and treating it as such. Now, I have some questions. First, it appears I have a few treatment options to start with: one of the Ibrance-family of cdk4/6 drugs, a parp-inhibitor like Lynparza, or Faslodex along with my Arimidex and Lupron. Is there a smart strategy here in terms of choosing which to begin with, since we all know I will eventually become resistant and progress no matter what? Have researchers discovered that going in a certain order can prolong survival, or is it just a guess? Second and relatedly, is it true that each line of treatment will be effective for fewer and fewer months as we go down the list? (In other words, the earlier ones will work for longer and towards the end I'll blow through them quickly)? I've read this fact before, but wanted to see if it corresponds to the experiences of people here. Third, I know lots of people like to get Foundation One (and similar) testing done on their tumors, but if mine cannot be safely biopsied, what are my options? Can blood tests work for this, since I probably have circulating tumor cells? Or is this something to be done later when I have bigger masses and fewer treatment choices?
