I went to India (New Delhi) from USA to support her financially, and she came from East Africa, I could not bring her to USA because of visa issues and the processing time. It has been 7 months now in India Apollo Hospital and things are going wrong and I am very frustrated I feel I am in a dark. Her Med/surg. Onc decided to give her Taxol (100 mg) and Herceptin (110mg) every week before surgery, they said to shrink the tumor because it was big. After taking 4 cycle of Taxol and 7 cycle of Herceptin, her white blood cells drops very low even after given the injection to boost the white blood cells. The Surgeon decided to do surgery and she had the surgery (mastectomy on her right side). The pathology report shows ER/PR+ and HER2+++ so the doctor decided to continue with Herceptin and Taxol every week. Bad news. One week before she completed her cycles she has two lumps on her right armpit where she had the surgery, and we decided to do bone scan, Pet scan and cat scan; bone scan and cat scan showed bone mets + the lumps she had on her armpit, but pet scan only showed the lumps on her armpit. I was devastated, and did not know how to tell my little sister, finally I told her the truth and I cannot tell you how devastated she is. Now the strange thing is onc. Surgeon took out the lumps and the pathology report shows different when it comes to ER. Previously it was ER/PR+ HER2+++, but now she is ER-(negative) PR+ HER2+++. Could the pathologist make mistake on the previous one or may be on the recent one? This is bad; she already took a lot of chemo. What are her options now? Does this mean Herceptin failed to work on my sister. We talked about hormone therapy but with ER- it will only respond 30% they said. Some one I need you help if you can as soon as possible. I would never wish the darkness I am feeling right now to anybody. Please do it for my sister. Sol",
