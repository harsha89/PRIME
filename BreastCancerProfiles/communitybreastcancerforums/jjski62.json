I was stage 4 off the bat, and because I am not outwardly sick, I only chose to tell immediate family and closest of friends my diagnosis, asking them to keep the info confidential, as I am a private person to begin with. At this point I'm happy with that decision. It allows me to interact with people and not be viewed as the cancer patient before I absolutely have to be. It's a comforting diversion to go out and be viewed as \"normal\" when a lot of my days are spent obsessing over this disease. When I do need to confide, those close family members and friends arethe only people I would want to talk to anyway.",

I have learned for the most part to live with this nightmare (I will never call it a journey). I think it took a good 5 months for things to calm down for me, when I wasn't consumed with unending tests, appointments, radiation, hospitalization etc. When the cancer runs became less and I started feeling better, I was able to focus more on everyday living. I asked for an antidepressant from the start and that helped. I remember reading others say it gets better with time. I found it to be true even though I thought I'd never feel that way. It's okay to have these roller coaster of emotions, but as time goes by it does get easier to cope with the diagnosis and you find yourself on the roller coaster less.

It is so important to have confidence in your team and feel that you are in the best possible hands and you are doing that. I know delays can be nerve racking, and I've experienced some myself, especially in the beginning, but things should get into a rhythm with your new health care team shortly and you will have peace of mind. I made some insurance changes at the beginning of my treatment from an HMO to a PPO because of all the extra steps I had to take with the HMO, like referrals and things. You just don't realize how important good insurance, doctors, and top notch treatment centers are until you are battling serious illness. Good luck with your treatments.  Joanne ",
