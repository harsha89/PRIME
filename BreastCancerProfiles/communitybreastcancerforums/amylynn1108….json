I am not giving up on this site as I have found stories and threads to be very helpful. I am an extreme worrier, and was scared to death of my 2nd chemo (which I did get on Thursday). I will take all of your advice and find threads to join rather than make my own. I was not aware how the site worked best. I do appreciate everyone for reaching out and helping me figure this out. You are all an amazing group of women and even though I am sorry that we all have to join this board, I am glad that we have each other.",
