I know I was someone who didnt want to see reports or scans for the first 6 months. I only recently asked for copies. We are all different, but do it if you are ready. In Australia PET's are not routine in the public health system. They wont give me one. My oncs relied on a bone scan, a CT, and finally a spinal MRI to give me a stage IV diagnosis. They wont do a bone biopsy either. They were going to, on my rib, but the angle they were to go in on to hit it was too dangerous....thats what they said anyway. Dont knock yourself for not having all the info yet, though it is good to become more proactive in treatment discussions and more informed on options and our own pathology, it takes a little time to get your head around it all, but as CB said, we are here to help work through it with you if you want. Im wondering if you have been given treatment similar to an earlier stage BC, because your mets are limited?...anyway, wishing you every success with treatment and your next appointment joanne :)",

At first, to help me deal with the panic, i made a 'panic book'.. words that made me feel strong, or reminded me of the big picture, i would read them when i felt panic, or fear creeping in to my mind. it helped to remind myself that i have time, which is more than many people in the world get, with wars, earthquakes etc.  I have found that avoiding this reality for a few days is quite nice every so often! It seems i have many days now where im just living. I wouldnt have believed that i could do that when dxd nearly 2 yrs ago. Its not an easy road, but it has opened my mind and heart. I have bone mets only. At first the oncs were seeing me every month. At my last appointment he said 'see you in 6 months'....i was like 'huh!?'... learning to live each day, in the true sense of that saying, is something we can achieve, we kind of have to! :) be gentle on yourself x",

I said to her that if i knew then what i know now, if we were taught in school how cancer works, (as one in two Australians will get it) how it mutates, travels, goes back to sleep, how it is still a mystery to the medical world in a way, and how food and exercise change the way our bodies work, about immune systems, and how common cancer is...then i think it would be a much more interesting subject to others. I realised cancer is still a scary word because the general public still dont know the facts. Even i didnt after my dx...I was told 'you will feel tired', but not why. I was told nothing about how to live with this common disease. There may be good advertising campaigns to scare people about cancer, but none to educate. it took alot of self education this last year to undertsand my disease to the best of my ability. No, I dont want to talk about trivial shit any more. I want to talk about big things. Like the universe, microbiology, love, funding for MBC research, study results on mice, on women with BC, macrophages...and because of that, no one asks me over for coffee any more.

You may not get on so well with those who have had no real pain, but you will have deeper connections with those you meet and connect with in the future. Right now you are learning some amazing things about life and love. These experiences and memories can help build your resilience to the minor things that stump alot of people, you may not be aware right now of your strength and compassion, but we can see it, and those you meet on your journey will see it :) You have a life to plan too, keep your dreams going, even if they are put on hold for now. Keep a diary of your dreams, goals and plans.

They can help us identify where we are losing our minimal daily energy reserve (as cancer cells use up alot of our daily energy) and how to change our lives so that we can enjoy and get satisfaction in what is most important to us. Hence if you love cooking, they can organise someone to shop for you.

She said i qualified for NO assisitance from them, not even a gift voucher :(...but Im getting off topic....sheila, im sure you will be able to access heaps of services now...hang in there x i just feel so sorry for you, and your hubby, and it has bought up my frustration at the 'each man for himself' cultural structure...and therefore social isolation that i think can happen here in Aust. x",

I havent menstruated since the first tablet. the onc looked up in surprise the other week when i told her that (they hadnt asked)..i dont know why she looked so surprised?...wishing you success xx",

I spoke to the palliative team about it. How i have to get up during the night for a super long (seems like litres) wee during the night, and asked if it was fluid. The palliative nurse said that was correct, after lying down for a number of hours the fluid drains into the bladder if possible. In the morning I am less 'fluidy', then it builds up during the day again. Because i cough and sneeze all night due to my allergies, and because sometimes i dont wake in time busting to go, i think it's harder to control. especially if you have had kids. (and didnt do pelvic floor exercises as prescribed like me). Please do see someone asap, but there is a chance is it an issue similar to mine, as opposed to spinal issues. I do have spinal mets though, so i will ask my onc too after reading your post, so thanks. Send my best wishes to your mum.",

They said that to me too not long after dx. not everyone iat the conference agreed. That has stayed with me ever since. Apparently the MRI's confirmed stage IV...but i never had a bone biopsy. They said the spot was too risky...it makes you wonder doesnt it!!!...i have a number of 'spots' they could biopsy if scan results are correct...but the reasoning now is that it would be 'painful'....hmmmm I get what you are saying. Has the onc convinced your BS that its not worth the gamble to see?..and the palliative head space they have in regard to us, is pretty hard to shift. Talk to her again. tell her your mental stability depends on a confirmation either way...say anything!, that you and your hubby think could get her back to the point where she is willing to try. Change oncs, yes.....I totally understand the pain of living with a dx that someone at that table wasnt 100% about. And that they would prefer to believe it is MBC, and wait for signs of progression to confirm it, in preference to a bone biopsy, and easing the patient's mind. it sh*ts me too. good luck :) p.s. I even double checked with the onc the other day re skull mets and brain MRI..i asked could they be anything else??!!...sad really. But in your case, I think its a very valid option!",

We have alot to absorb, especially if we are researching alternative options as well as sifting through our conventional options. We also have alot of emotional ups and downs as we come to terms with the diagnosis. Sometimes, when people (kindly) offer information or treatment options, i need to know that there is a bunch of research behind it, and i appreciate when someone provides that research. I appreciated when my friend printed out lots of pages of info on hormonal treatments verses oopherectomy and hormonals etc, she went to the effort of finding the studies, and i was then able to read through them at my convenience. I spend alot of time researching this disease, and someone to bounce off is invaluable.  I think some of us need a wide berth, space to feel all the things we feel, and then a caring ear when we are in the mood to talk. I find i can talk till the cows come home about cancer, or treatments, but if a friend or family member want to, i get irritated, usually because i know they are discussing it from a mainstream, limited position. It is amazing how little we really know about cancer, till we get it. If i had a molecular biologist as a sister, id be at her place every day picking her brain...lol. If someone wants to refuse treatment that is their choice, and should be supported. Ask her what she would like you to send to her, and send it. My brother told me that when our mother was seriously ill, she cut off at a certain point. He said to me that dying is a very personal time, and that i may not have the inclination to be talking and sharing feelings at end stage, so to do and say what i want to NOW. It was good advice. Some of us go into our own little world when dealing with this. Its ok, its all ok. If you want to tell her how you feel about her, do it. I know i am quite an angry person now too. All anyone can do is tell me they love me, help where they can, leave me alone if i need to be alone, listen to me when i need to talk, and sometimes make me laugh. It must be tough on the outside looking in, but though she may be up and down, just have patience, and be there when she is ready, and let her know you will be there when she is ready :)",

I think fear of dying is something we all have to deal with at stage IV, it is not exclusive to those who pursue a 'natural' as opposed to 'chemical' treatment route. All treatments offered to us are potentially dangerous. No treatment offers us a cure. 'the thread', or forum that many of you avoid, is mainly full of legitimate study results, along with some questioning, a little theorising, and some simple complementary ideas to help us on our journey. We pay for standard treatment, knowing it will only give us, hopefully, more time. Some may choose to pay for Alternative treatment that (though im not sure its legal) offers the same. I find it hard to understand the hesitancy to explore all our options. You find it hard to understand why some would do that. Each to their own. I think the discussion has been exhausted on bco. If you read the latest findings linked on 'that thread'. or in the 'research' forum, you will see intriguing and potentially benficial evidence of how we may be able to influence the outcome of our disease. Lauriesh, your post was so true. I believe we would have haha'd those things 20 yrs ago. ",

He said that there is a 10% chance of ONJ from a dental procedure if on zometa. Less than 1% chance on an oral bisphosphonate. I discussed this with him because i have a friend who was diagnosed stage IV 3 years ago. in preparation for her treatment and zometa she had every tooth removed...(!)..3 weeks ago she was diagnosed with ONJ, and spent a week in hospital on I V antibiotics. He told me that there are spontaneous cases of ONJ on zometa. unrelated to a dental procedure. To my mind, this means that the risk is there, whether we proceed with dental extraction or not. My previous oral surgeon claimed that it would take a year or so for bisphosphonates to create the enviroment where ONJ was an issue, but he used scare tactics by showing me pics of ONJ...I prefer my new oral surgeon, who discusses the pros and cons and is honest about the risks. I would consult with an oral surgeon who is informed on this concern. good luck with what you decide :)",

(yet they can give false positives too). There is also a higher radiation intake with a PET (correct me if wrong anyone) ...in my bio i copied out the reports from the CT and bone scans. The person who wrote the report states that my 'extensive' bone mets do not show up much on the CT, and to refer to the bone scan...the bone scan report states that spinal mets dont show on bone scan. Only the spinal MRI showed up those mets.(!) I have been told if i want another MRI, i would need to come up with the money for it. I have bought up the option of a PET scan to my oncs...they were vague in their responses. When pushed, my regular onc admitted that PET's were not offered in the public health system here, and again if i wanted one i could push for it and pay for it. They will only do a PET when it is important to look further into a particular area that is of concern on another scan, so she said. So it seems to me, at least in Australia, that the basic standard approach is bone scans and CT scans, and 'wait' for any measurable lesions elsewhere to show on those scans, or else when we present with symptoms, investigate then.....i know it can be frustrating. I suppose we have to decide how aggressive we want to be re detecting things as early as possible, and how much we want to self advocate and self fund scans...thats how i see it anyway. My recent bone scan result was 'stable disease, no changes since feb'...i asked the onc if my extensive spinal mets only showed on MRI, how do we know they are stable too?...he said \" well, we can order another MRI down the track and check that, yes\"    hmmmm... MRI's  are costly, either to the health system, or us, and you may have to push for one, as i am going to do, but i may have to pay for it..  im not sure if your onc was correct to say that bone stability would be a good indicator of soft tissue organ stability??...im sure there are people here who have had progression to soft tissue organs with stable bone disease....?",

But it did not specify chemotherapy as the systemic treatment used in comparison to no treatment in the study. The second study link you added, used phone calls from a clinic to accumulate it's results. Again, not the most comprehensive study I have come across. Daughterneedsadvice: Your mum should make her own decision, after listening to the advice of her oncologist, and asking the RIGHT questions of her oncologist. She needs to ask for her particular potential overall survival benefit from doing the next chemo option, and the following one too. She needs to decide if the potential benefit, including possible side effects outweighs her quality of life queries, as she has had a number of chemotherapy treatments. She can then make an informed decision. I think asking for medical decision advice on a discussion board predominantly used by those going through standard treatment is something one should only do with an awareness that these are opinions of lay people only, most of whom have chosen to use palliative chemotherapy. There are a large number of studies that show a low carb diet can influence breast cancer, and also recently, that stress can create an environment (in the bone) that encourages cancer cell growth. Therefore focusing on relaxation can help. I would not recommend any treatment choice, as our decisions regarding our stage IV cancer diagnosis are very personal, and none have been proven to cure us of course. I wrote a list of questions to ask your oncologist, in laymans terms, as the first post in the stage IV thread in the Alternative forum here.",

But i dont want to take anti anxiety meds yet, or an anti depressant...i am holding out as long as i can on extra medication...though some would say this is wrong. it is right for me i think. i spoke to my onc about it, i said im not sure if im anxious, or depressed clinically ...who wouldnt be naturally a bit depressed and anxious with what we are dealing with. i told them i remember responding well to valium for a very short time in my 20's...they said, fine, if you do well on that, you can try it later down the track... re panic attacks: when i was 16 i started having them after helping my mother recover from bowel cancer..i think it was tied to that, because a panic attack would come on if we were out shopping, or if her and i were anywhere alone together. they were whopper panic attacks, hyperventilating etc...i now can see it was because while she had recovered and was feeling full of life and wanting to do everything, i was remembering how she collapsed, the times she was hospitalised, and when she was weak...so when i was alone with her, the responsibility ( in my mind) was too much, i was scared something would happen, and i was responsible....i try to ease these burdens for my daughter, i have the list of people to call on the fridge, i have plans in action for her to stay with friends if i am unwell, i have told her that she is not responsible for taking care of me if i am unwell (as much as i would like that lol) i do not want her to have the burden i had as a young girl...i am straightforward about what my body is going through, to an extent, (no prognosis info etc)....but no mystery..but the mystery, the lack of information, the 'happy face' my mother put on each morning, was scary and bewildering to me as a 13/14/15/yr old...so maybe getting a bit cranky is ok jenn?..sorry if this is too long...one more thing, after a number of years with debilitating panic attacks, i started reading/researching as much as i could on them, at around 19 yrs old. i came up with just one line i would say to myself, and it cured them, for many many years.....simple as it is, that line was ' its up to me...do i want this panic attack or not'...thats it..the realisation that I was in charge of me, had a profound impact....i hope this may help your daughter.. also, panic attacks can be nipped in the bud, contrary to popular opinion. take care jen, and sorry for the  looong post xx",

Chickadee, its not hard to understand your negative experience with an Alternative practitioner, but one's personal experience is not evidence for a theory that those who try a more natural approach to disease have had a negative experience with a doctor. Coolbreeze, you said that you know one person who went the alt route, and she died. Yet you, we, know so many women who have died using conventional medicine. some quickly, and some miraculously, live 19+ yrs at stage IV. There is no logic to that argument. I posted some very old stats on 'that thread' in the alt forum a long while ago that documented the amount of time women lived with stage IV in a time before the standard treatments offered today. Some lived that magical 19 yrs with stage IV, many just 3 yrs, some 5 yrs. with no treatment. Not so different to today's figures. Chickadee, if you overview what you are asking, questioning, and apply it to all of us, the 'mind sets' are the same. That is why i dont understand the hostility (and almost religious fervour!) directed towards those who are wanting to pursue a more natural route. Were you foolish for listening to a 'quack'?, maybe. Was i foolish to walk out of my onc's office to have yet more brain scans to be told i was clear, based on a severe rash on my neck that may have caused the enlarge lymph gland, because he didnt even bother to look at the severe rash? maybe. Questioning, researching for ourselves, advocating for ourselves is very important. But overall, we should just accept each other, and our choices, they are the same, and based on the same principals.",

Some anxiety, depression, and mood changes are to be expected when living with this disease. In my opinion, true depression, clinical depression that affects decision making, or severe anxiety that impacts on daily life,  is another matter....all the best vicki, its a hard position to be in, I sympathise.",

Changed my user name a couple of times, at present it's a song title, best sung by Frank Sinatra :) Sometimes i worry if my user name sounds flippant, but to me, it represents the shock of diagnosis: \"riding high in April, shot down in May...\" and also, my determination to live as long as i can: \"..each time i find myself, flat on my face, I pick myself up and get back in the race!\"..... I have a 13 year old daughter, who is very pretty, a bit of a maths whizz, and very social. I am 47, 48 in June!..I am tired alot, but live with minimal pain from extensive bone mets...strange. I have mets in my skull, my hip, spine, rib, and acitabulum (wrong spelling im sure). I have researched this disease exhaustively, and have decided that i want to try and influence the outcome by changing my diet, and my lifestyle. I have been in some heated debates here on BCO, but I am even grateful for them!...because they sharpened my reasoning skills, forced me to define my own beliefs and principals to myself, taught me to be critical. For that I am very grateful. I like the person I am now, much more than the person i was prior to this diagnosis. I confront life and death now, I tell people I love them, I have reignited my passion for painting in oils. My goal is to live until my child is an adult. 20 maybe?....I think I can do it :) oh, p.s. 17 months stable on Tamoxifen..I said no to Zometa. so bones are going solo.",

I have realised that in a way Im an outsider too...here i come bla bla bla ing all over the boards...and i thought to myself yesterday..how would i feel if i was a member of a bc community in Aus, and some chick from another country came there telling us all what to do...as i sometimes do...so i realised im lucky to have the acceptance i do have, from those who like me here, and hence wanted to reinforce my gratitude... coolbreeze, sometimes you are very opinionated! lol.. and i dont always agree with you...but i get what you are saying here. But.. its a fine line i suppose with us stage IV people. I have found ssdealer's posts always to be very supportive, and caring. It was just one post of yours ssd, which I responded to, that offended me (just a little bit)..(and maybe made you think i am one of the people that thinks carers shouldnt post here...which isnt true) .I think the fine line is when someone may come across as complaining about how hard it is for them, as opposed to how hard it is for the person with cancer. They probably dont mean to sound like that at all...it IS very hard for them!!!!...but its sometimes hard to hear about that, as you say coolbreeze, when we are doing our best to help ourselves and each other every day...Bernicky and many carers are incredible, informative, and have alot of support and deservedly so. When a young person comes here frightened about what their parent is going through, i sometimes try to help, imagining my daughter coming here for help...and what i would want her to be hearing from us. So it is a very, very fine line. And i suppose sometimes we are touchy at stage IV when we are in a fearful mood, or phase, or feel unwell, or if we are just pi**sed off....all i want to say is that i can and do offer my support as much as possible, im sorry if i made anyone feel unwelcome...I hope all can find what they need here....as i have....lleddick...all the best while you are going through this hard time.",

They used a spinal MRI to 'confirm'. I have not had a bone biopsy. My stage IV diagnosis was based on a spinal MRI. The only signs I have had were a really painful 'shoulderblade' pain that lasted a couple of weeks about 6 months prior to dx, and a general feeling of unwellness/tiredness.

When you all get your heads around that...or when you read the statistics on overall survival and chemotherapy at any stage, you may stop ths ridiculous expose of limited understanding of the nature of cancer, and the nature of chemotherapy.",

      "Content": "Dec 5, 2011 07:13PM - edited Dec 5, 2011 07:34PM by thats-life- Hi apple, just have to add that nobody  has to do chemo. Stage IV choices are different yet again, as are choices at all stages, and all ages: Ian Olver, Clinical Director, Royal Adelaide Hospital Cancer Centre, Director, Medical Oncology, Royal Adelaide Hospital, and Clinical Professor, Department of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide ....'Some cancers may behave differently in the elderly and warrant different treatment approaches from those in younger patients. In breast cancer for example, the risk of local recurrence after lumpectomy declines with age. This may decrease the need for postoperative radiotherapy in older women. In the Oxford meta-analysis adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with decreasing survival benefit with increasing age particularly in the over 70 age group. Individual older women at high risk of recurrence, however, may obtain some benefit from adjuvant systemic therapy. ' Summary 'Elderly patients with advanced cancer must be allowed to balance the potential risks and benefits of treatment when deciding whether or not to have chemotherapy. The response rates to aggressive chemotherapy are similar in younger and older patients. Disease-related survival is often similar, although the older age group has more deaths due to comorbid illnesses. Factors complicating chemotherapy in the elderly are the physiological changes of ageing, the presence of comorbidities and polypharmacy. Deterioration in renal or hepatic function may force the doses of chemotherapy to be adjusted. Organ toxicities may be more problematic in the elderly, but in most tumours, the efficacy of chemotherapy is not age dependent. Chemotherapy, where indicated for advanced cancer, can therefore be safely and effectively used in selected elderly patients.' .........'For each patient the decision whether or not to have cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced cancer is a balance between the potential benefits and adverse effects. Both of these involve value judgements by individual patients. The perspective of older patients may differ from that of younger patients. Short-term quality of life and the ability to continue managing their activities of daily living may be more important than a modest survival advantage when deciding whether to accept chemotherapy. Conversely, some fit older patients may seek aggressive chemotherapy if they can expect a similar outcome to younger patients.'",

I was hoping this was a new thread that took into account all sides of the Chemotherapy Option, but if its just yet another chemo praising thread, then add it to the ginormous list of those already available. There are just a couple of Alternative Threads. Evidence is there if you care to look. Meanwhile, poor plant lover was hoping for some positive chemo outcome stories. But from a stage IV perspective, its more about your willingness to gamble, as Bak said, on what is going to get you first, the cancer, or the treatment, and from that decision onwards, its a personal choice. It will be a combination of factors that will then determine whether you will have progression, or not. There are many threads already for discussion on dealing with side effects, or successful return to a sense of wellbeing after treatment.",

I send you some of the strength I use to get through this special time of the year. Make memories, that's all any of us have. My gift to you both: \"To see a world in a grain of sand, and heaven in a wildflower, hold infinity in the palm of your hand, and eternity in an hour\"     William Blake and this: \" As long as we can love each other, and remember the feeling of love we had, we can die without ever really going away. All the love you created is still there. You live on in the hearts of everyone you have touched and nurtured while you were here. Death ends a life, not a relationship\" Unknown Authour. Dave, this Christmas my daughter only has me. But she remembers the love of my mother. She feels loved, even though I am the only family member in her life now. I think about how she is going to be when I die too. I have to believe she will thrive, and be ok. The only gift I can give her now is to nurture strength, independence, and give her as much happiness and laughter as i can. Its tough, but every time she is driving me nuts with her all night giggling with her friends, I remember that she deserves this laughter. When the fears of the future creep into my mind, I remind myself of the human ability to adapt, and survive. It will be ok. Send my love and best wishes for a special Christmas to your wife, and tell her I will be thinking of her. This helped me too: (wriiten by a woman living with stage IV cancer) \"Your job is straightforward: Identify your children's physical and emotional needs as they arise and change, and make sure that they are satisfied\" Their main emotional need is to know there is a plan, and that they will be taken care of. Thinking of you both, n.",
