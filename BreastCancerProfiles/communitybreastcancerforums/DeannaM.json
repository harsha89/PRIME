I have read through it an it has been so informative :)  I have posted this question in other areas of the board and have received great informaton. If anyone here has experience with this or advice too, I would greatly appreciate it.  My mom is ER+, PR+ and HER2-. Her tumor was 2.5cm. When it was removed, they tested 2 nodes. At the hospital, the BS told us they looked good and there was a 90% chance the cancer had not spread to them. We were informed Thursday that one of the two nodes tested positive with 4mm. It also had spread some into the fatty tissue behind it. They are wanting to go in again and remove more of my mom's nodes (I believe all of the nodes and the fatty tissue) this week. After that she will do chemo, radiation, and then Arimidex for five years. Is it standard to have more nodes removed? We are gong to discuss the benefits of doing all of the above mentioned that vs. just the chemo, rads and arimidex with. If the nodes have to be done then we will, but it brings up her survival rate by 1-2%, she will probably opt out. Also, is chemo area specific or would it kill cancer cells in a different part of her body? She has pre-cancerous cells on her vulva that need to be taken care of also. The doctor said it was unrelated to her breast cancer. We are afraid that if we wait until the surgory, chemo and rads are done that the pre-cancerous cells will turn to cancer. Any help that anyone could provide would be appreciated. We are going to talk to the oncologist in the morning. I just want to make sure that I am well informed when I go in there and am not wishfully hoping she might not need surgory. Thanks",

I do not mind staying with her and taking care of her, but she feels like she is putting me out (which she is not). I called her doctor's assistant today and discussed the drain with her. Because my mom is thin, the originally told he she should not need it more than two weeks. Today she said it probably will be in the full weeks, so we still have at least 10 days to go. I also asked her about flatening the tube when I empty the drain and she said that is exactly what I should be doing. Because I was trying to get the tube to inflate back up after it was flat, but she said that was no necessary.   There really is no easy answer with any of this. I am glad that we did it, though. If we hadn't, she would have had to do longer chemo too, because they wouldn't have been able to stage her. Thank you again for the responses :)",
