I had my wire guided excisional biopsy.  I thought that I would be getting one wire but it turns out there are now more microcalcifications than there were a month ago.  So, I got to have two wires.  Which by the way were almost the most painful thing in the world.  I had lidocaine but still felt the majority or the procedure and as soon as I was out of compression and blood was flowing again my body began shaking from the pain.  It was the worst!  I don't get why I am having so much pain with procedures that most women on here sailed through with only minor discomfort!  The techs also had trouble getting my images prior to wire placement because that area is now even more dense than it was before!  The hospital staff was amazing!  I've never had a surgery or spent any real time in a hospital as a patient and their kindness helped me get through the difficult day.   I saw my surgeon right before surgery and she mentioned the possibility of a cyst caused by fibrocystic changes for the first time(as an explanation) for the pain, but also said that ALH can cause pain.  This was new.  She said that the rapidly reproducing cells can cause pain but that is different info that I had received from just about everywhere else.  She did not know that they had given me two wires until that point and offered no explanation of the new micros.  I believe she heard me when I told her I will NOT exist in a state requiring me to take Hydrocodone and Tylenol all the time.  She saw my husband after surgery and all she said was that there definitely were a lot of fibrocystic changes going on in my breast.  That's all she said really though.  Do hormones cause fibrocystic changes?  I know that my gynos response to my hormone issues was the pill and getting rid of my cycle completely but with the ALH diagnosis I have been encouraged to stay far away from any form of estrogen.  Who knows what the answer will be?  I guess it depends on what the pathology reports say.  My DH had to go back to work yesterday and I knew people would be coming by later in the day so I got up and did laundry and cleaned the house some, until my muscles starting shaking and I felt like I was going to faint.  I've been pushing through so much pain for so long that I forget that surgery recovery is more than just how much pain I am coping with.  My body has to heal!  I am under strict orders to DO NOTHING!  Pretty hard for me.  I expect to hear something either today or tomorrow.  Hoping for good, conclusive findings!",

I am three weeks post biopsy and still bruised.  My breast was so bruised that the surgeon commented on it last week.  I also have a hematoma.  I have yet to read a post describing these type of negative side effects associated with a sterotactic biopsy so maybe I am a unique situation.  My advice is if you feel sharp continuous pain during the biopsy make them give you more lidocaine. I had my son naturally and compare all pain to that, and compared to that this even at it's worst is totally doable   Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Nov 9, 2018 07:52PM - edited Nov 9, 2018 08:02PM by Rshep9101 hello there, I completely understand your feelings. The waiting. The wondering. The hypothetical responses to hypothetical test results. I am also 38 and was diagnosed with ALH, Fibrocystic breast changes, and dense breasts 8 years ago. My older sister is BRCA positive so it made me even more high risk. I have endured the same type of screening as you and am about to have my 4th biopsy (2nd Surgical) in 8 years. It is nerve wracking. I too have a background in science as a Nutritionist so I want all the info possible. it helps me have an idea of how I would respond in certain hypothetical situations. I love my surgeon. She is calm, conservative when it comes to surgery, and so willing to respectfully answer any and all of my questions. She has helped me tremendously over these years. I just had genetic testing yesterday and am scheduled for surgery next Thursday to remove a growing fibroadenoma. The waiting will be the worst. I am an emotional person. I will spend some time on these boards and reading journal studies, which will be positive some days and negative for me on other days. I will watch old shows again that I have seen a million times (ie Grey's, Felicity, etc). I pray a lot and cry a lot. I write down gratitudes. I box and channel all my feelings into punching the bag. I play basketball and lift weights. I made a playlist specifically for changing my mood. I cook. I will throw myself into Christmas shopping and decorate a week or two earlier than most ;). My first surgery was also in November. Depending on the results of my genetic testing I may reach a point that I am ready to reduce my risk with surgery(oopherectomy or mastectomy). I am not there yet but the worry, waiting, anxiety, and screenings effect different people in different ways. My sister sees them as just routine tasks at this point but she started this journey at 16. She is single and doesn't have any kids so the risk though very real is hers alone. I tell my family if a biopsy is needed but I don't call everyone. I have tried over these last few years to be more transparent about my risk and screening because I think it reminds my peers that they should not assume their age removes them from risk. Good luck to you as you navigate all this. Cancer sucks. Being High Risk sucks too. hugs 😊",
