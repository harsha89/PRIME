I don't really think that a doctor can know that a specific progression is THE progression. I am not sure it is fair to expect that level of prediction from anyone. *susan*",

I mean, I took the pills everyday, and presented my butt monthly for a shot, but nothing more than anyone else here. I just got a lucky draw, for now. Lena, to answer your question, for the most part I don't have the ugly SE's. I have some bone pain, I have lost a few IQ points [which I really really miss] and some fatigue. Well within the acceptable bounderies however. This winter I had three months of no SE's, and boy was that nice. 3rings, yes. It is probably good that people in this waiting room have gotten older. I do miss seeing my familiar faces just a bit though. So a little story, I was in this waiting room, which was quite full, sitting next to a man that was probably old enough to be my Dad. One of the very well-meaning volunteers approached and asked this gentleman if he wanted a drink. Never offered me anything though. Then another volunteer approached, again to talk with this man, and in one of those almost baby voices said \"And who are we here to see today? What time is your appointment?\" and then looked at me! \"We are not together. I am actually a patient\" This man burst out into laughter. He wondered why \"we\" were waiting for anything. I did offer to let him adopt me if he owned an Island in Greece. Sadly, he didn't need anymore children, and did not own any islands.  Can I actually dance as a Stage IV patient? No. Could I dance before BC? No. However, I did do a small jig, or what I called a jig, after getting the scan results. I suspect it was not a pretty sight. Loved hearing that so many others have gotten good news recently. Been a hard two weeks here on BCO. *susan* ",

I think I walked around looking like a deer in headlights for that entire period. I did a lot of \"planning\" and figuring. I didn't tell anyone so that I could preserve my professional life, which took its toll on my friendships. I spent some time evaluating what was going to be important in my life. And then I kept being alive, with great scans. So, I just lived. As you can see from my signature, I have been playing the breast cancer pool since 2005, with my first mets diagnosis in 2010. So, May 2010 to March 2017 with mets. Only this last progression has me thinking about no longer working. Again, a question about where I put my energy vs. do we have enough money for that? I am even closer to you than Pam, since I am in Somerville, 02143. *susan*",

I sincerely hope that your first option, the Gemzar, is the first treatment that you respond to, and that you respond well with a minimum of side effects.

I am one of the lucky ones that gets a very good view of what is happening inside with my tumor markers. Other people progress while their markers are going down or are stable.

Ignore this comment unless it was from a medical professional. I, for one, have never heard this, but then again, I don't have an MD after my name either!  :-) Swelling in the hands and feet can indicate that you are retaining water or that you are not processing your waste well. Neither thing is great, but require different approaches. Since I have not had most of these drugs listed, I don't know if this is one of the side effects or not. I would put in another call the the oncologist on call to determine if this is life-threatening. While waiting for the callback, raise your feet on an ottoman or coffee table to encourage flow. Questions they might ask could be, how much have you been peeing in the past 24 hrs, over what period of time has this swelling increased, of course bowel movements [they all love to talk bowel movements don't they?], and your activity level compared to last week. I hope that you get some answers. Holiday weekends are so hard when you are scared. Everyone who is anyone, except us, is having a holiday. Hang in there, *susan* ",

I am at 17 months, someone else is at 3+ years.... but there are those that don't respond to this drug at all. It will take you a few months to know which category you will be in. Deciding to leave a job is such a personal decision. I, for one, keep working. I need the income. Others swear by leaving their jobs and \"enjoying\" life. For the most part, they have better insurance programs than I do. I do believe that making any major life decision right after getting traumatic news can be a mistake. Let the dust settle and then decide what is best for you and your family. All the best, *susan* ",

I get my bloods drawn monthly and the oncologist orders two tests, CEA which is a general cancer test, and the CA27.29 which is specifically for breast cancer. Doing the test once will not do much for you however. The power of these tests is your specific trends. So using me as an example. I had my first markers done right after surgery, and then every 3 or 6 months from then on. When my numbers started to rise, I started getting scans. My numbers actually more than doubled before the scans could confirm that I had metastic activity. So, for me, my tumor markers show progression before scans. But, other women see absolutely no movement regardless of their tumor's activity. I guess that my caution is, if you pay for this test out of pocket you will need to continue to do this in order to get anything meaningful from the numbers. One time will not be sufficient. Hope this wasn't too long and perhaps, even a little helpful. *susan* ",

As someone who has managed many employees [and will never ever ever ever do that again!], perhaps I can offer another perspective. Your original post actually has two competing components. The first is professional. This person works for you, she is undermining your authority with vendors, and is working at odds to the goals of your department. To me, it feels like she has found an opportunity to assert herself as the \"real\" leader and worker. I suspect that she hopes when you fail and/or don't return to work, her job will be safe. Further, she may very well be thinking \"if there are layoffs, maybe English will go and I will be the one kept.\" And finally, she got caught and is not willing to vocalize that she knows what she did was unprofessional and has given you, her supervisor, no assurance that this will not happen again. The second thing I hear in your post is that your feelings are hurt. Co-worker doesn't send cards, doesn't sympathize regarding your cancer and treatment options. Unsaid, but I suspect she doesn't want to hear about your latest doctors appointments. And as you say, she doesn't even \"wish you well.\" I fear that you are mixing personal with professional. There is no requirement in a work environment that co-workers be anything beyond a co-worker. Cards, wishes, group lunches and all the trappings of \"faux friendships\" sometimes work their way into the business world, but we can't demand that our co-workers treat us the way we treat them if it crosses out of the business relationship. This person sounds really unpleasant. I would HATE to work with her on a regular basis, but I wonder if you removed your hurt feelings from the equation if you would be able to find the appropriate response. Is discussing internal workflow with a vendor breaking a company policy?  Is is standard to have a subordinate resist correction and refuse to comply with your directives? Is there something here that would allow you to write a small warning letter that became part of her employee file? In terms of being pro-active going forward, have you considered a work board where all projects [or whatever you guys do] are mounted on a board, color coded by person responsible, date due and then date submitted? [Yea, I am just a tad evil with passive aggressive people!] I hope that you accept this post in the spirit in which it was written. What a lousy thing to be dealing with. You have reminded me why I run my own company and have zero employees. All the best and take care. *susan* ",

The mean number isn't that interesting in isolation. This all assumes you know what your \"normal\" number is of course. I now have two.... I was a 44 for the years following my original DX. Now my baseline is between 68-72. I have taken this to mean, my body is always fighting these mutant cells now but with the help of Faslodex is fighting them back. As I have noted before, my numbers have consistently gone up in the Spring time. I don't know if this is due to pollen, warmer weather, or that everything wants to grow during the Spring.

In a group of women, I would prefer a nice hike through the woods, and then retreating to the lodge and drinking really well-made cocktails while telling stories in front of a fireplace. And that is why I have never signed up for these retreats. Totally not my style. *susan* ",

You are still waiting for your final diagnosis. For me, it was a 6 month period where my brain was really clutter with cancer/negative thoughts. For me, it got better when I had a treatment plan, and then when that treatment began to work. The fact of the matter was, the world didn't stop because I was full of fear. I still had to make food, clean the house, make a living, worry about my daughter, in other words, there was a life that I needed to be living. By paying attention to that, I was able to move emotionally to a place where the fact that I have cancer in my body, no longer is the only thing going on inside my head. There is no getting away from the fact that Stage IV sucks. It is scary. But I think you will find that this board has a vibrant and alive group of women and men who will support you as you regain your balance. Bet, *susan* ",

These injections have gotten me to NED [no evidence of disease.] Most women receive the shots while standing up, well slightly hunched over. LowRider has a great description of the \"position\" in the Hormonal thread that is stuck at the top of the forum. Given some traumas in my life, I get mine while lying on a bed. Make sure that the Faslodex is at room temperature before they inject. Do what you can to relax while the injection is being given. They do have to push hard to get the Faslodex into your buttocks. Chances are you will get a double dose which means one in each cheek. One of my coping mechanisms [in all kinds of things] is to count. Generally, each injection takes about 64 seconds. Each of us experience this injection differently. Side effects also vary. Overall I have found this drug to be very tolerable. Again, if you read through the hormonal thread you will see what various folks have experienced. Since this is your first treatment, I bet you don't experience much in the way of SE's.

I admit that I simply didn't buy health insurance between the ages of 18-21. It was all I could do to pay for my college tuition during those years, even working full-time. For many years, we bought what would now be considered catastrophic insurance. Very high deductible. However, with the arrival of baby in 1986, we started reviewing other options. [Kids are expensive!] Every year, we reviewed our options and chose the plan that seemed to fit our needs. Moving back to the Northeast allowed us to use non-profit insurance companies. Until last year, we chose a plan with no RX coverage since our monthly RX bills were exactly $12.30. However, with my progression, a change in the MA law, and a quick review of how much Xeloda would cost should I progress, this year we opted for much better RX insurance. I belong to a business association which means we are in the market as part of a much larger group so that my health history isn't part of the insurance cost calculation. All we can do it make the best decision based on our current circumstances, along with some knowlege of what our future will bring. *susan* ",

Dana was not at all open to directing chemo at local facilities when my sister was treated there. But breast cancer is a different animal for early stages.

The stage is straight out of \"Name that Price\" or whatever that old show was called. The curtains have way too many pleats and there are spotlights swirling around lighting the space. An excited voice says \"And behind door No 1 is surgery. We will remove your breast and you will take months to recover. Or we have Door No 2. Chemo that will make you bald and sick again. And finally, Door No 3, you will get a new aromatese inhibitor.\" The voice sounds excited, like I am winning a trip to Tuscany, or a week in Paris. In my dream, my mind is a running commentary, trying to analyze the options as they are presented. A Vanna White wanna-be is in a gold lamé dress, her arms gracefully pointing to each curtain as the choices are announced. Today I met with my Oncologist, Dr. Roger, to review my scan results and talk about the treatment options. Today's meeting included no gold lamé I am happy to say. Just two white coats, my husband and myself. Dr. Roger was clearly relieved that there were no bone mets. [If there had been he was planning some really heavy guns! An interesting aside.] He sees mets along the chest wall [where my original tumor was attached] going vertically, and one on the outside of the lung [not a lung met.] He confirmed what I had heard during my conversation with the PA. Minimal. He then began to draw pictures. [Dr. Roger likes to draw pictures, but they are really not very good.] He explained that the estrogen expression is actually two distinct expressions [alpha and beta, scientists are sooooo boring.] The aromasin blocks one of them while the other expression, which is rarer, is left alone. Surprisingly, Dr. Roger is continuing the aromasin, but adding Faslodex to block the second expression. Since my blood markers have been an accurate look into my progression, we will start testing these monthly, at the same time as my injection. I will see Dr. Roger again in two months, unless next month's markers continue the rise. I was then taken to the chemo infusion room. My former chemo nurse, Nurse Judy, gave me the Faslodex injection in the same chair that used to be my A/C spot. Damn what a large needle! I counted to 63 seconds, but it is possible I was counting really fast. There is no dignity to cancer. The irony is, the awful pain I have been experiencing, the pain that started the search is completely unrelated to my progression. Instead I have to have my gallbladder removed! Now that I know the plan, I have lots of questions/thoughts, but that will be a different post.   *susan*  anotherplan.blogspot.com... and its back. May 3, 2010 mets found.

I found my lump 4 years and 51 weeks ago. Given my tumor's personality, I received the standard protocol: partial mascetomy, 4 rounds of A/C, 33 rads plus 8 boosters. I have been in a study of Armidex vs Aromasin since December 15,2005. I was just about to open my last bottle of the aromasin and was really counting down the days when I could say good-bye to all the side effects. Of course, standard protocol would have included 4 rounds of Taxol, but given my low rish of recurrance and because I play the violin professionally, my medical team chose to omit it. The neuropathy caused by Taxol would have comprimised my fine motor coordination. I have not yet had a meeting with my Oncologist, but received the news via phone from his physician's assistant. She catagorized the results as 'minimal' with mets showing in my chest cavity and lymphs in the upper right quadriant of my body. Bone scans and MRI's didn't show any bone activity. I am married, same guy for 27 years, have a 24 year old daughter and am self-employed. I am a business consultant and database developer now, but still play the violin professionally as often as possible. We live in a house with bad water karma just outside of Boston, and groan when it rains and is windy at the same time. We have a cat that doesn't know that at 16 years old it should be getting old, and acts more like a dog every year. I am cynical, have a well-honed cancer humor, generous, caring, and don't take fools lightly. I love laughter, but don't do that enough, and having happy people around my dinner table, which I am doing more of lately. I am petrified about the finances of this diagnosis. Oh, not today. Nothing has changed today, but the future. I worry about who will take care of my husband when his genetic Alzeihmers starts. And then I remind myself, that this is a long term chronic condition, and I will not need to make some of these big choices until there is progression. anotherplan.blogspot.com... and its back.

Instead, I had to watch my feet and direct them with my brain. Digestive system is behaving, though if I eat too much in one sitting I get acid reflux. As a result, i am disappearing a bit. (Very odd feeling for someone who has always been a little too big.) I still have hair, and in fact, might need a trim soon. Energy levels have been fine.

Or maybe a protein-heavy dinner [small as it was] is helping. I am finding hot weather really wearing on this drug. Is this true for others? SouthernSurvivor, none of my mets are in a location that a biopsy wouldn't have potential significant issues, so we keep treating what I had back in 2005. The research nurse on my current clinical trial tried to convince my oncologist to biopsy and got absolutely no where! IrishTwin, I hope that your sister's off-week is going well and that her white blood counts are holding up well. Lulubee, need to hear from you. You are in the middle of cycle 1 which I found to be quite hard and had me doubting my reasons for living! Please check in.

I hope that you can have an honest discussion with your oncologist and that they are willing to do whatever it takes. And, yes, get rid of that steroid! I don't get any pre-meds at all, and they are not given at my hospital unless the side effects of the drugs require them. KPW, I googled nephritis and this is some scary stuff!

The muscle cramps are my biggest complaint on this drug. On day 4/5 and 11/12 are the worst for energy. I have headaches [and have run out of Advil! Ack!] Tonight, I am running a fever. Is this the precursor to being sick or a side effect of chemo? I have no idea. I am watching this closely, but going to the ER in a major city on a Friday night is about the last thing I want to do. Tuesday through Friday, I am starving and have learned to eat as much as possible. Then my appetite wanes and the pounds start to come off. I try really hard on Monday to eat LOTS of calories so that no one on my medical team notices. But, note above, money is getting tight, so my go-to take outs are really not an option. I love to eat Massaman curry on Mondays but Mr. 02143 doesn't like this dish. I simply refuse to make two different meals. The off week is a bit of a disappointment. When I was on Taxol, there was a great curve upwards for the entire week. On this drug, I sit at the bottom for longer and don't feel that I get the rebound as quickly as I would like.

I do think, non-scientifically, that the stretches that I am doing for the cramps has helped a bit. I think Dana Farber categorizes dropped foot as a \"strain\" of neuropathy.

I still have a \"loss of appetite\" but am able to eat, just have trouble deciding what I want to eat. Mr. 02143 does have preferences, so we eat what he desires. That works well enough.

She is smart, beautiful, funny, caring, and full of a spirit that shines through on every level. Had we ever been together before? No. And yet, it was a day where we felt that we were lifelong friends, just restarting our conversations. We laughed, and talked, and laughed some more, and had conversations that had depth and meaning. My husband and I jumped on the Metro and headed to the stop that Ebru had given us and she picked us up in her sporty VW. We were off to a \"typical\" Istanbul coffee shop, but somehow, the plan changed and we changed direction. Over the second bridge to a palace in Asia; a real sultan's palace overlooking the Bosphorous that has been converted to a restaurant and event center. We walked up the front stairs [marble of course] and began to look around. It was empty of people so we went up the second set of stairs and found ourselves in the most glorious foyer. Still no people, so we kept walking,through a huge ballroom with crystal chandeliers, and into a large parlor with frescoes on the ceiling. We found fancy bathrooms, but no people. It was like visiting a museum without any guards. We found a terrace, but it had workers and no restaurant. Finally, down some stairs and we found the restaurant, on a terrace with the straights down below. We had a lovely lunch. Ebru chose three meze: hummus, a roasted pepper, tomato and walnut salad, and fried bulgher meatballs. For an entree, Ebru and my husband chose the tandoori lamb shanks and I tried the veal koftas. We each had some side dishes that included a special spiced rice, eggplant served different ways, and the obligatory grilled pepper. All perfectly prepared and did I mention the view? In the garden beneath the terrace there were two peacocks, very vocal peacocks giving another atmospheric touch! After coffee it was time to leave. I think we were all getting a little fatigued and so we went back inside and found the door to leave. But! Someone came after us because we were in the kitchen! What a kitchen! It was huge with so many different stations. It was a small crew for this meal service, but clearly they can prepare food down there for at least 2000 people. The mixer was bigger than some bathtubs! Someone showed us out a side, employee entrance. So fun to see so many parts of the palace that were not supposed to be on the tour. Perhaps a few signs would be helpful for future guests? Can you imagine how hard we laughed as we remembered being able to thank the chef for a lovely meal? We arrived back at our hotel around 6pm, full and happy. We had such a lovely time with Ebru. I only wish we were here a little longer so we could enjoy each other's company some more. *susan*  ",

Since I am being scanned so regularly with this clinical trial, we know that this small clot didn't exist 12 weeks ago. Useful knowledge, I would think. While talking with Dr. C, she used many of the same logical explanations regarding \"no pills.\" She also added that this injectable drug is the only one which has been tested with good results in \"our population.\" She also mentioned that warfarin requires that you eat exactly the same nutritional content each day and that this is not easy for \"our population.\" Cancer patients, the logic goes, have too many outside influences on their taste buds and energy levels to eat the exact same amount of vitamins, especially Vitamin K, each and every day. This injectable drug, since it is dosed by weight, is more accurate. As to the needles, I am one tough woman except for this one thing. Mr. 02143 isn't doing a great job, but at least he is doing it. Oh, and I am so sorry that you are having to do these injections as well. Lulu, if you are anything like me, cycle 2 will be easier. My port has never been right. It has failed to give blood five times, though the first four times we did all kind of weird positioning and simply waiting, and it did finally give the goods. Three times, the port was so inflamed that no one would access it. The Taxol burned, and the port pain would last most of the week, hurting me and causing enough itching to wake me in the middle of the night. I am just about done with my week off. But you must be starting yours? I am so glad to hear that the barium/contrast combination makes other feels nasty. At least it is normal. *susan*",

I don't recall having any problem with Neulasta back when I was doing A/C, but the stories that others told showed me that this drug can be really hard for some folks. But, to have the drug and STILL get a cold seems just plain cruel. I hope that you are able to leave the house during this off-week. I admit, I didn't. I will be right here rooting you on! Day 9 is almost over. No Advil yet. I was able to eat two real meals today, and did a grocery store run [though I didn't do the driving.] I have prepped a pork butt. Half is going to become a Santa Fe Carne Adovada, a dish I had for the first time a year ago when visiting a friend in that city. The rest will become two different versions of breakfast sausage. I am in a search for a decent breakfast sausage formula. Sometimes, I just want a bit of breakfast sausage, and if I had patties made in the magic freezer, it would be simple to satisfy that craving. In fact, restocking the magic freezer is one of my goals. I need to make some breads, stocks, stews, and perhaps a casserole or two. One of my major goals is to put on a few more pounds. I was given the \"lecture\" again this week. I had to take a 20 minute nap around 2pm, but it was so pleasant, I chose to extend it another 20 minutes. That felt luxurious! *susan*",

Blood work is looking fine; well except for those tumor markers. I had had a steady drop during the first five cycles, but this cycle, week 1, they were back to where we started. Not promising to be honest. Tumor markers, especially 27.29 and now the 15-3, have been very accurate for me in the past. The CEA has not, but even that one has shot up to the highest level in years. If history repeats, tomorrow's scan won't show a progression. The tumor markers go up about 2-3 months before the scans see the uptick. Damn! So yes, I have scans tomorrow. Due to the trial I am on, it is a CT which I detest. I am not loving this drug, to be honest. As Lulubee mentions above, the cramps are fierce! My trial nurse has stated that they can not be controlled through diet. She has hopes for a topical cream but none of her patients can afford the cream, so she has read the results but doesn't have first hand notations. She has suggested that I do leg stretches before bed and that does help. I have added arm stretches too. But how do you stretch your neck/jaw? And I can't stretch my hands in an effective manner. I am getting what they call trigger finger which is really scary. There you are, slicing garlic thinly and suddenly your hand is clenched and unusable. I have learned how to wake as a cramp begins and work to reduce the intensity. There is a price for that though. Other muscles in my body seem to absorb the tension, and I am simply not getting solid blocks of sleep. Neuropathy continues to be an issue in my feet as well. For the first time, I used my handicap placard in a parking lot since I just couldn't imagine walking from the other spots. Does anyone else feel that their arms are getting weaker? Lifting a king duvet is really hard for me these days, and I don't recall that being a problem in the past. Getting that same bloody duvet into a duvet cover is like doing pull-ups. I am not needing stool softeners. The headaches still exist but don't have the same intensity and I can often go several days without an Advil. My commitment to helping out my daughter and son-in-law with their kid's childcare and preschool delivery has increased dramatically. We now get up at 6:15 every day [early for me] except on chemo days when I have to get up around 5sm. I am making her breakfast four days a week, same with lunch and snack. Some days she carries her lunch to school; others we are at home. Good thing I like her! Cycle 7, assuming the scans are stable, should begin on Tuesday. I plan to enjoy these few \"good\" days before then as much as possible. Susan",

I too am on a Phase 2 study, localized to the Boston area and Spain. Totally different one, but since I am not getting the \"addictive\" drug, I too will have the option to get that should/when Halaven fails. It is an interesting option. Lulu, really? you have to continue to carry ice with you? However, given how my hands and feet feel today following yesterday's infusion, maybe I should be carrying ice as well. This was week two of cycle 3 and within hours I could feel my feet responding. By 10pm, my fingertips were the next victims. Irish, my 15-3, which seems to have replaced the 27.29 at my hospital but maps closely, are on their way down again. I hope this means that this drug is working for me, and I certainly hope that it works well for your sister. The other requirement of my current clinical trial is regular scans. I am not generally a big scanner, but I don't get to negotiate this point and stay on this trial. Turns out I am going to be scanned on my off-week. Doorbell...... ",

First off, my problem has never been pain. I have not had any pain from my tumors since the breast tumor was removed in 2005. Oh, I have some neuropathic pain, but that has only made some walking, like from the edge of a parking lot to a store, problematic. During my 5 years of Faslodex, my butt hurt. My stomach is starting to rebel from all these Lovonox shots. But, I do not have what I would call chronic or cancer pain. Yes, I know that I am very lucky. This winter was a hard one. Some things in my personal life got squirrely just as the toxicity of Taxol was beginning to take a toll. We changed my protocol for the Taxol to full strength, but with a 3 week on, 2 week off schedule. But those squirrely things emptied my energy and emotional reserves, and I simply could.not.do.anything. I was not tired and yet I was exhausted. I had no energy or perhaps motivation to accomplish. I hit the \"wall\" several times a day; a wall that made my brain stop working, much less my body. And then I had a progression. And then the Eribulin which simply did me in. I had a few days during those first 12 weeks of Eribulin that I could do anything, but for me, this wasn't enough. It took me 3 weeks to make a dress for the grand kid; a pattern that should take me about 5 hours normally. With nothing in reserve, I was paralyzed. The current dose reduction gives me some hope. My brain isn't shutting down. I am actually able to create a to-do list in the morning and accomplish at least some of the items on this list. Not always all, though my lists are really too long. I have had the energy to leave the house and go to the supermarket. I can think enough to actually write emails to friends and try to connect with people again. I realize that with each treatment I will have less stamina. But, being a total slug just isn't what I wish for myself. This dose reduction has lifted me to at least snail or maybe tortoise. I am functioning even if my daily goals are more limited than they once were. Does that begin to answer your question? *susan*",

Uneventful day at a hospital that is known for great delays. I was home by 10:30. But, within moments of my push, my headache was back. Had some stomach pains for the first time. It was also the first time I ate something before the treatment. I won't do that again! Only new physical side effect I have noticed is my left hand, which can cramp up so that all the fingers are tightly agains the palm of the hand, and the fingers simply won't move. I use the skills I developed when playing violin professionally to talk my hand through relaxing. It takes a bit of time, and I don't like it at all. Otherwise, feet are pretty much the same. I continue to have large muscle cramps, mostly at night. And that left foot wants to drag. I have sent in my application to get a handicap placard for my car. I can see that there will be days that I will need it. These benchmarks are hard. *susan*",

Over the 20 weeks that I have been on this drug, my blood pressure has steadily dropped. Each week, just a bit, but this Tuesday the research nurse declared that my blood pressure was dangerously low. When I got home I called my primary's office and scheduled an appointment for Friday. Yes, they wanted me to come in earlier but TWELVE people coming to Thanksgiving! There was no time for a doctor visit. Yesterday I had 30 whole minutes with my primary, who I really, really like. They took my blood pressure three times and it was only seriously low; not dangerous. Given my 25 lbs of weight loss over the past year and the current readings, she has taken me off all blood pressure meds. Her thought is that we find the baseline, not affected by the drugs, and then adjust from there. She did ask if low blood pressure was a side effect of Halavan, and I had to admit, I didn't know. Quick research at home, and why there it is, a rare but not serious side effect! I seem to always get all the weird ones! So, maybe, just maybe, if my blood pressure is a bit higher I will regain some of the energy that I no longer have. [Yup, always looking for the bright side.] More energy would certainly be a treat. Thanksgiving went well. For the first time ever, I asked my guests to bring food with them. I did make 9 items on the table.... and each guest brought something. It worked well. Since my sister can still not eat by mouth, I didn't have to have vegetarian versions of everything which was a huge work-reduction. I would not have had the capacity to do everything this year. The dishes are all done. I still have to wash all the linens that have cranberry and wine smudges. I am making some Kaiser rolls right now so our Turkey has some fresh bread to hang out with as a sandwich. I hope that all of you were surrounded by the people who make you happy! *susan*",

I have a blood clot in my left lung. I don't consider any of this good news. I am stable with smouldering tumors!!

I asked her what could have led to such a clot, and her response was chilling\u2013 \"This is a side effect of cancer and its treatment.\" How to treat? Oh, no simple pill by mouth for me. Nope. I have to inject myself TWICE A DAY! At first, she was this isn't urgent, but then she called back several more times and it was clear, I had to head to Dana Farber today to start this treatment. I waited for the Brazilians to check in [I have a small airBNB,] and for son-in-law to pick up the grand, and then I went, driving through Red Sox traffic. Thank goodness I had my regular nurse who was patient and calm, and told me stories of her recent trip to Greece. I have always said I could never stick anything or anyone with a needle.

I mustered enough energy to set up breakfast for the morning guests, but it was not easy! Day 11 I was whipped from the moment the day began. The headache was back. I wake early on Friday to care for the grand, and boy do I miss those 90 minutes of sleep! Even when I woke I could tell that my blood counts were dropping\u2013 rash a little bumpier and itchy, a mouth sore or two, generally dragginess. At 8am, the grand announced that she wanted pizza for lunch, and we hadn't even had breakfast yet. I did it. Made some dough right after oatmeal was served. Her new thing is to have quiet time on a \"pretend\" bed in my office while I nap. She falls asleep just as I wake up, giving me a bit of Susan-time. I slept long and hard last night. I was whipped. I think I need to scale back today and give my body some time to heal. At this point, I think it is safe to say that Thursday [Tuesday infusion] is a downward slide; Friday is the hardest energy day; Saturday is a day to rebuild. This is my off week! I really hope that I have made it through the worst of this cycle, which is infinitely better than those 9 weeks of hell I endured for cycles 1-3. Thoughts to all of you, *susan*",

The foot neuropathy is a bit better. It is affecting a smaller area of my feet, but that darn left foot still gets \"caught\" at unexpected moments. The cramps still wake me regularly. I have found that in addition to the stretching, it is good for me to wear one or even two pairs of socks to bed. This keeps the legs warmer which seems to help. Of course, this means that I am now often too hot. A small price to pay, I guess. However, the cramps still happen and they still hurt like hell. The weaning off of Lisinopril was rather rough. But the crushing headaches have passed. At Dana Farber, post-Lisinopril, my BP was sky high. The next day at my endocrinologists office, where they take their time and do an old fashioned hand reading, it was perfect. We shall see how it reads tomorrow in the rush of a Dana Farber office. I think that the Eribulin is also affecting my overall mood. Does anyone else have moments of despondency for no particular reason? *susan*",

It allows me to contribute to the conversation without whining about how crappy I feel that day, or what time of day I plan my naps! Rx side effects just doesn't interest most people. I feel lucky that I am still pretty darn healthy, for a woman with mutant cells fighting to control her body, so I can still find general interest topics.

      "Content": "Sep 7, 2011 04:39PM - edited Sep 7, 2011 04:45PM by susan_02143 So many of you getting surgery tomorrow. Astonishing! Hard to believe that it has been over six years since my partial mastectomy with SNB. I was a mess before surgery. The idea that they were going to CUT my breast horrified me. Such a sensitive part of my body, and they were going to use sharp objects! Here is the good news. This surgery was not bad at all. The underarm was more painful than the breast, which had almost no pain. Here are a few things I wish I had known.... 1. wear elastic pants and a shirt that doesn't need to go over your head to surgery since they are much easier to get on when they send you home. 2. have an \"old-lady\" bra that locks them down to wear after the surgery for a bit. Your breast will thank you as you go over bumps when driving 3. bring a small pillow with you to the hospital to tuck between you and the seat belt on the way home 4. get the RX for pain [which you may not even need, but insist] during the pre-op and have your waiting person get it filled while you are in the OR. 5. You will probably sleep a lot the first two days after. The first day because of the drugs, the second day because you have not been sleeping well for the last week and are tired. Put clean sheets on the bed before the surgery. Just so much nicer. I will look for your reports. May your surgeries go as well as mine did. All the best, *susan*  p.s. And of course, mourning the loss of who you were before this nastiness and your breasts as you have known them is really normal, and okay. ",

My guess is that your radiology clinic was one of these clinics and is choosing not to do the extra work required to assure you a fourth PET. This isn't new. My health insurance company now utiltizes an outside review body for all PET approvals. It is more work for my doctor, and once she had to push back.

Few updates: my sister completed her treatment but is still not able to eat by mouth. Her tongue is so covered with sores that almost all foods are too painful to manage. Last week was a bit better, but this week is worst. Her scans have been delayed since they are worried that the sore would be misread. And my poor Dad is still in the nursing home. My mother is back home, but hasn't brought him home yet. I heard today that she is planning to let him come home on November 1. It will be a hard adjustment for my Mom who is not particularly patient. Since she still works 60 hours a week, this leaves him with a lot of time to kill all by himself. It will be up to them to figure this all out. Good to hear from everyone! *susan* ",

As usual, I went into the hospital last week for a bone density test and to draw blood. Not as usual, I didn't go online and check my numbers until this morning. OMG! My ca25.27 is up to 107! This means in the past 11 months, I have gone from 38 all the way up to 107. Of course, the traffic was awful. The drivers in the garage were nuts. The elevators were slow. And I was actually late to my appointment. [Another woman was delighted. She showed up to her appointment a week early and was able to slip in!] Dr. Roger and his PA, Lauren, went through how I have been feeling. I was told to be comprehensive in my description. To be honest, for the past three months, I haven't been feeling that great. Food tastes odd. Loss of appetite [ME? Loss of appetite.] Strange liver pains that increase when I lie down. Blah blah. \"This is all so capricious\" he said. You know that this is an indication of tumor activity. He said lots more, with the caveat, \"but of course we never know.\" So now, I am waiting for the call to schedule an MRI, CT scan, ultrasounds and bone scans. The full monty. I am guessing this will all take about 2 weeks to sort out, but it doesn't feel good to not know. I will not tell anyone besides my husband that I am in cancer-limbo. Certainly, no posts on Facebook or Twitter. But I needed a place to put my fear. And this thread is simply the safest place. Good wishes please.... this is feeling kind of real. ",

With these \"names\" you can research the Chemo Threads on this site to see the wide variation of experiences that other women have had. Day 5 or 6 is the hardest one... meaning Tuesday infustion, Saturday or Sunday will be the hardest days. If you are planning to work full-time through chemo, you will want to request a Tuesday or Wednesday infusion day. The type of work you do does affect your ability to continue. People with routines at work seem to do the best. People who do problem solving have more difficulty. Many companies jostle the job responsibilities around to help people work. And some very progressive companies do sick-leave pooling so you can apply for sick time owned by others. That said, you may feel sick and be tired. You might have to take some time off, especially towards the end of treatment. Whenever possible, time your treatments so that you have your days off to recover. Go on and start freezing some easy to reheat meals. I found I had to eat about 2 oz of food every two hours to stay ahead of the nausea. Others find other things work for them. The Chemo threads on this site go back many years.... do some reading and find the strategies that have worked for others. You won't know which ones might work for you until you are already in the treatment, but knowing what options are out there can be useful. No reason to reinvent the wheel... hundreds of thousands of women have done this before you. Hope this helps, *susan* ",

See my breast surgeon and hope for the best. Odd how I get nervous before these reviews. Sister has her last chemo tomorrow.... 6 more radiations. She can't talk much now, and is totally using the feeding tube. My Mom is being a trooper, being her primary cheerleader. The kid went North and spent a ton of time with my Dad. He continues to get stronger physically, but the short term memory isn't returning quickly. Celebrated my 26th wedding anniversary on the eve of the Olympics by going to a Chinese restaurant that specializes in Northern cuisine. Dirt cheap, and delicious. I am trying to learn to cook this cuisine, and seem to have conquered dumplings. Wok cooking is eluding me, however. All the best,  *susan* ",

My sister has now gone 2 weeks without using her feeding tube. Her first post-treatment scans are next week, and assuming they are clean, she will have the PEG tube removed. My father is now back at home, and though the transition is difficult both of my parents, this is a very good thing. Right now, we are at 16 for dinner on Thanksgiving. Need to finish patching and painting the dining room. We had insulation pumped into the walls, leaving nasty holes all over the walls. The difference is astonishing. My feet don't feel cold air pouring across them as I stand in front of the stove, and when the furnace does come on, it only stays on for a few moments. And, then it doesn't come on again for hours. Delightful! So everything here in Boston is looking up! Best to all of you..... *susan*",

If there comes a time that research can begin to understand the full cellular life-cycle, then perhaps a cure can be found. I do not expect this \"cure\" to happen during my lifetime. However, unlike so many women on this board, I am okay with that. The existence of a cure does not change my daily life. It is up to me to find meaning for my life in spite of the fact that I, unlike so many others, know what I will die of. I suspect it is comforting to use the word chronic and hope, but that isn't how I view my reality. Additionally, when/if there is a \"cure\" it will be preventative since that is where all the money is going. But again, I believe that it will be years and years before such a breakthrough will occur. However, I believe fully in participating in studies and trials whenever possible. I have donated tissue, blood, allowed the details of my life to be studied, am in a sister-sister study, etc. Accumulating the knowledge needed to \"cure\" and treat this disease, and many others, is dependent upon those of us unlucky enough to hit the jackpot to give, even though it will not help us directly. I do not want my child to ever deal with this. I do not want her children to ever deal with this. This disease is already going to take so much from them, that donating a few tumor cells doesn't feel like too much. Whew.... sorry... I think I just unloaded a lot of baggage on you. I am sorry that you are feeling down. Hope is a tenuous emotion, and comes totally from within. *susan* ",

It will get you up-to-date.] For the past few nights I have had a really weird, yet surreal dream. There is a stage with three curtains. The stage is straight out of \"Name that Price\" or whatever that old show was called. The curtains have way too many pleats and there are spotlights swirling around lighting the space. An excited voice says \"And behind door No 1 is surgery. We will remove your breast and you will take months to recover. Or we have Door No 2. Chemo that will make you bald and sick again. And finally, Door No 3, you will get a new aromatese inhibitor.\" The voice sounds excited, like I am winning a trip to Tuscany, or a week in Paris. In my dream, my mind is a running commentary, trying to analyze the options as they are presented. A Vanna White wanna-be is in a gold lamé dress, her arms gracefully pointing to each curtain as the choices are announced. Today I met with my Oncologist, Dr. Roger, to review my scan results and talk about the treatment options. Today's meeting included no gold lamé I am happy to say. Just two white coats, my husband and myself. Dr. Roger was clearly relieved that there were no bone mets. [If there had been he was planning some really heavy guns! An interesting aside.] He sees mets along the chest wall [where my original tumor was attached] going vertically, and one on the outside of the lung [not a lung met.] He confirmed what I had heard during my conversation with the PA. Minimal. He then began to draw pictures. [Dr. Roger likes to draw pictures, but they are really not very good.] He explained that the estrogen expression is actually two distinct expressions [alpha and beta, scientists are sooooo boring.] The aromasin blocks one of them while the other expression, which is rarer, is left alone. Surprisingly, Dr. Roger is continuing the aromasin, but adding Faslodex to block the second expression. Since my blood markers have been an accurate look into my progression, we will start testing these monthly, at the same time as my injection. I will see Dr. Roger again in two months, unless next month's markers continue the rise. I was then taken to the chemo infusion room. My former chemo nurse, Nurse Judy, gave me the Faslodex injection in the same chair that used to be my A/C spot. Damn what a large needle! I counted to 63 seconds, but it is possible I was counting really fast. There is no dignity to cancer. The irony is, the awful pain I have been experiencing, the pain that started the search is completely unrelated to my progression. Instead I have to have my gallbladder removed! Now that I know the plan, I have lots of questions/thoughts, but that will be a different post. ",

After the tumors have been removed, the reconstruction team will move in and rebuild using parts of her forearm, and skin from some other area. She will then move to full head/neck radiation for 7 weeks with once weekly chemo. They claim she will need a feeding tube starting at week 5, and will need ample narcotics to withstand the pain, so will be unable to drive herself to treatments. The treatment plan is about 6 months from front to back. This is all contingent upon a clean CT and PET scans scheduled for later this week. Sounds pretty rough to me, but she is sounding pretty upbeat all things considering. Be well my sisters, *susan* ",

With luck, we will get an additional week of some foods supplemented by her feeding tube.

One more week, and we will be harvesting our own tomatoes. The herb garden is growing like crazy. My daughter is home andis full of life and happiness. Sandra, how are you healing??? Calico, deep breathes. We are all scared of mets and recurrance. I try not to give into that though, since that means cancer has won.

Infection? oh, only 1% have that problem, etc. etc. The nausea is finally under control, but my days of making soup are over. Her ability to use her mouth is almost gone, so she is drinking carnation high calorie drinks. Her PEG tube had to be pulled, so she isn't doing the feeding tube yet, but should be to add those extra calories to every day. We expect it to be reinserted this week. I am going to head North today to spend two days visiting my father. Word of mouth indicates that he is doing much better physically, but still gets confused.  Hope everyone is well. ",

She is no longer able to eat by mouth, and has begun using her feeding [PEG] tube which was reinserted last Wednesday. Since my mother is with her 24/7, I haven't seen her in a week or so. My visit with my father was fine. As my other sister says, he is a little like Mr. Magoo. As smart and nice as always, with very little short-term memory. If there was someone at his home, he could be there, but he couldn't live on his own right now.  We are seeing a break in the family under all of this strain. This is all very hard. Will try to post back responses to all of you later. ",

Calico, I do hope you have a lovely visit with your Mother. So much has happened to your family since you have seen her. I hope that you find comfort in each other's presense. Liezel, maybe having your caniversary all alone was a blessing? Not having to be falsely cheery, not having your feelings hurt when husband forgets.... a soft chair and a good book would be a lovely day. Peg, Congrats on your 6 mo mammo. I have friends who just love whitewater rafting. Did you have a fabulous time? My mammo was on Thursday. I didn't get the \"special\" machine and they didn't squish anywhere near as much as previous iterations. From there, I see my breast surgeon who is just an amazing woman. Though the breast looks clear, she is concerned that I keep getting infections in the breast. She will now have me do an annual MRI for a bit, just to be sure. Also gave me an RX for antibiotics so I can start the regimen quickly if I get another infection. Dr. MaryAnn also offered to talk with my daughter about medical school over a cup of tea. So clean scans here too! No more cancer docs until November! ",

We met professors, watched the Laurel parade, and heard a lot of smart women making speeches. The kid has had several interviews for very competitive positions, but hasn't been hired for any of them. She isn't defeated. She continues to send out applications, resumes and cover letters. Hard time to be graduating and looking for a job. Sadly, my oncologist checkup at the beginning of the month didn't go so well. Though I feel fine, my numbers tell a different story. Everything is going up... tumor markers, hemaglobans and my blood oxygen levels are \"of concern.\" We redid the tests, and they had gone up even more. We are waiting for something called the Jak2 mutation test. Oncologist is worried about my bone marrow. This test will take another 2 weeks to come back, so nothing to do but live life and push this to the back of my mind. Trying to pretend that I am not waiting for another test result as best as I can. ",

In fact, Nicole, you hardly leave my mind. Take up a full seat, please, since you know you have grabbed the brass ring. Around here, life is good. For some reason my Onc has ordered a gazillion tests which I will begin in a week. I have a new lump in the \"affected\" breast, but I think it is just scar tissue that has hardened. By September 1 I will know that this is nothing. The kid LOVE LOVES LOVES her new job. LOVES LOVES LOVES her new apartment. And is learning to call before \"dropping\" by. My dear uncle, who I have been helping with food, etc has died. He simply didn't wake up one morning. He died in a small town, in his favorite place in the world. Services are next weekend. One of his dying wishes was that I would play at this service, so I am frantically practicing. His other dying wish was that I be allowed to select cooking utensils from his kitchen. Very sweet. Though this is all sad, it is a miracle that he was able to choose when and how he died. I admire his perseverance and determination. And I miss knowing that I can visit and enjoy his company. So that is the news from Boston. Many good thoughts as we approach our chemo-versities.... *susan* ",

How are you and your husband doing through all of this? I just can't imagine how anxious you must have been as the medical folks figured out what was happening. Please don't blame yourself for anything. Maybe, maybe not. What we all know is that Matt is a child who was truly wanted, he is a great blessing, and will be surrounded by love. That seems like a tremendous amount to me. I will continue to watch for pictures on Facebook. Much love to you and your entire family. *susan* ",

You know we all know each other so well it was easy to find things to discuss. Our treatments, our jobs, our kids, what to do in Boston.... did the conversation ever falter? Don't think so.... And we talked about everyone who is part of this thread and how important they are to us.  There were pictures taken. I expect that they will show up on facebook. Hope all is well.... *susan* ",

Sadly, I am not the bearer of happy news. Sandra has a new career and Peg continues to do amazing things in NYCity. Leanne's boys are turning into incredible young men. I have kept up with them on Facebook, and their stories are so very joyful. I am so glad that you are well too. *susan*",

I am not particularly, or even specifically Irish, but this place had some good reviews from trusted sources. Edie ordered the Shepards Pie and ate it with complete relish. Instead of being awkward, we had a great time together! Edie ordered another beer and we just talked and talked. When that beer was done, we weren't ready to leave each other so we went to a local coffeeshop and had a tea. Finally, I took her back to her hotel, having gained another friend. Ever since, we have spoken via text or phone at least once a month so I was concerned when she didn't respond to my latest text. Or the next one. Today, I took a deep breath and did the search. Edie lived a completely different life than me and yet, we found each other through this nasty disease. Her greatest concern was her youngest daughter Taylor who has just turned 17 [if my math is correct.] For those that knew and cared about Edie, here is a link to her obituary: www.legacy.com/obituaries/timesunion/obituary.aspx?page=lifestory&pid=166615979 Rest in peace Edie. *susan* anotherplan.blogspot.com... and its back.

And to be honest, October [my b-day month and the month I most dread each year] is really about awareness. Who are these people who aren't aware of cancer? To be most effective, edit that letter and send it to every newspaper that runs a happy BC story. Give us permission to use your shortened letter, and each of us can submit the letter to our local papers when we spot those silly articles. Today the Boston Globe had an obituary for a 43 year old, 14 year survivor of breast cancer. She got a two column spread because she created a concierge service at Beth Israel Hospital here in Boston for Oncology patients. During those 14 years, she used her energy to make life better for those that followed her. But I can guarantee you that she will not be mentioned in all the articles that will be published during October. I don't own anything with a pink ribbon...... *susan* ",

Some weird brain thing was telling me if I let it get long again, the cancer would return. Now, I am so NOT that person. I am practical to a point that annoys many folks so this was very out of character. So, after 4 yrs, I let my hair start to grow. Of course, the cancer returned after 4 1/2 years. But I don't think they are related. Currently my hair is 12 inches long. I will grow it for 2 more inches and then cut it all off for Locks of Love.

To me, this is a logical next step, but only if they are willing to look at the whole picture. [That is hard to find.] I am really sorry that you are in this kind of pain and hope you find the right solution for you. *susan*",

Next, I flipped through the notations that already existed. OMG! This was my medical journal. I sat down, and read. It started on May 1st..... and went through to the first chemo. Reading this diary was astonishing. This woman was so calm as she found her lump, and started contacting doctors. As I read each entry, each medical professional's name jumped off the page, familiar and clear. Who is this woman who journals with such detachment? Needless to say, I put this journal back on the shelf, and grabbed a different one to take to LA. I didn't cry. Maybe I have just put this susan into a box, and closed it with heavey-duty packing tape. But as I sat there, reading, the names of all my September sisters went through my head. We are slowly moving away from each other, but each of you is burned into my memory. Be well, my dear friends.... *susan* ",

Life at the susan household has really sucked. My father had open heart surgery 15 days ago to repair a valve. Turns out that my father had a heart defect from birth that only caused issues recently. The surgery was supposed to last 4-5 hours, but once they were in there, they found they had to replace the valve, and repair three others. He was on the heart/lung machine for 7 hours. He is still in ICU, and he isn't doing well. I will head there tomorrow to be with him for the first time. My mother can't be with him tomorrow because, oh god, my younger sister has been dx'ed with another cancer. She has an oral cancer most common in smokers, but she has never smoked. This is her third cancer. The first at age 28 she should not have survived... the second one was easy... this one is nasty. My internet research indicates that only 20% survive. So tomorrow, I will be with my confused, sick father while my mother and sister are at Dana Farber having their first meeting with her five new doctors. I am reeling. I alternate between total denial, and being overwhelmed. My poor mother. She has been my sister's rock.. and my father's partner.... and now she is trying to be both. Please consider sending my family your most positive thoughts as we navigate this hard reality. The good news now: in spite of my breast pain, the tests found NO mets and no reason for concern. Turns out I had an infection running rampant. Peg, I leave for the UK on May 20th... but I should be here on the 19th if you want to have breakfast together. Leanne, have a wonderful vacation. Tina, you ROCK!!! Sandra, thank you for the report of your London weekend. have a great trip to Cyprus! Maxine, good to hear your news..... and that is all I can remember. Sorry, can't concentrate.  Take care all... *susan* ",

We took a sleeper train with a berth, and a working sink in the cabin! At the wedding there were lots of men in kilts, salmon prepared five ways, venison, cousins, friends, and lots of scottish dancing. How much fun. We were so far north, that the sun didn't go down until about 11:30 pm. We enjoyed traveling around the North of Scotland for several days. I managed to drive on the left with a stick shift without banging into anything! My father is not recovering from surgery well. He is in a nursing home now trying to get stronger. He has simply lost huge blocks of his memory. I am not sure where this will end up. I have just returned from spending two days with him, and though he is now able to walk, his mental state is so changed. My sister had her surgery, and is recovering really well. She can actually talk, and is fully understandable. She is relearning how to swallow, and I have spent a night with her, and made poached salmon and overcooked fresh pasta, and she was able to eat this. Yesterday was her set of checkups and she heard her pathology report. The lymph involvement was greater than expected, so they will add another chemo to her cocktail. For her, chemo is a radiology enabler. They say that the chemo will get the cancer dancing, and the radiation will zap it. She will start this next phase in two weeks. Since returning from Scotland, I have only spent two nights [not consecutive] at home. There is so much need right now. But I will stay put for a little bit since Lauren is coming home from her year abroad this weekend, and I will need to help her get re-settled in the parental house. Now, I am going to crawl into my bed and try to get rested again. *susan* ",

Life has been pretty overwhelming here since I returned. Lots of traveling between patients. Spent much of last week with my sister, taking her back and forth to the hospital. She had surgery for a PEG tube [oh yuck], didn't do well with the pre-surgery drugs and then a week later developed a terrible infection. Unfortunately, my sister lives one hour from my house. So each time, I drive an hour to her house, an hour back to the hospital [which is 3 miles from my house], back out to her house, and then back to mine. Four hours per trip! Today, she has her first radiation and Monday will begin the weekly chemo infusions. At this point, my Mom is taking over her care for the most part. I will be responsible for her for only about 3 days, and we actually don't expect her to need anything on those days. Phew! Good news is the kid is home and already working at her two jobs. She hasn't lived with us full time in a couple of years now, and we have done a good job of readjusting all of our expectations. Peg, have a great photo shoot. Work is drying up around here. I may have to consider doing some travel to get more. Just the nature of the economy right now. Best to all..... ",

Otherwise, my life is just about making food for the family and for my sick uncle, working for clients and trying to enjoy our garden. The rain this month has been ridiculous. We have had so much rain, a three-day nor'easter.... all of us feel waterlogged. Have decided to go to a yearly conference in August and extend for a few days to do a small vacation. My husband's first time in SF. We are looking forward to having some time together. All the news from here. Gosh, my life is boring. ",

Okay. So the scans were not fun. Barium for breakfast is just disgusting. Then the contrast burst all over me and the floor. Totally ridiculous. Anyhow, saw the oncologist first on Thursday. Blood markers are still up, but down from last time. Scans are clean. We agreed that I would not have any more scans. I will not see him again for six months. And I was off to my mammo. The technician was so precise. She took so much time pushing and pulling. My poor surgical breast was truly put through the wringer, but she got the shots that she needed. I was off to see the surgeon. Well, her PA since I am not interesting anymore. And she made me wait for 40 minutes. By the time we went into the exam room I had reached the end of my patience rope. I turned down an MRI. At the end of the day, I just wanted to sit in a chair and cry. I have no idea why. Husband truly doesn't get it. This was all good news after all, but somehow it just drained me. I am just tired of looking for something to go wrong. I am willing to do blood tests, but I am refusing everything else. So, good news. I am having all the wrong responses, but am grateful and am backing out the system slowly! Nicole, sending all my thoughts..... *susan* ",

We were dx'ed with breast cancer at the same time; both stage IIb. Julie decided that chemo was poison, and chose an 'alternative' path. Obviously, I chose the western medicine route. We simply couldn't connect after that. She died yesterday a year after hitting stage 4, still traveling around the world trying every cure. I am angry.

You have been through the ringer, and for them to expect you to trust them, seems beyond the bounds of human nature. I don't know what to tell you about the anger. It is justified. But, it sounds like it is getting in the way, so maybe you can find someone to talk to. To this day, I wish I had talked with someone after my brother died. My anger management is NOT the recommended way! I hope that you can find some peace. You deserve it. *susan*  oh! p.s. love hearing from you, even when it isn't pretty. ",

I currently have mets in my lymph nodes and chest cavity. Waiting to schedule an appointment with my Onc to discuss the treatment options.

This isn't a result of anything but bad luck. Please note: I am not telling anyone about this.

I can't tell if this new amount of fatigue is my body's way of dealing with the stress and sadness, or the faslodex.  Telling my daughter was hard. She understood in waves what I was saying. As I finished she said \"So this will never go away?\" and just sobbed. But, I have decided that I am not telling my Mother, sisters, and family beyond husband and daughter until I am on a treatment plan that forces me to. It hasn't been easy to omit such a large piece of news from my conversations with them. I still think that this is the best plan for now. The gallbladder procedure was totally bogus. Wrong procedure for what ails me! By the time this became clear, the IV was in my veins and the drugs were flowing. Clearly, I will need to make sure that this never happens again. I will need to see a surgeon now, but I am not rushing. Next faslodex shot is next week. Will get my blood markers done then too, but it will be too early to tell if this new drug in the cocktail is having any effect. Today, I am 'running away from home'... going to visit a good friend who has moved to the Cape. A few days by the ocean before the season hits with someone that I love to laugh with. Really looking forward to this small break. *susan* ",

I gave my daughter permission to tell very close friends so that she would have a support system. I did the same with my husband, and only in the past few months has he chosen to do so. My daughter was 18 when I was first dx'ed, and 23 when I progressed. My mother was told that if she told a single soul without my permission, I would no longer communicate with her.

There are wildly outdated statistics, stories about side effects that seem too bad to be true, and medical sharmans. But this site is on a side street of the internet where compassion, honesty, and true caring can thrive. I too am on hormonals only, but my Stage IV dx came 5 years after the initial dx when I had the chemo, rads, and surgery. I am four months into this new progression and really hope that this pill plus a shot of Faslodex monthly is working. As far as treatments go, this is pretty easy. I am hoping for years if I can get them. So sorry you are here, but this is a wonderful group. And you are welcomed with open arms. *susan* ",

The hot and sour soup at Quindoa Garden is exactly what she is craving, so that is where I will go get her a quart.

Just makes me remember that I am a small piece of a much bigger world. The Mystic River works well too, and I plan to investigate the bike path over there soon. If I have a day or so, I head to the cape to visit friends, or north to the mountains. I can't climb those mountains anymore, but that doesn't matter. They give me a sense of well-being. Heck a trip to Revere Beach, with a stop at Kelly's or one of the Cambodian/Laoitian spots is fun. Or, I buy something a little special to make for dinner, even if it is just a nice bit of cheese. When it is warmer, a break, sitting in the garden with a cup of coffee reminds me that I am a really lucky person. For me, routine has always been a downer.

Thrown into menopause, forced to stare at your own mortality, grieving for a life changed forever, so very much. Talk with your doctor of course, but your current swings don't seem unjustifiable. If the latter, then it would seem that your new therapy is throwing your hormones and body for a loop, which of course it the whole point of estrogen therapy! Again, talk with your doctor.

But when it all becomes too overwhelming I need to change my environment in some way. If I have any energy, I go to the ocean and walk along the beach; or go to the North End of Boston and walk the streets listening to people speaking Italian. Or I might go to an ethnic market, buy anything that looks interesting and try to figure out how to make a tasty meal from ingredients whose names I can't pronounce. And then, when nothing else works, I call my friend Lucy on the Cape and tell her I need to run away from home. Being away from the phone, long walks along the beach with the Frisbee dog, and a place that is comfortable to put up my feet always seems to brighten my outlook. Best I can do... *susan* ",

How empty a life must this person have if they actually care to notice that some people use makeup to substitute for eyebrows?

Names that include Mom always stand out and I can't decide if you have a kid name Syr or live in Syria. What significance does your screen name have? 2. I vaguely recall that just before being diagnosed you went through a divorce. Is this true? If so, how are you managing as a newly-single person? Who is in your support system? What does your family look like? 3. Can you tell me about where you live? Is it rural, urban, suburban, cosmopolitan, old-fashioned, broad-minded? Would you ever consider living anywhere else? 4. What has been your cancer diagnosis/treatment from start to finish? 5. What do you like to do for fun or in your free time and has that changed since your stage 4 diagnosis? 6.

In fact, I couldn't imagine why she would be calling. She doesn't do scheduling either.  After the normal pleasantries she informed me that Dr. Roger, my wonderful oncologist, has taken a personal leave of absence with no known return date. When I questioned her, the tone of her voice led me to believe that this might very well be permanent. My world has been turned upside down. Dr. Roger and I have been together for 6 years. He is an outside the box thinker, who feels comfortable with my questions and thoughts. He considers me part of the team. And we have a great time talking about where to get really delicious ethnic foods for under $10 per person. With my blood markers rising, this is when I need Dr. Roger! I can't believe that I have lost this person from my medical team, if only for a few months. I am going to have to teach a new doctor who I am, and figure out her priorities, and hope that I don't piss her off, plus trust someone new. Nurse Lauren remains as my PA, Nurse Linda continues as my oncology nurse, but I have been transfered to Dr. Christina. She is very young. Has the perfect resume. Dr. Christina wants scans. She isn't Dr. Roger. Blood work and Faslodex will remain the same for next week, but I won't meet my new doctor until the scan results are back. After the call was over, I burst into tears. I didn't really realize how I felt, don't cry easily so this clearly has me upset. I did my business conference call and did what anyone would do- took a nap.

Our circumstances are different. I am almost 10 years older than you. I have a husband though I have been the primary wage earner for most of our lives together. My house is a reasonable neighborhood and might actually sell. 1. I am going to work as long as I possibly can. I don't have any disability options besides SSDI, and by definition, SSDI will be a lot less money than earned income. Plus I like to work. 2. Retirement funds will be essential after you stop working. Once you are declared disabled, those funds will be available to you as a monthly income with no penality. By not paying taxes on that money now, while your income is healthy, is actually a pretty big savings. We have to change our definition of retirement which takes a bit of head turning. I would continue to invest in a retirement fund as long as you are working, and don't need the cash for other uses. 3. I too bought a fixer house, and we have begun really fixing it up. Though my husband likes to pretend that he can make more money so that we can stay in this house, my practical side knows that the overhead will be too much when I am no longer a fully functional income generator. So, I am not planning to put the house on the market, but I want it to be ready to show when that becomes the only option. Your case sounds more complicated however since your capital has been lowered through home ownership. You will have to weigh the pros and cons of ownership, keeping both financial and emotional components in the mix. 4. I have begun researching less expensive areas of the country to move to when things here begin to decline. My criteria has been near a major medical center, not too cold in the winter or too hot in the summer, and near a \"hub\" airport. And relatively cheap to live. [There aren't many places that fit this criteria, I am sad to say.] Support systems and friends are all good, but in reality, we all rely on ourselves to get through this. 5. There are a few other things that I have done to prepare. Too specific for this post. I am planning for the worst while striving to be present and joyful in daily life. It took me a long time to get here though. It sounds like you are well on your way to getting there. All the best, *susan* ",

For me, it turns out that my ER expression is the \"B\" expression, so Faslodex works for me, while the Aromasin which I was on when I presented with mets and targets the \"A\" expression. Sadly, there is no test yet to determine which expression is the one that needs to be blocked. *susan* ",

I felt like crap, hated life and was on the verge of an emotional breakdown daily. I hope that as your body refreshes itself from the radiation, your spirits are raised and that you feel emotionally better.

My new primary, nicknamed \"sperm of the devil\", is just like this young doctor in the interview. She is simply too young to have had any experience in real life at all and is so damn sure that she is a gift to humankind that she can't imagine anyone with a different life experience. Fundamentally, she has absolutely no empathy. But it is a slippery slope. My oncologist believes that at least half of her early stage ER+ patients are non-compliant with their hormonal drugs. So, when they present with mets, should she not treat them since they didn't comply? Many of us [with the exception of Ann] have gained weight on these hormonal drugs and/or steroids but we all know that increases our risk of mets. Do you not treat overweight people for mets since \"they brought in on themselves\" or \"anyone can loose weight?\" I believe we are heading into a time when medical care will be withheld from those that make choices that aren't in their best interest. Or were forced into unhealthy environments by their lack of resources. Or just make one stupid mistake. We already deny people without money health care. Not such a great leap to believe that other barometers will be used in the future. I think this is a very complicated subject with no \"right\" answer. People far smarter than I can't find the balance, but it is a discussion that is clearly happening. *susan* ",

It weakens you and then you have to get back your strength while now taking the hormonals. There is no hiding that you have cancer. Your life has to be scaled back. It altered my body in ways that I am still aware of. Knowing what I know now, if I had been diagnosed Stage IV from the start, I would not have chosen the chemo first. Of course, that isn't how my life has played out and I don't have any regrets. Good luck making your decision. *susan* ",

It makes huge assumptions about our culteral references, gender identity, and doesn't really have a place on the Stage IV forum. *susan* ",

You would refill via the app so that it knows how many refills are left. Perhaps send an alert 15, 10 and 5 days before you need to refill, and maybe even emails the prescribing physician to prompt a reorder? More ideas encouraged... this could be a great tool for those of us managing multiple RX's with different refill dates. *susan* p.s. Maybe I should start a new thread for this.",

Or they could just be high today. Faslodex is different than Femara. It prevents the receipt of the estrogen expression B, while Femara prevents the creation of estrogen expression A. Since I am on both aromasin and Faslodex, targetting both expressions, I can't tell you which of my side effects are a result of either drug singly or combination. However, overall, it is not a bad treatment at all. Though this repeats what is in the \"sticky\" Hormone thread , there are a few tricks to reducing the pain of the injection. You should absolutely NOT ALLOW them to do the injections until the syringe has reached room temperature. EVER. It generally takes about 30 minutes for the drug to warm up. you can speed that up by holding the syringe in your hand. Generally, the shot is given while one is standing. Each shot will be given in a cheek butt. While they do cheek left, position your body so that your weight is on the right leg. And then switch for the other shot. Lately, I have found that I do better when the shot is given in the upper portion of my ever-expanding butt. Work with your nurse to come up with the best spot for you, assuming you get the same nurse every month. We hope that you will have many months of NED to test different spots. And for comparison, my markers were 44 at dx. 118 when we found the mets, and now hang out around 77. Scans don't find anything. My strange way of dealing with this is I imagine that the 77 means that my body is actively fighting off the cancer... so I don't have active mets but they are trying to find a hospitible spot. [Yea, weird I know, but it helps me as I take these drugs.] Wow, this was wordy... I hope it is a bit of a help. *susan* ",

There are things that others can do for you to free up your time for the good stuff. [of course, you do have to decide what the good stuff is!] Grocery shopping is a huge time and energy sucker. Keep a list. Have a friend pick up your list when they are headed to the store, do your shopping, keeping a separate receipt and you pay them for the cost of the groceries. This is really common around here, and often there will be someone buying for up to 5 people. Yes it slows down the checkout line, but really, why would you care? This friend also needs to be non-judgmental. If you put chocolate chip, carmel swirl ice cream on the list, NO COMMENTS. Sometimes mets needs some ice cream. Apple picking... as an example. Is it picking the apples or the making of the pie that appeals to you most? Pick one, and find someone, even your husband perhaps, who can do the other part. Not enough energy to make the crust, add it to the aforementioned shopping list. Teaching the young one to read. Could you \"supervise\" one of the older kids taking this on? All of you snuggled in a chair or on the bed? It is hard not to beat ourselves up. We KNOW what we want to do on a daily basis. We just can't always DO it. I am finding that if I look at my life in weekly batches instead of daily ones, I can find more room to be gentle with myself and my expectations. Does this make any sense? *susan* ",

My father renovated a sun porch for her, creating a fully assessibe bath and bedroom. All the doorways on the first floor were already wide enough for the chair. Dad built the bathroom so that the chair could roll into the shower and over the toilet. She was able to take care of her own personal needs. Things we found useful: 1. long tongie things so she could pull items off of shelves, or from kitchen cabinets  2. a plastic seat shifter.... this was a plastic seat that one could use to get into the car. you faced it towards the car door, sit on it, and then it could swivle to look forward 3. we ramped the house. neighbors complained and we could have cared less 4. back in those days it was novel, but we had a remote control for the TV 5. a desk on wheels that had an adjustable height. She used it to hold books, etc, nowadays it would be good for a laptop 4. at the bottom of the ramp, we created a shaded patio so she could easily go outside in good weather. The world is an easier place now for people in wheelchairs. This was back in the early 1980's. She had to be carried into Symphony Hall to listen to a concert. Even the hospital wasn't fully wheelchair friendly. As I type this, it amazes me that my father did all of this work for his sister in law. Maybe your house can accommodate some of these fittings to make your life easier. All the best, *susan* p.s. if you want to send that same Dad some positive vibes, he is currently in ICU unable to breath on his own following an open heart surgery, please feel free. ",

I got to NED with a combination of Faslodex and Aromasin. During my early stage dx, I used up half my lifetime A/C's. To have demanded chemo when it wasn't medically neccessarily would have reduced my options later when the mets were more plentiful. My doctors consider their decisions to be based on an intimate understanding of MY tumors and they consider the treatments that I am receiving to be aggressively going after my cancer. The real question is what will work for each patient based on their tumor load, response to previous treatments, and tumor personality. All of these treatments are aggressive. *susan* ",

Your normal blood marker number will be different than mine, or anyone elses. Following surgery I was a 44 and presumably there was no cancer in my body at that moment in time. After chemo it fell to 35 and sat there for 3 years. Bouncing a little, but always between the 35 and 44. Technically, this is high, but it appears that this number is my bottom. Since then, in the past 18 months my markers have gone up first steadily and then quickly. I am now above 150. At 66, they did a series of scans and found no cancer activity. 6 months later I was at 117, and the scans started again. This time the mets showed up. The oncologist concludes that chances are the mets were there at 66, but not yet visible. I consider myself lucky that the blood markers are a good indicator of activity. So, I believe that the usefulness of blood markers has to do with direction not actual numbers, but only if your markers actually respond to cancer. Hope this helps, *susan* ",

My first three months of Faslodex I had increased fatigue and felt vaguely sick, like a cold, for about 10 days. I was napping at 11am for a few quick minutes and then again in the late afternoon. This month I don't feel these effects, but maybe I am just so elated to see those markers going down, I am not noticing! My injection sites do hurt. Quite a bit. More than most I think. But I haven't felt any strange sensations that aren't butt-related.

We did not consider any of our family members to be the right choice, so we ended up selecting a friend. But when they adopted a child, they asked not to be in our will. It took us some time, but we were able to get another couple to agree to be the designated guardian. Of course, I have no idea if my family [or my husband's] would have fought that choice in court. I rather think so. That is one of the things that pisses me off. If I am dead, it isn't possible to explain/defend/fight for my own choices!

And I will say that the medical profession has some really smart people; far smarter than the two of us. If solving the cure for breast cancer was a simple as having a scan, we would all get scans.

The ACA has not been changed with this new administration. Nothing has been passed in Congress to change the ACA. Having a pre-existing conditions does not mean that you can not get insurance, nor do you pay more than your peers. Depending on which state you plan to return to, your choices for health insurance plans [self-pay] can be very good or wretched. Choose your state wisely. Even the most draconian proposals for changing the ACA, which do not have enough votes to pass, will continue to allow people with illness to continue to buy insurance if they have been covered for the previous year. BUT, those changes have NOT been voted into law. Some states have accepted extra money so that if you return without a job, you might very well be heavily subsidized. I have no employer. I have never had an employer. I have always had self-pay and I have insurance that has covered absolutely all of my treatments. That said, insurance is expensive and will probably become more so now that the IRS has been told to NOT apply the penalties for not having insurance. *susan*  EDITED to ADD: Every single one of us is covered under the ACA, regardless of who pays for the coverage. The ACA dictates who and what must be covered as a minimum.",

Numerous cancers, maternal aunt who was diagnosed at 36 with breast cancer and died at 46, in addition to being the only woman beside this aunt who hadn't had ovaries removed due to unusual growths. The genetics counselor created a family tree and made notations on each stick figure about their health history. It was actually a fair amount of work to assemble the required information. After the meeting the genetics counselor, who is also an oncologist, calculated that I had an 18% chance of a BRCA anomoly, and so the test was approved. First report indicated that I was not BRCA positive but that there was a gene expression which was \"off\" but with unknown consequences. Two years later I received a second report expressing that my \"off\" was now understood, and was unrelated to breast cancer or cancer of any kind. Without a family history of \"female\" cancers, generally this test is not performed, I assume based on both the cost and the fact that only 5% of breast cancer is attributable to BRCA. My assumption is that there will be other indicators within our DNA, but the research is still in its infancy. Hope this helps, *susan* ",

This is our place to vent, spew, whine, complain, celebrate and support. *susan* ",

Assuming that you eat meat, you start with a basic chicken stock cooked with scallions and ginger, and from there, you can do so many things. A basic noodle soup with some cabbage, all the way to a fancy soup with grilled pork, mushrooms, green onions and cabbage. Take some of the same stock and simmer with a pork bone, and you intensify the flavor. One of my most favorite soups is a Vietnamese Pho, a rich beef broth with sliced beef, Thai basil, sprouts, and some other condiments that you can choose to add. Making Pho does take some time and the cost of beef bones has skyrocketed lately so this has become a special occasion soup.  And then of course there is Miso soup, Japan's great gift to the world. This is the fastest and easiest soup in the world to make, if you can find the ingredients nearby.  Of course these soups don't cure cancer, but I find that I feel stronger and sated when I make these soups part of my regular diet. I will be happy to post my chicken stock process for you later, if that interests you. Hope this helps, *soup susan* ",

Use the gentler treatments as long as possible, before moving to the chemo track. If your sister is lucky, she will be able to use different hormonal treatments for years. These treatments actually do work for some! I am stable on a combination of two hormonal treatments. In my dream world, I hope to get five years from this combination. As chainsawz stated, there is no cure for what ails us. For me, this isn't a fight but a complex chess match where I hope that my doctors and I can out play the cancer for as long as possible. John Hopkins is considered to be one of the best hospitals in the country. Nothing in your post indicates that you must have a second opinion, but of course that is your sister's decision. Sorry that she has moved into our little world. I would recommend that she consider joining this group.

If you do choose to play along, please post YOUR new questions for one of our fellow forum members within the next three days. 1. You are still working at the age of 70 which is impressive for anyone, much less someone well past the \"traditional\" retirement age. What kind of work do you do? Do you do it because you love it, or because you need the income, or both? If you could retire tomorrow, would you? 2. Over the past year, you have had some physical challenges and have needed pain meds and hydration. There may have been more, but my memory fails me. Are you still managing the side effects of your treatment or have you found the right mix of medication to keep them under control? 3. Who is your support system? Do you have a significant other, children, extended family, and/or chosen family? Who among them makes you smile? 4. And speaking of smiling, what gives you joy in your daily life? What do you look forward to? 5. Do you live in the United States? If not, where are you located? If you are, what region? Can you help build a picture of what it is like where you live? I love to imagine the countryside and architecture of people's home areas. Have you always lived there or did you choose this location for some particular reason. 6. As always, the bonus question is-- what was I not clever enough to ask that you would like us to know? Can't wait to hear your responses! *susan* anotherplan.blogspot.com... and its back.

At the risk of sounding way too practical and not warm and fuzzy enough, do you have a legal agreement with this partner above and beyond your co-mortgage? Are you eq ually responsible for this mortage [50/50] or is there a different distribution? I am going to assume you are not able to buy this person out, so have you considered hiring a lawyer to sue her for breach of contract? Is your area in a deep real estate slump or is there any chance of selling the property for the value of the mortgage? I can't imagine going through this. Whatever feelings you once had for this person will need to be put to the side and you have to fight for your family's best interests. This could include sueing so you can garnish her wages [after all she is ascending!] Sue above mentioned getting other investors, who perhaps could buy in at less than full value [i.e. .20 on the dollar.] This is the perfect place to post this I think.

As you can imagine, I had many of your same fears about the scar. Heck when the doctor marked my neck in the pre-OP I actually asked him if it was legal to cut someone like that! Post-surgery I looked like an extra from Sweeney Todd. But, my surgeon was an artist and did the incision in one of my ever-increasing neck creases. Within 6 months, it had faded to a slightly different color. At two years out, it is almost impossible to find. I wore a scarf for the first year [though I wear them pretty frequently anyhow] and the only person who mentioned the scar had a matching one to show me. In my case, they reinserted the parathyroids since my problem was Graves disease [hypo.] If you want the name of my surgeon here in Boston, send me a PM. *susan* p.s. And the ONLY area of the body that this surgeon touches is the neck region; a true specialist. Hundreds a year.... at a major hospital.",

From there you can visit quite a few historic sites [if that is what you are interested in] associated with the Revolutionary War. If Maine is your real love, I would probably consider using Portsmouth, NH as a base. This is wonderful town with lots of places in town where you can walk to find a restaurant, etc. A bit farther north is Portland, ME which is also a funky little city with lots of places to walk, etc. Either of these spots would be great places to use as exploring bases.

You first began posting here on bco.org in February of this year, but stated that you have been fighting breast cancer since 1996. That is a long time indeed. What did that fight looked like for you? 2. Before you \"retired\" what kind of jobs did you have? I know that cancer cost you your last two positions, but I don't know what you did in your professional life. 3. Your online portfolio of artwork is quite breath-taking. Do you have any formal training as a visual artist or are you self-taught? What are your artistic inspirations? How did you find your studio partner? 4. I haven't travelled around Oregon much. Just driven some of the coastline and gone to a conference in Portland. Can you tell us about Estacada, OR? Is is a rural area? Small towns? Is it flat or hilly? Can you see mountains or the ocean? 5. And finally, all of Deuce's fans want to know, how did you come to live with so many animals? How much land do you have to house them? Did you get a herd of goats or did you add them one by one? Did you milk them and make cheese or did they just wander about enjoying their lives? 6.

As to a cancer insurance plan, I don't think it will pay out until your reports remove the word \"suspicious.\" But I could be wrong about that one. It might be sufficient if your onc begins to treat you are someone with mets, and is willing to say so on an insurance report. My mets were not biopsied.

Does it mean a chemo that makes you sicker than another or what? I see that you are on Xeloda. In my world that seems aggressive. I, for one, am thrilled that my simple Faslodex treatments are working. I don't really want anything more powerful than what is needed. I am not going for a cure; I don't believe that there is one. I do want a life that is as normal as possible for as long as possible. When I was first diagnosed, I was hit with the big guns and clearly they didn't work! To me it is a miracle that one shot a month can be so powerful. It seems that you should have a chat, a serious chat, with your oncologist if you don't think s/he is doing enough.

I will say that with minimal mets, if your friend is ER+ there could be the option that aromatese inhibitors could keep her stable for quite a few years. Doesn't work for everyone, but these treatments are much gentler than chemo. Sounds like your friend needs both a good oncologist along with some other services.

I have been to services at an art center, armoury [decommissioned], and in a living room. You really can't rent a church, and most churches would expect that you would have been a member [or a survivor that is sponsoring the service was a member.] If you think of all the places that people have weddings, it might give you some other ideas: boat houses, historic homes, on a beach, in a coutry club or housing association club house, or art museum. Heck, I think you could rent a private room at a restaurant, serve a meal, and have people speak or just tell stories. I am still working on this one. I want it to be a place that reflects who I was in life, and allows people to speak with love and joy with each other. To be honest, if we can still afford this house, I figure it should happen right here. But if we have had to move for mobility reasons, [or financial], I will need to find another spot. For me, it will also need to be a place that makes my husband and kid comfortable. After all, they are the ones who actually have to be there. *susan*",

Only 5 hrs away, and yet, I have never been. The plan is to hop in the car, and just plain go. But, I have a bigger trip planned... just not sure how or when. Stopping in Paris to see all my new cousins, then working my way through Provence one more time, into Italy. Then taking a ferry to Greece, and finally, heading towards Istanbul to visit yet more cousins. I would love to take three months to do this, but I suspect we will never have enough cash for that.

The depression was hard on them, but the kicker was the huge flood of 1934 [I think.] It wiped out all the machinery on the first and second floors of the riverfront factories. That combined with the rise of unions was the death knell for this industry in the Northeast. At that point they moved to Georgia [towels], Burlington, NC, etc. So why doesn't the Southeast have the same BC rates along those river towns? I am convinced that environmental issues are a trigger for this disease. In fact, I suspect it is the trigger for many diseases. I just can't square this author's statement with my intimate knowledge of Cape Cod and Long Island [which was mostly agricultural.] I think that any compound that is created by industry should be tested extensively. This is not a view shared by industry, of course. *susan*",

The concerns about treatment side effects have been _my_ concerns, not the doctors which is why I am not on aromasin any longer. My oncologist's primary concern seems to be that since I have such an \"indolent\" version of this disease, she doesn't want me to have scans too often. She is worried about too much radiation! I live with the long term side effects of aromasin daily and they really do suck. I have been off that drug for 18 months, so I guess this is what I have to live with.",

There are women on this site who are vegans, fat, skinny, fancy houses with no toxins, power lines, some sex, lots of sex, children, no children, breast fed or didn't (and you can add a ton more attributes.) My suspicion is that the elements that cause cancer are so complicated that the medical profession has only begun to scratch the surface. Family history is a far smaller component than most people think. So sorry that your Mom has breast cancer and is so fearful. Perhaps she can join this site and see how many of us are living full lives even in the face of the Beast. *susan* ",

Unless you want to spend your whole vacation driving, it will be one or the other. But, I think I can get you something that is a compromise.

You ask you current onc if they know anyone at the new facility, or at least if they will make a call to \"transfer\" you. Doctor to Doctor is always going to be the most seamless transition. In LA, I assume you are considering UCLA or Cedar-Sinai. They both have a breast care center with a coordinator. If you need to transfer yourself, I would start by calling the coordinator, and have them help you transfer your records, etc. This is not like being accepted to college. They are hospitals. They need patients. You are a patient, and assuming you have some kind of health insurance, I can't imagine that being accepted will be difficult. I would start this process at least 6 weeks before you are actually planning to move, and have an appointment on the books before you leave WI. The new facility may insist on new scans and bloodwork, or maybe not. The more information they have in advance, the easier it should be. However, I would have a second copy of all your records with you in case they are misplaced or sent too late. Hope this helps. *susan*",

You clearly don't have enough of it. There is nothing more stressful than not having enough money to cover the basics. I am not a big \"new-agie\" kind of gal. I don't believe stress caused my cancer, but I do think that it makes it harder to get stronger. You seem to live in what I consider to be \"the middle of nowhere\" so I don't know what resources you might have at your disposal. But, I think you need help. In Massachusetts utility companies are forbidden from turning off the power during the winter months. If your heat is gas, the same thing applies. There is no \"basement\" for those of us who heat with oil though. Maybe NY has the same type of regulations. Are there any emergency groups in your area? Perhaps you can get food from a food bank for a couple of months so that you can divert those funds to your furnace? There might be a county agency that has emergency funds for \"disabled\" people to get help with heating. Even the Red Cross might know where to get some assistance. We aren't that many paychecks away from needing assistance. It wasn't so long ago when we made choices between food and antibiotics, so I really undestand how hard this is to manage. You may not get a break, but you might be able to find one. All the best, *susan* - who if she had even an extra penny, would send some cash your way. ",

I don't use coupons to be honest.... the coupons that arrive in the Sunday paper are not for ingredients, but for processed foods. Ways we try to save money. We reviewed our cable bill and pared it down to what my husband considers to be the essentials. In September we will not renew our cell phone contracts, and instead will go on a pre=pay plan since we are not getting enough value for our monthly cost. We keep the house VERY cold. We close the doors to the rooms that we don't have to use and turn off their radiators. We have reduced the amount of meat that we eat to about 4 oz a day, and in general do not eat the three-part meals anymore. We make everything from scratch with very few exceptions. Since there are only two of us in the house now, I make larger pots of everything and freeze the leftovers already portioned. We buy household goods like paper towels at a warehouse store, along with many food items. Again we utilize that freezer. [Best investment ever if you have a place to put it!] This summer we are refurbishing a bathroom so we can rent out a room. Turns out this room is worth $650.00 a month for a single occupant! If we rent to an ESL student, the income isn't taxable. I don't buy clothes. Gaining weight is simply not an option anymore. Last year my personal budget was $235 and that is only because I had to attend a wedding with two events. My husband buys clothes more frequently, but will only purchase something that is at least 60% off. When we do splurge, it tends to be a raw ingredient that we can make at home like a steak. But we still only eat a bit at that first meal. The next day, we will have a big green salad with some of the leftovers, and then the next day it appears in a burrito. I think this is really hard for the kids. It is hard to be the one \"without.\" When our child was still living with us, we would give her a budget for \"special\" things, and in her head she bought a gazillion things. And then she would buy the thing that gave her the most pleasure, but she felt like she had bought and returned all those other items. For some reason this helped her not feel deprived. Nothing here that you haven't considered already. Maybe it helps to know that you are not alone with this financial squeeze. *susan* ",

My hospital has an \"on time\" policy. If for any reason [and sometimes I have been that reason] the doctor can not see you at your scheduled time, a nurse is sent to the waiting room to tell you exactly what is happening and a vague why. My oncologist, who I saw every 6 months for a few years, would spend 30 minutes with me. The first 20 minutes were mostly chatting about how I felt, any new ethnic restaurants we had tried, and whatever else seemed to come up. Then there was a 5 minute physical exam, and ending with writing up the lab request and any scans that he thought might be needed. The month that I reported a lot of pains and concerns, he and his PA jumped into overdrive and had me in a scanner within 24 hrs. My time with my oncologist was never a waste. My only regret is that we got a little too casual about spacing, but two months would not have made a difference. I wish all of you had a doctor that shows such great concern about the patient in the room at that moment. *susan*  p.s. and no waiting for lab results. Just log onto their website, run your credentials, and there they all are. ",

And DH is a wonderful acronym. Some days it means Dear Husband, but other days, yes, it does mean Damn Husband. I always assume the first unless it is preceded by something like scumbag. *susan*",

Depending on when she did the anti-hormonals, and whether or not she responded, there might be new options available to her such as Faslodex, Faslodex with Ibrance, or Femara with Ibrance. Even if they didn't work long term for her, they might give her heart a break. Doxil is an \"old\" chemo that has some of the same properties as adriamyacin, but I think it might be a bit more gently. Worth asking. Same with affinitor, I don't know how that affects the heart. I think it is also coupled with an anti-hormonal drug. That is what I have.... just suggestions that require more research. Wish I could be more helpful. *susan*",

If it makes you feel any better, my Faslodex/Aromasin hair loss is happening on my eyebrows. Damn, even my husband noticed. This disease just takes way too much of our dignity. *susan* ",

They ordered some ultrasound scans of my uterus and ovaries and made an appointment with a GYN/OB who specializes in female cancers. The tests found nothing. There were no cancerous cells in the blood. And it never happened again so we checked it off the list as \"bizarre\" and moved onto chemo no 2.

      "Content": "susan_02143 wrote: Dr Roger, my oncologist and friend, died on January 19, 2012. The inside of my bones feel cold. He so deserved to have a retirement with his wife. At 68, his life was cut far too short. His leave of absence has been hard for me to deal with; his death seems too cruel to absorb. = Roger Frederick Lange, one of Boston's pre-eminent hematologists and oncologists, died January 19, 2012 from complications of multiple myeloma. He was known for his keen intellect, expansive knowledge, excellent judgment, and outstanding personal care of his patients, and over his career became one of the most sought after cancer clinicians in Boston.  Dr. Lange served as a faculty member of the Harvard Medical School for 37 years, and was a source of inspiration and a role model, devoting as much care and energy to training young physicians as he did to taking care of his patients.  Born in 1943 in Chicago, Roger was a graduate of Chicago's South Shore High School class of 1961 where he excelled in baseball and basketball. He graduated from Harvard College, summa cum laude, in 1961, and from the Harvard Medical School, cum laude, in 1969.  Dr. Lange was selected to join the Residency program in Internal Medicine at Beth Israel Hospital, and thereafter served at the National Institutes of Health under Dr. Raphael Shulman. In 1973, Roger was a post-doctoral hematology/oncology fellow at Washington University in St. Louis, and in 1974, he assumed the role of Chief Resident in Medicine at the Beth Israel Hospital.  Roger has been a member of the hospital staffs of both the Beth Israel and the Mount Auburn Hospitals since the mid-1970s. He became Chief of the Division of Hematology-Oncology at the Mount Auburn Hospital, and remained on the staff of both medical centers until the time of his death. His reputation as a \"go-to clinician\" and \"doctor's doctor\" was quickly established, as was his role as a medical educator. He was named as one of \"Boston's Best Doctors\" by Boston Magazine at least five times during his career, including in 2011. His patients treasured the time they spent with him because he treated each of them with respect and genuinely enjoyed their company. No matter how difficult the news he had to deliver, Roger always managed to have patients feel better leaving the office than they did entering it. The only part of Roger's life that was more important to him than his role as a physician and teacher was his family. He instilled in them his values, his enthusiasm for life's pleasures, and his sense of humor. Despite his busy schedule, he never missed his children's recitals, school plays, or sporting events, or Lois's chamber music events and performances. He and Lois made bicycling trips to several continents and every part of the U.S., sometimes biking one hundred miles a day. He made us all understand the importance of getting things exactly right \u2013 whether it was through driving around town for hours looking for the right size, shape, brand or color for whatever it was he was fixing, or solving any other problem, big or small.  Roger was blessed with many friends from each stage of his life.  He lived with joy, compassion, and the highest regard for others, and was widely admired for his honesty, loyalty, moustache, and especially for his sense of humor. Roger's approach to life was embodied in the advice he gave to the nearly one thousand cancer patients and family members attending the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center's annual \"Celebration of Life\" event. Urging them to continue to live life to the fullest, out came \"Just remember, cancer, shmancer, as long as you've got your health!\"  He is survived by his childhood sweetheart and wife of more than forty-four years, Lois (Platt) Lange, son David M. Lange, daughter Nancy Lange Vaidya, daughter-in-law Bernadette Lee, son-in-law Anand Vaidya and his two beloved granddaughters, Maia Vivienne Lange (15 months) and Usha Ranjani Vaidya (3 weeks). He is also survived by his brother, Paul Lange, of Rehoboth, Delaware. anotherplan.blogspot.com... and its back. May 3, 2010 mets found.

How do you feel about Dr. Primary?  If you feel comfortable with both or one of them, ask THEM for a referral to a different oncologist. If I recall correctly, you drive into the city for work everyday. Surely there are great oncologists in such a large metropolitan area. This is a big website. There are over 65,000 members. Start posting in EVERY thread asking people from your area to give you suggestions re: oncs that are paying attention to them near you. I understand that your insurance might limit who you can see, but surely there is more than one practice that you can get into? And, under the circumstances, if you found an \"out of network\" person that you trusted, you might be able to fight your insurance company to cover them. That is what the Patient Law folks can do. [I will leave it to EnglishMajor to post the website link.] I had a great primary when I was first dx'ed in 2005. Then she went on medical leave and her partner took my case. He misdiagnosed me TWICE!!!! Sent me to great specialists but not for the right body parts. Almost cost me my life. This, my dear friend, is worth fighting for. {{{{big hug}}}} *susan* ",

If her response seems totally out of character, she really might need to try a therapist. And the first one might not be the right one.

I did four of those infusions way back when I was stage II. Emend is your best friend. Follow the drug regimen religiously. For me, the key was eating tiny meals, every two hours. My routine was oatmeal at 8am. At 10, a small smoothie.... especially the yogurt. Noon was a \"standard\" meal such as mini quiche, meatball with spaghetti, high protein and high carb. 2pm I would eat a boiled egg. 4pm was something like a mini-quiche. Dinner at 6pm was a small piece of meat with something like a mashed potato. 8pm, gosh, I can't remember..... and then I crawled into bed. I made all of this food during the steroid boost I got during the first three days. I was a cooking fool. Other things I remember are spanikopita [from Costco], a bagel with smoked salmon, more yogurt with frozen fruit, chicken stew with biscuits [ina garten on food network.com], tenderloin steaks on the grill, etc. This is a fairly rigorous protocol, but hundreds of thousands of women have done it as lower stage patients. You can do it! *susan* p.s. I also walked the local supermarket during A/C. Helped keep my energy level up, and man did I learn where everything was displayed. I did the store twice which was a mile. It was winter so walking outside seemed too scary with ice and snow.",

At this point, we added a single dose of Faslodex. After 14 months of this, I was declared NED, and changed to a double dose of Faslodex. My side effects have been bone pain, joint pain, neuropathy, fatigue.. at varying degrees. I don't take pain meds, but I sometimes have to take a short nap. Overall, this protocol is pretty easy, and getting to NED makes a few pains seem irrelevant. *susan* ",

My cancer is slow and stupid. [Not stupid enough to go away during my first set of treatments though.] My treatments are easy in comparison to the barage of chemos you have been on. Of course, none of us can tell you when enough is enough. I am sorry that your cancer hasn't been responding to the treatments. I am sorry that you are in pain. But please, don't call yourself a wimp. Clearly you are a strong and confident woman who has withstood side effects with some grace. My only suggestion is to have a palliative team in place to help you with the side effects. Perhaps your hospital has some specialists who can make this all a bit easier for you. *susan* ",

[Figure there has to be some benefit to having mets after all!] Another high fat meal 4-5 hours before the scan. No dairy or sugar. Upon arrival they take you to a \"quiet room\" where they test your blood sugar levels. If they are low enough, you get the radioactive injection and sit, quietly for an hour. My place allows me to work on the computer or read, but other women aren't allowed to do a thing. After the hour has passed you are taken to the machine. At my place, they no longer tie you onto the board. Instead you lie on your back, they put a wedge under the knees, and ask if you can put your arms over your head. 35 minutes later it is done. Again, my hospital does this test in a sun filled room. To be honest, I sleep now. Tech Andrew says that it isn't unusual. Oh... and I bring my own pajama bottoms since I hate the hospital ones.

To refresh, my scan three months ago showed that my original mets which had been MIA for four years, were back with a few new ones, and that vague changes noted on the Left Rib, could be a fracture. The chest wall and pleura lining mets have grown and made babies. Well, as I suspected, it was no fracture in my rib either. That one has grown as well. And since that isn't enough good news for one day, my right rib [which I have been complaining about for 18 months] is also popping up little mets. There is also something on my liver. They called it a focal point, with no measurement. The recommendation is that I should have an MRI to evaluate since the PET doesn't do a great job imaging the liver. {SHIT SHIT SHIT!] She is putting me on Xeloda, an oral chemo. Silly her, she suggested I take it with me on my big Window-of-Opportunity trip, but I declined. After she adjusted to the fact that I was actually leaving, she agreed that starting a chemo in a country where I certainly do not speak the language, much less the medical language, was nuts and we can wait until my return. Instead, I had another set of Faslodex shots so that the cancer didn't get six weeks to get stronger. I will have an MRI on the 26th, another oncologist meeting on the 28th, and start the new treatment as soon as I receive the drugs from the specialty pharmacy. I was not expecting regression, I am not surprised about the first rib met being for real, but am quite devastated that there is already another one on the other side and possible liver involvement. *susan*",

However, the MRI found two new mets, L3 and L5, on the spine which popped up during my great Window of Opportunity tour. [Absolutely no regrets on the trip.] Dr. Christina then gave me a choice of starting a different non-chemo line of treatment: femara with Ibrance, leaving Xeloda for another day. I absolutely chose this option. Have started the femara, and am waiting for the approval/arrival of the Ibrance. I have high hopes for this combination, assuming my blood counts can withstand the drug. Still need to figure out when/if it is the right time to stop working. As a sole proprietor there are no leaves, STD, etc, and my clients pay me to solve problems so I need to be sharp and available. Training/advising a replacement will take time and effort.

Most of them can't ever remember that I am a patient and not another patient's daughter or granddaughter. But about a year ago a younger woman started to volunteer. About my age, give or take a half dozen years, she has a pink ribbon on her name tag, self-identifying as a breast cancer patient. We have become friendly. She is bright, has great taste in clothing, and over the past year I have come to look forward to our short conversations in the waiting room. During the summer I didn't see her. To be honest, I imagined her summering on Martha's Vineyard, Dorset, Vermont, or one the numerous coastal cabin communities that dot the Atlantic Ocean here in New England. Of course, her real life might be taking care of an aging mother in a dreary mill town, but I like my fantasy better.   Anyhow, today she was back and I was quite pleased to see her. She allowed how she has been away and then asked how I had been. Somehow today's conversation probably went over some invisible line into more personal and I mentioned my carpal tunnel issues. She asked if I was XXXXXX on bc.org. I must have blanched since she asked permission to continue. \"Of course,\" I replied.   She continued \"There is this FIVE QUESTIONS thing happening on bc.org and there is someone who also has carpal and plays the violin, just like you! I read her post yesterday and said to myself, this is someone I would like to know.\" I had to laugh as I said \"Well you already do!\" I have been outed at my hospital!    She is ten years out from her treatment. She so wishes that bc.org had existed back then, especially the reconstruction boards. She reads our forum to try to assist her sister-in-law who is a Stage IV breast cancer patient who has chosen not to know anything about her treatment and options.   [~~~~~~ waving to my nice volunteer]   Under the circumstances, I felt free to ask her for her screen name. She doesn't have one.

I have a \"special\" diet for dinner the night before, then have to eat that same \"diet\" at least three hours before the scan. When they bring you back, they take a bit of blood to check your sugar levels, and then assuming you \"pass\" then they bring in the radioactive stuff. At the BI, it used to arrive in a silver case, but now a large dosing machine arrives instead. I tell them how much I weighed that morning [but most patients actually are weighed] and they use the same needle configuration that drew the blood, to push this stuff into your body. Then you sit in a room, not moving, for an hour. I am allowed to read, listen to music, etc, but since I schedule these things at the crack of dawn, I sleep. They wake me about 10 minutes before I will go in so I can change into my all-cotton yoga pants, put on some warm socks, and use the restroom. [If you bring your own clothing with no metal, you can use that instead of those horrid johnnies.] My PET scan machine is on the 4th floor with lots of natural sunlight. I put my stuff in a corner, and get onto the bench. They center me up, but a wedge under my knees and a pillow under my head. You lie on your back. They have bands of heavy material that they put across my stomach to keep me still. I used to be tied in, but no longer. These bands are like those thunder-calmers for dogs actually. And then they start. The bench goes all the way to the other side of the tube, and then it starts, with the bench slowly working its way back toward the starting spot so the scan can get the right places of the body. It is not wildly loud like an MRI. There is no banana smoothie like the CT. To be honest, I generally sleep some more in the tube. These days, with the new machines, the test takes about 25 minutes. I haven't been given the drink in ages. Not sure why. At the BI, the drink is hidden in fruit juice when they give it. Hope that helps! *susan* p.s. the radioactive stuff seems to have absolutely no side effects. I just want a vegetable and a carb desperately afterwards.",

My understanding is that you have to contact them directly, determine which records they would need, payment methods etc and who the records will be reviewed by. With any of these three, you can also contact a specific oncologist and do this process directly with them. Good luck! *susan* ",

I think this is a very strong statement. Heck, I can't get a doctor to admit that my bone pain was a side effect of aromasin, or that my fatigue is related to my Faslodex use. Doctors just don't make statements like this without a huge amount of evidence. I have been on Faslodex for 53 months. Before believing this dentist, your sister should have a chat with her oncologist. Please encourage your sister to join us. We have a very active Faslodex thread, affectionately known as the Fanny Pack. *susan*",

A small point obviously, but an important one. For people who have employers that offer health insurance, generally, the employer pays a portion of each month's premium. For those of us who do not have an employer, our costs remain the same. The difficulty is, and it is a huge difficulty, is now you don't have any income to cover those expenses. People who work for companies that cover the health insurance costs while their employees are on either type of disability have a great gift. For me, the two years of paying for insurance without income looms large. I am working hard to put enough money away while I am still working to cover those two years. Currently, we pay $1600 a month for two of us for decent coverage. That is a huge savings goal! Some other sources of money are retirement accounts [no penalty for withdrawal once you are disabled], downsizing assuming your community hasn't had a real estate collapsed, and cashing in a life insurance policy, if you have one. As others have mentioned, without income, you might qualify for government subsidized policies, but I believe that your family income has to qualify [not just you.] I will be interested to know how you navigate this pesky, but essential, question. *susan*",

The extra \"stuff\" [fat is such a nasty work] on my hips is generally tender and has been since one very rough injection by a substitute nurse. I wouldn't call it painful though. Tender is a better word. The amount of tenderness ebbs and flows based on where I am in the month. I have the most discomfort in the first three days of the cycle and then again starting up again 5 days before the next injection. Have no idea if this helps, but it is the best I can do describing how my hips have responded to this treatment. *susan*  p.s. 11 months single, 6 months double. ",

I am racking my brain to remember if there was a delay between the removal and inserting the new one. I just can't remember. I know that it couldn't have been that long between the two since her chemo schedule was intense, and all in-patient. Perhaps the surgeon can clarify/answer this question when you schedule the removal? *susan*",
