I was concerned this time, and put a call in to my BS office.  I talked to one nurse, who didn't know what it could be,.....so she let me describe it to the other nurse...who was likewise dumbfounded.....they asked me to drive in to let them look at it.  If they didn't know what it was, then they'd ask the doctor to take a peek. Well, both nurses looked at it, and hadn't a clue...and agreed it felt hot.  The doctor came - he was baffled.  They all thought - at first - it was shingles, but then agreed it wasn't.  He didn't know if it was an infection, bruising, or just what...but gave me a script for antibiotics (augmentin) and wants to see me back in ten days OR if it got worse.  He also told me to put NOTHING on it - no creams, lotions, oil, heat, or ice..  He took it very seriously.  Now, I have noticed that this side is extra sensitive, and when I go to stretch or pull something it does hurt.  So, I dont' know what's going on.  It IS looking so much better, and the color is just about gone.  The little red dots are slowly fading. The cellulitis could be it...maybe????  I have little red spots on the back side of my calves, and the doctor (about 8 yrs ago) told me that was cellulitis....so maybe ????  this is too>???  I don't know...

We do have several shops in the area that specialize in the prosthetics.  One in particular has ladies that work there who all have had MX, and the shop was started by a lady who had BC.  The other shop was started by a family whose mom had BC, and her daughters (I met and they are sweet) work there.  I will remember to make sure about the return policy.  Thanks for that advice.  I'm not looking for a \"new look\" or to play around with my look.  I want to be as natural as possible.  I just really want ME back =.  I even plan on taking the pictures of my chest (the night before the BMX) so the fitters can get an idea of MY shape and the way I looked before and the way I STILL want to look.  I hope that doesn't sound silly. You ladies have been so encouraging to me.  Thank you.  I am so grateful.  I think I need to print off what you've written, or take notes.  Actually, I did take notes off of Barbara's website before my BMX as to preferred forms.  It's in my notebook.  THE notebook.... blessings...robin",

Anyway, today, I actually wore my new forms to church for the first time....I don't think anyone noticed any difference.  BUT the nice thing about the forms was that I was able to wear a top that I hadn't been able to wear.  There are a few things in my closet/drawers that absolutely need some filling out. Granted, it doens't take much (ha!), but they need a little bit.  Once I get past my 15 days, and I'm sure that these Amoena's are the ones I'm keeping, then I'll probably just wear them only for the \"filling-out\" days....I've actually found that by wearing the bras and forms more than two days in a row, they rub my rib bones and make them sore. Oh, and I HATED to wear bras before BC too...I couldn't find a MX bra that was comfy, so I just sewed in pockets on my old comfy bras...And this morning, as soon as I got home from church, OFF came the bra/forms, and on went a cami and a fun shirt and that's what I wore the rest of the day and to night church. blessings..robin",

BUT, that's not what I was going to tell you.  I have been looking high and low to find some kind of swim suit option where I could get by with being \"me\"....some of my older suits do just fine, but I wanted something new.  I normally wear tankinis, and my bottoms are fine...just needed new tops.  I knew that if I found horizontal stripes without preshaped cups and without gathering, I'd be okay, but I hadn't been able to find any. Today, when I was at Target looking around, I happened to walk through the exercise clothing and noticed their running clothing.  There were some great looking running shirts, that were actually made out of the same material as swim suits!  They had built-in bras (no cups!!)....they had horizontal stripes, they were actually a little longer than normal tankinis (which is good for me since I'm nearly 6' tall!!), had a really cute back, had sides cut lower, yet high enough to hide my scars......they are normally $16.,99, but many were clearanced for $8.00!!! I bought one and tried it on with one of my swimsuit bottoms and it works great.  My husband and daughter (age 17) thought so, too.  From the front, it's not obvious that I'm flat and from the side - well, who cares!?!?  I had breast cancer!!!!  I'm heading back tomorrow to find more...at that price, I can afford to several to mix and match with my navy bottoms and black bottoms. Thought I'd share this with you, in case anyone else hadn't had any luck with swimsuits.... blessings...robin",

I LOVE it that scarves are so fashionable right now......they are wonderful to directing the eye toward the neck and face.  I have found inexpensive scarves at all kinds of places , even the drugstore...pretty ones, too!!  I wear scarves a lot, and no one has even given me a second glance.

My counselor also said that the lab will call me if there is a cost to me prior to the lab going through with everything.  My blood was drawn (three vials) on Monday. The genetics counselor quoted me a cost of $3500 for the BRCA1 and 2.  The colon cancer test is $440. My insurance is supposed to cover 80%.  That's still a hefty amount for me to pay, but I'm already paying for three surgeries, so for some peace of mind - and for my children's sakes, it's probably worth it.

I look continually for cute \"flat\" tops....inexpensive ones ....things with ruffles, or something to draw the eye away.  For swimming, I haven't bought a MX suit, but have been able to wear tankini bottoms from my regular suits and have gotten exercise/yoga tops made from swimsuit fabric to coordinate.  I'll get them in horizontal stripes or patterns to distract the eye.  So far, no one has noticed, or at least I've never caught anyone staring.     I totally dislike wearing normal, regular t-shirts because they accentuate my flatness.  High necks are bad for that, too - for me, anyway.      I'm like some of the rest of you.  I just couldn't justify all the extra surgeries, the additional risks, etc just to get bumps to make other people feel more comfortable or to fill out my clothes.  My husband is totally fine with me the way I am, and most of the time I actually forget about it (unless I'm feeling tight).  Like Barbe, I walk tall and proud....   and so should all of you!!! blessings...robin",

I immediately stuck them in the pockets of the camis I had gotten from Target and it PERFECT!!! I wore if in place of a bra and under a thin sleeveless, thin shirt.....very perfect. Thank you so very much for the idea.  I am THRILLED beyond words.  They really didnt' ride up, although I felt *(alt times) that the band around my chest  was riding up, but when I would go to pull it down, I found it really wasn't.  SOOOO much more comfortable than a bra and/or my silicone forms..... I am sooooo grateful........ thank you, thank you, thank you..... blessings.... <3 robin",

Anyway, just wanted you to know that we all are just one year ahead of you all, so as you all are taking this path now and comparing your current experiences, if you have questions or wonder about the year down the road, pop in over at the *other January* thread and pay us a visit....or send a PM to one of us, especially if our signature \"story\" looks similar to yours. In the meantime, know that each of us cares about what you're going through...and how we DO remember what you are facing and going through.... blessings.....robin",
