I should have had them already, and when I started calling the oncologist's office for results 14 days after my bilateral mastectomy, I found out that she forgot to order it  :(  So now the pathology sample has to be sent to another state, and then results will come after that.   In the meantime, I've had 2 doctors tell me that even though my lymph nodes were clear, I'm firmly a stage I, and they feel no need to do any scans because they feel very confident that there's been no spread of the cancer, that they'd probably still recommend chemo regardless of my Oncotype score.  Their words were \"everyone is going to want to give you the adriamycin because you're only 30 and your heart can handle the damage that the adriamycin causes.\"  My mom had adriamycin and I saw the heart damage that it caused on her and how it affected her, so I find my doctors' sentiment extremely frustrating.  Giving me chemo because I'm young and can handle it seems like they're treating me like an experiment rather than evidence-based practice.   Sorry, I think I just needed a place to vent where others know what I'm talking about.  ",

The thing is, I see a lot of people on here (and obviously my oncologist feels the same) feel that the younger you are, the more benefit there is to doing chemo early as I have many years ahead of me to live.  After my mother's experience, it has me coming from the opposite end of the spectrum.  She had her lifetime maximum of adriamycin and taxol when she received it back in 1999.  Thankfully she's still alive and has had no more cancer scares yet, but that was her 3rd time fighting breast cancer.  She maxed out on her lifetime maximum of radiation with her first 2 bouts of breast cancer so she couldn't receive it the 3rd time.  I really want those options to be there for me if I have to fight cancer again later in life and I worry about maxing out early on.  My mother is still fairly young - she has plenty of years left in her, but if God forbid she got cancer again, her options would be much more limited.   It's a lot to take in and I think my mind is still overwhelmed by it all.  I appreciate all perspectives and information, though, and am definitely trying to sift through it.  This experience certainly makes you feel like you have to obtain the knowledge of an oncologist overnight!",
