What I didnt mention before was that I lost two sisters to BC, one was buried last week and the younger one at 33 last year. And another thing I was advised to keep stress out of my life especially the work place. Good luck to you and everyone dealing with BC, remember to question your doctors well, do the research before you go under the knife.",
