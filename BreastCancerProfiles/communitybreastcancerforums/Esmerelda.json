      "Content": "Nov 27, 2018 10:33PM - edited Nov 27, 2018 10:44PM by Esmerelda Dear friends, I thought of posting in the \"not diagnosed with a recurrence but worried\" but I'm SO worried I might have bone mets... I think I should just post here. I've been lurking for a few weeks, after having been gone from this site for several years, trying to just move beyond this and focus on my girls (Originally diagnosed in 2012 - see more info below). I'm sitting here this early morning, about to get my girls up for school (4 yo and 10 yo), and then I will be driving two hours for an appointment at Univ of Michigan for a clinic appointment. I feel so sad and hopeless. I just thought it was time for me to write and seek support from you dear people. We moved to a new home (same town) in late September, and in the midst of prepping our home to sell (beginning in August, my husband herniated a disc and was essentially out of the packing, moving, renovating, unpacking game until now - he had surgery three weeks ago. I ended up doing it ALL. And subsequently hurt my back as well. Many times over those long weeks, after putting in a new kitchen floor (!) or carrying too many boxes, etc., I could feel the back pain creep in. Fiinally I started pyhsical therapy at my husband's urging- we can't BOTH be down for the count! I've been in physical therapy now for over a month and I'm not really getting any relief. I know when I tell that story, it absolutely sounds like a simply injury. Only my symptoms have really changed in the subsequent weeks and seem to be worsening. Earlier I might get a day of relief, but now it's everyday. I currently have a nagging, unending burning sensation in my tailbone. I have tingling in the toes on my left foot, and I have an occasional sharp twinge in my mid back vertebrae. I also feel a sensation in my sternum (not pain, really, just discomfort?), and an occasional burning sensation in the upper verterbrae, neck area. Oddly, when I sleep, all of these symptoms go away. I wake up with no pain/discomfort, but as soon as I get up they start in again and are there all day long, often worse by the end of the day. (Or maybe I'm just tired of it all by the end of the day.) Oh, and most recently - no pooping these last three days. My crazy-worried thoughts tell myself this: I had bone mets all along - and the intense physicality of single-handedly moving our family just broke what what already weakened by bone mets, They were there - with no symptomology - and I overdid it and now vertebrae, coccyx, sacrum (?), are fractured, etc. Is that a possibility? Can anyone offer me any wisdom or perspective? I don't have any scans scheduled yet. My onco wanted me to start with my PCP and an MRI, because they thought from my story it was injury induced. Well now these injuries don't feel the same - they feel ominous. (Burning tailbone and the rest???). I asked to see my onco first and today is the day. I am terrified. I don't know how to live with this. I don't know how to not live without feeling in utter despair from my girls losing their mother. I don't know that I can do this. Any help is welcomed and so appreciated. Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Currently sobbing at the keyboard.) <3 (Edited to say: maybe I'll copy and post this message to the \"worried and undiagnosed\" thread - I guess that is a more appropriate place. Blessings and peace to all of you lovely sisters.)",

I guess I'm looking for some hopeful perspective and encouragement. I was just diagnosed with IDC in late March. I haven't had any surgery yet, my tumor is less than 2 cm, and from the MRI, US and Mamm, my lymph nodes \"look good\". (Though, I know looking and \"being\" good once checked by pathology are two totally different things.) I've had some pain in my hips and also what I would describe as mild \"discomfort\" in my ribs for the last three weeks or so - that sort of comes and goes. I've also been (at times) doubled-over by fear and anxiety - which I think is driven by the fact that one of my best friends has stage IV bc, and I've been helping her these last two years. (I think my fear is, in part, driven by supporting someone else through her debilitating fear.) I had an X-ray of my hips and one hip shows a \"lucent lesion,\" and I am now scheduled for an MRI. They've told me it could be many things... arthritis (though I'm only 39), an old injury, etc. I know there's nothing anyone can say... I just... want to be alright. I have a 3 year old and I have these heart-crushing thoughts about her loosing her mommy... a thought that I just cannot take. If anyone has any encouragement for me... I would be eternally grateful. Thank you so very much.Â ",

You are an incredible inspiration to us all! I so appreciate you chiming in and offering support. And you, Jill! Thank you so much. Yes, I do try and take solace in that all my pain seems to go away at night. Though I know nothing can offer 100% assurance. I\u2019ve been agonizing over this for so long - I\u2019m frustrated that even after today (just a clinic appointment) I won\u2019t have any any answers - any scans or tests will still be days/weeks away. (Happy holidays! Ugh.) I know my onco will dictate - but do any of you have any perspective on what scan would be best to offer the most accurate findings? Blessings to you all.

I keep hearing from women (and from one meeting with an onco) that chemo needs to start within \"12 weeks\". But is this 12 weeks from diagnosis or 12 weeks from surgery? Thanks, chemo sisters!",

My Mia is 3 and half, and one of my greatest concerns is her wellbeing. I just wanted to write a short message of encouragement. There are INCREDIBLE women on here who will be here for you, who will respond to your concerns, fears and questions. I've found that it's a wonderful community of support. I wanted to tell you that there's a thread within the IDC group called, \"Ladies in their thirties\" of which I write on occasionally. It's a great place because most of the women are just like us - have little kids and are trying to cope and overcome this thing. I encourage you to find that thread and post your same message there. I know you'll get some great responses. Being new at this myself, the only thing I can recommend is to take this one day at a time, start educating yourself and get a team of medical professionals whom you feel confidant in. The rest will follow. Much love and light to you! You WILL get through this!Â ",
