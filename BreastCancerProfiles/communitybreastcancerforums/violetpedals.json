      "Content": "violetpedals wrote: It's been 4 years since my last mammogram/ultrasound. I have always had lumps in my breast that were previously \"brushed off\" by doctors. This time, since it's grown, they've ordered a biopsy. I met with the surgeon this week expecting a needle biopsy but he said he would rather remove the hard mass surgically and then biopsy it.  I have really dense breasts and he mentioned that the \"hard piece\" felt crunchy.  There is slight pain associated but it's not constant and it's not \"really\" painful. It's happens more when I move my arm high or raise it I feel the area in question and there is discomfort.  I guess I'm really worried that my pain and crunchy mass have been there for years and I'm just now getting around to it. Very worried about surgery as well since it will my first ever. Any thoughts or tips would be greatly appreciated. Also, what do you think about the surgeon referring to it as \"crunchy\"?
