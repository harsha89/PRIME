How it started was a year ago, near the breast bone I started having pain. Had a mammo and never heard anything from the dr about it. (assumed it was ok) Now, the pain has spread, I notice it was worse after removing my bra. I also noticed a lump when I removed my bra, but one I laid down I coulnd't find it. The pain moved to my underarm. Whereas, I couldn't lay on my stomach and put my arm up over my head. Now, the pain has vanished, however the pain has moved to the left breast. There I also noticed pea sized lumps. So, I\"m not sure what it is. I've been on HRT for 15, had cervical cancer at 29. Tomorrow is my mammo, needless to say, I'm worried.",
