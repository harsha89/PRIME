It would seem to be getting better, but by evening it would be worse in a spot that I was thinking didn't get hit. Once the treatments ended it continued to get worse and worse. Friends and even husband thought it would be better for me to get out and be with people. Go with them to work out and visit. Right. Me with my melting painful boob and greasy, oversized shirt. 6 days after my last treatment, I lost it. I really dont wish this on anyone, but i was close to it that day. I yelled things at my husband he couldnt believe were coming out of me...like putting a certain body part of his in the microwave oven for 60 seconds a day for 16 work days. Now, it is so much better, I will be going back to the YMCA Monday. I will be ready to go. I decide that and no one else. Sheesh. Pilates should be okay to do, right?",

A woman in my water aerobics class had just started getting radiation and asked me what she should expect. I started off by saying everyone is different. We both have light coloring. I had 16 strong treatments and she was getting 30 treatments. I told her to just keep the aloe up and aquafor. This woman continued to be in the pool everyday for at least an hour then would get in the hot tub for 15 minutes. It was amazing! After her last treatment she moved so I have no idea how she is doing now. Everyone is different. I just couldn't imagine going into a public pool and hot tub, but maybe I worry needlessly. I still have nausea and fatigue. Almost flu like but no fever. One minute I am having hot flashes, the next chills. Very hard to get motivated. My husband has been very helpful and understanding thank goodness! This can't last forever though, I hope.",

I still have quite a big portion of my breast that is hard and swollen, which my surgeon said is normal and will take time to return to normal. The past few nights I have been noticing spots on my night shirt right around the breast area so I assume this is something coming out of my nipple since I don't see any other sores...has anyone else had this? I haven't called my dr.'s office yet as I just saw her (BS) Apr. 29th.
