    "Content": "jessmm wrote: About 10ish months ago I discovered lumps in both of my breasts, some were the size of a peach pit and others the size of a small bead. A few are painful and a few aren't. I went to get ultrasounds done, and they didn't see anything. Six months later i had another ultrasound and still nothing. I've been monitoring the bumps and they arent changing much except a couple are growing in size a bit. Breast cancer hasn't been detected in my family before, though other types of cancer ar prelevant. I'm also 16 and the doctor I've been seeing has told me I'm probably too young. Should I be pushing for more tests? Log in to post a reply",
