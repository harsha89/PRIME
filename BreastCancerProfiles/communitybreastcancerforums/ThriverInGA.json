The area over my lumpectomy is inflamed red and a bit blistered. It burns and stings! I had Contura brachytherapy following my surgery, then started chemo 3-1/2 weeks after treatment. My radiologist prescribed a corticosteroid cream for it. Has anyone else experienced this SE? How long did your rash last?

Now that I've had breast cancer I'm avoiding parabens and other chemicals. This time I am using a product called Scargo, which is natural. I purchased it at Whole Foods. Probably any good natural massage oil would work, as the surgeon says it's the massage over the scar that breaks up the scar tissue, not just the oil.",
