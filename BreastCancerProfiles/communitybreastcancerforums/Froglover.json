I was devastated...i am 40, only had a few grays before this. It was very thin too and i ended up sgaving it off again hoping for a better result...to my amazment it worked...its coming in dark brown like it should be. Now my last chemo was end of August and I dont have much hair, you csn see my profile pic, thats a month ago. It seems to have slowed way down again...i havnt had to shave legs in weeks, so im not sure why or whats going on. I am going to ask at my appt next week.",
