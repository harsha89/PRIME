I was more of a lurker throughout our shared experience [dx and surgery within days of shelabela and kae_md99] but still feel connected to you all. Happy to report that I've healed fairly well, and am pretty much living my life with a new appreciation for just about everything - and feel joy in everyday experiences. AI has caused some joint issues, but, like most everything else, it's doable. Hope everyone is doing well!",

I developed a dime-sized blister on my lower rib cage that eventually resolved itself - but I never felt any soreness or pain [good news/bad news]. There was also a cluster of much smaller blisters that developed around the same time along the same rib [this was last Thursday, which was #22/30] that the nurse thought could be shingles, but they ruled that out. So yes, watch your skin carefully. The techs were concerned, but my RO wasn't - Just told me to load up on Silvadene.",

The Silvadene works great, but is a bear to remove - and the baby oil, which my RO recommended, just isn't getting the job done.",
