    "Content": "discometal wrote: Hi everyone. I just went to a doctor who was highly recommended by a friend, though I'm not sure why. First, he laughed when I told him I found the lump in my breast on my own rather than it being found by a doctor (???). Then, he did the ultrasound, and afterwards, he told me not to worry and that I have fibrocystic breast changes, that's all. I don't feel 100% about this and I'm considering a second opinion, and here's why. What I have felt is that when I'm lying on my back, I have a small lump that almost feels like a peanut on the lower outer part of my right breast (maybe like 7:00ish). When I'm standing, though, I can feel that it's bigger and more like a marble-ish feeling. However, I can feel the front and sides, but not the back, and it almost feels like it's at the end of a little section of breast tissue that I guess, now that I've read about fibrocystic breasts, feels a bit like a short wide rope. So, when the dr said there was nothing on the ultrasound and I have fibrocystic breasts, I initially felt like he was wrong because I know I could feel a lump. But then thinking about it, I guess the nature of the lump and the fact that it feels almost attached to a tube like structure when I feel it from a certain angle would make sense because of fibrocystic breasts being \"ropy.\" The thing is, I've had the lump since before my last period, and it hasn't changed in size or feeling, and I don't have any breast pain. I have occasional breast pain before my period, but nothing too intense, and not every month. The doctor was also just bad at answering questions and I didn't really like him. BUT, I'm in Japan and have been living here for the last three years, which complicates things because doctors are different here. I'm coming back home to NYC in August, and I don't have insurance in America yet, while I do have insurance here and things are much cheaper anyway - my doctors appointment and ultrasound was around $19US. Anyway, what do you all think? Do you think I should get a second opinion? And if you do, do you think I should get a second opinion here, where there's a bit of a language barrier and doctors aren't so friendly, or wait until America? Or do you think that this sounds very typical of fibrocystic breasts and the dr is probably right? Any thoughts? I didn't really like him, but the more I think about it, the more it seems like he's probably right, even if he had absolutely terrible bedside manner (which most doctors in japan do, so this will probably be the case again if I visit another doctor). I've been so worried the past few weeks and now I feel a bit stupid for thinking it's a lump and wondering about all these horrible conclusions when it turns out apparently it's not even a lump? Though, I still feel it, so I don't know. I feel very reassured that it's nothing, but I'm not sure I'm clear on exactly what kind of \"nothing\" it is - though I'm not sure I really will be while I'm in Japan, to be honest. So, I guess, my own cultural problems aside, does the lump I described sound like fibrocystic breasts? Do you think it's okay to not get a second opinion? Or at the very least, to wait until America or just wait and see if anything changes? Thanks, everyone, and sorry if my questions seem vague or too situation-specific. I guess I mostly just want to know if what I'm describing sounds like fibrocystic breasts and he's right. I know you're not doctors, but I'd appreciate any input if any of you have experienced fibrocystic breasts before! Thanks so much again! Log in to post a reply",
