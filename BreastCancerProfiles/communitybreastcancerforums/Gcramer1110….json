(had a lumpectomy in 2011) and on the ultrasound (due to my age 25) showed another lump, almost in the same location as the one I had removed in 2011. The lump can not be felt but very visual in the ultrasound. I do have a long history of maternal breast cancer, including my mother and grandmother and so on. My anxiety is high then it has ever been in my entire life. I do have scheduled surgery for Nov 20. My question is is a non papable lump more serious then a papable lump? Log in to post a reply",

I will talk to my primary physician about things to do for anxiety. It really starts to affect my children and sometimes husband. Thank you all!",
