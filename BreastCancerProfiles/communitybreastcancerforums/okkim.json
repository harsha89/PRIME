Today was a rough day trying to get hold of clinic for ct scan and bone scan supposed to be done tomorrow but have to wait until next Tuesday. Just when I have a pretty decent day I get kicked in the butt. Wish I could just take a bunch of sleeping pills and wake up when it is all over ... don't worry not talking suicide. Just want to sip thinking for a while. Work right now helps. I'm an elementary school counselor. The other staff and the kids have been great. I just hope I can keep working at least some between treatments. At least I'll get out of recess and cafeteria duty. I feel for what my husband is going to be going through. ",

I know I'll have plenty of time to read.  You're right about keeping your mind active and thinking about other things. I'm really counting on being able to work in between treatments, every two weeks. I'm an elementary school counselor and I love my kids. I need to keep busy even if it is hard to focus at times. I think I have chemo brain already and I haven't even started yet.  Lol.",
