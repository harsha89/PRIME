It is my understanding that it being moveable is good sign. However, it's best to get a professional opinion. When you say you applied for insurance, is it individual or group policy? If it's individual they usually have a rider (which means they won't pay) for any pre-existing condition for a certain amount of time, however, grp has to cover effective immediately, at least here in FL. I would prefer you not wait to see a MD, is there a free clinic near by? If you do wait and you have individual coverage, perhaps don't mention when you found it. Best wishes, Jeanne",

It sounds like your mother may have ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) which is an early stage of cancer and very treatable. Usually either lumpectomy w/ radiation or mastectomy takes care of it. Occasionally, chemo is recommended. Regardless of the type of cancer, there is treatment out there. Please try and get the final path report and come back. This place will give you so much encouragement, support and knowledge to get you both through it. Best wishes, Jeanne",

Whereas, when I had my dbl mast I had expanders placed at the same time. That's just one type of reconstruct, there are others, but most can be done at time of mast. I do have some feeling in my breast, but not what it was before. I had previous biopsies which were negative as well as recall mammos and US. Since I had 2 areas of DCIS mast was recommended over rad mostly by my FP who I also work for and whose wife had BC, the rad. onc. thought it would end up w/ the same results if lump & rad, surgeon supported either. I was 46 and just felt my breast had served their purpose and if there was cancer, just didn't need them any more. It was a very personal decision that was supported by all those around me. Although there was no residual CA left in either breast, there was a lot of precancerous tissue and who knows at what stage it would have been found.
