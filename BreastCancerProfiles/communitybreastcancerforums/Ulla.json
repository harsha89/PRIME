LOVE U ALL Below is a Dr.   Phil's test.  ( Dr. Phil scored 55; he did this test on Oprah - she got a 38.)  Some folks pay a lot of money to find this stuff out! Read on, this is very interesting! Don't be overly sensitive!   The following is pretty accurate and it only takes 2 minutes.   Take this test for yourself and send it to your friends. The person who sent it placed their score in the e-mail subject box.  Please do the same before forwarding to your friends (send it back to the person who sent it to you.)  Don't peek, but begin the test as you scroll down and answer. Answers are for who you are now --- not who you were in the past.   Have pen or pencil and paper ready. This is a real test given by the Human Relations Dept. at many of the major corporations today. It helps them get better insight concerning their employees and prospective employees.    It's only 10 Simple questions, so grab a pencil and paper, keeping track of your letter answers to each question.

(a) 4     (b) 2     (c) 3     (d) 5     (e) 6     (f) 1 Now add up the total number of points. OVER 60 POINTS :  Others see you as someone they should 'handle with care.'  You're seen as vain, self-centered, and who is extremely dominant.  Others may admire you, wishing they could be more like you, but don't always trust you, hesitating to become too deeply involved with you. 51 TO 60 POINTS : Others see you as an exciting, highly volatile, rather impulsive personality; a natural leader, who's quick to make decisions, though not always the right ones. They see you as bold and adventuresome, someone who will try anything once; someone who takes chances and enjoys an adventure.   They enjoy being in your company because of the excitement you radiate. 41 TO 50 POINTS :  Others see you as fresh, lively, charming, amusing, practical, and always interesting; someone who's constantly in the center of attention, but sufficiently well-balanced not to let it go to their head. They also see you as kind, considerate, and understanding; someone who'll always cheer them up and help them out. 31 TO 40 POINTS :  Others see you as sensible, cautious, careful & practical.  They see you as clever, gifted, or talented, but modest.  Not a person who makes friends too quickly or easily, but someone who's extremely loyal to friends you do make and who expect the same loyalty in return.  Those who really get to know you realize it takes a lot to shake your trust in your friends, but equally that it takes you a long time to get over if that trust is ever broken. 21 TO 30 POINTS:  Your friends see you as painstaking and fussy.  They see you as very cautious, extremely careful, a slow and steady plodder.  It would really surprise them if you ever did something impulsively or on the spur of the moment, expecting you to examine everything carefully from every angle and then , usually decide against it.  They think this reaction is caused partly by your careful nature. UNDER 21 POINTS:  People think you are shy, nervous, and indecisive, someone who needs looking after, who always wants someone else to make the decisions & who doesn't want to get involved with anyone or anything!  They see you as a worrier who always sees problems that don't exist.  Some people e think you' re boring.  Only those who know you well know that you aren't.

      "Content": "Dec 28, 2007 12:21PM Ulla wrote: Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.\" is a line from the 1939 film Gone with the Wind starring Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh. It was spoken by Gable, as Rhett Butler, in his last words to Scarlett O'Hara. It occurs at the end of the film when Scarlett asks Rhett, \"Where shall I go? What shall I do?\" if he leaves her. The line is memorable not only because it contains a swear word (which was generally not allowed in films of that time period), but because it demonstrates that Rhett has finally given up on Scarlett and no longer cares what happens to her. This quotation was voted the number one movie line of all time by the American Film Institute 2005.[1] In the novel Gone with the Wind, Rhett does not say \"Frankly\", but simply \"My dear, I don't give a damn\". The context is also different; he is speaking quietly to Scarlett in a room, not storming dramatically out of the house. Shah Rukh Khan speaks the same lines in his latest film Om Shanti Om (2007) at a critical juncture, as a tribute to this famous quotation. The movie itself is a tribute to Indian Cinema. It is also used in Tim Burton's Corpse Bride as a humoristic element when the dead walk the earth.",

While keeping the skin on, it is then brushed with olive oil. Traditional garnishes for masgouf include chopped onions and tomatoes, as well as the clay-oven flatbreads common to Iraq and much of the Middle East. After marinating the fish, it is then placed on wooden sticks and then barbecued on a large flame.After the fish is well cooked and crispy, it is often sprinkled with the juice of a lemon, ready to be served. Like many other Iraqi dishes it is usually served with rice, along with salad and  mango sliced pickles.(AMBA)  yumyyyyyyyyyy i want to go to baghdad now",

The epic, set in the American South in and around the time of the Civil War, starred Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Leslie Howard and Olivia de Havilland. It told a story of the Civil War and its aftermath from a white Southern point of view. It was awarded ten Academy Awards, a record that would stand for years. It has been named by the American Film Institute as number four among the top 100 American films of all time. It has sold more tickets than any other film in history. Today it is considered one of the most popular films of all time, and one of the most enduring symbols of the golden age of Hollywood. Adjusting for inflation, the film is the highest grossing of all time",

..(the onk sent me that letter saying i can do part time only which is very good for me as it is felxible and allow me to take the swedish test without being there 4-5 hrs daily,,i guess this can be considered as good news.. 3rd.now i have another added daily duty ,,which is open my webcam daily for dear mom showing her that i am still alive and in one peice,,lol 4th.phoned the stupid onk office today to tell him about my strong reaction to tamox. and the nurse answered me and she talked with the jerk ,,who told her that i can take a pause till monday and call them back then to c if it was the tamox or something else..now wat??is he trying to say that its just in my mind ??i imagined it?? no way,,i really felt so,,and kept feeling the same foe exactly 30 hrs till the damn pill out of effect..so we will wait and c,, my sister in UK asked for his phone no. and it seems that they will have some another stupid conversation be4 we can decide anything,,so till monday i am happy to be happy..yyyoooohhhhoo 4th.jane ur story is amazing and so warming ,,i felt better after read it,,u r great.. 5th.shirlann,,as my other sisters said,,u know how to put in simple ,warming,comfortable words,,ur DIL is insane for not loving u..my mom was born in 1948 and it is true wat u said about wispering the name of the bootface ,,becoz evryone was so sacred from it knowing its just a killer..i told u now i must deal with the high phone bills and showing myself on webcam daily..lolbut i really feel better that she is acceptng it little by little and slowly,,the most benificial thing that helped her is to c me and talk so long,,she will try to ask for a visa to visit me ,,but its very difficult as they dont give iraqies visa trying to avoid asylum seekers more and more,,as always we pay when the politicians make stupid decissions,,we can hope that they may grant her the damn vissa. 6th.mel honey am sorry for ur allergy i hope u r feeling better,, 7th.have a happy birthday olevia..u r so blessed to have such a hot momma.. dear lisa i hope u will have great time today with ur baby daughter celebrating her 17th ..my lil sister will be 17 next 7of august.. 8th.sue sweety wer r u honey ,,i miss u so bad..plz check in.. now dear AE,,yes u read it right ,,and i will tell u all my story down below..i hope u wont be bored ..i just felt i want u all to know everything about me ..so feel u as my family more and more.. my DH was kidnapped for 8 days by some gang of religiouse extremers they took a big sum of money to release him and we were really blessed that they did released him as they used to kill them after they recieve the money ,,i guess it was my luckiest thing that happened in my all life,,this was in feb,2007 they took his Camry car and all the money that they found with him (about 10.000US$ which was with him for some buiness deal..yes believe it we dont have credit cards in iraq,,so if u have something related to bussiness and need to pay money u must do it by cash)..then they asked for 100.000 US$ to let him free..it was so much and we couldnt tell the police as it was the police check point on the road who sell him from the first minute..so there was long negotiations till they accepted to take 50.000 US $..and that wat happened ,,so one of the men who were working for my DH acepted to be responsible about handing the money ,,it was like a living movie..they used the mobiles to giude him where to put the money and where to drive the car ,,and they just left it there and our man came back ..so we kept waiting ,,it was the most difficult time we had ,,as they shut down the mobile phones and we didnt know wat to do ..this was for complete 24 hrs ,,then we recieved a phone call from a mobile number that we dont know it ,,and my dh was talking...at last they relaesed him and his friend who was with him in the car..and they released him in a very dangerouse area filled with wolves,,anyway we had my DH in one peice thank god,,after that we both decided that we cant live in the country any more.. and this was a must now  as i was threatened to be killed for multiple times and was in seriouse danger of assasination for 2 times ,,i was working in the ministry of iraqi health but my work in fact was with the US civial troops who r responsible about civial work and rehablitation..so i was working as the connector between iraqi authorities and the US officers who choosed me for so many reasons made them sure that it was the best to deal with them through me,,this put me in a very critical corner as so many of the iraqi ppl considered me co-operating with the invasive enemies..while i was just doing my normal work..i even was payed by iraqi ministry of health the ordinary sallery,,day by day things were being more risky,,till i was the head of a commitie responsible about making sure of every diplome for the doctors in my institi=ute and we found that ther r some ppl who faked the diplomas after saddams fall..and this was the most danger that i found myself in,,i have the all pappers from the university that profs all that,,they sent me 3 bullets in an envelope was on my desk with a lil notice saying(u r free to choose where u want these bullets ..)i was scared but didnt gave up i kept the all important documents in a safe place ,,and took a leave from my work,,till things subsides ..u can add that i was started to be considered even by the iraqi authorities as unwanted person as i am not representing them,,i was libral,unveiled,never had any relation to any political party to support me ,,and never had any religiouse tendency to be one of them..so after my leave ends ,,i went back and talked about the faked diplomas again as i found myself still the head of the commitee after the leave..this time in the next mornning i was getting out and just about open my car to go work ,,i dont know wat happen in my mind that time i just wanted to have some fresh bread from the adjacent bakary,,so i just walked 3 steps from my car to buy some fresh ,hot bread for a fast breakfast in my car ,,and my car just exploded..i looked at my car burnning and it was only one half that was burnning,,the halfe of the driver seat,,,,ofcourse they called the police who said that it was a (C4 paste )attached to the door of the car,,i was in complete shock,,shakin..and crying hesterically..i left the work and DH bought us a new house in a different area and we moved ..i just left everything and kept the important pappers and all the documents ,,the all accedent came in the evenning news ,,it was in december 2006..i wanted to leave the country since that time but DH needed to be kidnapped be4 he could make this decission..lol so ,,,here we r ..we just told the swedish migration authorities everything with all the available documents so they granted us a permenant resedency withen 5 days ,,,it was the fastest application that was approved in our time...this was in may 2007 the rest of the storry u all knew it ,,i became pregnant in late june ,,then diagnosed with bootface in 14th of august 2007..and here i am with my all lovely sisters,,, much love ,,gentle hugs..warming wishes for everyone to have a good day",

      "Content": "Dec 28, 2007 11:24AM Ulla wrote: The story opens on a large cotton plantation named Tara in rural Georgia in 1861, on the eve of the American Civil War. Scarlett O'Hara is the eldest of three daughters of Irish immigrant Gerald O'Hara and his wife, Ellen. She is seemingly sought after by every young man in the county, except the refined Ashley Wilkes, for whom Scarlett longs. She is upset to hear of Ashley's imminent engagement to his cousin Melanie Hamilton, to be announced the next day at a barbecue at his family's home, the nearby plantation Twelve Oaks. At Twelve Oaks, she notices she is being admired by a handsome but roguish visitor, Rhett Butler, who had been disowned by his Charleston family. Rhett finds himself in further disfavor among the male guests when, during a discussion of the probability of war, he states that the South has no chance against the superior numbers and industrial might of the North. When Scarlett is alone with Ashley, she confesses her love for him. He admits he finds Scarlett attractive, but says that he and the gentle Melanie are more compatible. She accuses Ashley of misleading her and slaps him in anger, which is heightened when she realizes that Rhett has overheard the whole conversation. \"Sir, you are no gentleman!\" she protests, to which he replies, \"And you, miss, are no lady!\" The barbecue is disrupted by the announcement that war has broken out, and the men rush to enlist. As Scarlett watches Ashley kiss Melanie goodbye, Melanie's shy young brother Charles Hamilton, with whom Scarlett had been innocently flirting, asks for her hand in marriage before he goes. She consents, they are married, and she is just as quickly widowed when Charles dies not in battle, but of pneumonia. Scarlett's mother sends her to the Hamilton home in Atlanta to cheer her up, although the O'Haras' outspoken housemaid Mammy tells Scarlett she knows she is going there \"like a spider\", to wait for Ashley's return. Scarlett and Melanie attend a charity ball in Atlanta, where Rhett makes a surprise appearance. Now he is a heroic blockade runner for the Confederacy. Scarlett shocks Atlanta society by accepting his bid for a dance, even though she is still in mourning. While they dance, Rhett tells her of his intention to win her, which she says will never happen. The tide of war turns against the Confederacy. Scarlett makes another unsuccessful appeal to Ashley's heart while he is visiting on Christmas furlough. Eight months later, as the city is being besieged by the Union Army in the Battle of Atlanta, Melanie goes into a premature and difficult labor. Scarlett must deliver the child herself. Rhett appears with a horse and wagon to take them out of the city on a perilous journey through the burning depot and warehouse district. He leaves her with a kiss on the road to Tara. She repays him with a slap, to his bemusement, as he goes off to fight with the Confederate Army. On her journey back home, Scarlett finds Twelve Oaks burned out and deserted. She is relieved to find Tara still standing, but learns that her mother has just died, and her father's mind has begun to crumble under the strain. With Tara pillaged by Union troops, and the fields untended, Scarlett vows she will do anything for the survival of her family and herself: \"As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again!\"",

      "Content": "Dec 28, 2007 12:01PM Ulla wrote: Scarlett sets her family and servants to picking the cotton fields. She also fatally shoots a Union deserter who threatens her during a burglary, and finds gold coins in his haversack. With the defeat of the Confederacy and war's end, Ashley returns from being a prisoner of war. Mammy restrains Scarlett from running to him when he reunites with Melanie. The dispirited Ashley finds he is of little help to Tara, and when Scarlett begs him to run away with her, he confesses his desire for her and kisses her passionately, but says he cannot leave Melanie. Gerald O'Hara dies after he is thrown from his horse while chasing a Yankee carpetbagger off his property. Scarlett is left to care for the family, and realizes she cannot pay the taxes on Tara. She knows that Rhett is in Atlanta. Believing he is still rich, she has Mammy make an elaborate gown for her from her mother's drapes. However, upon her visit, Rhett tells her his foreign bank accounts have been blocked, and that her attempt to get his money has been in vain. However, as she departs, she encounters her sister's fiancé, the middle-aged Frank Kennedy, who now owns a successful general store and lumber mill. Soon Scarlett is Mrs. Frank Kennedy. She becomes a hardheaded businesswoman, willing to trade with the despised Yankees and use convict laborers in her mill. When Ashley is about to take a job offer with a bank in the north, Scarlett preys on his weakness by weeping that she needs him to help run the mill; pressured by the sympathetic Melanie, he relents. One day, after Scarlett is attacked while driving alone through a nearby shantytown, Frank, Ashley, and others make a night raid on the shantytown. Ashley is wounded in a melee with Union troops, and Frank is killed. With Frank's funeral barely over, Rhett visits Scarlett and proposes marriage. Scarlett is aghast at his poor taste, but takes him up on his offer. After a honeymoon in New Orleans, Rhett promises to restore Tara, while Scarlett builds the biggest and most crassly opulent mansion in Atlanta. A daughter, Bonnie, is born. Rhett adores her as a less spoiled version of her mother, and does everything to win the good opinion of Atlanta society for his daughter's sake. Scarlett, still pining for Ashley, lets Rhett know that she wants no more children. In anger, he kicks open the door that separates their bedrooms to show her that he will decide that. When visiting the mill one day, Scarlett listens to a nostalgic Ashley wish for the simpler days of old that are now gone, and when she consoles him with an embrace, they are spied by two gossips - including Ashley's sister India Wilkes, who has always held a grudge against Scarlett. Scarlett's reputation is again sullied, but Melanie refuses to believe in the rumors, and invites her to Ashley's birthday party. Afterwards, a drunken Rhett tells her he will make her forget Ashley, and sweeps her up the stairs in his arms, telling her, \"This is one night you're not turning me out.\" She awakens the next morning with the look of guilty pleasure, but Rhett returns to apologize for his behavior and offer a divorce. When he returns from a visit to London with Bonnie, Scarlett tells him resentfully that she is pregnant again. After Rhett tells her to \"cheer up. Maybe you'll have an 'accident,'\" Scarlett lunges at him and, when he steps out of the way, falls down the grand staircase of their home and miscarries. As Scarlett recovers, and Rhett attempts reconciliation, young Bonnie, as impulsive as her grandfather, dies in a fall from her pony when she attempts to jump a fence. Scarlett and Rhett are devastated and exchange recriminations over her death. Melanie visits to comfort them, but then collapses in labor from a pregnancy she was warned could kill her. On her deathbed, she asks Scarlett to look after Ashley for her, as Scarlett had looked after her for Ashley. With her dying breath, Melanie also tells Scarlett to be kind to Rhett, that he loves her. Outside, Ashley collapses in tears, helpless without his wife. Only then does Scarlett realize that she never could have meant anything to him, and that she had loved something that never really existed. She runs home to find Rhett packing to leave her, saying it is too late to salvage their marriage. She begs him not to leave, telling him she realizes now that she had loved him all along, that she never really loved Ashley. Rhett tells her that as long as there was Bonnie, whom he could spoil and love unconditionally, as he wished he could with Scarlett, there was a chance that they could have been happy, but now that chance was gone. As Rhett walks out the door, she begs him, \"Rhett, if you go, where shall I go? What shall I do?\" He answers, and turns away. She sits on her stairs and weeps in despair, \"What is there that matters?\" She then recalls the voice of her father Gerald: \"Land's the only thing that matters, it's the only thing that lasts.\" And Ashley: \"Something you love better than me, though you may not know it. Tara.\" And Rhett: \"It's from this you get your strength, the red earth of Tara.\" Hope lights Scarlett's face: \"Tara! Home. I'll go home, and I'll think of some way to get him back! After all, tomorrow is another day!\" In the final scene, Scarlett stands once more, resolute, before Tara.",

Read on, this is very interesting! Don't be overly sensitive!   The following is pretty accurate and it only takes 2 minutes.   Take this test for yourself and send it to your friends. The person who sent it placed their score in the e-mail subject box.  Please do the same before forwarding to your friends (send it back to the person who sent it to you.)  Don't peek, but begin the test as you scroll down and answer. Answers are for who you are now --- not who you were in the past.   Have pen or pencil and paper ready. This is a real test given by the Human Relations Dept. at many of the major corporations today. It helps them get better insight concerning their employees and prospective employees.    It's only 10 Simple questions, so grab a pencil and paper, keeping track of your letter answers to each question. Make sure to change the subject of the e-mail to read YOUR total.  When you are finished, forward this to friends/family, and also send it to the person who sent this to you   Make sure to put YOUR score in the subject box.

(a) 4     (b) 2     (c) 3     (d) 5     (e) 6     (f) 1 Now add up the total number of points. OVER 60 POINTS :  Others see you as someone they should 'handle with care.'  You're seen as vain, self-centered, and who is extremely dominant.  Others may admire you, wishing they could be more like you, but don't always trust you, hesitating to become too deeply involved with you. 51 TO 60 POINTS : Others see you as an exciting, highly volatile, rather impulsive personality; a natural leader, who's quick to make decisions, though not always the right ones. They see you as bold and adventuresome, someone who will try anything once; someone who takes chances and enjoys an adventure.   They enjoy being in your company because of the excitement you radiate. 41 TO 50 POINTS :  Others see you as fresh, lively, charming, amusing, practical, and always interesting; someone who's constantly in the center of attention, but sufficiently well-balanced not to let it go to their head. They also see you as kind, considerate, and understanding; someone who'll always cheer them up and help them out. 31 TO 40 POINTS :  Others see you as sensible, cautious, careful & practical.  They see you as clever, gifted, or talented, but modest.  Not a person who makes friends too quickly or easily, but someone who's extremely loyal to friends you do make and who expect the same loyalty in return.  Those who really get to know you realize it takes a lot to shake your trust in your friends, but equally that it takes you a long time to get over if that trust is ever broken. 21 TO 30 POINTS:  Your friends see you as painstaking and fussy.  They see you as very cautious, extremely careful, a slow and steady plodder.  It would really surprise them if you ever did something impulsively or on the spur of the moment, expecting you to examine everything carefully from every angle and then , usually decide against it.  They think this reaction is caused partly by your careful nature. UNDER 21 POINTS:  People think you are shy, nervous, and indecisive, someone who needs looking after, who always wants someone else to make the decisions & who doesn't want to get involved with anyone or anything!  They see you as a worrier who always sees problems that don't exist.  Some people e think you' re boring.  Only those who know you well know that you aren't. Now forward this to others, and put your score in the subject box of your e-mail, like this:  Dr. Phil's Test, I'm a  '(fill in the blank)'",
