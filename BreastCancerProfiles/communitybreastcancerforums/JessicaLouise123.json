    "Content": "JessicaLouise123 wrote: My mom beat stage 3 breast cancer last year - it was a tough battle and her cancer was VERY aggressive. She was finally diagnosed Cancer Free in October of 08. She has to go for her check up's every 6 months. At her last check up it showed that one of her Lymph Nodes in her stomach was swollen, and now they need to do a CAT scan. She has had a double mastectomy about a year ago so obviously nothing would come back in her breast? I'm just so worried about this enlarged Lymph Node - I don't know what I'd do if it came back. Does this happen to women who have had breast cancer and it turns out to just be nothing? Just so worried Log in to post a reply",
