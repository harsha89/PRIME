The sad thing is that the path report seems to identify it as benign, I think.  What I do not undersand is why a needle biopsy was not done first or why it would not be accurate? I have had 2 lumpectomies and just finished a double mast.  I did have cancer.  Each lump was removed upon discovery without a needle biopsy.  Each was removed with extra margins until they were clear.  But still the cancer slipped through.  That is when I decided I had to go to the extreem while my nodes were still clear.  Cancer is sneaky, it seems like he thought for some reason there was a high risk for you.  I would find out why he felt that way.  Or maybe he was way to over cautious, It would be hard to tell from here.  What were the discussions like before the surgery?  I guess I am repeating the prior poster, talk to the doctor about why he chose to do what he did.  It sounds like he had a difficulty in the surgery, though the bleeding could be just an unfortunate complication.  You have a lot to ask him.  I would also ask for the post sugical report where he should have given a rundown of how the surgery proceeded and any issues encountered.",
