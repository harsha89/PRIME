After talking with the OB and the radiologist, it seems that apparently women who aren't pregnant/breastfeeding CAN get infections in their milk ducts and that this isn't as uncommon or crazy as the internet makes it seem. I didn't have any other discharge when I went to the exam with the OB, and the ultrasound showed everything being totally normal. No lumps seen there, and no abscess. They said to just keep an eye on it, and if I have more bleeding or other discharge to visit with the surgeon I saw earlier this year. Apparently, there MIGHT be a benign papilloma that was too small to see on ultrasound right now, but it didn't sound super likely. I am supposed to follow up with my surgeon about something else anyway in November, so I'll be sure to mention this too during that appointment just in case. After finishing the antibiotics, I no longer feel the lump that was initially worrying me.",

I recently had a 3D diagnostic mammogram back on June 1st (I was having some other issues in my OTHER breast, but so they did a mammogram on both and ultrasound at that time despite me only being 28) that was all clear. On Thursday, I found a soft but noticeable pea sized lump under/off to the side of my nipple. It was definitely new, and freaked me out. I was seen by my GP on Friday morning... I was apparently running a slight fever (99F), and while doing the exam she did find the same lump I was talking about. She said she was surprised I'd noticed it because it was pretty small. I hadn't had any discharge, but then when she squeeze it.... pus came out, followed by blood. That scared me a lot. She's started me on antibiotics in case of infection, and sent the discharge off for a culture. But she basically said any time blood appears, it's a bad sign and so I am being sent to seen an OBGYN on Monday, and having an ultrasound on Tuesday. I'm pretty scared, guys. I've had a lot of health problems this year, and this is just the icing on the cake. I'm hoping it's \"just an infection\", but even that is weird because I'm not pregnant/breast feeding/diabetic/immunocompromised.... so I don't see why that would happen. This is weird, and I'm not happy about it. :| Log in to post a reply",

It's one of those things where even if it is an infection, apparently that's pretty darn weird for someone who has never been pregnant... Fingers crossed. I'll update when I know more. I haven't had any spontaneous discharge, but the area on that breast is tender/sore still - even with Aleve! Frustrating to say the least.",
