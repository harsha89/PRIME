    "Content": "LovelyShara wrote: About two days ago a rash appeared on my left breast. It started off with a series of sharp pain. My daily activities shave changed I started working out two days a week and associated the pain with me just pulling a muscle. I didn't start to panic until the rash appeared and when I goggled my symptoms. It\u2019s a blotchy patch, warm to touch with little spots. Really wanted some advice from anyone who has similar problem. I also have breast implants which scared me more. I wondered if this was a problem associated with them. Log in to post a reply",
