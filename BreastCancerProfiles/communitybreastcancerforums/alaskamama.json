I might someday feel differently -- and I can look into reconstruction if and when I do. But I really can't imagine changing my mind. I am small-breasted, and because I am thin the plastic surgeon said I would need a tissue expander and implants AND a lat flap to make a big enough boob. NO WAY! I am a runner and value mobility and function over a little mound on my chest. I'm very happy with the falsie from Nordstrom, which saved my insurance a bundle of money and saved me months and possibly years of procedures, risk, discomfort and possible diminution of arm/shoulder function. That said, I don't judge anyone for deciding differently! It's very personal and if I were large-breasted I might feel differently.Â  I wrote a blog post about this very issue called, \"Breasts, real and otherwise.\" It was inspired by a thread on BCO. I feel there is tacit pressure to reconstruct (especially if you're young), so I am grateful for the support I found here for going flat and happy! Best wishes with your decision. Remember, you can change your mind later -- don't rush into anything. http://alaskamamaruns.blogspot.com/2013/09/breasts... (I'll add that I'm widowed... that doesn't change anything for me as I wouldn't be interested in a guy who couldn't Deal With It!)",

      "Content": "alaskamama wrote: I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer three years ago at age 42. My oncologist has me on Letrozole (Femara), which she says is more effective than Tamoxifen. Because I am premenopausal and it's only effective if you're postmenopausal, I've been on Lupron which effectively puts one in chemical menopause. I dislike Lupron and am opting to have my ovaries and fallopian tubes removed - surgical menopause - in six weeks. Now that I'm actually reading about the procedure, risks and recovery, of course I'm getting a little nervous. My procedure will be laprascopic, though it'll be a bit complicated by having an umbilical hernia repair with mesh at the same time. Thanks in advance for any advice, encouragement, warning, etc.!
