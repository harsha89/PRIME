They did a breast exam and found a lump in my left breast.  They had me come back in 2 weeks after my period.  They then referred me to a breast specialist.  He found a different area than what the previous 2 Dr's found and the original area. He is now having me go get an ultra sound. My left breast is bigger than my right and I read that with breast cancer you can sometimes see the vein(s) in the breast...which I do see.  I also read that the skin can look like that of an orange...and I do believe I see a subtle area that is slighly pitted...but none of the Dr's really looked that closely at my skin on the breast and I'm not sure if it's just me imagining it.  One day my left arm pit was very sore but again, this only happened once and maybe it was in my head? I'm freaking out...and the waiting is horrible!  I'm in grad school I'm trying to stay focused but this is always on my mind. Can this happen to me?  I'm only 23!  Would I have other signs?  I heard that 70-80% of women diagnosed do not have a family history of breast cancer...I do not have a family history. I'm not sure if I should be worried.   Can anyone give me some advice?  Has this happend to other women?  What were your results? Thank you so much! Log in to post a reply",
