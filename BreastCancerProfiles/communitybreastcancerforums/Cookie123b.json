    "Content": "Cookie123b wrote: Hi everyone. I have very dense fibrocystic breasts that are riddled with cysts. I had two macro cysts aspirated this fall (one 40cc, the other 20cc) because the pain was so unbearable. When the cysts hurt the most I also feel very veryunwell. Today I\u2019m in pain and can feel the cysts enlarged but also feel almost like I have the flu (which I don\u2019t no temp or other symptoms). I feel awful. I am posting here to see if anyone else experiences feeling unwell when their breasts hurt the most. It\u2019s really impacting my life and aside from aspirations,EPO and managing caffeine I am not sure what to do. It\u2019s almost like my body is having a response to the cysts.
