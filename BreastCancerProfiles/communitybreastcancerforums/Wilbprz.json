I just had DIEP flap surgery 2.5 weeks ago. It was a unilateral mastectomy. I just wanted to see if anyone has had the same thing done because although the doctor says I\u2019m healing great I want to see if others are feeling the way I do. I had excellent doctors and everything went well. The pathology report came back as still DCIS with 2 small areas of micro invasion but nodes were clear and so were the margins. They say I don\u2019t need radiaction but have to talk to the oncologist to see What they want to do. I\u2019m hoping nothing more. Has anyone gone through the same thing",
