So year later, the 3D tech said yes, my breasts are dense when scan finished.  That's why I was shocked and confused by report stating I have no density.  Just frustrating because everyone I know that ever had breast cancer it was caught on ultrasound not mammogram.  And some didn't have dense breasts.  What if report in error and radiologist clicked wrong box hence the wrong chain letter sent to me?  I just wish our medical community would get act together. Or at least give you a density rating, what scale they use and what category you fall into so you can know how they derived at their conclusion.  Especially if one facility gives ultrasounds for anybody on scale 1-10 of density and the other only does if 5 or greater.   Instead of report saying you have density or no density.  I'm not hypochondriac and wasn't even concerned about exam.  I think I am fine.  I'm just annoyed because of discrepancy and now gotta resolve to make sure I'm fine and I have accurate info on my health.  My friends on other hand are on my case to resolve and telling me all the horror stories of people they know that were told mammo fine and later found out had BC.  They reminded that just recently a radiologist didn't read the MRI of my hip accurately and completely missed an entirely different problem.  So they are human too and make mistakes, overlook or even can mislabel the wrong chart.  So I gotta get CD and have my doctor compare both. Wonder who's right?  My heart goes out to all of you that have battled this monster or lost loved ones.  And thank you for being so helpful and insightful to those of us trying to understand and be better informed for our own health and loved ones.  xoxo",

Ever since I started going to gyno...I've always had fibrocystic breasts.  I've had lumps and masses over the years and few times I was given an ultrasound....all benign.  Thank god.  Had a friend diagnosed at 22.   So no shock when I was told I had dense breasts last year and needed extra test via ultrasound.  So few weeks ago, had my 2nd mammogram and expected ultrasound.  Told tech I had \"dense\" breasts and lucky me gets ultrasound too.  She uploaded my previous scans and did my mammo.  When she finished I inquired about density and she said yup, you got dense breasts.  I asked if going straight to ultrasound...she replied no because radiologist isn't in and need them to sign off.  She said normally it would be done same day when radiologist there.  But it was Friday afternoon.  I was told I'd be called to schedule ultrasound as soon as radiologist reviews.  Report just came in mail (No BC - NO DENSITY) ??So my question/concern is....can someone go from having very dense breasts to having no density in 1year?? Both techs each mammogram immediately said I got dense....so how can radiologist say not dense?  Is that possible?  Or should I be concerned with who is right?  Radiologist from last year or this radiologist?...I'm happy to be healthy but if this report is erroneous and radiologist made mistake then I don't know the real truth with my breasts without ultrasound... HELP??  ..All my friends with dense breasts (some less than mine) all had mammo & ultrasound.   Do I have Dense or Not?  Log in to post a reply",
