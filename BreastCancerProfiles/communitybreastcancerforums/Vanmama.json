I drink my share of each of them though I do drink plain water at home, for the most part. I had my first full chemo infusion on Thursday, felt pretty lousy on Friday though I did manage to work a half day. Came home at 11:30 with nausea and body aches. Yesterday was mostly body aches and little energy and today it's hitting the fan! My tongue is hurting, every joint in my body hurts, and the bathroom trips have begun. Made it kind of hard to run the few errands we had for today--we did manage to get groceries but didn't manage to make any purchases at Lowes, for the house we're moving to. Good thing we have no time limit! I'm interested to see if I lose any hair this week from the failed Taxotere two weeks ago. I had a bunch of side effects from receiving 30 seconds of T before it caused a full blown anaphylactic reaction a couple of weeks ago. It's something new every day, isn't it? Laura",

I am on Day 15 after my first full chemo infusion of CMF. Two weeks before that I had a major anaphylactic reaction to a thimbleful of Taxotere. I have had side effects from Day 3 after the T. This week I am really struggling with being soooo tired all the time. Yesterday I noticed a few times that I was just a bit unsteady when getting up from my chair. I have had a headache for a week--nothing horrid just annoying. Oh, and I'm going to throw up sometime every day. It's not always at the same time of day but it will happen. I'm assuming they are normal side effects, right? I've been thru the nausea, sore tongue, bathroom issues, no energy...it's kind of like a Ferris wheel, where I get a new issue every time the wheel goes around! My next infusion is May 7th. Laura",

Oh, I have issues, of course, but just nothing as severe as what you are going through! The American Heart Association Heart Walk is being planned for September. My employer is sponsoring it in our town and we do a lot of activities to raise money. This subject is near & dear to my heart because I do deal with Atrial Fibrillation, also. We do baskets to auction off and I want to sponsor a \"chemo care for breast cancer\" basket. I'm coming to you to ask for suggestions for what should be included since I haven't needed so much of what you have. I have a soft chemo hat, for starters, and will include peppermint tea because I have drank gallons of it since the start of this whole thing. I'd like to hear what you feel is important to include. Thanks so much for your help! Laura",
