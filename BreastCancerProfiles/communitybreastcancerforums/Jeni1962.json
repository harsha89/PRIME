It's amazing what we endure and go through and come out on the other side...still kicking and fighting! :) I logged on today...it's been a while because I'm having some issues that I believe are from Radiation treatments.  I had a left breast Lumpectomy in Aug. 2012....then in May 2013...2 more biopsy surgeries within a week of each other in the same breast because of a suspicious area. It was negative. However now....I'm going through P.T. for breast pain...shoulder range of motion issues.  My biggest concern though is I'm having some pretty severe rib pain. Really all over in my chest wall...I've felt that for a while. But under my left breast at the bottom of my rib cage...ironically right under my radiation tattoo....I'm having SEVERE rib pain. Painful to even lay a finger on the area or stretch my body. My P.T. thinks I need to go back to my Radiation Oncologist or my Oncologist to  have it checked out. I am going to do that. It really feels like my bones all in my chest wall are brittle...if that makes sense. I had 5 days a week for 6 weeks Radiation...then 4 days of boosts in the area. I honestly didn't think I would have side effects for this long. It actually feels like it's getting worse.  Mainly came on here to find out if others have that kind of rib pain. I see that you do. I swear sometimes I think...\"Am I just making this up? Am I really still feeling all of this?\"  Does that make sense?  Anyhow....thanks for letting me jump in here. ",

They did a rib/chest X-Ray....all bones look good. So that's good. I was afraid I might have had a small hairline fracture. So...I'm still going to call my RAD ONC/ ONC this week and make an appointment just to rule anything out. Doesn't it suck...everytime we have a pain like this we INSTANTLY think the worse! I try not to. I'm a pretty positive thinking person but that pain throws me right into the \"What if's\" zone!   Thanks again for responding. Always nice to chat with others who have been there...done that! Have a great day!! Jeni",

I can not extend my left arm out fully. I have to hold it in a bent position because it is too painful to extend. From my elbow up it is swollen and very tender and painful. My arm feels heavy and carrying it around in a bent position all of the time is tiresome. I have a sling from a previous injury that I have thought of wearing from time to time if I have to be walking for any period of time. Don't want that on too long though..don't want my arm \"stuck\" in that position. My arm is REALLY hurting! My general Dr. is out of town so is my surgeon so I went to an associate of my general Dr. today. He put me on Ibuprofin 800...3x a day for 5 days to see if this helps. I am very nervous that it's Lymphedema...but I don't want to over react. I don't know who to talk to about this. I am going in on Monday the 27th to see my RO for the first time...a meet and greet. Figured I'd ask him as well. Any comments? Do my symptoms sound like it to you? I have read things....researched...til I'm blue in the face...and it seems to me that it's the beginings for sure. Thanks for any help you can give to me. Don't want to be paranoid but hard not to be sometimes!  Jeni  Log in to post a reply",

Such a roller coaster ride of emotions. I have a lot of loving friends and family that support me and for that I feel very grateful. However, one thing that bothers me...as soon as I say Stage 0 everyone is like...oh, well...that's not so bad! I agree...OMG...it could be worse and again...I am thankful it is not. But....it's still CANCER. Has anyone else experianced that from other people? I know they mean well and are trying to make is sound better by minimizing it...but to me it's still CANCER. I don't care how little it is. I still have to have it removed and have to have radiation after. My surgery is this Tuesday the 7th of August. I am getting more and more anxious. In my gut I know I'll be ok...but nervous about the testing after on the section they remove. Is it HER2 positive, which means it is more aggressive than they thought. They say it's non-invasive...is it really? They don't know these things FULLY until they do the surgery. Then you have to wait a few days for the results.  If I find that it really is even slightly invasive or if it's more aggressive than they thought...I will be talking to my surgeon again about going in and having a mastectomy. Just so many emotions running through my head. I hope this site can help me to understand my feeliings by chatting with others that are feeling the same way. Thanks for your time...and thanks for this space to feel safe and just vent! Jeni  Log in to post a reply",
