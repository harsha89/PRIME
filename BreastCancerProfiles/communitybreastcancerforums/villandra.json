I have a 30 year old pea-sized enlarged lymph node under my arm.   Most people who look for it can feel it, but I doubt it's more than an eighth of an inch in diameter, certainly not more than a quarter of an inch.   You should see those ultrasounds trying to clearly depict my much larger uterine fibroids.   I mean, sometimes they can't even find them all!   Sometimes they can't distinguish that two of them are two separate fibroids.  They are completely inconsistent with the sizes How much information of any kind can you really get about a small lump from an ultrasound? Is it true that an ultrasound can only distingish whether a lump is solid or filled with water? If so, would there be any reason to do one on a 30 year old, hard, pea-sized (pretty small pea) enlarged lymph node?  Or any other lymph node?   I do believe that lymph nodes are always solid?      Yours, Dora Smith.     Log in to post a reply",
