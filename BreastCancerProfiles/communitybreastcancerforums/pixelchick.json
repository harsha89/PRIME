They don't think it is anything at all but anything over a 2% chance they like to biopsy. I am glad they err on the side of caution. I am sure you will find yourself in the 80-85% as well! Hang in there and think positive thoughts. This board was very helpful, supportive, and calming for me and I am sure you will find the same.",

Perhaps the other lump is clear that it is nothing to the radiologist. But yes I would still confirm with BS as they would know best. I understand your concern and would feel the same way as you. Hang in there, breathe and relax until you talk to breast surgeon.",

      "Content": "pixelchick wrote: Just got home from my first ever biopsy and boy was I scared going in. Even though everyone said it wouldn't hurt I still couldn't get the thought of a needle going through my breast. So I had a small pinch from numbing then felt nothing, barely any pressure. It really was painless. So now I wait for results, Dr told me should have them eod Thursday! I had BI RAD 4a plus the radiologist doing the biopsy said they broke apart when taking samples which is a good sign they are just cysts. I am trying to hang on to the 80% are B9! Just scared as a lot of cancer runs in my family. Mother had colon cancer, father kidney cancer, great aunt breast cancer so I am a bit on edge. I have been having mammos every 6 months since my first one so they have been watching and are being cautious which is good. So if it is bad news then it should be very early. Wanted to share with those still waiting to have their biopsy that is isn't bad at all, over very quickly and doesn't hurt....of course I am still numb so I am sure I will be a bit sore once it wears off, but the procedure itself was very easy!

      "Content": "Nov 20, 2013 02:13PM - edited Nov 20, 2013 02:15PM by pixelchick Glad to hear it wasn't painful for you either. I am sure this helps and will help others who are waiting to have theirs done. As for mine, it is left breast about 7:00, I did bleed a bit but that is because they didn't use epinephrine (sp?) in the local because I tend to get light headed and dizzy from it, so that can cause more bleeding and more bruising. So far it doesn't look bruised and pain on a scale of 1-10 it ranges from a 2-4 maybe, at times it likes to remind me what happened to it mostly just soreness not really pain pain if you know what I mean. I can see it will be a bit sore for a few days but I can live with that, especially if I get good news tomorrow. This waiting is the hardest part. I know in my head that I have an 80% chance of being fine, but still can't help want let my mind wander to the \"what if\" land. Try not to read too much online and examine too much now, that will drive you crazy for sure...though I should take my own advice :) hang in there! Positive vibes coming your way!",
