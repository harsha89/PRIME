I mixed a brew of pure Jojoba, Rosemary, Castor and Argan oils and applied them to my scalp every evening before bed for about 3 months. Finally started seeing some slow growth around 6 weeks post chemo. I have no way of knowing if it helped or not but my hair has grown back evenly, thick (like before) and wavy (hair was previously straight).

Hair is such a part of our identity as women! I finished chemo on June 28th and immediately started taking biotin and using a hair tonic I made with Jojoba, Rosemary, Castor and Argan oils. I would just rub it all over my scalp every night before bed. It took 5 weeks before I saw ANY kind of growth at all but then my hair started to grow in pretty thick and even (and unfortunately, grey...). Still not growing fast enough for me! I was finally able to colour it last week (the final photo). I also started taking Tamoxifen about 6 weeks post chemo so I've been on it for over 3 months now and have yet to notice any hair thinning. ",

I am however using Latisse again so I can \"go natural\" again. It does work very well. Thanks all for the tips on facial \"fuzz\"... I think I'm going to try to exfoliate a few times first. I just can't imagine shaving!! I'm so scared of getting stubble/regrowth on my face... yikes. @ MamaOz... Your hair looks gorgeous. Your curls are beautiful. I know the feeling of wanting to colour it though... I did the same thing last week and sent a pic to my hair stylist asking her if it was long enough to colour. Thankfully it was! I was on the fence whether to go light or dark, as highlights were not yet an option. I chose light and since I have so much grey, I thought it would look more deliberate with dark(ish) roots growing in on light hair (than salt and a little pepper hair growing in on dark hair!) My roots haven't started to grow out yet but in the next couple of weeks I'll get an idea of how it looks against the light (dyed) hair colour. I'll keep you posted. @ lovepugs77...Your hair is growing in beautifully and looks really healthy. Best of luck to you! I actually liked taking the pics and although everyone is different, at around the stage you're at now it was growing so fast I could see a difference every couple of days! Would love to see more pics soon if you're up to sharing. Hugs.",

Sharp pains too! My RO did say the worst was going to be in the two weeks post-radiation.... Hopefully this time next week, it will start to heal. Think I will try Calendula, green tea compresses or pure aloe gel as some have suggested. Unlike most others, I started Tamoxifen two months prior to beginning rads. Going on four months now with (thankfully so far) no side effects other than hot flashes. Good luck to everyone still in treatment and Happy Thanksgiving to my American friends.
