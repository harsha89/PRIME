The medical providers and the insurance company do not agree on the pic codes, so therefore I am so limited on what I can get. The medical providers use the pic code number of L8010 for my sleeve and my insurance says this is a custom sleeve with that pic code, not one off the shelf. I only get the ones off the shelf. I have made many phone calls and am getting nowhere. BCBS won't change their pic codes and the home medical place won't change theirs. Therefore I am not covered, even though my policy says I can have 6 sleeves off the shelf a year. Grrr....Is anyone else struggling like this getting their home medical sleeves and gloves to go through insurance?   Dx 10/17/2012, IDC, 6cm+, Grade 2, 1/11 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2- Chemotherapy 10/24/2012 AC + T (Taxol) Surgery 4/3/2013 Lymph node removal: Left, Underarm/Axillary; Mastectomy: Left; Prophylactic mastectomy: Right; Prophylactic ovary removal Log in to post a reply",

It is something I will certainly check into though. Yes, so frustrated. I have never had an issue with BCBS before, all through chemo, surgery and rads. Not sure why they are being so difficult now. It is certainly not a fashion statement I ever wanted to wear that's for sure! :)  ",

My oncologist said markers don't change, but finally agreed to it and it came back 10% ER positive. I am on tamoxifen for 5 yrs now. Whether the 10% helps or not, I may never know, but feel I need to be on it just in case!",
