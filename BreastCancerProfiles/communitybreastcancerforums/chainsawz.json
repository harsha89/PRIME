One of the best documented is Barbara Bradfield who achieved a complete clinical cure after participating in the Phase I Trial of Herceptin in 1993, She has not had to take any chemo since the trial ended 17 years ago. Another is Ginger Empey who was the first patient enrolled in the Phase III trial in 1995. Ginger discontinued chemo in Sept. 2008. I was first diagnosed at stage IV in 1999 with brain mets and tumors in my chest. I was treated with Herceptin for nine years and stopped all chemo in November 2008 after consulting with Dr. Dennis Slamon. The three of us remain cancer free, there are others whose stories on on the HER2 Support Group's website: http://her2support.org/community/member-stories Please don't misinterpret this as I am not advocating that all Stage IV bc survivors on Herceptin should discontinue treatment as this is a very serious decision that should not be fully discussed with your oncologist. But it does happen !! Hugs Christine I just read a post from yet another woman on another site who was on herceptin for 8.5 years and has been off everything for the last year.  Her onc wants her to go back on herceptin, and she is posting because she is hesitant....the year break was nice for her :>  There is always hope!!!",

There are 2 types of bone metastases. In osteolytic or lytic metastases, the cancer cells dissolve some of the minerals in the bone, making an area of the bone less dense. If the cancer has destroyed enough of the bone's substance, these appear on x-rays as a darker hole in the gray-white bone image [\"Swiss Cheese like\"]. Bones with osteolytic metastases tend to break very easily. Osteoblastic or blastic metastases cause an area of the bone to appear denser or sclerotic [\"scar like\"]. On x-rays, these metastases show up as spots that are whiter than the bone around them. . Often, bone metastases have both lytic and blastic features. Sometimes bone scans fail to find cancer that has spread to the bones. This happens most often if the metastases are purely osteolytic (where bone is less dense). In some patients, the scan may show no radioactivity in areas of bone that the cancer has already destroyed. In some cases, a CT scan can help tell if the cancer has spread into your bones. It may be used when bone metastases are only osteolytic, since these metastases sometimes don't show up in bone scans.   Because an MRI scan is very useful for looking at the spine and spinal cord, it is the standard test used if spinal cord compression is suspected. MRIs are also good at finding problems in bones and joints. Often an MRI scan is done to better define a bone mass seen on an x-ray. MRI scans can usually tell if the mass is likely to be a tumor, an infection, or some type of bone damage from other causes.  ",

Doesn't mean cancer, but it worries the docs.  I'm not an expert, but you can google breast asymmetry and find better info that what I am probably writing here :> Just know there is hope for your mom!  There is also a great site to look at regarding brain mets and her2+ because information will be important for you.  It is more common for her2+ than many realize and can respond to treatment, but we tend to get clumped in with all cancer patients by the radiology oncologists.  Here's the link:   http://home.earthlink.net/~ckane/bcwatchdigest-brain.htm",

Perhaps a mortgage, car payment, or unpaid student loans. These debts might not be forgiven, but they might not be recoverable either. And his family isn't always stuck with the debt. Debts Debts do not die with the deceased. Although death creates an emotional burden on survivors, debts--and any money owed to the deceased--must be addressed. Even Uncle Sam will want his money, so tax returns must be filed, creditors contacted, plans made. However, some debts are forgiven after the debtor dies; these can include credit card accounts and other credit accounts such as federal student loans. It is important to take a close look at the deceased's circumstances. The Heirs Relatives and heirs to the estate are not required to repay the deceased's debts. However, because the estate must pay back all debts required (not forgiven) and possible (assuming the money does not run out), the inheritance might shrink or disappear. Also, if you are a co-signer or co-owner on a debt with the deceased, you are generally responsible for at least a portion of the debt. Otherwise, heirs and relatives cannot be forced to pay.",

I had a planning CT and then an MRI a week before so they could map my spots.  Then, I went for the actual procedure which was painless and took 40 minutes per mets.  It was like having an x-ray.  Very easy, and I went to work the next day.  I was told to expect fatigue, but I never did. I have read many posts from other BC patients who had the \"old\" framed method where patients were required to have a metal head ring attached to their skull with four pins. From what I read this was not always a pleasant process.  If possible, I would encourage everyone to locate a facility that uses the a system that allows \"frame-less\" stereotactic radiosurgery, which is just as accurate and much easier....this is just my opinion, but thought I would throw this out there....

I know this combo has kicked some serious cancer butt, so I am hoping this is a great mix for you!!! ",

These changes result in an increase of the cell membrane permeability, which allows nonpermeant molecules to enter the cell. This phenomenon is called cell electroporation (or electropermeabilisation) and is becoming widely used to improve anticancer drug delivery into cells, which is being referred to as electrochemotherapy.",

I also copied the blurb below from another thread in the stage I and II forum which the poster copied from the triple negative forum...LOL!!!  http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/108/topic/748340?page=1#post_1719778 Abraxane v Taxol (comment from TNBC forum) \"Hey, I just heard a talk on Abraxane vs Taxol, and Abraxane appears to be both more efficacious and with fewer side effects.  Abraxane consists of nanoparticles of albumin arranged in a sphere with taxol inside.  Because of the improved efficacy (weekly is best, at 150mg), Abraxane will probably become standard of care.  With Avastin it works even better, as chemotherapy causes cancer cells that don't die to overexpress VegF (proangiogenesis and creating resistance to chemo), and Avastin shuts down the VEGF circuitry. \"",

The harm is that we've lost our focus for finding the real answers. We continue to fail those 40,000 women every year. We need less focus on \"early detection\" and more focus on understanding the reality of breast cancer - how to stop the aggressive cancers that aren't detected with mammography, how to stop breast cancer from recurring, and how to prevent it from metastasizing to other parts of the body and becoming lethal.\" For the whole article go here: http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20091012/EDIT02/910120349/1019/EDIT/Mammography%20isn%20t%20the%20cure-all%20we%20d%20hoped%20for",

This was the old man's reply. Grandfather says this: \"In life there is sadness as well as joy, losing as well as winning, falling as well as standing, hunger as well as plenty, badness as well as goodness. I do not say this to make you despair, but to teach you reality. Life is a journey sometimes walked in light, sometimes walked in shadow.\" Grandfather says this: \"You did not ask to be born, but you are here. You have weakness as well as strengths. You have both because in life there is two of everything. Within you is the will to win, as well as the willingness to lose. Within you is the heart to feel compassion as well as the smallness to be arrogant. Within you is the way to face life as well as the fear to turn away from it.\" Grandfather says this: \"Life can give you strength. Strength can come from facing the storms of life, from knowing loss, feeling sadness and heartache, from falling into the depths of grief. You must stand up in the storm. You must face the wind and the cold and the darkness. When the storm blows hard you must stand firm, for it is not trying to knock you down, it is really trying to teach you to be strong.\" Grandfathers says this: \"Being strong means taking one more step toward the top of the hill, no matter how weary you may be. It means letting the tears flow through the grief. It means to keep looking for the answer, though the darkness of despair is all around you. Being strong means to cling to hope for one more heartbeat, one more sunrise. Each step, no matter how difficult, is one more step closer to the top of the hill. To keep hope alive for one more heartbeat at a time leads to the light of the next sunrise, and the promise of a new day.\" Grandfather says this: \"The weakest step toward the top of the hill, toward sunrise, toward hope, is stronger than the fiercest storm.\" Grandfather says this: \"Keep going.\"",

Komen and the American Cancer Society to see if any of them can help pay costs until she has insurance.  Meantime, you could set up appointments with the breast surgeon and oncologist.  Sometimes it can take a bit to get an appointment because they are usually booked to the hilt. ",

Thanks to cafe lover for lighting a fire under me, and thanks for caring so much. Hope all is well with all of you. ",

Do you know how many mets your mom has and the size?  Those two factors determine what type of treatment plan she will receive and if she has to have WBR (whole brain radiation) or can just have cyberknife treatment.  We are all here for you!  Best to you and your mom!   lisa",
