I'm 22 years old as well and had some breast changes that have sent me into emotional breakdowns and spirals. Im sure I have health anxiety as well. i just recently discovered that I have fibrocystic breasts that have been concluded from multiple physical examinations and US. I am currently pushing for an MRI/biopsy to just give myself 100% peace of mind that this is B9. I know it's so hard to stay away from google, and I have read the exact same articles that you have mentioned about 22/23year olds being diagnosed without breast cancer and it sends my mind and heart racing with worst case scenarios, But they had different situations than we did. We just gotta breathe! Haha feel free to message me if you have anything you need to vent about. You are not alone girly! (((Hugs)))",
