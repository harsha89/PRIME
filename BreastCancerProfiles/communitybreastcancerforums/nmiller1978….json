It is exciting but more than a little scary because this is completely uncharted territory. I go back to treatment on Tuesday, so several of us will be on the same schedule ;-) Towny, I am also in NY, but in the Saratoga Springs area, I treat at Albany Med through NYOH which is a division of US Oncology. One thing I do have to caution you guys about is cancer assays...I don't have all the information, but have been told by many including several of my doctors that these tests are not yet reliable and exorbitantly expensive. Please, please research it further before spending that kind of money, I know we stage IV girls are often preyed upon because of the desperation of our prognosis. There is a thread addressing this specifically on TNBCfoundation.org under the metastatic forum.  Also, I've been told that PARP efficacy IS tied specifically to BRCA mutations and even more specifically BRCA 1. TNs who are BRCA 1 generally have more basal like tumors, these types of tumors are more likely to respond to this treatment than non basal like tumors. That's what I've been told by my oncologist and what my research has uncovered. Good Luck to all starting PARP trials soon. I would recommend you stock up on Colace now!! I was \"regular\" my entire life, even on 8 months of Taxol/Avastin... this combo changed all that quickly!! Hugs and prayers!! God Bless you all, Nicole ",

And yes my scans have been completely clear for some time now. In March the tumor in my breast was significantly smaller and by May 1st the SUV in both breasts was identical, less than a 1.0 but some uptake because I had dense tissue. No lymph nodes ever lit up after my diagnosing PET in Match 2010. My liver has been completely clear since July 2010. When I had my mastectomy in June all 24 lymph nodes were clear and my tissue (all of it) was completely cancer free, not even a micro met to be found. I guess this is pretty rare. My first post surgical scan was Aug 12, 2011 and that was still perfect. My next one is the first week of November but I feel pretty good about it. Stay tuned!! @Terri, thanks for your support. I had to go out on a limb and disagree with my doctor but I knew in my hear that it was the right decision. Trust your gut!! Nobody has your best interests at heart more than you!!

The reason being surgery takes car of the localized disease but doesn't treat anything metastatic. Because we are not hormone sensitive, hormonals and AIs don't work on us, these drugs can be taken while \"off\" chemo for surgery, with TNs, all defenses are down for surgery. So in my case, even though the primary tumors were taken care of by surgery, the liver mets (theoretically) would be left to grow unchecked. That's why the aggressiveness of TN is such a big factor, 6 weeks off chemo without good control of the disease can be a total crapshoot: yes you want the primary gone, but those aren't the ones that kill you. So, for now we are hopeful that my liver mets responded the way my primary did. Won't know until my next scan for sure, but that's the way it usually works. Also, I never had AC, Taxol/Avastin for 8 months & the PARP trial since 12/10. Hope this helps!  God Bless Nicole ",

Be your own advocate!! My Onc is great, but a little on the conservative side. I had to BEG for a BMX. His reason for concern: TNs can't have any TX during surgery and recovery the way women with ER/PR+ can so there would be NO defenses in place for up to 8 weeks, this made him (understandably) nervous. I came across Hydeskate's story and PM'd her some questions. Her results are really what put my onc over the top on moving forward with the BMX. So ABSOLUTELY do your own research!

It's definitely working its magic on the cancer as my primary tumor was reduced by more than a third after only two weeks but it seems it's \"tickiling\" my liver as well. Liver enzymes in just 4 weeks have been climbing steadily from 30s to 164 to 180 and then today 338!!! Tenfold in four weeks. I was last scanned 12/08/10 and there was nada anywhere but my right breast (had two large liver lesions at dx 4/10). Onc is insistent that this is chemo related and not indicative of new disease in the liver (since the primary site has reduced so quickly). Because my enzymes were so high they withheld tx today. My question, is this par for the course? I know Gem is known to cause liver issues but these numbers are alarming to me. Any ideas on how to calm it down? My Onc is conservative & totally against milk thistle, turmeric, etc. but I wold love any input. I don't want to miss anymore treatments on a drug that seems to be working so well!!!

We lived in the UK for 13 years when my father was stationed over there with the U.S. military. We lived a short distance from Cambridge. I've always followed your posts and wondered... As far as a break from Chemo goes...such a tough subject! I'm tolerating this very well thus far and the word 'progression' scares the crap out of me. My onc offered me two months off at the end of this cycle and I said \"No, thanks!!!\" I'm afraid to be OFF chemo. how sick is that? Anybody else feel that way? Off to get my poison this AM, Weds is my day for tx and it's good to get something to kill the beast!!!!!!Thanks again for the advice, really appreciate it! Nicole ",

Creeping toward high since I've been on Avastin...yesterday it was 142/90. So today before TX, the nurse took my blood pressure again, this time in my right arm.My primary tumor was in my right breast, although I've never had anything surgical done, they've always taken my BP on the left. So imagine my surprise when the machine read 122/86!! Then checked against the left arm which this time read 146/97!! What the hell??? I asked and her response was....some people are just built that way, could be your vascular system. Huh?!! Can you say \"brush off\"?!! Needless to say I have a call in to my MD but can any of you shed some light on this?? Just curious!! Thanks!

Nothing showing in liver, lungs, etc. BUT, there was some uptake noted in the \"former breast area\" whatever the hell that means. Didn't get a value in it but I know it was slight. This was noted on both sides with more uptake noted in the right side (where the tumor was and where I had 24 nodes removed). I was told this is most likely post surgical scarring and healing and not to worry as it's only been 10 weeks since surgery. I know the radiologist so he reads these stat as a favor but of course NOW I need to ask a question about a report I'm not even supposed to have access to!  Onc is on vacay til I see him on Tuesday. Let me finish by adding my pathology from surgery was PRISTINE, not even anything microscopic found. AND nothing has ever shown up on the left side. Radiologist said he was just being thorough but I of course am panicking. Anybody have any experience with this? It's gonna be a loooong weekend!

Your profile didn't say whether you are triple negative but I'm assuming you are. Ok, first off do you have good disease control from the neck down? Second there are two schools of thought with SRS vs WBR: wbr can only be used once and can have some pretty decent, sorta scary side effects. OR which is what I wished I had done, do wbr first then use SRS as a boost to go after the little ones. I opted for SRS first for fear of losing my hair. Stupid vanity. Now I'm out of options except for trials. We shall see!! Either way, get a second opinion!' Nicole",

Took about two months to start coming back and I definitely had the reverse Mohawk thing you read about, but it filled in slowly and a year later it's thick & curly. Side effects vary. Personally fatigue was my biggest issue. Sleep when you're tired but STAY ACTIVE. Eat well and take all your meds as prescribed.  Steroids suck but they are necessary. Listen and follow your docs orders. That MD after his name doesn't make him god but it does give him credibility. Do get a second opinion at a research or university hospital. If both docs are in agreement I would do it. They're attempting to reduce what's called tumor burden. And the great thing is you still have the option of SRS to clean up any new spots.  Don't forget, you feel fine: go by how you FEEL, not how some piece of paper says you should feel. Best of luck. The thought is much scarier than the reality.  Love & prayers Nicole",
