I faired pretty well.  They took the lump ( approx 2 cm) the sentinel node and 3 auxiliary nodes.  I had a drain for a week.  They took it out yesterday.  I started arm exercises the very next day!  I must say, I don't like them but they've really helped.  Now I wait for lab results.  Sometime next week, they're going to contact me with the results.  Not going to worry about that though (or at least try not to) One day at a time someone told me.  These are words to live by.  So count me in on the tally of April girls.  For those of you recovering from surgery or those of you who haven't had their surgeries yet and for those who have survived this whole ordeal.....God bless!",
