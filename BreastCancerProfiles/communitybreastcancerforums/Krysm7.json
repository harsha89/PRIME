They have me an IV and some dexamethasone. Didn\u2019t touch headache. Also did a ct to rule anything out there. My neuts are 0.4 White are 1.6 Plates 206 No fever They ended up having to send me to emergency for further investigation. I sat there for over 3 hours to see a doctor. I asked if I could just try some sumatriptan that I\u2019ve had in past for migraines. They kept telling me could be something more severe. So it was okay to let me suffer for hours just incase. So now ER doctor, who I\u2019ve heard gets excited about doing lumbars, wants to go straight to a lumbar. No more blood work, no other tests straight to lumbar. If I refuse lumbar I go on 3 antibiotics. Any advice??
