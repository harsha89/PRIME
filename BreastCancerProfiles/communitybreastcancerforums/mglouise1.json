I went in for my ultrasound on my lump, which I have had for awhile, and just ignored it. It hasn't changed size other than a little each month with my period. I have large breasts so I guess I just never noticed that it was on the larger side. I had an ultrasound, and the doctor came in and told me I most likely have a Fibroadenoma, but he wants to biopsy it due to it's size (4cm) just to make sure it's not a Phyllodes which he said is unlikely. He said \"It does not look like Breast Cancer.\" But my ultrasound report rated me BIRADS 4, which had been FREAKING me out. It also says \"probable fibroadenoma\" I am only 24, and I know the chances are low, but the BIRADS 4 has me sooo worried. Anyone else been in a similar boat? Thanks, and hugs!
