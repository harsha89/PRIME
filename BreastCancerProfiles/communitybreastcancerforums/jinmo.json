It's DCIS on the left side, diagnosed via biopsy of calcifications. No more specific info yet. So I am telling myself this is good news. I know DCIS is good news in a relative sense. But in truth, I am completely freaking out. I have had miscellaneous pain on that side for quite a while, having had a pleurisy diagnosis early this year, and some continuing shortness of breath. So now of course I think everything on my left side is cancerous. I know that's unlikely but this is how your mind goes, right? My husband and I go to consult with surgeon on Monday the 5th. The wait seems like forever and meanwhile I am wrestling with who to tell (other than an entire internet forum, ha!). Meanwhile I will be reading and learning. Thanks to all for listening.

Good luck with your conversation with parents. It is a difficult one but just do the best you can. They will want to do something for you, so maybe you can think of some small practical thing that will make them feel helpful. I'll be thinking of you. Fightingirl, laughed at your getting ready for bed story, it's all about how can I get myself into a cozy nest as efficiently as possible here too. We all deserve a little time in the cozy nest, I think. 3bears, sorry about your tissue expanders not going in. But better to wait for the right time for your body. laastra, congrats on your surgery going well! I did not get pathology today, wah. So it will be Monday, when I have my followup appt with the surgeon anyway. Oh, I wanted to mention that my wedge pillow is wonderful. I have been able to stay in bed all night each night since surgery. So those still waiting for surgery might want to consider buying one. I didn't buy very many things on the \"items needed for post-surgery\" list, but I am really glad I bought that one. One other practical thing, I do find that I can open and close my recliner's handle with no problem. The handle is on my right side, where I did not have any nodes pulled. I think I could do it even on the left if I had to. I know earlier in the thread there were some people worried about getting in and out of a recliner, so wanted to share my experience. jinmo",

Don't just let it go, ok? Based on what I've read here (I am no expert), some types of pain can relate to lymphedema which you will want to get on top of right away. Hope you feel better.",

Today's women: Laastra, tennischick888 and lovesgreenthings, sending you calm thoughts. You can do this. I saw some new names, welcome to all of you. Edgeofnowhere, can I call you eon? It's easier to type. Leftcoastie, good luck with your drain removal on Tuesday. Annoyingboob: congrats on your shower, and thanks for the path to the cabins pic. I am a scuba diver so tomorrow while the surgeon thinks I am unconscious, I will be out cruising around some shallow reefs (that's what those dark areas are on the first cabin pic). Then I am going to swim back, climb out of the water onto that path and I will see you ladies at the bar. Still hoping for a handsome recovery room nurse so I can babble all this stuff about cabins, reef fish and blue water to him while I am coming out of anesthesia! DCISinAZ, sorry about your surgery delay but an ill plastic surgeon doesn't sound good at all. And your dog too. Arg, what a week. I saw some discussion about DCIS above so just wanted to chime in that I was told for my particular DCIS that if I chose lumpectomy there would be 25 or 35(?), 5 days/wk for x weeks radiation treatments and 5 years of tamoxifen. I am 50 years old. Just throwing that data into the mix for you guys, I know everybody's diagnosis is different. 2moveforward, congrats on no nodes but sorry to hear you will have to do chemo. Pugsmama and all the others starting or waiting to hear about chemo, smack those little cancer cells down! I think it was shellybeans who found her clean mammo report from before. Yeah, I have one from May 2016 marked as calcifications, non-suspicious. If I find that thing around here I swear I'm going to burn it. And my tomorrow sisters: Did-not-see-this-coming, zookeeper, cowboy-up, and GT1965, here we go. I'm going to get out of the house and run some errands today. Remember to ask whether you can have anti-nausea meds with your anesthesia if you want them, I am having them. I will be back later today to check in.

You're going to do just fine. 3bears, I think it was you who said you have the wooden chest problem, I have that too. It seems to be weirdly below my incisions, right along my ribs. I am still not looking down there, but I can feel that the area there is slightly swollen and I have been working on doing some massage along it, hoping to loosen things up. It seems to help a little bit but not much yet. I was hoping that tight feeling it was the tape from the drains, but no such luck, those are gone now and it's definitely inside my body. Ok, so this is pretty funny and none but you guys will understand. A group of the exercises they gave me to do has me bending forward at 90 degrees from the waist, supporting myself with one hand/arm on our kitchen island, and the other arm hanging down freely. So then I'm supposed to wave my body in different directions for however many reps with the free arm swinging back and forth, side to side, clockwise, counterclockwise, etc. Of course all this with my eyes closed tight so heaven forbid I don't see my chest, and my husband laughing at my wiggling around resembling a child imitating an elephant's trunk, and carefully considering my fingers on the whirling around ones so I don't whack into something in the kitchen, which is not all that big. Whee, look how high I can make my arm go! It's amazing the stuff I now find entertaining. And one more funny for all of you. My husband has been helping me shower, which we have been referring to as \"putting me through the car wash\", and last night I pointed out that it cannot possibly be a car wash, because I have no headlights. Ba dum bump. Terrible BC jokes, apparently they come with the territory. There is plenty of crying too, I promise you that I am not really some manic Pollyanna. Pugsmama's doctor was exactly right, you have to walk through all the emotions. All right, you brave women, have a good day. ",

Let's see, I did my pre-surgery stuff order on Amazon: wedge pillow, shower chair, little holder doodad for the shower head so it can be down on the wall where I can get to it (it's already a handheld but sits way up the wall in a normal shower position), recovery yoga video, and one of those horseshoe-shaped neck pillows. The freezer is stocked with pre made meals. Going to Sam's Club this week to stock up on heavy pantry items so I don't have to buy and lift them after surgery. Peanut butter, for instance. Can't have a day without peanut butter. Also, some smoked salmon. Not because it's heavy, just because I want it! Fresh food shopping for veggies, etc. is the beginning of next week. Anyone who hasn't had a chance or noticed that it's there, you might want to check out the https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/91/topics/699896?page=16#idx_451, for a good shopping list. It's all summarized right there in the first post, with things you might want to buy or to gather up from around your house so you are ready for hospital and post-surgery. Oh, one last thing I thought of: if any of you are Amazon Prime members, there are free meditation/relaxation recordings available for streaming. I listened to one night before last, very calming.

Cowboy-up, I go on Tuesday as well. Getting nervous, for sure. Doing accounting work today for my business, and then I am going to clean my refrigerator! And maybe sweep in all the dusty corners of my house, of which there are many. I have one precious Xanax from a short prescription the prior breast surgeon gave me (I started a process in December and then opted to wait after year end as my insurance was switching to a different health system). I am saving it for the night before path reports, unless I break down and demand more before then. I don't want to take them but the stress of waiting may wear me out. Melatonin has helped with sleep a little and my surgeon's nurse said it was OK to take, so you guys may want to consider that if you haven't already. All right, I'm going to try to step away. If I can manage to distract myself, I won't be back until Monday morning. Or you may see me way before that! Take care this weekend, all. jinmo ",

      "Content": "Jan 18, 2017 04:13PM - edited Jan 18, 2017 04:14PM by jinmo Hi all, just wanted to give a check-in and report on my BMX. I posted a really short message last night but I had to retype it several times just to get coherent English...I was a little out of it. So anyway, now I am home. I did not choose any reconstruction, so my new scars will be straight and flat, I hope. They look pretty good I guess, but I really haven't gotten the courage up to do any more than a quick glance. They measured my arms in the hospital for a baseline so we know if lymphedema is developing. So far my only puffiness seems to be from all the saline that came through my IV. At the hospital, I had four drains put in. Two were removed this morning, from near the center of my chest. The other two, which are on the outer sides, more toward the armpit/node area, are still in. My drains are cooperative so far, and DH and I have both learned to strip the fluids out. I have not felt any pain from the process other than a little stinging at the very top near the skin, where you first take hold of the drain with your fingers to start stripping. I have a post surgical camisole now with drain pockets, but that was provided just before discharge. Before that the drains were kind of dangling and i had to be careful about not pulling them. A suggestion from one of the CNAs there was to just go ahead and put on my own undies, and then the drains can be held by the waistband. That worked fine for short term, so you might want to bring a pair of (sturdy, not flimsy) panties in case you need to do this too. Or you could bring some nice big safety pins and pin them to your gown. Be sure to bring some undies in any case since they will probably make you get up and walk the halls to keep your blood circulating. I was glad I had my lip balm and lotion. Never even looked at the books and magazines I brought. Did a little playing around on my tablet & phone. And, oh horrors, I must admit that I did not brush & floss my teeth last night. I had the sentinel node biopsy, and five nodes were taken. I will have path report on that later in the week. The dye injection for the SNB was quite painful but not unbearable, and I have lots of blue marks, even on my back from that stuff circulating around.. Let's see, what else. The doctor said I could shower tomorrow, which amazed me. All right, that's all I've got. Hope it is helpful to someone! Did not see, cowboy-up, GT and zookeeper, it looks like we made it. Congratulations and a toast to everybody already at the bar and those still on their way.",

      "Content": "Jan 18, 2017 06:36PM jinmo wrote: annoyingboob, thanks for asking about my decision process. I spent about six weeks deciding but here's the basics: 1. DCIS can't be seen in surgery because it is microscopic. Therefore, the first lumpectomy is kind of a \"scoop and hope\". 2. I had small breasts, so if it had gone to a second lumpectomy, which happens about 20% of the time, it would have been a mastectomy for me anyway since I would not have much tissue left. Here's the link to the 20%: http://www.breastcancer.org/research-news/20120718 3. I did not want to have only one breast, so if I was going for one, I decided I was going for two. 4. I did not want to do the radiation treatments and five years of Tamox, which is what they had planned if I did lumpectomy only. 5. I buy my insurance through the ACA, so I am determined to get this over with in 2017. I think 2018 is not going to hold a lot of good insurance news for self-employed people like me. So, no reconstruction since that tends to be a long process. No unilateral because I might not be able to afford the second surgery in a later year. Getting my recurrence possibility down to the lowest possible number (even though it's not zero) means less possibility of future financial disaster. 6. I have no genetic markers but I do have a sister with cancer. It came to her at a young age and was aggressive and already in her nodes, not just DCIS. She's still here, 20+ years later, but she did the whole deal: lumpectomy, chemo, Tamox, and eventually hysterectomy. Maybe rads too, I don't remember. Cancer is scattered all over my family tree. If I can nail this thing to the wall now, I'm gonna go for it. I ended up thinking of this in my personal situation as my one chance to \"swing for the fences\". A more realistic phrase would be, \"bailing for the doorway, hollering in fear!\" but that doesn't sound as good as swinging for the fences, right?. Only with a diagnosis of DCIS did I get the choice of doing one big surgical thing and possibly walk away without any further treatments such as rads, tamox, chemo, etc. Or the way my husband and I ended up putting it: I just literally bet my boobs that there was nothing else in there but DCIS. If pathology shows something else, I won't be any worse off, and if it turns out to be only DCIS throughout, I may be able to just walk away. That's what made sense for me, in my own situation only. Hope some of this may help someone as they think it through. jinmo  ",

And my sternum is driving me nuts, absolutely can't stand to have even a bit of fabric touch it. I look pretty funny walking around the house with one hand pulling my cami away from my sternum. I did find a webmd article on nerve pain treatment, here: http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/prescription-medications-treatments-nerve-pain#1, maybe a different med would help? The only other thing I have is a suggestion I read somewhere on this board to hold your opposite hands on your chest, armpit, wherever things don't seem right, just pressing around lightly. Apparently it has something to do with rewiring your brain to understand where your new body parts are and aren't and how your brain should translate your nerve sensations.

You are strong enough to do it, I know. Lisabekind, my left (node) underarm was definitely more tender than the right, and if I pressed it it felt like a big bad bruise, but it didn't hurt that much if I left it alone, if you know what I mean. So if yours is that painful all the time, one week out, I might consider calling the doc. I had 5 nodes out, don't remember how many you got. Pyrrh, I certainly have to confess that I would not want somebody to smack me on or under my node arm really hard right now or maybe ever. It's not so much that it \"does hurt\" as that it's telling me it \"could hurt\". Fightingirl, sun salutations, yes, may we all do them very soon! The blood pressure/needle stick rule, forever on the node side, is what I was told too. I will be using my node arm and if bad things happen to it, oh well. Because not using it because I am afraid of what might happen, seems worse to me. But my use is more lifting, pulling, reaching, not so much contact stuff like pyrrh is maybe describing. I have swelling on that side under the arm and I think some of it is lymph fluid, feels squishy, but I am working the manual lymph flow sheet they gave me to try to move it on out, and I think the other exercises help a lot too with general fluid flow. I know I've missed new people but saw joyfaith and Pamela, welcome! Anyway, took so long to finish and post this, there's probably 20 more posts by now! Wishing a good day for you all. ",

And we have new people, sorry but glad to see you here. LamaMama, you look awesome in your avatar. PickleJar, I have BMX no recon too, glad you are healing well and hurray for drains coming out soon! On the arm thing that you guys were discussing, they told me to start stretching mine up right away (the walk your fingers up the wall exercise) however far I could, but I was forbidden to do any weight bearing above 90 degrees even with the tiny 1 lb weights until after the first week. I have no recon though so may be different for each of us. Right now my non node arm can walk up the wall to about 160 degrees, maybe more depending on the angle I'm standing to the wall, and the node biopsy arm a bit less. Definitely not holding them straight up overhead yet. Things going well here, I finally really truly looked at myself in the mirror today, and it's not so bad. I can handle it. At least, I can handle it once we get all the nasty tape goobers off me. I did not know until just a couple of days ago that the Dermabond the surgeon used is kind of purple. My husband mentioned it by chance when we were talking about the incisions. He didn't realize that I didn't know, and I never thought to ask. In all my cringing, scared little glances that I was doing before then, I thought that purple stuff across my chest was bruising or scarring or stitching or I don't know what. So knowing that color was not part of the incisions is part of what gave me the courage to stand up in front of the mirror and look. The other thing I asked him for was to look at my underarms while I was doing the wall walking (gotta love that, right, a man who will come and stare at your armpits upon request), because I was afraid that I might be doing something bad to the end of my incisions. But he said that no, the incision was not pulling or opening at all. So anyway, TMI, maybe, but my point is that if you have a willing loved one or friend, have them look, really look at what you're doing if you're scaring yourself while stretching. You may be able to get some reassurance that you're not breaking stuff that shouldn't be broken, to give you strength to try for just a little further up the wall. Take care of yourselves and only cancer-butt-kicking fairies for your sleep tonight. ",

Here is what they told me about stripping them: basically grasp right at the top of the drain tube, fairly near your skin and pinch firmly to hold. Keep holding on there so as not to put any pull against where the drain comes out of your skin. Then use two fingers of the other hand to compress and strip the drain fluid downward into the drain bulb. I bet you must know this but I'm a little worried cuz it's Friday night and you're having a problem. So ignore me if you don't need this advice. My doctor made me strip mine out a minimum of three times a day. One of my tubes would always refill immediately and have to be re-stripped once, the other would clear the first time. Hope this helps.

Let me know, I was hunting around tonight and it was all rather medical-looking. Also, one other question, does anybody have sore, like bruised painful sore, shoulder blades, of all things? It just seems weird. Pressing on my shoulder blades hurts, pressing on my chest hardly hurts at all. Take care all!",
