So that they are not going to sleep and be on their own.  We told them it was breast cancer.  They knew about Terry Fox who had died of cancer and they wanted to know if I was going to die.  We told them we hoped not - explained some of the treatment and how it would kill the cancer cells. Explained that you couldn't catch cancer etc.  Weeks later my 7 year old wanted me to promise I was going to be alright forever.  We made the decision not to lie to them or make promises we couldn't keep.  So we have worked through issues as they arose.  Kids are amazingly tough and they understand.  Go at their pace though - we had a few conversations before we got through everything.  I decided to shave my head just before the 2nd chemo - a friend came over to do it.  The plan was the boys could watch etc but Star Wars the movie was on - they came to check out what was happening, had a laugh - as we all did and went off to eat popcorn.  Good luck.",
