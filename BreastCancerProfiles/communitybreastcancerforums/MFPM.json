      "Content": "Oct 4, 2017 02:20AM - edited Oct 4, 2017 02:25AM by MFPM Hi Ladies, I'm not new to this site but am to this group.  I had a mastectomy (can't believe I'm saying it) September 26th.  Was wondering if it's normal considering it's almost 8 days now and I still feel very weak.  I mean I get up each day but I don't do much.  I am not taking any pain meds, just coping with the drain, doing arm exercises and am  an emotional mess.  I will see my surgeon next Monday who will refer me to an onc.  I was already through a lumpectomy, diagnosed in 2015, 9 months of preventative chemo and 3 months of radiation that I finished in April of this year.  Weeks later upon my 1st check up, a Dr. came running in the room during the sono, saying he saw something suspicious.  I told him that according to a radiologist, it was just a cyst that was seen/recorded prior to the lumpectomy.  Unfortunately it wasn't which lead me to this surgery.  I feel floored, a horror on top of a nightmare that I was ready to get out of, take a vacation etc..  So due to that mistake, it's been 2 years of this, which I thought was gone, but no, left there until last week. Any advice for physical and emotional healing right now?  I was taking Exemestane which I know is needed, pathology 95% estrogen but they told me not to take it until I resume with their Dr..  I changed my diet and my cosmetics to mostly natural.  I also fear more treatment may be coming, though I will not know until I see him, plus the Onco test.  I'm grateful to be alive but getting tired of this running my life.  I did not do reconstruction (maybe in the future), just wanting to be clear and cured!  As far as I know from the biopsy pathology, this one that was left in me was ER+ & PR+ and an 8/9 on the Nottingham scale, much higher than the 1st which I know is not good.  I can't believe this happened and I haven't even had the nerve to look at myself yet. :'( ",

Mama Felice, You certainly have been through the mill too.  I wonder where we get our strength at times!  What happened with me, sorry for repeating myself for those who read it before, was I got an order to have 2 suspicious spots to be biopsied, going to a small local hospital as the medical center didn't do it there anymore.  Dr. seemed nice enough but biopsied 1 and as the technician even asked him, \"Aren't you going to check the 2nd one?\", the Dr. said, \"Eh, it's just a cyst\", dismissing me.  HAD he done what he was supposed to in 2015, that would've been taken out during surgery but instead I had a lumpectomy for the 1, 9 months chemo, radiation, and then this past spring when I figured all done, time to relax, I went for the re-check mammo/sono.  A Dr. came running in the room and asked what was at the 10 o'clock position and I remembered like it was yesterday, telling him the Dr. said it was just a cyst, not biopsying it.  He said very seriously, it didn't look good to him.  Weeks later I was diagnosed again, not that I ever got rid of it.  I haven't had time to relax, even my mind to be free of this.  It could've all been done had he followed the orders which is beyond upsetting but I'm just doing what they say and now know I have to be my own advocate, wishing I would've spoken up that day.  I've done enough beating myself up about that.  I could think I did all of that treatment for nothing but then I think, maybe it's God's plan that I did to keep the other at bay!  I like your words that surgery is the most important line of defense!  I'll keep that in mind since like everyone else, I don't feel free of this but maybe I should.     I didn't hear from the Onc yet, whether he got the score back yet but will give it another week or so off time for myself, then call if I don't hear from him.  My Drs. are all nice but I hate to say I feel like just another number to them.  These big hospitals and centers are great for professional care but it's not very personal.   Many thoughts and Prayers for Everyone!  I'll check in again soon and let's all take care to get rid of this.  I just want to be normal again, whatever that is.  Much love!",
