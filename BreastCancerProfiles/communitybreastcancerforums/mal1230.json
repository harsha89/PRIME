      "Content": "mal1230 wrote: I'm 31, underweight (my whole family is tiny), and have no family history of breast cancer, yet I find myself terrified about inflammatory breast cancer. My right breast is swollen and I have swollen lymph nodes under my arm (that have been there since before the breast swelling - I have been sick for about a month now) and I can't find anything that would cause that besides this. I have stretch marks from the swelling. My right breast has always been bigger than the left one, but because of this and what it's done to my mind, I don't even know how much of a difference it has made. It seems like a huge difference, but I don't even know. I had an ultrasound which was normal, but from what I understand, an ultrasound wouldn't pick this up. Here are my concerns / questions: 1. I have an appointment with a GYN tomorrow to get more information. I do not have insurance until 2/1 and if she wants to send me for a biopsy, I don't know what to do. From what I read, this cancer doesn't wait. Any suggestions? 2. What else can cause unilateral breast swelling? It's not painful, hot, itchy, etc. and I don't have children. Thank you so much - and to everyone that is battling this cancer and any type of cancer, keep fighting!! You're in my thoughts and prayers. Log in to post a reply",

I asked my boyfriend and he said it looks swollen, but he can't tell a huge difference (I'm not sure if he's just saying that to make me feel better). What's freaking me out is when I take a picture just to see, it looks like there is a HUGE difference, but when I look in the mirror, it doesn't. I don't know.... Thank you so much for your reply - I really appreciate it. I'm on antibiotics for a sinus infection myself. I wish you the best.",
