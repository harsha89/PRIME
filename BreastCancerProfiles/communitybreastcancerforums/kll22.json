Nothing scary to report from my experience with TC.  Like you, I was terrified before my first because I didn't know what to expect and how I would react. Once the first one is done, you will know what to expect.  Track your SEs day by day and you'll know how to prep next time.  Follow your MOs instructions on fluid intake, and if things get too bad call and ask for advice.  Days 3 - 5 were the worst for me but certainly managable.  My son commented the other day that chemo hasn't been as bad as he expected and I agreed.  Above all, give yourself permission to rest.  It is exhausting and that increases over time.  You can do this! VLNRPH - yes, I do wear glasses. I've been slathering on moisturizer with sunscreen like normal and using California Baby aloe vera lotion for sensitive skin, which helps. REVMAMA- I'd add make sure you're eating a good amount of protein and getting your fluids.  Most importantly, go with the flow; if you need rest then rest.",

My chemo was on Fridays and the following Mon - Tues. were the worst for me.  By the following Friday, things had pretty much returned to normal.  As you move forward, be aware of the cumulative effects of chemo.  It can really be exhausting by the end.  Best of luck to you.",

I still feel fake wearing it but I get tired of  looking around the bills of caps all the time.  So many different solutions to this one problem!",

I hit a point where the hats were bothering me - I hated the limited vision I had with the brims - and I didn't feel like me with the wig.  I had between 1/4 and 1/2 inch and good coverage when I called it quits.  I love it and everyone says how great I look with the super short hair.  I have to admit that if anyone asks why I \"cut\" my hair so short, I'm tempted to whisper \"head lice\" and see what the reaction is!",
