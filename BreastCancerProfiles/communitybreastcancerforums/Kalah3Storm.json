I was actually at work when my mom told me she had breast cancer again and i didn't think i was going to be able to finish my shift. My mom is my world and i don't know what i would do without her. Everytime i ask she says she's okay, but i think she tells me that to make me feel better.  I've been reading a lot of these entries about moms being upset because of their children. I have a brother that's 10 years old and i don't want her to think that she has to be upset about the two of us. I just wanna let her know that i love her and that she has nothing to worry about, but i can't seem to talk to her cause i know i'll end up crying. I guess this is just my teenage rant so i can get all of my feelings out without crying. My friends don't understand how hard it is to go through this. To wake up to your bald mom slowly walking because of aches and pains and hold her while she cries and you have to sit there and think about how you can't do anything to make it go away. I wish there was something i could do. My mom was helping me clean my room earlier and she could barely mom because most of her pivot joints we hurting.... her wrist and ankles mainly. I don't know how to make her feel better when all i can do is cry. I try to go to her chemos with her but they are always on fridays in the morning so i'm in school. I feel like there's nothing else i can do. Log in to post a reply",
