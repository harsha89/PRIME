The changes (with more to come) that this has brought about are almost overwhelming. Is there anyone out there that can offer some words of encouragement, advise, and tell me if it will be possible to work full time at a desk job? I have very little sick time leave due to just starting the job a year ago.",

The important thing is to get the lump checked out as soon as possible. I  had a mammo, ultrasound, MRI, then biopsy. Good Luck to you and let us know how your doing.",
