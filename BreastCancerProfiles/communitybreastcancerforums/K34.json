They said the reason they only scan the area of concern is that ultrasounds are not used as a diagnostic tool for areas where there is no concern as they can give a false positive. I don't know how old you are, but here in the UK (think the US is the same- I'm a US import but came here as a teenager) they don't really have a diagnostic tool for under 35s he was saying as mammos often can't pick up things in breast tissue of the under 35s as it is too dense, so it relies a lot on the woman to be breast aware, and then an exam and an ultrasound can verify an area of concern.  I am sorry for you that they were unable to give you results- I fortunately had the radiologist there telling me it was nothing to worry about.  I hope you had the results you wanted.  ",
