I guess the whole breast cancer thing isn't really \"new\" to me. My older sister was diagnosed with it last October. She had stage 2 invasive ductal carcinoma. Five days after they told her about it, they removed her breast. It all happened so fast. I never really knew what anxiety truly felt like until she told me about her cancer, and from that point on, I was a nervous wreck! She only had to have chemo, no radiation. She finished her treatments maybe 5 or 6 months ago and is doing well. Her hair is growing back and everything.  Well, I had my annual check up yesterday. My midwife found a lump in my breast. I asked her if it was big, and she said, \"well...yeah, it is.\"  I had no idea it was even there! She felt it for a good few minutes, and the look on her face struck me as hard as hearing I had a lump. Of course, it couldn't end there. She also found a mass on one of my ovaries. I don't know if they could be related or not or anything. Anyway, I have to go in Monday for an ultrasound of my breast and my ovary, then I will go back the following week for the results. I know worrying won't help. but I guess I can't help it. My sister's tumor appeared so quickly. I guess like mine has. I stopped by her house today and she told me she wanted to feel my lump. (she is a nurse as well as my sister) She said yes, it was big. She said it felt just like hers did, only mine is on the opposite side as hers was. (why is it that I can't seem to feel this lump as easily as they can? I have tried to feel it, and I simply can't!  I mean, I think I might feel it, but they felt it so easily! I would think I could, too!) I'm a wreck. That anxiety I felt when my sister told me she had her cancer? Well, I guess I know what to call how I'm feeling right now.  Thank you for listening.
