Now mind you I'm 40 and my kids are older. My youngest will be 18 the end of this month. The ER doc poked on my breast and told me it was mastitis. And, he sent me home with a script for keflex and naproxen. With orders to contact the women's center for a mammogram and ultrasound. So Friday afternoon I filled my prescriptions and began taking the medicines. Yesterday I called and made an appointment for today. The medicine that the ER doc prescribed me wasn't working. I was so miserable I don't think I slept more than a few hours over the weekend and last night. Today I go to my appointment and learn that the lump is an large deep tissue mass, and my lymph nodes under my arm and near my clavicle are a bit swollen. I don't recall the exact size of the mass. But, the doctor said the reason I'm feeling it under my skin is because it's grown in size. I also learned I have 2 lumps in my L breast as well. One close to my underarm and 1 on the underside of my breast. Neither of them hurt. I also learned I do not have mastitis. Nor is it a cyst. I have an appointment next Monday for another mammogram and ultrasound on both breasts and a double biopsy. On the plus side, I was prescribed pain medicine, which has made my pain more bearable than the naproxen did, so yay for that. But, I'm scared and more confused now than before my appointment. Can someone please help? I don't know how to even process this let alone tell my kids. I thank you very much. Log in to post a reply",
