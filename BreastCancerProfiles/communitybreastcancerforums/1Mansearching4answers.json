Approx. 14-16 months ago I began noticing a soreness on my right breast area. At first I assumed it was a bruise, and that it would go away. It did not. As time passed I began to feel unusual growths around my nipple. They grew pretty quickly and seemed symmetrical around my nipple. I finally went to my PCP and he acknowledged the growths as abnormal. He ordered a right breast mama gram as well as ultra sound. The radiologist report diagnosed the condition as \"benign\", stating that the condition was \"Gynecomastea\". My doctor later told me not to worry about it. I had told him that that the condition seemed to coincide with a head injury (TBI) & that while researching the condition I found on many reputable medical sites that head trauma can damage the pituitary gland inside the brain and that hormone imbalances may occur. He looked it up on his IPAD and agreed that my condition may be caused by hormone production problem so he referred me to an Endocrinologist. She did blood work that revealed very low testosterone levels that can cause Gynecomastia. I knew something was wrong as I had lost all interest in sex & low T many times is the cause. My doctor was initially going to try Testostetone injections but changed her mind and prescribed Tamoxifen. The drug has reduced the size of my growths but I have had side effects, insomnia, frequent nighttime urination, increasing decline in interest in sex plus weight gain & big increase in appetite and food cravings. My question has anyone had these side effects and how can I I convince my doctor to Try testosterone as she knows it's what I wanted to try initially. My T levels are barely within the normal range but age adjusted my levels are of a man 30 years older than myself . I have many other symptoms consistent with low Tand they are severely decreasing my quality of life. How can I convince my doctor to take me off of Tamoxifen and try Testosterone? She is very arrogant and seems to dislike an informed patient. I sure would appreciate comments or advice. Thank you so much Log in to post a reply",
