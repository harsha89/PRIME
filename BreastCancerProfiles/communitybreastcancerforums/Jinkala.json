Back when I first found out I was going to have to do chemo, I did a lot of Google searches on terms like \"chemo scarf\", \"skullcap\", \"chemo hat\" and just checked out all the various sites and what they had to offer.",

It's still super short and growing slowly.  It's very soft and fine and so far, just as straight as ever.  My last chemo was in November and I'm still probably around a half an inch.  I'm still on Herceptin so I'm hoping it speeds up once I'm done with that.  I'm not taking anything extra to promote growth though.",

The fear is totally understandable.  Once you do know what the lumps are, you will feel a lot better because once you know what the problem is, then you can focus on dealing with the problem.    Good luck to you!",

I chose to do the single mastectomy with no recon.  While I wanted to have a fast recovery, I also wanted to avoid rads if possible.   I considered a double to keep my appearance 'balanced' but was worried that I would have more trouble during recovery trying to be careful and baby both arms.  I also decided that I would like keeping my good breast as long as possible. Having recon would definitely have meant a longer recovery plus a lot more surgery including surgery on my good breast to lift it to match the reconstructed one.  They just don't make new breasts to match saggy old ones apparantly.    I looked at pictures of reconstructed ones and felt that it just wasn't worth the trouble involved and that I could get the same look under clothing with a good prosthesis. My prosthesis is on order right now but in the meantime, dealing with a single breast hasn't been too awful.  I swear that some of my back problems have gone away and I haven't noticed any issues with balance (as I had been warned about).  I've been wearing a puffy form in a camisole since surgery but I only wear that outside.  At home I don't mind being single breasted in a t-shirt and my boyfriend doesn't mind it either.  I'm happy with my choice so far because it works for me.   ",
