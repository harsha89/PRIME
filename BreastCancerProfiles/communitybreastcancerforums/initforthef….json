I was originally diagnosed with Stage III BC 12 years ago. During my routine scan in May 2014 they discovered several small metastasis to my liver. I was immediately put on anti-hormone therapies and my cancer progressed. I had a good few months with Xeloda, but my scans on Monday showed aggressive progression in my liver and lungs and now I have fluid around my lungs. My onc wants to start me on Docetaxel ASAP. Throughout this whole process I have had very few symptoms. My onc makes it seem IV chemo is the last resort. I am getting a second opinion from another hospital as I am hoping to get in a clinical trial. I am scared about my quality of life as my onc said I would need to be on this forever. I am just still so shocked as I feel completely normal! Has anyone been told to go straight to IV chemo after the first oral chemo stops working?",
