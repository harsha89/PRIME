I have been doing this for a long time for my carpal tunnel syndrome, and fitted this way, they work very well. I am having better pain relief from this than the pills. I had 2 lumpectomies, so I am shaping the packs rather than leaving them flat. I take a washcloth and cut it into 3 strips. Fold each 3 times to make  a square. Soak it with water, put it in a baggie and freeze it, shaped over something rounded in the freezer, which in my case, is a baggie full of rice. It could be anything you have that is rounded.  I have 5 or 6 of these in constant rotation in the freezer. Anytime I need a new one, I pop the old one back in. So they are no too shockingly cold against my skin, I fold each inside half of a paper towel. Right after surgery I needed them to be larger and used more frequently, so I have a few for night that are a whole thick washcloth, folded in quarters. I kept a cooler next to the bed filled with a bag of ice and the frozen washcloths inside the cooler and changed them maybe 2-3 times. The smaller ones make a fitted icepack small enough to fit in my sports bra and not look too bulky. My surgery was on the inside quadrant, so I am using the curved part inverted next to the sternum. But they can easily be shaped for wherever your incision is located. I have gotten deft enough at slipping one up under my shirt, under the sports bra which I am wearing for support, and into place, even in a crowd of people. I was just able to take a 4 day trip away from home, 1 1/2 weeks after surgery, carrying a totebag with a soft-sided insulated cooler inside all weekend, plus larger cooler in the car for additional replenishments (plus booking a hotel with a refrigerator). On the pain pills I would have been too woozy to even go. Since it was taking my daughter off to college I felt I HAD to be there, and the ice packs plus ibuprofen made it possible. Not pain free, but possible. Hope this helps. Linn DCIS, 1.6 cm, Grade 3, ER+/PR ? (PR test was inconclusive).

The edema does not hurt or bother me at all. It's just puffy: basically on the whole outside half of my breast, over the pectoral muscle where it goes to the arm, and under my arm. I see it when I'm changing, mostly. I am glad I got a bra for this that does not fit tightly under the arms. I have gained 1.6 lbs since last week and I think that is this fluid. From what I have read here, the radiated tissue produces this fluid: it is an expected side effect. I just thought it is useful to mention, that it has to be attributable to the rads, since I did not have any lymph nodes removed and still have swelling.",

It's funny, what I'm feeling does not feel like \"regular\" fatigue. It's more like a feeling of inertia. I can't get myself to DO anything other than in front of the computer. Luckily for me this is my off-season. I will confess I tweaked my preliminary appointments  to be able to start rads after. If the cancer comes back I will be really angry with myself for starting too long after my surgery, which was late August (2nd lumpectomy). But no one said anything. I think I'm fighting a cold, too, and now that I can't take my usual Vit C at the first sign, it will probably catch me. The actual treatment feels like nothing. The machine clicks a few times, opening windows to the right size. Then I hear the buzzing which the actual radiation. I am getting 2x each day, from the front and side, and from a little behind and below my armpit angling up. I am not having nodes done. So far the length of all seems exactly the same. I had a few tiny twinges of pain (no where near the surgery site, exactly on the apposite side actually) the first few times. Now it feels maybe a little tender inside after each treatment,  which goes away after a few hours. A touch of redness which also goes away. No burning. Some swelling under the arm and along the outside of the pectoral muscle. The doctor said it is edema produced as a side effect of the rads. She seemed to be glad to see it. I am applying aloe 2 x a day.",

But since I had a lumpectomy, not a mastectomy, I found I needed support, so bought a soft sports-type bra (someone on here recommended Soma brand, Kahari model, called a sleep bra), that has a wide bottom band and a 3 hook back closure. The closure makes it easier to take on and off daily for treatments without having to wrestle a no-closure sports bra over my head. I have a lot of underarm swelling so am trying not to irritate that area. I don't like how I look squashed flat, but I'm living with it. If I try on something form-fitting I end up taking it right off again and opting for something that camouflages more. Where do you find the calendula cream? Several have recommended it, but I have not found it in a regular drug or grocery store, Whole Foods or Trader Joes. I think I'm ready for something stronger than aloe.",

I believe it \"potentiates\" the drug, meaning it makes the effects more intense: which is not predictable and could be dangerous.  There are a number of drugs that help to potentiate others: this is why, for example, acetaminophen is added to codeine. The amount of codeine can be reduced (thus fewer side effects) because the acetaminophen makes the codeine work better. Alcohol potentiates a lot of different drugs. For example, people die from combining alcohol with barbiturates because the alcohol makes the dose of the barbiturate effectively stronger. My dad was on xanax, I remember the doctor telling us no wine, or only a small glass for a special occasion. (daily rads would not count, I think!) There was a thread sometime back, saying 1 glass of red wine helped prevent burning. A search would probably turn up the thread. I tried it, but could not do it consistently. It makes me so sleepy that my day would end with dinner if I did. And wine at bedtime is not good either, as it causes waking later in the night. I have enough trouble sleeping through the night without that. I am toasty now after 25 treatments  but the aloe 2x  day (should have been 3, but it's too hard to get undressed during the day) helped a lot. My skin looks burned but is not that sore except for the nipple, which got dark, cracked and dry. The rad doctor prescribed Radiaplex cream last week, which is even better than aloe. Very soothing. The hospital pharmacy carries it. I tried the greasy ointments (like Aquaphor) recommended here but they were much too hard to get off before treatments. They feel great on, but if you have to scrub to remove them, that is harder on the skin. It makes the skin hurt and feel like it is burning after a treatment if I fail to get it all off, which must be very bad. So I'm sticking to the Radiaplex or aloe now. I am more sore on the inside than the outside, but Aleve or ibuprofen help very well with that.",

I was told at several that they don't carry them anymore due to liability issues. After I got mine, someone posted to my thread that they used a scrunchie! With the belt unfastened, slip the scrunchie on over the buckle insert part. Wrap it around several times. Fasten the seat belt, then slide the scrunchie up into position until it is comfortable. The advantage to the scrunchie is it can stay in place on the seat belt all the time and can't get lost. I find with my clip I have to take it off, or it falls off when I let the belt retract, sometimes flipping under the seat or behind.  If I didn't already have the clip I would go get a scrunchie.",

Skin still felt warm to the touch. I was more sore the first week than the second. Since about day 10 I have significant swelling. I have gained about 2 lbs of fluid. I saw my rad doctor yesterday and she said it was the swelling causing pressure causing the pain. I'm not sure if that's the whole story, but it must be part of it; because I have pain even in areas that are not being irradiated due to the fluid buildup, like under the arm and around to the back. Pain is probably too strong a word, should be \"ache\". Still feels warm. I have occasional twinges when exercising, mostly when gravity changes the breast position. At about day 13 I suddenly had this tan/pink colored \"Square\" on me. It is now getting a bit darker daily. Now I am having pain again, still very much like a period. I should probably cut down on coffee, which is famous for aggravating the lymph nodes and impacting drainage. I used to deal with that during my period by taking vit E. Since I can't take that now, ache it does.  Aleve and ibuprofen help that, about 50%. I don't want to be on them around the clock, so I take either one after the treatment (midday) when I am most sore. By morning it is a lot better. I am using the same brand of aloe gel. I find it soothes, but does nothing for the color. Skin still feels hot. Some say here to refrigerate the bottle, so it's cold when you put it on. It's cold here, so I find it shocking enough to apply it at room temperature. How many treatments have you had? Hope this helps.",

I had thought of this when I first learned I would need radiation, but assumed \"they\" had solved the problem of scattering by now. But then I thought of my dentist and how they always use a lead blanket over your torso when doing X-rays to the head.   The article mentioned a doctor who is forming a small shield out of lead to place over the other breast, since breast tissue is known to be especially sensitive to radiation. He said in the video that the dose received by the non-treated breast is (if I remember correctly) equal to 40 mammograms EACH DAY of treatment. I found that shocking, if true.  Though he said he was more concerned about this effect for younger women, 20 and 30 years olds. I assume that is because the mutagenic changes made by the radiation take a certain number of years to show up. Maybe we 50 year olds are supposed to die of other causes by then.

(No one makes a 40 B, much less a 40 A) I am still wearing my post surgical \"Squeeze \u2018em flat\" sports  bra because a regular one looks really bad. But when I stop wearing sweaters I will have to find an answer. I have been reading a couple of threads on this subject. I have read here that you can get forms or fillers but I would imagine they are all some kind of foam or silicone. My problem is...as soon as winter is over, I can't stand to wear anything but cotton next to my skin. I work outside, in all weathers, and get really hot. Yet I still need to look presentable, nice clothes, jewelry, etc. Nylon or synthetic fabric bras are out, so I already know I would not be able to stand a sweat-trapping foam insert. I can just see myself tearing it out and tossing it at work. I can't go braless-I get too achy. It's hard enough just finding cotton bras.  Even the ones that are cotton on the outside are often lined with nylon. None of the pretty ones are cotton. :( I'm good at sewing...I could take in the now A side but seams are always hard to hide in a bra. It's an odd place to put darts in too; I think it would pull the nipple part over, which would not conform to my shape.   Actually, you can see my scar in any bra except a sports bra. It's right where the plunge part of the bra is. So I'm not sure how I could either take some fabric in, or pad this out either. I can't figure out why a divot way on the side makes me, overall, a size smaller in the first place. I thought of buying 2, one in a B and one in an A, cutting them apart in the middle, and stitching the left B together with the right side A. That could get expensive fast, but if it worked.... Does anyone else have this problem, and how did you solve it? Linn DCIS, 1.6 cm, Grade 3, ER+/PR ? (PR test was inconclusive).

Wendy, my doctors said to take only an ordinary multivitamin. No extras, no large doses. The level of antioxidants present in large doses counter the effects of the rads in killing cancer cells (short version).",

I could not find a position that did not hurt either the sore breast or the sternum. I moved to a separate bed when I started rads because I found I had to sleep in the fetal position with the breast cradled and there was not enough room.  I did not get up to take anything because I would have to ferret around in the medicine cabinet in the bathroom and wake up my husband. He sleeps badly as it is. This morning I found a full bottle of Aleve. Thanks for telling me about it. I think I will have to make room for that on the bedside table along with the aloe and other such stuff. I tried some Udder balm type lanolin cream last night too. It felt pretty good but is greasy.

It might not be the same brand you are looking at. She is at college and I have been urging her not to get hooked on soda like the other kids. So she started choosing this instead, think she was doing something good for her body. But the amount of corn syrup in it was higher than soda! It the one you like does turn out to have a lot of sugar, perhaps a health food store would have a better version? I would like to start drinking green tea myself but like you, I don't like the taste. I was thinking about adding a few drops of bottled pomegranate juice to it. I have cherry concentrate too. Trader Joes has lots of good juices, maybe I will try several kinds. Maybe that would work for you too. I like green tea enough when I have it at a chinese restaurant. I might have to experiment with brands. I wish there were tea tastings so I wouldn't have to buy boxes of stuff I didn't like. Come to think of it, there is a chain of tea stores in the mall that let you taste first. And a tea store in Chinatown: not close to me but I could justify the trip someway.

Just Aloe cream with about 20 other ingredients...and aloe well down the list. Maybe only larger stores carry it? Mine is kind of small. If I can't find it at Walmart tomorrow I'm giving up and buying an Aloe plant. Now THAT would be natural. I asked the pharmacist for ideas today when I couldn't find the Aloe there. I said the techs had only mentioned Aquaphor. He said Aquaphor is almost half Vaseline (or \"petrolatum\"), and Eucerin is just Aquaphor plus water! He said they used to make up \"Homemade\" Eucerin in the VA hospital from Aquaphor and water when he worked in the VA hospital to save money. Now, in my mind, Vaseline is NOT a moisturizer. All it can do is seal in any moisture that is there in the skin.  I use it on chapped knuckles in the winter but after using a moisturizer. Maybe I can try that with radiation too, if it gets really burned or raw: apply the Aquaphor after a moisturizer...once I FIND the moisturizer, that is. I am not clear on why they do the X rays.  They must be a low dosage X ray if they show soft tissue and not just bones.",

My DCIS was found during a diagnostic mammogram. If you had a negative mammogram (was it screening or diagnostic?), how was yours discovered? How did they know to do a biopsy? I had been having screening mammograms every 2 years. I had a painful and rapidly growing lump in my right breast in May. My gyne doctor ordered a diagnostic mammo, but it was too painful to do. They did an ultrasound instead, and found it was a fluid filled cyst. That was aspirated on the spot and they told me to come back as soon as the soreness went away for the diagnostic.  The diagnostic found calcifications in a completely different area. My doctors (several, independently) said that getting the cyst was a lucky break. A normal screening mammo would have been fewer films and not magnified. They actually called me back 3 times for more views. There was no connection between the cyst that caused so much attention and the cancer they found. My surgeon calls it my \"lucky cyst\". The cancer they found was long and thin and did not make any kind of lump. But it completely filled a duct from the chest wall all the way up to the skin. This experience has me wondering how many of the early stage cancers are discovered, if they don't show up on a mammo? If there is no lump, and no calcifications, how do they find it? Around here MRIs are frowned up for BC. Every doctor I talked to said there are too many false positives. I asked for one, but no one would approve it. I have to have all my work done within a network, and it is network policy not to do them for BC. I don't think it is the money; they approved genetic testing and that was expensive. Luckily it is a big network, but the policies run across the board. They keep using the same mantra, \"It's not the standard of care here\". MTG, I think doing makeup as an alien is a great idea! Lots of sparkles, stick on jewels, maybe iridescent makeup. I would like to do something, though I have no occasion to really dress up: just the trick or treaters coming to the door. I have  a spider headband with flashing eyes I plan to wear. Beyond that I will just dress all in black with an orange jack o-lantern scarf. Not very impressive. I love Halloween. My BIL is visiting from out of the country. We have been trying to explain all the decorations and what Halloween means, how the customs arose.

Because of the swelling I think some skin was trapped with no air circulation (not that it could get much anyway under my clothes: but my house is too cold to go for more than a few minutes shirtless.). The skin cracked at the side of the nipple and quickly became infected. I think being moist with cream actually made it happen. Of course I noticed this at 10 pm, before the Thanksgiving holiday.  The pain kept me up all night so I did not make the best Thanksgiving meal in my history. I managed to find a tube of Bacitracin around and put that on, which I think helped. I could not stand to have my shirt or bra touching the nipple (because it presses it down), so actually cut off a 2\" slice of toilet paper tube, cut slits into one end to open it like a fan, and taped it over my nipple. It projects out about an inch so nothing can touch the nipple. I have been wearing (and sleeping in) this thing for 2 days now, and taking my leftover codeine to be able to sleep.  When I went in for my boost today I was counting on seeing the doctor, but there was just a skeleton staff on duty. There was not even a nurse available. They did call a doctor for me, who said to just buy Neosporin, but to call him if I spiked a fever.

They both look too conservative for jewelry. If anyone has a brainstorm, let me know. My skin did quite well until AFTER I was done with the regular treatments. When I got a nipple infection on boost day #1 it was bad for a while after that. That was followed by some shallow skin sores. I also did better washing everything off, then letting everything dry out.  Once everything scabbed over (which it only really did this morning) I felt much better.

I know I will, but once I have something scheduled, it's back to reality. My husband wants to take me out to dinner to celebrate, but I have had a touch of nausea for the last week and don't want to go until that goes away. It's not bad, but not something I want to challenge. The techs loved the earrings I made. I made 6 dangles and 2 posts, all pearls, and let them decide which kind they wanted. They were not all there so I gave one the rest to distribute to the absent ones. I gave a small bag of Ghirardelli chocolate to the 2 men.",

The waiting room is shared with the MRI dept., maybe that's why. I was thinking about bringing cupcakes too, for my last day next week. The beaded bookmarks are a nice idea: how are they flat to go in the book, though? I'm trying to visualize this. I was thinking about making earrings for my group, though I don't know what to do for the young man I see everyday. He looks too conservative to wear a leather cord necklace, like Alaina made. For that matter, I don't know what any of them would wear in their off hours: what they wear at work is pretty unobtrusive. I'm also not exactly sure how many to make, as the number of techs I see fluctuates. I'm told they borrow staff from a sister hospital. Happy Thanksgiving to all!",

It causes added sensitivity to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight. I don't intentionally sunbathe but work outdoors so sunlight is pretty hard to avoid. It causes uneven or blotchy pigmentation in sun-exposed skin. I asked the Radiation doctor if radiation, in conjunction with this drug,  might be similar in effect to sunlight, and cause hyperpigmentation. If, therefore, I need to discontinue taking this drug, and find a subsitute. She asked the hospital pharmacist but he could not find any literature on it. I guess the subset of people getting radiation and also taking Relafen must be pretty small. So I'm wondering if, by chance, any one you out there are taking this as well. Thanks!

I have joint pain if I skip; as long as I keep it up they don't hurt at all. I also have sciatic pain; have since my last pregnancy 18 years ago. Not intense most of the time, but it never really goes away. Must be something about the yoga stretching, decreasing pressure on the nerves. The pain really ramps up if I skip a few classes or spend too much time sitting (like driving more than an hour). I think I recovered very well from my surgery, partly because I was getting my chest muscles stretched all the time. I take it with an authentic traditional teacher, not at a gym, where they tend to treat yoga like a fitness class and push too hard. I was able to continue during recovery from a broken foot, and did not miss any classes after surgery. I say that to tell you that it can ge gentle, and still be effective and thorough.",

It WAS a long weekend! Since the rest of the skin seemed to be OK, just the nipple affected, I taped that toilet paper tube/cone down, before I went on a major excursion to the city Saturday, involving lots of walking, with my husband and kids. In retrospect that was a bad idea. I should have just kept it in place with a stretchy bra. I am sure the cardboard cylinder/cone would have been fine if I had not taped it down on the last day. I wore it Wed through Friday with no ill effects. It began to really hurt by the end of the day but I was not in a position to go look at it. When I got home I took it off, and the skin came off with the tape. This was skin that had looked just fine, before, just tanned. But the nipple was much better after 2 days of Neosporin. And not only was the raw skin very sore, but 2 new areas were also now infected and oozing. Up until now, I have NEVER had any kind of skin infection. I had never had any kind of scratch or wound get infected. I still cannot stand to have anything touch the affected skin or nipple, not even gauze, it stings like crazy: but now I have a much larger area to deal with. I tried several things to keep my clothes off it, but finally made a ring out of cardboard large enough to circle the breast and then some. It is large enough in diameter to rest on the skin outside the irradiated area. I did a lot of fitting and trimming to make it contour to my ribs and side. That is being held in place with my very stretchy \"Barely There\" bra. I hope this way it is getting some air under my clothes too. I am wearing all wool today (apart from the bra) so hopefully it can breathe.",

Then as the minutes went by I discovered that all those other women were there accompanying a relative who was MUCH much older. One by one they all got to leave.

My place has nothing but ugly green hospital gowns: I went through a stack before I found one that even had any ties left. And then once I was laying there all exposed I wondered why I'd bothered. Even the \"good\" breast is made to suffer embarrassment. Somehow that did not occur to me before today. Up until the last few months my breasts were like good friends: sources of happiness and comfort, good things like milk for my children. Now I feel like one is a traitor. And that's illogical too.",

For the first time I have that tanned/pink \"square\" some of you have mentioned, that tells me exactly what area is being zapped. It sure is good to find out ahead of time, on these boards, about a lot of this. It helps a lot. I have a big patch of darker \"tan\" about 4 inches under the arm pit, I wonder what that is all about? It's like the midpoint of the swelling. They had to do a lot of tinkering last week to re-target. I still have the swelling so I think that is changing the angles. After Friday's treatment I became very sore/tender inside. The nipple is dry and sore too but it is the inside that is the most achey. Saturday I was walking through a museum with family and I was so sore I could not concentrate. And I had looked forward to the excursion all week as a \"reward\"! I took some ibuprofen (it was the only thing I had with me) and was surprised that it helped. Not completely but about 50%. I sat in the  back seat going home so I could cradle the breast from the bumps of the ride. I'm wondering if the rest of you take anything for pain, and what it is. So far my skin seems to be OK with just the aloe 2x a day. The doctor said to treat the nipple more frequently but it's hard to arrange getting undressed in the middle of the day, and letting it dry (it's cold here, and I'm not alone much). The texture of my skin is getting rougher but that does not bother me, it's not like a rash. I know what you mean about people taking the overly cheerful view. That's OK for me to take, if and when I want to (sometimes I do, sometimes I don't). I find I'm annoyed when what I'm going through is downplayed. I find my husband is going back to \"normal\" now, having gotten over the shock. He keeps saying things like, \"It's over. Radiation is just insurance\". Well, I don't feel like it's \"over\". For the rest of my life I will have the threat of this hanging over me, how can it be \"over\"? My neighbor's sister has colon cancer, another neighbor across the street had uterine cancer. We were talking about it, at a family get-together, and he (and the others) were saying how much worse it would be to have those. Well, yes, maybe, but I don't want to hear that now. I've been kicked in the head, and I'm still reeling. I'm not sure that my emotional state should be put on a scale and rated lower than what other people \"deserve\".",

Tracyanne, the explanation your doctor  gave makes sense. It also is a small sharp pinpoint, not overall. It is easy to distinguish from the overall breast soreness I have. I notice it most when exercising or bending/twisting in ways that affect the rib cage.  Also when I lay on my left (non-radiation) side. I am taking Aleve for the general pain, maybe it has been helping with the rib pain as well. Counting boosts, I will be done about Dec 3. I had to take an hour and a half long highway drive today and had to face the fact that I am not up to a longer drive. I don't feel that tired but find I am dizzy when driving. Today I had to drive on the right side all the way, thinking at any second I would have to pull off. Driving on curves is the worst. The non-highway, stop-and-go driving I do to get to my rad appt is no problem. I am supposed to pick up my daughter at college for Thanksgiving, the Wednesday before. I can tell now I won't be able to do it. I started feeling it at the beginning of rads and now it is getting worse. Weird. I'm wondering if rads have caused my body to be short of some vital nutrient. Anyone have this? Vtmom: you are finally getting down to the wire. Sorry you are having so much pain. Hope you ARE done at Thanksgiving. Congratulations to all who are done!",
