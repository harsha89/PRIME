Blood test has been done, reveal low white cells count and recommended to repeat after 2 months. 19 Jan 09 repeated, still low, but a little better, recommended next after 3 months. At the time of my yearly mammogram  on 16 Feb I ended having biopsy. Exactly 2yrs on the day I was diagnosed with new tumor in other breast. My immune system could not do anything about it, But finally somebody listened and I am beeing sent to hematologist !!  I need help with this, otherwise I might well going on repeating.",
