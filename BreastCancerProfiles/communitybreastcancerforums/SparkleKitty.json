Was scheduled a needle biopsy. The needle biopsy doctor told me he didnt think I needed it and sent me on my way. Turned 23. I got pregnant. Had my beautiful son. Then noticed more lumps while attempting breastfeeding. Went to the doctor. Got another ultrasound. Results inconclusive. Went to a breast care center. Got another ultrasound. Results inconclusive. But the breast care center doctor told me she really didnt think it was anything because I was so young. Turned 24. Had a lot of lumps and so much pain. Got another ultrasound. Results inconclusive. They had me wait 6 months so they could compare. Turned 25. Lost over 60lbs and now underweight. Got another ultrasound. Results showed a few cysts but some that are not cysts. Ultrasound tech went and got a doctor I had not seen before to look at the weird lumps on the screen. That doctor looked me straight in the eye and said it could be something. He said he wanted to wait another six months for another ultrasound and then a mammogram. My primary doctor moved away. Went to a new primary doctor today. She felt my lumps. Started crying... she told me I needed to go somewhere else since they havent been taking me seriously. Said there's so many lumps (which I obviously know). Blood work in the morning and getting set up at a different breast care center. Cant even sleep tonight because there's so much pain. Feel like I cant breathe.. I'm so confused on why this is happening and what is going on with my body. I cant think straight. My son only has me.. I'm the absolute only family he has. This cannot happen. Lumps are covering my entire chest and my armpits. What's hurting right now is the lumps going down on my ribs. I dont know if its related, but my neck muscles are very stiff and hurt quite badly also. Really wish I wasnt so stubborn and actually filled my prescription of pain medication Log in to post a reply",
