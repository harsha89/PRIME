You may need to see a doctor to remove the radiated tissue and to promote healing of the wound. Once the radiated tissue is removed the wound should begin to close (on its own without sutures/stitches). I recommend that you see a specialist who treats this unique type of wound, perhaps someone affiliated with a medical school and/or teaching institution. I would definitely call the doctor's office prior to your scheduled visit to determine whether they have the people/expertise to treat this type of wound.  I wish you well. Barbara The wounds you describe may be painful. A bag of ice may offer temporary relief of pain and reduce any inflammation that may be associated with the wound.",
