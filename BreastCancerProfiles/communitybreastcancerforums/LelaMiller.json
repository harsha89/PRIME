      "Content": "LelaMiller wrote: hi, could anyone help provide any advice that I can switch oncologist within MSKCC? I was assigned to an oncologist based on availability. The oncologist I want to see will not be available until Mar. Talked to patient reps and explained that the one I want has special research focus on the cancer type I have. However, they said no, they explained that they work like a team. However, I really feel not confident at all to see my current oncologist. Any advice? Any reason strong enough for me to switch after my first visit? Otherwise I Â most likely will have to find someone at other facility in Manhattan or any basking ridge MSK oncologist you would recommend? Thanks so much! Log in to post a reply",

Actually, after my first visit, there is no such urgency at all. My score is very low. However, I am in my 30's. My oncologist was not sure whether she would provide me any sever therapy. So I am not confident on her suggestion. I really want to switch to someone at MSKCC. Just don't know how... Thanks again! Best luck!",
