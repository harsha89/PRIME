My docs are trying to convince me to get another annual mammo but it aint happening.  Just had my first termography done last week and my second in 3 months time.  I'll never get another Mammogram as it hasn't shown anything for me so far and way too much radiation.",

My worry is that I want to go back to work after chemo, but if I then go back, everyone gets used to me being there (I work with different departments throughout Europe) and then I have to leave again.  It won't do me any favours I don't think.  I told my boss the other day that I would go back after chemo but now after speaking with the nurse am worried I may not be able to handle it.  Anyway, I suppose I'll just have to talk to him again and see what he suggests.  With the current climate, I'd prefer not to go part-time...incase they get too used to that and I'm kept on part-time after I go back.",

I was going to do the rads first thing in the morning if possible but its a drive to the other side of Dublin city to get to the hospital (about 1.5 hours each way) and then work a full day. I spoke to one of the nurses today and she said that I may feel really tired during this treatment so now I'm wondering if I should go back to work or not.  Things would be worse if I went back and then had to leave again because of treatment. Really just looking for any suggestions or info you may think I might find helpful. Thanks a mil. Paulsgirl.

I will ask my Doc's when I'm in for my third session but just wondered if anyone knew in the meantime. Thank you, Paulsgirl.
