Lymphovascular Invasion Breast cancers have a blood supply like normal tissue and organs. Tumors also have lymphatic channels running through them, which serve as a circulatory system in the body for tissue fluid and proteins separate from the blood circulation. If cancer cells under the microscope appear to invade into the blood vessels or lymphatic channels of the tumor, the possibility that cancer cells have spread to the lymph nodes or other areas in the body increases. This is called lymphovascular invasion or LVI. I also had LVI when I was diagnosed back in 2008.  Because of the LVI, I had 4 rounds of AC chemo.  I did not have lymph node involvement.  I had a SNB with 3 nodes removed.  All three nodes were clear.  Good Luck!",

Take care of yourself. Karen",

I would assume if you meet with a genetic counselor they would agree that you are a good candidate to be tested based on your family history and they could write it up in such a way to get you the most coverage possible for the test. Good luck!  I hope you are able to be tested and that insurance covers you 100%.  Karen",
