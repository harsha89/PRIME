Because they were so stretchy and the necks wide enough, it really wasn't a struggle to get into them. They felt so good next to my reconstructed body ;). (I hope this doesn't sound gross, but I would stick a mini-pad to the inside of the t-shirt to absorb some of the oozing that was going on at the incision sites) For my doctor's appointments I had a great little LLBEAN zip front jacket/top (activewear) with pouches inside to hide my drains while in the waiting room.",

Looks like I will have to wait until January for breast surgeon and PS to combine their schedules. Dr. suggested MRI to make sure more is not going on since we have to wait another month, or do the node biopsies in advance. Unfortunately i have to consider the financial side of all this. Doing the MRI will cost me the last $600 of my out of pocket expenses this year before things are covered in full and then I start all over again with meeting my $1500 ded/out of pocket in January. Trying to choose MRI over SNB. Will MRI provide info about lymph node involvement? Since I am having the bilat, my tissue will be tested in January when it is removed. SO confused, I am ready to call for the MRI but don't know if it will be that much of a help. When I left my last appt I had nixed the MRI and asked to do nodes if possible. I figured I would be getting the nodes done anyway (at time of bilat) so I may as well get one thing out of the way and start healing before the big surgery. Major second guessing on here. Help??

Even though I had stage 0 DCIS, i chose mastectomy. I just wanted to increase my chances of saying goodbye to cancer for as long as possible. Flap procedures have a longer recovery time (and longer operation) but mine turned out great. Although it was just 8 weeks ago, I am very happy with the new breasts, they seem quite real. So if you have any questions about muscle-sparing tram flaps feel free to PM me. So sorry you didn't get any answers before. I hope you are coping well. All my best to you as you proceed.",

I have watched a sister -in- law deal with breast cancer for 15 years. Her first lump was treated with lumpectomy, radiation and chemo. 6 years later she chose bi-lat when a new lump showed up. Her biggest obstacle was complications from a tram flap done on the previously radiated side. Radiation had really affected the tissue on that side and infection complicated things. With all that she has been through that is her biggest complaint. The non radiated side got an implant and is great. She has 2 little girls and has just found out she is now in stage 4 metastatic cancer to the liver. I don't know if a lumpectomy will \"cure\" my cancer. My feeling is probably not (my mother is a bc survivor too). So I wanted to avoid radiating my tissue and just go for it (the bilat) while my chances of getting great new foobs is still possible ;)",

Can't sleep in a bed yet because it hurts too much to shift and roll over and such. I just started driving again this week but like you said turning is very uncomfortable. I can't stand to have a bra on. Sometimes I will tie a thin knit scarf under my breast line and it sort of takes some of the uncomfortableness away from my chest area. While I can't relate to the missing breasts since I had a tram, I just feel like so many other woman on here seem to be feeling so good by 6 or 7 weeks, and one can't help but wonder if something is wrong when the relief doesn't come. I want my arms to work better and I just want to feel good again. I hope the same for you and I hope it comes soon. All my best to you and I hope the rope isn't anything serious or long term. Yay yay yay though, about the cancer free part! Carole",

Hers was considered to be to fibrocystic or fibroadenoma. It could be felt. It was oval and slippery. The first biopsy revealed just breast tissue so we weren't even sure that the lump was part of the sample (it moved very easily). We insisted on an excisional biopsy (I couldn't bear not knowing for sure- I wanted that lump in a jar!) and that revealed fibroadenoma. She was told she has very fibrous breasts and may have more lumps to deal with later.  Hopefully yours is a similar situation and all will be b9. Hang in there!",

Didn't know that was what it was at the time though. My lower abdomen filled up like a big 'ol water balloon. You touched it and it rolled in waves out to the sides. I went weekly to have it drained with a very large syringe. The first few weeks they extracted several syringes full (around 300cc). It has slowed down alot and it has been 2 weeks since my last needle draining (which was only about 60 cc). I go on Thursday again but I think it has pretty much stopped. Wearing the binder helped alot with holding down the volume as well as the weird sensation I felt through the tummy. The first 3 times I never felt the needle, the last time I went I definitely felt the pinch of the needle so I hope I am done with that now. The doctor spoke of possibly re-inserting drain if he sees more fluid on this upcoming visit so I am glad that it has really slowed down. Best of luck to you and try the binder! ",
