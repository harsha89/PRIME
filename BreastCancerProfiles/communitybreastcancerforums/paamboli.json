I have used it for years to ease joint pain, and it takes the soreness away for a couple of hours without putting more chemicals into your system. It has no smell, is not greasy, and absorbs quickly, so that you do not have to be concerned about staining your clothing. It is available in health food stores and high-end markets for about $11. All it does is to make things feel better for awhile. However, I have never used it in a post-surgery area, so best to check with your doc before using it on an incision. paamboli",
