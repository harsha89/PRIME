I've had a mastectomy even though I really wanted a bi-lateral, the insurance wouldn't cover it. So I'm post surgery almost 4 weeks and ready for the unknown. Simply reading the words you all have shared has helped me a bunch. I intend to emerge on the other side of this stronger and better than ever. If you all can do it I can too.    Thanks for sharing.

The waiting and not knowing is the worst so far for me. I'm a mess. I quit smoking 10 days ago and quit taking estrogen too. So my system is in shock and still healing from the biopsy. I know I'll make it through this but it isn't easy. Sure appreciate reading what you guys have to say it really helps to know I'm not alone.",
