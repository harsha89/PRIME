It mentions that Smokers And Overweight Women Are At Greater Risk Of Breast Cancer.Gosh.I will give the damn smoking and keep fit right now.

Share the article as following， hope the smoker and the fat like me will learn: A recent study published in the Journal of Cancer Epidemiology has reinforced the correlation between being overweight, smoking and breast cancer. What makes this study unique is how test subjects were not diagnosed for BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations, which predispose women to breast cancer. Instead, women with such gene mutations were excluded to allow researchers to concentrate on lifestyle factors such as smoking, exercise, nutrition and weight.                                                              _ From http://breastcancer.dormitory.com Log in to post a reply",
