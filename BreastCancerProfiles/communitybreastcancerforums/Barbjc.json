I have to be doing several gentle breast massagesdaily to keep tissue moving so we'll see well let's get through this together !",

Just finished my 4th treatment and it seemed shorter this time maybe I'm just getting used to it\u2026 I don't leave the treatment center until I slather the steroid cream all over and then when I get home I put more Aquaphor on and I sit topless at home as much as I can! ha! Or i just go braless with a big tshirt on that is getting Aquaphor stains on it! Whensleeping, are you all wearing a bra or going braless? trying to figure out what's best .. Right now I have a very comfy bra while I sleep and I slather on the Aquaphor and put a gauze pad over it, but wondering if the pad is soaking too much of the Aquaphor and I should just go braless...it just feels so sticky to sleep though good luck to all, we can do this!",

I finished my third day of treatment today and so far so good ...I've been slathering Aquaphor on my boob all day long and I am also using a steroid cream they gave me. My arms and hands completely fall asleep and go numb when they are above my head during treatment and I am on the table for about 20 minutes since they are doing x-rays every day and I'm using that deep breathing technique because it is on my left breast. I guess that bolus is to keep the treatment toward the skin surface because I have the implant underneath\u2026 And yes I do experience that hot feeling once in a while on my skin... but I've been working out and doing yoga\u2026 No problems\u2026 When I do wear a bra I put a couple of those breast-feeding nursing bra liners in there because I have Aquaphor on! I will be doing 33 treatments total\u2026 6 1/2 weeks\u2026 It would've been 4 1/2 weeks but since I have the implant from reconstruction they are giving me less dose each day for a longer time period! Stay in touch and good luck tomorrow...",

I put on the steroid cream right after treatment...after doing the aquaphor during the day and then at night at before bed. I've not had any 'zingers' some of you spoke of, but perhaps it's because I had the bilateral Mx last year with reconstruction, so nerves aren't what they used to be in that area. I do like the 3:40pm treatment time much better than the morning time...it's nice to go home right afterwards, rather than heading to work on my work days. On Tuesday of last week, the first day of beginning the 3:40 time, I entered the back waiting room and found 4 women laughing up a storm! I told them the afternoon group was much livelier than the morning group! They were hysterical...all waiting for treatment because the office was running...wait for it...an hour and a half behind that day! Yeppers...I was supposed get treatment at 3:40, but went back at 5:15pm. But here's what's true...no one was complaining or angry or mad...we all just chatted and laughed the entire time, and thoroughly enjoyed our time together...sitting in our pink robes. Life is good when surrounded by good energy and kind people. And...Friday, I made the decision to begin riding my bike to treatment! It's only 3 miles away, so the 6 mile round trip is a perfect way to frame some fresh air and nature surrounding my appointments. I'll be doing that every day, weather permitting. I'm doing yoga and stretching every day, and began PT...determined for this radiation NOT to mess up my reconstruction. Been spending the day in a big t-shirt with no bra and aquaphor all over my boob, you know the drill! Will keep y'all updated...good luck everyone and hang in there! ",

The Aquaphor is super sticky so I don't wear a bra most of the time and I bought some cheap oversized camisoles that I wear (will toss when done since aquaphor stains) and then a oversize shirt over that. When I go to work I actually do wear a bra but I bought some nonstick pads that I put inside my bra to help with Aquaphor stickiness. Not the most comfortable but not forever!

All agree that my 1st rib (which is located up by the collar bone) is out of place, which is causing muscle knots by my shoulder blade and almost a tug-of-war between the out of place 1st rib and muscle by the shoulder blade. Plus I have a mild case of cording (axillary web syndrome) under my left arm pit. The tissue expanders are under my pectoral muscle, so all the stretching going on is related to all of these issues ! Due to the tissue expanders being in place, my chiropractor can't do her normal adjustment to fix this 1st rib, so the PT will manually have to adjust it back into place over time, and the PT will also be doing a specific stretching PT massage for the cording issue ... anyways! my suggestion to anyone with shoulder or collarbone pain is to see a physical therapist that specializes in post breast cancer surgery treatments, they are fabulous and even after one treatment with him I feel slightly better\u2026 I'm scheduled to receive PT 2x/week for the next 6 weeks ...hopefully my issues will be resolved soon because I can't take this pain much longer and I am so tired of taking painkillers and muscle relaxants! Hang in there everyone... I keep repeating my mantra \"I HAD cancer, cancer never had me!\" Fight fight fight!",
