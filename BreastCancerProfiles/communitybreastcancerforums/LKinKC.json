Just have a quick question fellow fighters. I am 2 weeks from my first Chemo one week left till the next one. I have had some good days now. sometimes the side effects such as the diarrhea and burning indegestion appear out of nowhere. I've tried not taking the meds for them but it doesn't go away. So I take them and feel better. Anybody else have this pop up symptoms. I guess I thought we would have days of side effect symptoms then none till next time. I'm learning ",

I might have posted earlier but I have been reading your posts and they have been so helpful but now things are really starting to hit me. I start Chemo tomorrow 1/23/18. Chemo has had me worried more than having surgery. My chemo is TCHP every 3 weeks for 6 weeks. What type if side effects did you have after the first round. Did you have any during the infusion? I to have been overwhelmed by all the tests. CT scan/ bone scan/ echo. Then had my port placed Friday the 19th sore for a few days but not to bad now. I have found I don't sleep much the night before appointmens or procedures. has anybody had this problem and do you know anything that helps. I have not gotten a wig, was brave enough to try on a cap. I want to wish all of you the best possible outcome and I will be praying for you. ",

The bone pain was worst this time for me also this time but much better at taking the pain med for it. Luckily the doctor doubled my previcid. No burning indegestion this time and am quicker to take the magic mouthwash which puts the fire out. My MO was not happy with my weight loss, 11 pound weight loss in the first round. So I have really been carefully to make sure to eat. I've been able to manage the nausea and diarrhea better so fsr but I am starting the same feeling as last time nothing looks or sounds good and I have to force myself to eat something. I'm not sure if it's nausea. I am going to the store tomorrow any suggestions on shakes or protein drinks? Good luck to everybody",
