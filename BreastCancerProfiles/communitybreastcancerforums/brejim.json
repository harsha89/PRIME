      "Content": "brejim wrote: Hi all, I had a Vacuum assisted biopsy done due to a small cluster of calcifications. Although the actual biopsy came back benign. The breast surgeon wants to go in and do an excsional biopsy due to Atypical Hyperplasia found during the biopsy. I am seeing the surgeon on 2/12 to go over everything? I don't even know what questions to ask. This is all new to me. I know that it increases my chance of getting breast cancer in the future but I also read that sometimes they upgrade your diagnosis after open biopsy. I'm so nervous about all of this. I've never had a bad mammogram before or any calcifications in the past. I'm 51 and scared! Log in to post a reply",

I thought all that fancy wording really means Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia as that's what I thought the doc said when she called me with my Core Biopsy results but then I wasn't sure. Hopefully it won't be upgraded to DCIS but it's treatable. My mind is racing with all kinds of \"what if's\"! Can't wait to have the biopsy done which should be in the next few weeks.",
