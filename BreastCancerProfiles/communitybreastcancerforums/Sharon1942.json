      "Content": "Jan 3, 2012 02:17PM - edited Mar 26, 2014 04:44PM by Sharon1942 I need everyone's input as to when they began radiation - how many weeks after chemo.  I had chemotherapy & my chemo onc said I was to begin radiation in 3 weeks - after my body recovered.  In fact, I had a consultation with the radiation oncologist in Sept.  Well, I find out today that the rad onc is so busy with appts. & meetings that she cannot see me until Jan. 26 - 6 weeks after chemo!  I am afraid that the delay will let any stray cancer cells start metastisizing before they are radiated.  I expressed this fear to my chemo onc & the answer was to refer me to another rad onc.  This new rad onc received her onc degree in 2011 & I know the original rad onc is very experienced.  My mastectomy was on my left side, right over my heart, so I feel I need an experienced rad onc so that I don't have any life-threatening side effects.  SO, my question is, do you think it is okay to wait 6-7 weeks after chemo to begin radiation?????",
