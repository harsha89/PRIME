Since the area is so large and there are two, she feels like a mastectomy would be best. She also said I would most likely have radiation and chemo. My mind is a fog, I am trying to figure out everything I need to take care of because she talked to the surgeon herself and he said he would fit me in the next OR opening to get this over with. I won't know until tomorrow if he thinks a lumpectomy or mastectomy is the way to go. I feel like a mastectomy is best, get it all. Anything I should know before I see the surgeon tomorrow? He comes highly recommended, so I feel I am in good hands. Several ladies from church have had him as their surgeon. Thanks.

I don't drink much diet pepsi anymore, just doesn't taste good.  I am have been drinking water and it's tasting good so far.  Some of my favorite foods taste awful.  I do love baked potatoes and mac/cheese, both of those taste good. I have continually lost weight, intentionally, and keep dropping a few pounds each week.  I start Emend/Decadron next week, I paid $207 for 3 Emend pills!  I need to ask my doc if he can get samples.  I am wondering when the weight gain will begin........ugh Blessings to all of you!

My drains are good, incisions just give me pain every once in a while. I have horrible pain in what I think is the back of my arm. If I sit and don't move, I am okay. But moving, even the unaffected arm, will set off this stinging burning pains that will last a few minutes and then settle down to a dull pain. I am assuming that is from the lymph node removal. I knew I would be sore, but am concerned about the type of pain it is. I am wondering if it's nerve pain. I see the nurse practitioner at 1:10, she is taking the drains out. I am still draining quite a bit, so she might not take them. I am going to talk to her about Hydrocodone, it gives me a headache, so I am going to see if there is something else I can take. I decided I can't let this pain get the best of me, but I can't play tough and not say this hurts and I need something to make it feel better. I was prepared for the stomach problems yesterday, so they weren't bad. I found these store brand iced oatmeal cookies are the best relief for constipation and they work in a very short time. I keep telling myself I had major surgery on Monday and it takes time, I just wasn't prepared for the fever and this awful pain. Thanks.

If the findings aren't conclusive and a lumpectomy is recommened, how soon should that be done. If the findings are not cancer, but the lumpectomy is recommended due to pain and discomfort, what is the time frame? I have read lots of messages and it seems the surgery doesn't have to happen right away, although I know I would want it over with. I really want to be prepared if I need to make decisions.

They took 6 out and they were clean, so I won't have radiation to my axillary area now.  I am looking at my path report and it says my sentinel node was .2 cm for the max diameter.  The largest focus was 2 mm in greatest dimension. I talked extensively with my oncologist and surgeon about lymph node removal, I think I could have pushed them and not had it done, but I wanted to know if it had spread.  My situation is different from yours, because they only tested the sentinel node and there wasn't much cancer there.  I had to have the mastectomy, since the lumpectomy didn't get it all and chemo port in, so I had them take the nodes out at the same time.  It is not an easy recovery, some people said it was easy.  I have had many complications from my mastectomy and still have them, 3+ weeks out.  My lymph node area is much better now, but I have had lots of pain and soreness. I would ask them if they are doing this for staging only.  Are they doing another procedure at the same time?  I don't think I have heard of anyone having more out after taking that many the first time. Keep us updated. Nancy",

Any good places I should look?  I guess I can use a shower puffy until I get a prothesis.  I have been using the puffy foam things I got with my surgery camisoles.  For a long time I did nothing, just decided to use one and look semi-equal.  :-) Thanks.

      "Content": "nanc512 wrote: I have had a lump for sometime, but it seemed to come and go. Last week it got very painful and tender, it's on the inside lower part and only in one breast. At the same time I became really sick with headache, sore throat, very tired and just blah. I went to the walk in clinic a week ago and he managed to get my appt moved up with my doctor, I had made one about the lump, but had to wait two weeks. He did a chest xray and blood work, thinking I had pneumonia. He came back and said I had a bad bacterial infection and my neutrophils were high. I was put on Cephalexin 500 mg, 4 per day. By the second day the breast pain was gone and the tenderness was minimal. I saw my doctor this past Tuesday, she said the lump is solid and movable. She sent me for an immediate diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. She ordered the fine needle aspiration if the other tests called for it. I went back on Thursday for the FNA. The radiologist said they found another small spot on the mammogram, so they biopsied both. I am 49 and very worried, no history of breast cancer in my family. My doctor did say she would most likely recommend a lumpectomy. I really thought it was a cyst or abscess because the pain and tenderness went away with antiobiotics. I think it's smaller now. It also appears to have moved since the FNA. Today I have a long narrow blister above the incision, no pain with it and it doesn't appear infected. My doctor goes to my church and said she would check on me tomorrow, so I am going to ask about the blister. I didn't feel a trip to the ER was warranted, since there is no redness and it doesn't appear infected. I wonder if they used clamps during the FNA. I couldn't see that well. The waiting game is so difficult. I know no one has the answers, but am glad to find a community that understands. The resident I saw for the pre-exam thought it was unusual for the lump to be on the inside. Any suggestions on what I should do in the meantime? Any words of wisdom? Thanks.
