I have read that an MRI has a tendency to give out false negatives and that I am subjecting myself to more waiting and tests. I asked the doctor(nurse) why the MRI instead of axillary lump biopsy and she said that it will give more definitive information with less trauma. I guess it makes sense. I called the Radiology clinic to be sure that the Breast MRI will be scanning the armpit lump as there isn't one on the breast, she assured me it will be scanned.    I had a biopsy last year(normal breast tissue??) and now I have a lump in same armpit still no lumps in breast and normal mammogram. I had ultrasound of the axillary lump in August and the Radiologist \" 'thinks' it is a Lipoma but I should have a Mammogram\" my physician said that because I had had one a couple months prior and it was normal, we could wait for another year. In 2 months time the lump has grown. I went to another Physician as a second opinion and he said to wait a month and then I could have MRI (it is scheduled for tomorrow). I am beginning to think it is all in my head and I should wait a little longer. It is a silly thought and even if it turns out to me nothing, I will have a baseline of the size and shape of the lump. My fingers are crossed that all will be good news and I will be able to put my fears are rest.  Log in to post a reply",

The radiology Tech told me that it usually takes the Radiologist around 48 hours to read the tests and if there are no significant findings the will send a letter to the referring doctor and not call them. Surprisingly I feel at ease that I haven't heard anything yet. I will wait another 24 hours before I contact my doctor. But it seems that at this point no news is good news.",
