      "Content": "Monique72 wrote: I have had mammograms for 15 years, starting at age 30, due to family history (older sister diagnosed at 35, mother at 60). Regular screening mammograms never found my palpable lump. My doctor found the lump, which was painful, as I was near my period, and honestly felt no different to me than usual. I have had two mammograms within the past year, 9 months apart, neither showed any abnormality. Only a manual exam and doctor-prescribed ultrasound found my lump. My insurance does not cover US as a preventative procedure, only mammography, and only one a year, at that. The lump is 2cm, near the nipple, BI-RADS 4. I am currently waiting for core biopsy results. My breasts are heterogeneously dense and fibrocystic. They're like a sack of marbles most of the time. Mammograms look like a picture of clouds in the sky, where any monster or creature of fantasy can be projected. Regardless of what the biopsy finds, regular screening mammograms did not help me. As for navigating the system, I've already put in hours of phone calls between primary care doc, hospital, insurance, and medical group, to fix insurance authorization mistakesand other errors made by pencil-pushers, billing clerks and schedulers who know nothing of medicine, yet whose ineptitude negatively impacts my access to care. I can understand clearly why my mother refused all care and died of cancer. It's hard to trust a system that feels like a lumbering, careless juggernaut that runsover you, then bills you for the service. My sister was not given a timely diagnosis even after her biopsy, because her old-school patriarchal moron of a primary care doctor didn't want to worry the poor lady. Fear and ignorance directly impacted their care. Another sister, a histologist, has been blacklisted by her local hospitals for whistleblower activity uncovering ineptitude in their oncology departments such as hiding clear false-positives & negatives, and terrible interpreting skills by unskilled pathologists. She now only works with a team of histologists and pathologists who travel to train new departments in other towns and cities far from the rural area where she lives. I'm hoping since I live in a city where I have access to a recognized NCI-Designated Cancer Center, my care will be better. And I'm hoping that sharing my fears and frustrations will help me get a handle of my worry and anger. And I'm trying to understand that we're all human, patients and medical professionals alike. I've communicated my frustrations to official complaint departments in the hopes that my feedback will help patients receive better care. But already I've encountered evidence of CYA mode & passing the buck. Again, nobody's perfect, but stupid and lazy should not be tolerated. I won't give up on fighting to receive my care. I won't give in to negativity and fear, but I won't be fooled, either. Educate yourself, you're your own best advocate Diagnosed with PASH tumor 1/16/2018 Log in to post a reply",

It's been challenging and I'm not even in the thick of it. marie5890, the one BRCA-1 gene marker anomaly found in my mother and sister was not known to be correlated with higher risk at their time of diagnosis. I will need to ask my sister for her results to pin down the specific SNP. I am participating in gene research for bipolar disorder with 23andme, where I downloaded my results and then uploaded them to a site called Promethease, which takes the raw genetic data and matches your results with existing research linked to SNPedia, a wiki-type site. I have some markers that have weak correlation with higher risks for cancer, matched with some that are actually protective. But no serious BRCA markers are noted. I'm pretty sure California has the protective laws you mention, but I have not been proactive enough regarding demanding additional screening. I've tended toward the \u201cno news is good news\" approach. Nothing seemed amiss with the lump to me, but the ultrasound showed not-so-good signs. So here I am. I suppose I should demand an MRI, as I think I've met both my deductible and out-of-pocket maximum in one procedure. I will ask all of these questions when the biopsy results come in. ",

It does not impact insurance coverage of MRIs.",

      "Content": "Jan 10, 2018 04:52PM - edited Jan 10, 2018 04:53PM by Monique72 I'm inclined to think it's due to the profit-driven nature of health insurance vs the hospitals. The more unnecessary procedures they do, the more money the hospitals can bill the insurers and the patient. Plus, hospitals keep your biopsy core samples for future, personal diagnostic reference, and, if you consented to allow the study of your tissue at a teaching (research) hospital, for broader cancer research. And, in teaching hospitals, interns need to practice on someone, so why not you? The short version: They need to take you apart piece by piece in order to make it pay.",

Having more than one of those descriptors warrants a 5, but for whatever reason, they put 4 on the report. Im supposedly in this world-class university\u2019s hospital, but I ain\u2019t feeling it.
