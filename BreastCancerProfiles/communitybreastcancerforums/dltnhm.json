For instance, if you have targeted radiation on a part of your head you will most likely have hair loss on that spot. After surgery & chemo I had radiation - and one of the target areas was my axilla area. So I have only a tiny patch of armpit that still grows hair under that arm. I also did not lose eyebrows or eyelashes on AC chemo but started losing them both on weekly Taxol - 3 weeks in. Then they started growing back about 2 weeks later. During my Taxol treatments my hair on my head resumed growth also. I did have another eyelash loss (partial) about 3 weeks after my 12 weekly Taxols ended but they came right back in. For some people it takes different hair cycles until their lash or brow hair starts cycling like before. One more thing - stress can cause hair loss. And the results of the stress and subsequent hair loss can occur 6 months after the major stress event. I experienced this once (age 36) after several life events that tipped the scale. It was kind of like after I gave birth to my children - lots more daily hairs in my brush & shower. I started counting them. LOL Then it stopped. It was a search on the internet that gave me the first answer. Hang in there. Diana",

I'm not certain if you saw it or not - but just in case you didn't, please check your private messages. As for the chemo regimen - although I did not have neoadjuvant chemo, I did have AC and then Taxol. Many many women in the last few years have been prescribed a regimen of 4 AC every 2 weeks followed by 12 weekly Taxol. It may seem like a long way to do it - but studies show it is a very effective chemo regimen and given over 12 weeks is somewhat gentler on the patient. Depending on your Her2 status (a negative can be a 0, but it also can be classified as a negative, but is actually Her2 LOW. There is an ongoing NSABP study for women with Her2 LOW status which adds Herceptin to the Taxol arm and then Herceptin continues for a year (not weekly!!). I echo what others have written you about having a good relationship with your MO. Once everything is said and done, it is your MO who will be guiding your treatment & long term follow-up care. Patients who have a great relationship with their oncologist are much more apt to be involved in their care, obtain more information, and make educated decisions going forward. PM me or reply here if you want more info. If you need an ear - I'll give you my phone #. Heading out of town on Wednesday. ",

I knew going into surgery that if there were positive nodes then I would have an axillary excision - not all my axillary nodes, but a portion to be tested as well. Nothing pre-op suggested to my BS that she would find positive nodes. The nodes were positive so she took an excision. If you don't know alteady, the surgeon does not know when she removes that fatty pad exactly how many nodes are there. It is only when the pathology comes back that the number is known. My nodes were extremely tiny according to the surgeon and pathology. More were there then anyone expected to find, but not all my nodes. As for the clear margin, your size, etc., I would explore this more with your surgeon. Since you had a planned mastectomy the expectation would have been to get as clear as possible margins AND remove as much of the breast tissue as possible. The breat tissue does go back and over to the side under your arm so that might have been the fatty tissue referred to. Try to hang in there. Get everything looked at closely and the infection taken care of. Removal of more nodes does not mean you are going to develop LE and development of LE can occur with the removal of just the sentinel nodes. I'd write down everything you want to ask and say to the surgeon before your next appointment which should be sooner rather than later. Take someone with you and don't leave until you get the answers to your questions.",

One of the things that I included was that when they (my docs, nurses, techs, etc.) were fighting for me - they were fighting for my family. And I personally expressed to my BS - a young mother and a cancer survivor herself - that I knew that there had to be times when she was taking care of me and others that took her away from her family. Or times, like the Saturday in the hospital, when she had to first make rounds. And I had the privilege of meeting her little tribe. As I told her, and asked that she share with her family, \"here's a picture of a family that is forever grateful for you and for the sacrifices that you and your family had to make sometimes to treat me. And these children in this picture (these big boys - 2 in college/1 in HS at the time) are so thankful that you (Dr.M) were there for their Momma. Thank you, you sweet, little ones for sharing your Mommy with ours to get her better.\" There were more words for her - but often those involved in our care never get to see us on the other side. I made a point of returning to see my ICU recovery nurse, my surgical prep nurse who revealed to me that she was a breast cancer survivor, my orher nurses and techs with notes, pics, and flowers, my chemo port team - we had a party :0), donuts and treats to my oncology team, special parting donuts and candy on 'zero' day - following my last rads treatment, etc. But always a note and a pic.

Labs will most assuredly be drawn closer to the start of chemo to make certain that your mother's levels on each test are appropriate to undergo chemo. Mine showed low iron about 3 weeks before I started. I chose to ingest all sorts of iron rich foods to get that back to where it was to be. Others choose iron supplements. That's just one example of something that might show up. Depending on the chemo, they will order a MUGA \"A multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan creates video images of the ventricles (lower chambers of the heart that hold blood) to check whether they are pumping blood properly. It shows any abnormalities in the size of the ventricles and in the movement of the blood through the heart. Other names for this test include cardiac blood pooling imaging, nuclear heart scan, nuclear ventriculography, and radionuclide ventriculography. Some people with cancer who receive chemotherapy or other drugs may need this test before cancer treatment to identify preexisting heart conditions or during or after cancer treatment to identify chemotherapy-related heart damage.\" Cancer.net I did not have neoadjuvant chemo - so I cannot speak to that. It seems like a second FIRST opinion is probably warranted with your mother's case - since you are not able to get in as soon as you believe her condition warrants. Who is the doctor that ordered the initial tests that found her breast cancer? Her gynecologist? Her internist? Her primary care physician? Which doctor's office called and told her to get in as soon as possible? You can most definitely start there. I will also suggest that your mother needs (if she has not already done so) to get complete copies of all records and results surrounding this diagnosis. She needs this for her records and armed with these results, she will be able to provide them immediately to the oncologist she chooses. (I'd suggest taking them and hand delivering them.) One more thing - appointment schedulers cannot always get you in asap - but nurses and doctors can. So it really is imperative that you are speaking with the diagnosing doctor and having him/her advocate on your mother's behalf for an EARLIER appointment. Nurses and doctors will have access to openings that the general scheduler will not. Diana Edited to add: Seeing a dentist to ascertain good dental health is also usually scheduled. ",

Also have a large gall stone - who knew? Didn't have a clue and don't why. Have to educate myself on gall stones. And a \"calcified granuloma in the lingula\" and two \"non-calcified nodules\" on the lungs. Those are evidently from some previous infection most likely from when I was an infant or a bout I had in the mid 90's where I had an upper respiratory infection that hung on for quite a while. No one is concerned about the nodules , the grauloma, or the gall stone. Bone scan revealed what MO spoke of as arthritis most likely. This is consistent with my former xrays done about 20 months ago when I was rearended at a stop light. Primary Care doc then said the tests showed some degenerative arthritis in my spine that was not remarkable. MO didn't pursue this today but my new Primary Doc sent me downstairs for xrays just to rule that out too. So ... that's the next step in my road to a complete diagnosis. Thanks again for all your stories. I will keep you posted one way or the other. I should know by Friday if not before what the results are for the MRI. I'm sure the xray report will be done tomorrow morning.",

My eyelashes are back to normal and then some.

Although I was 48 - I had not experienced any perimenopause symptoms and my estradiol level was completely normal. I had a normal period the week before chemo and it has never returned - 2 years 7 months. My levels were tested at 2 years with my Estradiol level in a post-menopausal range but my FSH & LH numbers are still at levels that are not menopausal. We did not test them for my last appointment in June but I have an order for them in October. In the meantime I have continued on Tamoxifen.  Hope this helps.  A detour from the hair topic :-)  Congrats on completing Chemo!",

I have been getting some responses in both the III and IV groups that have and are helping to look at this. I really wasn't that 'anxious' although it might have sounded that way. I just want INFORMATION in a big way and the more the better. So it helped to have some going into the appointments today. I was so thankful that I had researched chemotherapy drugs and regimens and scanning tests, etc. so that I had a list of questions and was familiar with different scenarios. And glad to know that there was all kinds of anecdotal evidence from the women on here who were symptom free and those tests did uncover things that otherwise would have flown under the radar. So let's see ... here's where I am as of today: Stage IIIA (got an A+ for having that figured out going into the appointment) LOL My HER was negative with my needle biopsy done in November (HER2/neu - FISH), but my MO asked the pathologist to run a stain (analysis by immunohistochemmistry) on my tissue from the mastectomy since they were being so thorough with the report and it came back LOW with a +1 score. That makes me a candidate for a trial involving herceptin for women with low HER. I may or may not get into the study. And it is a randomized study, so there is a possibility that I might be put in the control group and not receive the Herceptin at all. The study, however, is intriguing to me and the idea that participating might help me if I do receive the herceptin, that my participation one way or the other has the potential to help other women down the road in so many ways, etc. is reason enough to participate at this point. So I will have chemotherapy ... and I am looking at this beginning anywhere from 2/7 to 2/21. We are giving my body time to recover from my left nipple sparing mastectomy with DIEP reconstruction and axilla node excision which took place on January 10th - just a little over two weeks ago. Doc leans toward beginning druing the 4-6 week post-op dates. But everyone (all my surgeons and doctors) are thrilled with my progress and recovery thus far. Me too!!! All of that being said .... these are the tests that I am going to have going forward before Chemo begins: Doctor ordered: Bone Scan CT scan of pelvis, abdomin, and chest. The CT scan is scheduled for Fri and I will know tomorrow if I can get the bone scan done tomorrow. We were at the breast center (seeing surgeon, mo, picking up contrast, and making appointments for about 4 hours today. Long afternoon .. but well worth it. Participation in the trial requires a slew of tests and these are the ones that I will need in addition to the two above: Blood tests Pregnancy Test Echocardiogram or MUGA scan ECG (electrocardiogram) Hormone test (which will reveal if  I am pre-menopausal or peri-menopausal or menopausal. I am definitely not post-menopausal.) I am content with the scans that are going to be ordered at this point. Doc said that if there is any question whatsoever .. she will order the PET scan after the CAT and bone scan. That works for me. And all the other tests that are needed in order to see if I qualify for the trial and then where I would get plugged into the trial. Still want to learn more about CTCs and markers. From what I have learned thus far by research ... I see value in knowing what they reveal (even if it is an incomplete picture) .. but also see merit in what my MO explained about this today. Thanks so much to all of you who have responded! Hope you will continue to 'talk' to me and share the journey. This is a great community and I am learning so much from my fellow fighters and survivors :-) I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I've committed unto Him until that day. No one can snatch me from His hand.  Whatever the future holds ...  I am in the best hands possible :-) It is a blessing to have such a supportive online community of fellow fighters and survivors!

And yet some women do have one, two, or more of the above tests before chemotherapy - not only to establish a baseline, but also to possibly diagnosis stage IV. I haven't fit the picture all along ... So I figure it's possible to be stage IV and be symptom free at this point. I have just been preparing myself and wonder if there are any of you who had a similar road already. Thanks in advance. Diana Age 48 @ diag. Left SS NS UMX, Sent.Node Biopsy & part.

Perhaps it was because I actually fell asleep during my previous breast MRI and a large portion of my bone scan. In this one I needed to stay awake so I could keep inhaling, exhaling, holding my breath and stop breathing over and over and over again. It was almost comical ;-) how many images they were taking. At least I know they are being thoroughly thorough. And they even gave me a dvd of my own to take with me. So the countdown begins ... I imagine I will hear from my MO by the end of the day today. In the meantime, I walked at the mall today and met up with a girlfriend who just learned that she needs to have a double mastectomy. We are in this together.

      "Content": "May 22, 2012 05:36PM - edited May 22, 2012 07:38PM by dltnhm I had 4 DDAC, 3 week break, and am now having 12 weekly Taxols. # 5 is tomorrow. I never lost all my hair on AC but I did have my husband buzz it with a #1 setting. After my 1st Taxol I started losing lashes and that continues for a few weeks. The 1st to go we're the bottom outside lashes. I think this is because I had outside tearing after 3 doses of AC which thankfully stopped about 10 days after my last AC. My brows started to thin out about the same time as my lashes. The eyash loss has. Even the hardest part of hair loss for me. Recently my eyelashes started growing back in. It was almost as if the little buggers were waiting to come out. I actually pulled out the remaining stray hangers on over a few days last week. They did not need to be tugged if you kwim. At the same time I After the brows started to grow I noticed that the buzzed hairs on my head were feeling really prickly. I could just reach out and pull them out if I got my fingers around one. And I could rub my head over the counter and the little pricklies would end up there. It they weren't coming out in droves and some actually have stayed. This past week or so I have had hair growth. It is extremely soft and not patchy at all. Most of it is white, some blonde, but I know there is a tad bit of color mixed in somehow due to how the 'shadow' effect is on my head. This coincides with pure white soft pubic hair that has decided to make its entrance. Since I am on the 12 weekly cycles I am hoping that I will not lose any of the new growth - especially the lashes. I have heard some some lose their lashes twice often after treatment. I wonder if this doesn't have more to do with the fact that we are always losing hair normally even eyebrows and eyelashes. But we don't 'notice' because it is one or so at a time. If they all grow back in at the same time and If they are more fragile the Perhaps their cycle stays synched for months or so with another total or almost total loss. It's conjecture on my part because I haven't found anything like what I am speculating addressed in any literature. Hope this helps.",

After reading what I could find online from Penguin Cold Caps and here on the discussion boards, I decided they would not work for me, my lifestyle, and how I desired to go through treatment. In no particular order: The length of my chemo regimen and number of treatments: from 2/23 through 7/11 - 4 dose dense treatments over 8 weeks, a three week break, and then 12 weekly treatments. I'm a runner. And I'm a sweater. My hair is almost always soaking wet with sweat after a run - even in the Winter. And I'm okay with that :-) Because I sweat so much, I wear a bandana 'sweat band' or a regular sweat band or a baseball cap when it's warm/hot. When it's cold out I wear a baseball cap. (I have to keep the sweat out of my eyes - not just keep my hair back.) And I wear a very tight pony tail - there's just no way that a loose braid or a scrunchy would hold my hair back while running for an hour or two. And there was no way that washing my hair twice a week would work with my running. There are times that I ran before, during, and after chemo, and now twice a day. For me .... my running was so much more important than attempting to hang on to my hair. I didn't want to go through months of daily worrying about my hair. I could not imagine spending the time and mental energy that I was reading about. Worrying about hair getting caught in zippers ... worrying about children touching or pulling on hair (taught two year olds and had contact with babies during treatment) .... not allowing my husband to run his fingers through my hair and or touch my scalp ... for all those months ... not taking hard flow showers that included my head ... washing my hair only (at the most) twice a week ... worrying about 'shedding' ... possibly getting frostbite on my scalp ... Chemotherapy infusion takeover. This wasn't for me. I had a great outlook going into chemo and through chemo, but would not have wanted my experience to be mainly about my hair - before, during, and after the infusions. During my first chemo (AC), we decided that we would not only make the drive down to Florida for my nephew's wedding, but also go on a five day cruise with my husband's side of the family. After my 4th infusion, we jumped in the car and drove to Kentucky the first night. I'm thankful that I was not bound to carting a cooler full of dry ice and stopping to change caps. I can only imagine how we might have missed out on a great adventure if I had been. And the cruise - was incredible. And I was so free. LOL. I wouldn't trade that experience sans hair for anything. It was incredibly liberating to participate in any activity - not worry about my hair (or lack thereof) and know that I could clean up and be ready in minutes. The statistics quoted at the time that I was researching were not great enough to sway me that the cold caps had a high success rate with my particular chemo regimen. There seemed and still seems to be conflicting information given from the manufacturer and from some of the gals who have done PCC and from one of the self-described PCC helpers as to the best protocols to follow when using the caps. And there was and still appears to be difficulty for women receiving their full order of caps and bands and straps, etc. I'm sure I'm leaving something out right now. And you might get the impression that I am anti-cold caps. I still follow the threads and read what is shared. I realize that permanent hair loss is a real side effect for some chemo patients and a risk that some women would prefer to lessen or lower or negate with PCC. I guess for me there was never this idea that I didn't look like me because my hair was gone. Or that I \"looked like a cancer patient\" - whatever that is supposed to mean ... which seems to be a great fear for some. Maybe it has to do with my husband already losing his hair when I met him, or with one of my sons experiencing a receding hairline at a young age. Maybe it has to do with one of the boys in our congregation and one of the young men on campus where my husband works both having alopecia. Maybe it goes further because my husband and son share a congenital trait/anomaly. Maybe it's because I don't have a mental picture in my head that a certain look on anyone equates to anything in particular. This is not to suggest that I did not have any days of missing my hair. And I did have a particularly yucky exchange with someone about my hair at a vulnerable point in my last weeks of chemo. But I also had some wonderfully uplifting and funny exchanges too. But overall, it just was a non-issue. If you want to talk about the scale going up like crazy despite running 25-30 miles a week during my Taxol treatments ... now that's a different story ;-) Whatever you decide to do ... make certain it's your decision and that you're comfortable with it. There are some great gals on the PCC threads so pick their brains and read all the suggestions. Hugs! Diana",

I'm 12 1/2 months pfc and it's my hair - just as before on the curl front but super soft considering there's not a hair that's older than 14 months (my hair started coming back in while I was on my 12 weekly Taxols).

From reading your description, you would be staged at IIa based on the size of your tumor. She does not have the same diagnosis. Full disclosure - neither do I. First things second. I was able to continue running throughout my chemotherapy (also fast paced walking when I walked) - AC 4x's over 8 weeks. Taxol 12x's over 12 weeks. I was fortunate to go through my treatments with relative ease. I see you will be on another regimen if you continue with the scheduled chemo. I cannot personally speak to that particular regimen. My oncologist encouraged me to do whatever I felt comfortable doing and she and was very supportive of my running. Chemo started in the Winter for me (and I had hair in the beginning too) so I wore (as I always did/do) a ball cap with/without a fleece head/ear band when it was cold. We did have some unseasonably warm weather in March that year and since I chose to go wigless & hatless period, running that way was not an issue for me. In the hot weather I wore a sweatband or bandana twisted and tied around across my forehead. Regardless of the season - I made certain to slather on the sunscreen on my head & into my new hair as it grew in (which it started to do during my Taxol treatments). Please do what you are comfortable doing - just know - people are very supportive. As you probably know already, runners are a community - accepting of one another despite our differences. Cancer doesn't change that! Regarding chemopause .... I have not had a period since my first chemo treatment. 3 years 5 months. I was not headed toward menopause based on my hormone levels tested and had no physical symptoms pointing that way. I was 48 years old. My oncologist started with the \"wait and see if your menstrual cycle remains stopped for 2 years and if so we will check hormone levels\". As it stands my estradiol is menopausal but my FSH & LH are still very much NOT. Therefore, I am still taking Tamoxifen until those numbers change or until something else changes where I'd opt for suppression & an AI. There are others on this board whose doctors go with a cessation of menses for a time period and some do not even test the hormone levels. They go to an AI. I prefer my oncologist's plan. If you Google \"chemo lite\" you will find some interesting and varying hits. Bottom line is no \"light\" breast cancer chemotherapy protocol. There has been interesting research on patients who are prescribed less than standard dosage, or depart from the standard schedule or stop before complete protocol is given. This has been referred to as \"chemo lite\" in some articles referencing studies. The retrospective studies show that doing this ends with a decrease in effectiveness of the chemo compared to taking it the way it is intended to be taken. Sometimes, this is the best that can be done for some with comorbidities, allergic reactions, or strong negative side effects. Hope this is helpful! Diana ",

My husband and I went on our first cruise with his family right after Easter and had a wonderful time. I don't mean to be a Debbie Downer ... so I hope this will be seen and received as informative and not negative ... but I read many of you stating that you purchased trip insurance. The reason that caught my eye is because I am an avid reader of the Chicago Tribune and there is regular column in the travel section: Travel Troubleshooter. In the last couple of months I read a column about a couple who cancelled their trip because the husband had hip surgery and it was determined that this was a pre-existing condition. Since the couple had not insured the full amount of the trip, the carrier was refusing to cover the claim. In the end, due to the Travel Troubleshooter's involvement, the insurer made an exception. The column title for May 22nd was \"They saved $74 but they lost $10,074\" by Christopher Elliott in the Travel Troubleshooter Just a quick Google search for \"travel insurance and pre-existing conditions\" came up with hits which explained how this works or doesn't work for the traveler who purchases travel insurance and has a pre-existing condition. Here is one hit: www.tripinsurancestore.com/3/pre-existing.shtml If that doesn't come up as a link you can copy and paste it into your browser. I know that for all of you these trips are especially important and pray that each of you will realize these trips without complications. But I know that by purchasing trip insurance you are counting on being able to use it just in case - so I just want to make certain that you have all investigated the very small and tiny fine print included in these policies to make certain that your pre-existing conditions and those of your loved ones are covered! So excited for all of you that you are making these plans! (Edited by Mods to make the link clickable)",

If there were two distinct smaller tumors then the stage would not change. The final pathology revealed the original tumor and a separate area, not connected.

Screening, self-exams and yearly mammograms are all extremely important, but it will not keep someone from having breast cancer. Those tools might catch it earlier than later, but that is not necessarily true. The AWARENESS that I want to spread is not simply about the risk factors, self-exams, yearly mammograms, etc. It is so much more than that. And it starts in your HEART. How you live each day. What is important to you. How you value your relationships and extend your friendships. What counts most.

And it is still helping me let go of stuff that just doesn't matter at all in the grand scheme of life and living. You are wonderful, caring, compassionate ladies and although I did not end up a stage IV, I hope that you will continue to accept my input from time to time. Since it's in my lymphatic system I might have that Roman numeral one day. Keep fighting. Keep hoping. Keep striving. Keep living. From what I have gleaned, I, II, and III are often just numbers.

If not, it would be wise to gather together your mammogram, mri, and any pathology reports that were generated. Request a copy of the full pathology report from your bmx. Make an appointment to sit down with your breast surgeon and go over all of these reports. Did you meet with a medical oncologist and/or a radiation oncologist prior to your bmx? If so, they should have had copies of your reports and you could check the paper trail on the size noted in those reports. So sorry that you are going through this right now.",

And believe me there are well-meaning guys and gals who are attempting to help. But I must tell you that a) lumpectomy + radiation is NOT equal to a mastectomy  and b)  rads can be offered after a mastectomy There is so much more involved in a treatment plan so it is wise to really research this beyond any one person's first person account. And I don't mean just take my word for it. :-) Indicators for radiation following a mastectomy may include: presence of a large tumor (typically 5 cm or larger) nodal involvement - many go with 4 or more positive nodes (or) less than 4 positive nodes with extranodal extension (the cancer is growing out through the walls of the lymph nodes)  angiolymphatic invasion and/or lymphovascular invasion - cancer has entered the small blood vessels or lymph vessels in the breast  (I'm not certain if these two terms are the same thing. Most of the research that I did and what was on my pathology report and pointed out by my medical oncologist was on lymphovascular invasion or lvi) close margins (cancer cells at the edge of the mastectomy - skin, chest wall, etc.) Radiation following mastectomy can reduce the risk of local recurrence in most cases involving postive nodes. There are statistics on reputable sites and in journals. Some patients choose to forego radiation because they believe that the %age of decrease in local recurrence is not enough to warrant going through radiation. Others choose radiation because they believe that %age differential is significant. Meeting with a radiation oncologist to discuss all of this and his/her medical plan is part of the decision making process. Some patients seek second opinions regarding this plan. Personal disclosure: I'm 48 -  and am staged at 3A. I had more than 4+ nodes, extranodal extension in some nodes, and lymphovascular invasion. Radiation for me was strongly indicated. With axillary nodal involvement, the target of the radiation is often axillary nodes which were not removed and other areas of nodes (for me - those are the supraclavicular nodes - because that would be a likely area for spread from the axillary nodes.)  Did you meet with a radiation oncologist to see if radiation was indicated based on your pathology? I don't have an opinion on whether you need it or not --- I'm definitely not a doctor. If not a consult would probably put your mind at ease. ",

Her stats are similar & she wondered aloud today what the recommendation would be if the score was 18/19. Did your oncologist explain reasons for his/her recommendation? I would imagine he/she did. What chemo was recommended? Your age may be a factor. Have you thought about a 2nd opinion? If you do not have chemo - what are the recommendations for any treatment going forward? Was radiation discussed? Have you met with a Radiation Oncologist? Hormonal therapy? Lots to digest right now. You will get lots of advice and personal info here. Try to read results of studies that relate to your particular situation with all the factors. Again so sorry you are here but glad you found BCO.",

I just could not find some real women writing and discussing these tests. I love this community but there are thousands upon thousands of topics to go through to see if one fits your questions sometimes. Imperfect tool but a grand tol nonetheless. I am leaning toward requesting the PET or PET/CAT scan combo and also the blood work CTCs. When I write \"requesting\" ...I mean that from what I have read thus far, it appears that these two might give the best \"picture\" of what might be going on with me now and would certainly be great baseline tests to have before chemo begins. There isno doubt in my mind that chemo is on the agenda for the first step. I had a routine mammogram in Nov. which showed a suspicious area. A week later I had a follow-up mammogram, ultrasound, and neede biopsy all in the same day. The pathology revealed dcis and invasive Ductal Carcinoma. About a week later I had a breast MRI. The breast MRI revealed two additional lesions. I had a unilateral left breast mastectomy, sentinel node biopsy, and DIEP reconstruction on the 10th of this month. The two sentinel nodes were positive so my surgeon took an axillary excision which turned out to have 17 additional nodes, 5 of which were positive, for a total of 7 nodes. The tumor size ended up being 2.5 in size, clear margins after the removal of all breast tissue, vascular invasion presence, and T2N2 result thus far. The surgeon said she would not have felt the lump as suspicious, as did each doc that examined me prior to surgery .. Radiation oncologist, medical oncologist, reconstruction specialist, etc. After the axillary excision and before the path report, my surgeon said that the nodes did not \"feel\" cancerous upon excision. There again ...there turned out to be 5 additional positive nodes. It just seems that at each turn it is hopeful to believe it has gone no further, but more realistic for me to expect the next thing. Honestly, that has brought me great peace to research the next part and then find out that it really is there as well. Must sound crazy, but I am a student at heart and love research. The Lord is carrying me through this with a peace that really does surpass all understanding whatever the next step becomes. Still hoping other ladies respond about their experiences with these tests.",

At the one month one we talked about how radiation was going for me as it has just started, scheduling my port removal (didn't get it removed right away so I'm waiting until rads is over and all skin is calm), my tamoxifen prescription to start after rads, and follow-up care in the future (every 3 mos for at least a year). I also had my port flushed. Met with my BS last week. It had been about 6 months. I did not have any tests or scans. She did a breast exam. We did talk at length about the future. I will have a 3D mammogram in November and see her then for an appointment and exam. and we talked a lot about the past. I wanted to review the different mammograms, ultrasound, breast MRI from before and during diagnosis. We talked about my dense tissue too. I'm going to have a breast MRI alternating with the 3D mammograms going forward. I'm finding from reading on here that different docs have different protocols. Of course they also make decisions based on the patient. Hugs!",

That's my history. We are different even with the same stage. I looked back at your earlier posts and see that you were initially diagnosed in June, had further testing and you have a 4 cm tumor, grade 2, triple negative, with 3 of 9 nodes testing positive. I didn't see your age in the posting, but understand that the younger a person is, the  more aggressive the cancer is. If that's a factor for you, it's another point to consider. And triple negative has fewer options than hormone positive cancer. The latter may be another reason why you have been encouraged to hit this fast and hard. And coupled with the your positive nodes, there is certainly a reason your doctors want you to get started. You can only look forward at this point and not back - but I would encourage you to not wait longer. Since you will be having surgery first, generally a patient has to wait some time between surgery and chemo. So delays in surgery push back your chemo. At some point, you have to trust that there is someone in the conventional medical community that is looking out for your best interests if you are choosing to go that route as well.  I'm sorry that you are going through all of this. ",
