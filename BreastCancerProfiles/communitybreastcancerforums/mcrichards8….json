I did have an ultrasound which did not show anything so that is why I was sent for the CT Scan w/contrast. I did just speak to my OBGYN this morning because my mammogram done  a month ago was ok but not 100%. At the time of the results he did not feel I needed an ultrasound but now says its not a bad idea to have one. I discussed the lymph node and he suggested I speak with a surgeon or my oncologist to see what they say. I feel like I'm being a little crazy but unless you've been through it you can't explain the fear of reoccurance. I'll let you know...and again thanks!",

I was first diagnosed with early stage breast cancer in December of 2006. My treatment was a lumpectomy with radiation therapy. At the time there were no lymph nodes involved. I have had clean mammograms yearly since. I have been having issues with my neck for about the past 8 months. During my recent exams my general physician had been feeling a lump at the base of my neck/shoulder area. During the past 5 weeks the lump has remained the same size and feeling. A CT Scan with contrast was ordered. I just received the results today and was told all they found was a 0.5 cm lymp node enlargement. This lymp node was also detected on another scan I had a few months ago and there were no changes detected. This lymp node happens to be on the same side as the breast cancer was. My doctor says there is nothing to be concerned about seeing the lymp node is still very small. I am not quite sure what I feel about being told not to worry about it. Can someone possible give me some more information.  Dx 12/28/2006, DCIS, 1cm, Stage 0, 0/0 nodes, ER+/PR- Log in to post a reply",
