Had double mastectomy with TE's on July 12. Sentinel node biopsy showed 3/4 positive. Having PET scan today. Port placement consult with BS on Wednesday. If all goes according to schedule, I'll start 4 rounds of AC every 3 weeks on 8/11.",

Found out last night that my insurance won't cover Nuelasta based on new guidelines that we're only at 10% risk of fever from low WBC count. Of course I freaked out and spent my entire morning in preop for the port on the phone with everyone. Come to find out that my MO knew this last week when he got the denial & did review with the company. When they told him the new guidelines, he acquiesced. Has anyone else's MO decided they didn't need Nuelasta because \"other than the cancer, you're healthy\"? He said that if the tests show low WBC after the first treatment, we'll have grounds to argue for the medicine. I don't think I really mind not getting the Neulesta. If the data doesn't support needing it, that's OK. I think I'm just really resenting that I found out about the treatment plan change via form letter two nights before chemo which caused me to stress out since I didn't know about new guidelines. He made it sound like this was essential during our appointment at the end of July. I've had enough surprises thank you!!!",

I am concerned that as a public school teacher who plans to continue working as I am able and primary caregiver to my kindergarten age son, I'm going to be exposed to a lot of stuff. My MO was OK with me working when he thought I was getting the Neulasta. I hope that's still his tune at our next appointment. I'd be interested to hear if your plan is also insurance driven. djm What I think is so strange is the disparity in what they allow/deny. It seems so random. My insurance co didn't bat an eye at my MO ordering a PET without a CT. But the Neulasta is their line in the sand? No rhyme or reason. I hope your headache is better or at least not worse. Unwilling Participant I'm sorry to hear about your optic nerve damage. Best wishes for a good ENT visit on Monday.",

I've been on the Zoloft about 18 months after dealing with AD issues for as long as I can remember. I felt so lucky that it worked right out of the gate & I didn't have to try different things like so many people seemed to have to do. So I'm hoping the Effexor will also manage my AD. One more thing, I guess. I didn't really notice saline taste in my mouth. It does make my nose feel like I've snorted too much water while swimming. The nurse had me chew/suck on crushed ice while giving me the Adriomycin(sp?). She said that was the one well known for mouth sores & the ice in the mouth seemed to help prevent them (anecdotally). One more Neulasta update here and then I'll post on the dedicated thread with anything further. Still not getting it. They're not really pleased about that. Lowered my \"ER worthy fever\" to 100.0 and said go at the slightest indication of feeling poorly. The nurse said she's never seen the doctor as mad as he was on the phone during the peer to peer appeal with the insurance. They had to close patient doors he was yelling so much. She also said her aunt was beginning treatment soon and is not getting Neulasta per these new guidelines. Thanks for sharing the update, Unwilling Participant. It sounds like a reasonable path. And lymph node transplants? Never heard of that before. Thanks for the good wishes, fireheart438. Right back at you :) Here's hoping for minor side effects and improving conditions for everyone! Hugs!",

The insurance said that they require you to be at a 20% risk for the SE before they'll cover the drug and breast cancer patients are only a 10% risk. But maybe they're more flexible with the coverage if the cost is less. Best wishes to you!",
