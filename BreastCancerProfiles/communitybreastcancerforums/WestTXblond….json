I may hear from the doc before then to set up a biopsy. I'm not saying a word to my kids, family, and boyfriend until I know for sure what's gonna be going on. My folks are elderly, my kids live out of state, and my boyfriend lost his wife to breast cancer 2 years ago. I'm going to be optimistic! Thanks again!",

So...I'm waiting to hear back about when that will be. I'm trying not to let it bother me--too much! It may be nothing but a fibroid.",

Today I'm going to enjoy the day, get some things done around the house, and then tonight enjoy a glass of wine, a nice supper, and soaking in the hot tub! Life is good! I now have a better idea on where this cluster/mass is--thanks to you Beacon! No freaking out here--GottaloveNed. I have taken your advice and read up on the procedure. I just don't like needles--lol!",
