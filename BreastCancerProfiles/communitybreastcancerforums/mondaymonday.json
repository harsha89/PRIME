I wasn't overly concerned about it myself, as I have fibrocystic breasts and just figured it was a cyst. But then a friend was diagnosed with breast cancer and I selfishly thought of my own lump, so... I went. My Dr said that she wasn't too concerned about the lump, as it felt like other areas of my breast, but since I thought it was new and it is larger than the others, she would send me for a mammogram and ultrasound,just to be cautious and put my mind at ease (she really is a great dr). But then, as she's doing the exam, (and you'll have to forgive me because this kind of threw me for a loop, me being pretty sure I was just coming in for a cyst, and I can't quite remember what she said) she says something like, there are other areas that are more concerning, like this right here - and she had me feel an area that i had never even noticed before under my breast. I think it was right after this (but my mind could be playing tricks) she repeated that she would send me for the mammogram and ultrasound and that i should make an appt with a surgeon for a week or two after the tests (she said 'she's a good one - she won't cut unless she really feels it's necessary' or something like that). I'm sure this is standard, but in my head, I've made it into a huge thing. The problem is, I can't remember where this area is exactly and I am worried I won't be able to point it out at the ultrasound (or that I'll point out the wrong thing). My question is this, do they do an ultrasound of the entire breast, or just the areas I point out? Sorry for the long post - ever since my appt, my thoughts are so scattered. I'm not good at not worrying :[ Thanks so much for reading. Log in to post a reply",
