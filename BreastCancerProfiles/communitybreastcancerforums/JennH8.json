I was so nervous to look at myself. Had a good cry beforehand from nerves and being scared but once I got that out I took a look. Honestly, not as bad as I thought. I had immediate reconstruction with implants, so I think that helped. I also took a reeducation in size going from a DD to what my PS thinks will end up being a C cup, which he also mentioned is much more proportionate to my body, which is true. So I got a good look at my new \"baby boobs\" as I'm calling them, and even though there is still quite a bit of swelling, especially on my right, which is a bit irregular looking on the side under my arm, they're actually kind of cute for lack of a better word. I think I had looked at so many pre and post mastectomy pictures over the past few months, I had a good idea of what I would see, so that helped too. Glad that step is over. Lisa, we have children. Hubby and I have 2 girls together ages 21 and 15. He also has a son from a previous marriage who is 30 and is married with two girls of his own who are 2-1/2. They've all handled this a bit differently. My stepson and DIL, call and come by often to check on how I'm doing. They've been very supportive. Our oldest daughter has been my rock since day 1. She's always been very positive and reassuring. Her only breakdown was when I was debating keeping my nipples or not. The thought that I might possibly keep some breast tissue and up my risk, although minimal, really scared her. Our youngest had a complete breakdown when she was told. That was worse than receiving my diagnosis honestly. I felt horrible seeing her that way, and she needed a lot of reassurance that I wasn't going anywhere. She's doing good now. I think keeping a good attitude around her helps tremendously. Babs, I am so sorry you're having to go through that with your son. I'm thinking a lot may be fear with lack of knowledge and/or misinformation. I hope he comes around eventually for you. {{hugs}} Jacquie, I'm sorry to hear your pathology wound up differently than you thought, but I hope your able to find a treatment you're comfortable with. I have not seen an oncologist yet. My BS referred me to one yesterday and I should be getting an appt. scheduled today. I'm stage I as well with no node involvement and clear margins. I'm interested to find out what they recommend for me. I'm sorry if I'm missing anyone. I still need to go back and read posts. I'm doing all this on my phone, which presents a challenge within itself. :) I hope everyone has a peaceful, pain free day today. Will check in later.",

Lili, you sound like you're having quite a bit more pain than I am with a similar surgery although I had them go down in size on me, so not sure if that's the difference. They took about 800 cc of tissue and put in implants that are 480 cc. I'm actually feeling really good today. I had the longest stretch of sleep last night that I've had so far, which was nice. I'm scheduled to see my PS today. Yes, on Sunday. :) He's going to be out of town for a few days, and wanted to see me before he left. Sounds like I may have 2 of my drains pulled, which I'm excited and nervous about. I'm worried about pain. I'm sorry to read about those of you having so much pain still and other issues. I hope you're able to figure things out so you can get some comfort soon.",

I went out of the house for the first time yesterday and was saying how cold my neck was! Don't know how people with short hair do it. Brrrrrrr",
