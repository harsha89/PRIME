    "Content": "Catbuster wrote: Does anyone know what chemotherapy is best for Stage 1 breast cancer when the patient has pre-existing idiopathic sensory neuropathy in her feet (for 3 years), fibromyalgia, and heat intolerance (I still get hot flashes even though I have been menopausal for 20 years)? My doctor is recommending TC. From what I have read on reliable and trustworthy websites, any taxane, like the taxotere in TC, can cause neuropathic side effects. But these websites never mention a word about chemo patients who have PRE-EXISTING neuropathy! Common sense tells me that my neuropathy stands a good chance of getting worse, or much worse, with chemo. Dx 7/20/2013, IDC, 1cm, Stage I, Grade 3, 0/2 nodes, ER+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
