A hysterectomy took care of the uterine cancer, but now I am dealing with deciding the treatment for the breast cancer. I live in the Washington, DC area/Northern Virginia. I'm looking for a breast center/surgeon for a second opinion. Does anyone have any recommendations or positive or negative to help me decide where to go? I've met with a breast surgeon (who diagnosed me), had the genetics testing (awaiting the results), and a breast MRI. Any thoughts anyone can provide is GREATLY appreciated. My head is spinning!
