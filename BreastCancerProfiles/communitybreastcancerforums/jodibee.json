As a nurse and cancer patient myself I know of many stories where breast cancer was not caught by the routine test but was caught by a MRI. My mother was also diagnosed with breast cancer and was thought to have a tiny area in her left breast and was going to have lumpectomy however her onocologist ordered an MRI which showed two more even smaller spots and her treatment changed to mastectomy. Thank goodness for the MRI, It just may have saved her life!",
