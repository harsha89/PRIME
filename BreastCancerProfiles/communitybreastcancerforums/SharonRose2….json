That procedure was not as bad as I thought, but the waiting for the results is torture! I am welded to my cell phone and waiting, waiting, for what I am afraid will be not the news I'm hoping for. Pamphlet says results in 2-3 business days. Just venting. Thanks!",

Also, I'm 69 so the statistics about 25 year risks of BC with ALH are kind of interesting for realistic me as between my (controlled) hypertension, osteoporosis, and who knows what else, it's just a race to see what gets me in the end! By the way, I did access my VASB pathology report just now which was headlined with HIGH RISK BENIGN. I am going to try to put this out of my mind until July 25 when I see the surgeon. Take care!",

Radiologist just called and it is a sort of good news, and less than good news situation. The vacuum assisted needle biopsy pathology report did NOT show cancer (whew), but resulted in Atypical Lobular Hyperplasia. So I need to see a BS and get a surgical biopsy. But I can handle that as from what the MD said, it's a risk factor which means more monitoring which I am more than motivated to pursue. I am just glad to get the dx and move forward from there. Was dreading another day of not knowing. At this point I'm not catastrophizing as to what the surgical biopsy might find. Will save my Ativan for that scene! Needless to say, the MD, while very considerately spelling all the terms in ALH, did not need to as I had read just about everything about biopsied calcifications that I could find all week! Thanks again! Will give it back, I promise.",

Radiologist did say it would be probably Friday to get the report which is of course a more generous timeline than the paperwork said. Of course, can't do anything until after the long weekend anyway (but be stressed to the max!). I do have Ativan on hand but am saving it for when I am really a basket case. I was originally supposed to have the biopsy next Monday July 3 so I keep telling myself it could have waited until then, but I was able to call another affiliated location and get an earlier time. Sigh! Thanks again.",

Haven't seen pathology but did just make an appointment with a breast surgeon for later July as that was the earliest available. This is called incidental and one foci of ALH according to the nurse navigator to whom I spoke. But I am prepared for whatever happens. This is getting to be my approach since this started with a screening mammo right before Memorial Day. And yet I for sure know there are others facing thousands times more serious and concerning disease and procedures, so am feeling grateful right now.",

Of course I don\u2019t know how old you are, but that is my experience. Would you consider a second opinion on whether you need to continue the MRIs? I wish you the very best with your health and in 2018!",
