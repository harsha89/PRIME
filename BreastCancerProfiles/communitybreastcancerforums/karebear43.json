I finally accepted the fact that I will lose my hair (bought two wigs), but not knowing how I am going to feel physically or mentally is agnoizing. I was fine until I toured the ONC clinic and it just made it real for me. The onc did prescribe Ativan, but not many. I've been very depressed and am finding myself sleeping more than normal. I just want to get the first treatment over with. Once I do that, then I know what I'll be facing.",

The surgery part of this was a piece of cake for me and I had three of those. I was never scared, which is odd. The only part of surgery that was hard was the waiting for the results. This time though, it's with all the side effects that freak me out.",
