I had a clear MRI and mammogram 6 months ago with some new calcifications on my right breast. they recommended a follow up mammogram which i had last week. the follow-up showed some new calcifications so they recommended a stereotatic biopsy. today the radiologist said he could see a mass near the calcifications so maybe they could do the biopsy with ultrasound, but when they looked with ultrasound they could not locate the mass again. so we proceeded with the stereotatic biopsy. now i'm worried about what this mass could be. if i had a clear mri six months ago, could i have invasive cancer now? my doctor said at the worst more calcifications could mean DCIS now i'm worried i'm hearing mixed messages and i'm really scared as i wait for my biopsy results. what else could this mass be? why would it show up on the mammogram and not the MRI or ultrasound? could something bad have grown in such a short amount of time?",
