MRI showed: Heterogeneous circumscribed Lobulated Mass of 1.5 cm. Biopsy being done this week. Also behind it a non mass enhancement of 1.2 cm. BIRADS 4. Which of these words are not so bad. Radiologist said it's a very high probability of it being benign. Anyone know this exact wording, please? Biopsy is being done with MRI probably using vacuum. Could they take out a 1.5cm lesion? Or they will just biopsy it? We'd like to be prepared. Thank you all. Log in to post a reply",

So much has happened, my daughter's Dani, biopsy report came back, her primary is still BC, but the status on her HER2 changed from negative to positive. Also, we got back the Foundation One results, it seems she has 5 therapies she could try. 2 she is on, which they changed her immediately to, Herceptin/Perjeta she is also on Abraxane, and now they say she could maybe try Lapatinib,Emtansine, and Kadcycla. Did anyone try these?? You heard about it? Didn't speak to onc yet, and we have to still see what's the best path, and where they are doing these trials. Next wk we have an appointment with a 2nd opinion, so maybe we'll get smarter. She has been in quite a lot of pain, onc says it could be inflamation from new treatment? and she is down to 90LBs, even for her it's a bit much. She is petite, but...onc wants ME to encourage her to eat, yeah, i am the mom, it doesn't work! She had Gamma Knife radio to the sphenoid bone, last week, it was not too bad, now she does have some after pain. And next week, she is going for radiation to the femur, rad doc decided it was too chancy to just walk around like that. She ain't too happy about that, because it's basically everyday going to the city, and trying to make it back before the kids come home, she knows i'll be there for them, BUT she wants to be there. It's a marathon. We are going there for the weekend, try to diffuse some of all our anxiety. K, friends, so sorry i missed all the convos going on, i will try to follow. So that everyone knows, Foundation One partnered with a service, that if a person wants and sends the report to them, they could help you find where the clinical trials are for your situation, it's called Emergingmed, very efficient. If anyone has any advise, i am on the ready to listen. Thanks Log in to post a reply",

Right at the first mamo she was found to have fine linear microcalcifications, after sono and biopsy it showed it was benign. Since then she has a mamo once a yr, and either MRI or sono every 6 months. My question is should a mamo be done every 6months also? I know they are not reliable in itself in such cases, but i am anxious if anything could be missed. If anyone had this experience or advice i would much appreciate. Also, i have another daughter that also went for diagnostic mamo and it showed sclerosing adenosis, also after biopsy of something caught on sono. She is 25 now. What is the protocol then. Having this tough family experience with my fist daughter, she has METS now, i am truly freaked out, to be honest. Doc Rad it's just a fluke, no BRCA gene. Thank you Log in to post a reply",

Many varieties, it got a little better, less uptakes on Pet-Ct's. But then last month Pet-CT went crazy, mets in most every bone, spine, pelvic area, ribs, shoulders, and what really freaked me out quite large ones in the skull area. So Halaven, Xgeva were started 2wks on, one off, and then one more, and onc was told not much got better. So today, she was put on Abraxane, and the onc wants prob a biopsy of the bone, she doesn't know yet which one, (she is letting the biopsy doc decide, (which kind of doc actually does the biopsies, do u know?)), and also took blood to be analyzed in a molecule level. Is anybody out there familiar with this at all?? Could you explain it to me? And did you have it done? What is this all about?? Kinda lost and sad. Onc says it's serious....hmmm like what do u mean??
