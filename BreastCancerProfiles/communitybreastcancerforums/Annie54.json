      "Content": "May 28, 2013 08:31PM - edited May 28, 2013 08:33PM by Annie54 Hi Alibeths, The treatment itself is not bad. As I have said on other boards...I think of it as a \"spa day\" as I'm stretched out on a heated recliner with warm blankets, offered food and drink, fussed over by the nurses, and get to watch netflex movies on my computer. Even get a nap in! At our cancer center they infuse you with the \"pre-meds\" before the chemo drugs and they usually include anti-nausea meds, steroids, benydral and ativan which is also an anti-nausea drug but also an anti-anxiety med. Believe me, you are feeling pretty floaty during the procedure - that is why they want someone else to drive you home afterward. I asked them in subsequest infusions to lower the benydral as I showed no allergic reaction to the chemo and I wanted to be clear headed enough to drive myself home. They were happy to do that. My onc had me start taking pre-meds that he perscribed the day before chemo. These included a steroid, claritan (for bone pain from neulasta shot given day after infusion), and an over the counter anti-acid (Prilosec or Zantac). I take the steroid the day before chemo and then for 3 days after chemo.I take Zofran starting the day after chemo for 3 days for nausea to be piggybacked with ativan and or compazine if I need more nausea control. Honestly, the Zofran worked great and I was never nauseated so I didn't need additional meds for that. I did take the Ativan (my new best friend) at night to help me sleep. The steroids can have you wide awake all night otherwise. Indigestion was my one of my worst SE and rolaids took care of it but I'm now taking the anti-acid daily to try and beat it to the punch. I also took stool softeners starting the day before chemo and for a week after to counter any constipation and had immodium on hand when I had a couple of days of diarrhea. After a week I was able to stop all the meds except claritan which I kept using due to my allergies. I know it sounds like a lot of pills and a confusing regimine...but its really not bad once you've been through one round. Everyone is different to how they react to chemo and the pre-meds but it is doable and I've found not nearly as scary or horrible as I was anticipating. You can do this! Ask you onc about pre-meds - he should be perscibing them for you with a schedule of what to take when. Make sure he gives you ativan! As good as any xanax I've taken! Good luck!",

I'm having #6 of my TCH tomorrow (Yea done!). I asked the onc about 4 vs 6 treatments as a curiosity because I had read on these boards some gals were doing 4. He told me he always does 6 treatments for his patients - which was fine by me because I want to throw as much at this beast as I can. Perhaps your onc recommended 4 because of the small size of your tumor.Â For very small tumors they will let you forgo chemo all together. HER2+ is a sneaky aggressive cancer thoughÂ and I was told because of it I would be doing the full chemo.",

My kids tell me I seem much happier now - since they see me car dancing to the goo goo dolls when taking them to school :) My doc suggested I start doing easy crossword puzzles (not the NY times!) as you have to \"reach back\" in your brain to find the answers. She says that helps retrain your brain to access words from your memory. That makes sense to me so I've started doing just that. I'm also going to enjoy the last couple of weeks of my vacation from the AI.....sigh, still have at least 4 years to go on it but I'm going to insist on an anti-depressant to go along with it.

She's not a big fan of aquaphor as she says it clogs up in the pores. She ok'ed it for night time use as long as I washed it off in the morning. I also use pure aloe from the plant. I found a large aloe leaf (2 ft by about 6 inches) at whole foods in the produce section for $3.99. I cut a big chunk, strip the skin from one side and put it all over my breast. It has no smell and sinks into the skin fast. Must be helping because I've done 23 of 25 whole breast radiation treatments and will start my 8 boosts on Friday...... my skin is pink....nipple has turned gray in color with large brown freckles on it and my under arm is a bit sore - but otherwise I've done well. No major pain or fatigue. RO said skin could keep changing for 2 weeks past radiation (peeling etc) but should calm down and be getting back to normal at 1 month posts rads. Good luck! Annie",

While the taste buds are funky I eat alot of soups, dill pickles and watermelon. These seem to taste the best to me....and anything spicy. Chinese food also tastes good so maybe try some spicey Kung Pao chicken! Hopes this helps! Annie",

Also, I didn't have the infamous \"taxotere tearing\" during chemo....but it came on like gangbusters after chemo was finished (4 months ago) and I still have tears running down my face most days. Have to lay off the eye makeup as everything smears and runs! I didn't have eye pain, but my eyes stung a lot in the mornings so I put lubricating eye drops in - which helped. I had excellent eyesight before dx and am pissed how blurry everything is now, Trying to be patient for the world to come into focus again. Annie",

Lots of fatigue, indigestion, no taste buds. I felt like I was crawling across the finish line. But I want you to know that within 1 month after chemo I was feeling 100% better....not all at once but a little better each day. I have had some \"latent\" SE's which have shown up after finishing chemo (Taxtoere is famous for these)....such as toe nails falling off and some finger and toe nueropathy. None of which have been too bad though. My energy is almost back to normal and I feel good again - so it does get better. I know its tough when you are in the middle of treatment to believe that. We are here for you - ask any questions you'd like and we will surround you with love and support. Annie",

Just so sick and tired of the effects, the waiting to feel better, to feel normal again. In the 2 years before my dx I had embarked on a fitness program of running, strength training, pilates etc. I did some physical activity every day, lost 50 ilbs and got in great shape. Felt on top of the world.....and then BC. I do think being in good shape helped me in the long run with chemo and SE's as I've had minimal ones and have been able to work every day. But now here at the end, I've gained 30 lbs back and the fatigue is so strong that all I can do is sit and wait until I'm done with chemo before getting active again. I can't even walk now due to shortness of breath. Oh to lace up my running shoes and hit the trails! That's what I focus on being able to do and feel confident that I'll bouce back quickly. But it can be very depressing having to wait while feeling like a blob with muscle aches who cant walk across a room without breathing hard! Heres to finishing the race and getting back to our pre-treatment selfs....or at least to a \"new normal\" for us. I've been told the months in treatment will seem like a dream at some point and hard to remember specifics.......I hope so! Hang in there....we've made it this far with not much farther to go. We'll be OK Annie",

I've been told that Her2 positive re-occurance usually happens in the first 2 years after diagnosis. It is a personal decision but I would throw everything you can at the beast now - because down the road you don't have the choice anymore. Herceptin is a life saver for many of us Her2 positive gals but it doesn't always do the complete job. If you have more in the arsenal, I'd go for it! Annie",
