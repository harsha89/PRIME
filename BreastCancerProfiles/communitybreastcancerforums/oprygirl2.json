I also have a family history of breast cancer on my dad's side.  His mom died from breast cancer and several of his aunts did but were never tested for BRCA, because I don't think it existed then.  So since I am at an increased risk, should I be tested?  What about my health insurance?  If they find out, I'm in trouble and better be finding a tree that grows money.  I have two small children and I would rather have my body mutilated and have a masectomy and hysterectomy than for my kids to grow up without a mom. What should I do?  HELP!!! The sun is always shining beyond the clouds Log in to post a reply",
