That first mammogram is really important because they want to get a good baseline of what your scar tissue looks like for later comparisons.

I started tamoxifen in mid-December and did rads throughout January. It was no big. The only thing I didn't like is not knowing what was what. What I mean is, if I was tired or whatever, I didn't know if it was the tamoxifen or the radiation. Now that I am 11 days out from radiation I think my energy level was affected by the rads but my sleeping has actually improved with tamoxifen. I have no idea why that is but I am sleeping A LOT better. Everyone: I wish you good outcomes! I hope the treatments fly and you are on the other side of this step in no time at all.",

Congratulations to those who have finished and godspeed to those who are just starting or in the middle!! And warm thoughts for healing to those who are dealing with (lingering) harsh side effects. I am one of those whose rads experience was pretty uneventful. In fact, my left boob (which was always a smidgen bigger and saggier than my right one) now looks just a bit better for the lumpectomy + the firming of the rads. Depending on how the pinkish/reddish/brown of my skin where I had the boosters (I had 23 whole breast + 7 boosts) heals up, the girls may match better than they ever did before.... Stay mindful of your body and of creeping fatigue. And just stay in the batter's box and keep swinging. You can do it.",

My boob is a little pinker/tanner (and maybe a bit firmer) than it used to be, but otherwise, it is pretty much the same. Actually, to be honest, it looks better than it ever did. My left breast was always a little bigger and flabbier than my right. So, with the lumpectomy and rads, right now my boobs match in a way they never did before. My question is, if things are going to get much worse than they are, would that have happened by now? Or might it happen at any time...?",

I had an itch on my ear lobe but did not dare move. As they started to mark me up I just started cracking up laughing. LOL. What on earth?

One thing I hadn't thought of that I have noticed in surveying this message board is that some women start chemo and don't finish. Even if you agree to start chemo (or really any treatment) you are still in control of your own treatment. When my MO and I discussed chemo she said that the key is to remember that you will always feel different when it is over because you have aged during the process. So, you never will be \"back\" to the you you were. It sounded like she was suggesting that I trade in a year of my life as a 50 year old for many more years of my life as an older woman. I don't know how I felt about that. (Ultimately my score was too low to justify that exchange...). But anyway, the point is, keep in mind that your ability to make decisions doesn't end if you agree to chemo or anything else. And you never know how things are going to be until you give them a try.",

Anyway after my biopsy but before I got the results, I told him that the doctor said it probably was cancer. And he said, \"OH! I just hope it is Stage 1. Really try to have Stage 1.\" I have no idea where he got that. So, then before my surgery I actually drew him a diagram of the lumpectomy and sentinel node excision and what those would involve. He asked questions and I answered them as honestly as I could. After that talk he thanked me for being honest with him. He knows that now I am having radiation and we have discussed what that involves and how it works. I know he's been afraid but he has been a real champ. We also told his teacher and the principal of his school. We just wanted to be sure that folks there knew in case he was not himself.",
