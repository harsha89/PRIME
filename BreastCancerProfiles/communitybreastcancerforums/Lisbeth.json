This is if you had reconstruction, or parts of reconstruction, done some time after lymph node surgery...Â  I notice one 2010 study titled Breast Reconstruction and Lymphedema, authored by DW Chang, that says that the lymphedema risk is low after delayed autologous reconstruction (using body's own tissue), but I want to know if you all feel that that's an accurate statement. Same abstract also says that \"in patients who developed lymphedema following a mastectomy, delayed autologous reconstruction may help reduce the severity of lymphedema.\" Interesting... I always wonder about this in case I need to have my implant replaced later down the line (knocking on wood). Have you heard anything in your experience that contradicts this study info?
