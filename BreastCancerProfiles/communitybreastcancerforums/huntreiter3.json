After the first night of trying to sleep with it I remember wanting to dig it out myself & give up treatment right then. Now I don't like having the big lump with an ugly scar on it but they say we'll appreciate having it later. My first chemo. is on Wednesday and I did get the RX for the emla cream & will be bringing along something to suck on. My thoughts are with you.",

I have had a day or two on occasion after tx where something tasted different but it always came right back. I kind of wished they had died so I would stop stress eating! Eybrows & lashes started thinning between tx 4&5 for me but if I use mascara & brow pencil no one has been able to tell unless they get really up close to look. I'm hoping I keep what I have left.",

My treatment will be TCH every 21 days x 6 & Herceptin weekly for 1 year. Port is already in place. I already have my RX for my wig so ready to start shopping for that. Not shaving my head until it starts falling out in clumps. Not sure if I want to do it at a salon or with my family at home. Anyone want to share their choices on how you plan on doing it when the time comes? I hate that we all have to become friends this way but I'm so glad to have friends to go through this with.",
