Now the sinus pressure and pain, running nose and bloody discharge happen after every infusion. Loved the \"horrible wig\" stories. I bought one inexpensive one online and when I put it on, I laughed out loud. It was long, curly, blonde and layered. I looked like a stripper or pole dancer! I bought several more from a local shop and the cosmetologist offered to trim it. It looks a lot better now, with bangs, the pieces around my face trimmed and overall length shortened. One day I was in the grocery store, bending over the bakery products, when the bakery employee said, \"Oh, your hair is so shiny and beautiful.\" I told her I had breast cancer, and she started crying. We exchanged names, and now I have a new friend. And Saturday, I was in another store, when the woman waiting on me said, \"Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?\" I was sure she had spotted my wig and was going to ask about cancer. But no, what she said was, \"Your hair is about the same length as mine. Can you tell me where you get it cut?\" I lifted it up, and told her I was going through chemo. She was very sweet. So there are some uplifting wig stories out there. Just keep trying until you find one that works for you. (I still hate wearing it. It's hot and itchy, and it's the middle of winter. I don't know what I'll do this summer.)  Alison, good luck on your first treatment today. Whatever SE you experience, you'll find someone on this thread or another one who has had the very same SE and can help you through them.  Have a good week, everyone! ",

As I mentioned in a post on another thread today, I'm heading out for T/C #3 today, and I'm worried that the SE will be the worst this time. And count me in on hating being bald. I find that I am now obsessed with other women's beautiful hair. I was in a deli yesterday frequented by college students, and oh, their long, beautiful thick hair! I was so jealous. One of the worst things is knowing how long it will take to regrow to its previous shoulder length, and worrying whether it will be thinner or grayer. It will really piss me off to have to continue to wear a wig long after chemo is over. ",

The steroids are still in my system, I have energy and the anti-nausea meds are keeping that awful SE at bay. After the first treatment, I had 4 good days before the \"hit-by-a-bus\" feeling hit me. After the second and third treatments, that feeling hit on Day #3. You might want to have a back-up plan, just in case, like reading while sitting instead of standing. But I have a feeling you'll be OK and can enjoy and celebrate that wonderful accomplishment. FLDreamer, I've read on some other posts of women who have had severe ringing in their ears after treatment. What I've experienced is the sound of blood pumping in my ears, a whoosh-whoosh that is annoying. Others have mentioned their hearing being more sensitive, too.

Mine hasn't been as severe as yours, but I have the pins-and-needles feeling (more like knives sometimes!) in my feet and hands, very sensitive fingertips, and some loss of sensation in several toes and fingers. My MO knows about it, and we'll talk before my 4th and final infusion on Tuesday. Of all the SE, the neuropathy and fatigue are the only ones that have lingered every day through the chemo cycle. Hope you continue to feel relief! Ladies, on head coverings, I have been quite happy with the wigs and hats I bought from the American Cancer Society's TLC catalogue. My favorite is the fringe of hair that I wear underneath the caps and hats to make it appear that I am not bald. It's like short hair attached to a headband; it gives me bangs and a halo of hair, without the heat and heaviness of a full wig. ",

The night sweats have been especially annoying. I've gotten so I lay out a fresh set of pj's every night, with a towel, so if I wake up soaked, I can walk into the bathroom, wipe off with the towel, put on fresh pj's and get back into bed without turning on a light, almost without even opening my eyes.

I felt invisible; I felt like I looked like my own mother. First, I tried at-home semi-permanent color. Nothing. I had an appointment with a new stylist Tuesday (my old one disappeared in the year when I had no need of one). I showed her pix of the \"old me.\" She said she'd have to use a darker base than I was used to to fully cover the steel gray in back. It came out really dark, and I was almost in tears. She said she would add highlights but didn't have time that day, so we made an appointment for yesterday. I showed up, to find that she had gotten sick, so they rescheduled me for today. My hair was too short for foils, so she had to pull out that antique rubber cap. After all that, though, the highlights were barely visible. She said we'd try foil after all, even though it was difficult. Then it still was a little dark, so she combined some stuff with shampoo to lighten me a bit. Well, after 5 hours in the salon and three visits there, I can now say that I no longer have gray hair. Or dark brown hair. It's still not where I want it, but by the time I go again, it should be longer and easier to use foils.  I never imagined losing our hair and trying to get it back would be so hard!!    ",

Many predict that some version of cold caps will become routine in the future, since hair loss magnifies women's sense of loss and feeling like a cancer patient.",

Often they have wigs donated by former cancer patients, and you can get them free. Or check to see whether your hospital or cancer center has a shop on location offering products for cancer patients. I got a nice wig at my cancer center's shop, and a nearby stylist trimmed it to my liking for free. I also ordered reasonably priced wigs from the American Cancer Society's TLC catalog (also online) and several wigs from e-wigs.com. E-wigs will send you a ring of color samples for a small charge, then refund your money when you send the samples back. That's a good way to check color before ordering. For all my wigs, I've had a professional stylist trim them to suit me.  IMHO, the natural hair wigs are not worth the money. I bought one expensive human-hair wig, and it's my least favorite. It's not as shiny and I never found a way to really style it.  I also highly recommend the \"Look Good, Feel Better\" program offered by the ACS. You get oodles of nice cosmetics (high-end brands) and good suggestions on using the makeup. ",

Great, huh? But she suggested  that after I got through with chemo and rads, she could give me some collagen fillers and other treatments to try to soften all these new wrinkles.

I look like an old man.  I'm glad so many others had good luck with radiation, and little or no burning. I have very fair, sensitive skin and, despite using the RO-prescribed gel every day, I got a very severe radiation burn on the breast and chest. Even the rad techs said they felt sorry for me and hated to give me more rads. It was quite painful. I finally went to my dermatologist and she prescribed a high-powered cream for burns that helped immensely and, of course, it began to get better once rads were over. OK, now I want to know about Biotin or anything else that will speed up hair growth...Everyone, please share!! ",

I look in the mirror and see my mother. I feel invisible. Nobody recognizes me. So I finally decided to color it. I was worried about peroxide or ammonia, so first I tried a dark blonde shade of the Roux Fanci-Full rinse-out color. Nothing. Not a hair changed. I went back and bought a Clairol professional Soy 4-Plex semi-permament color -- dark blonde/light brown -- mixed it and left it on the maximum 45 minutes (which it said for coverage of gray). Again, almost no effect whatsoever. Maybe some of my near-white hair is a muddier gray, but that's only on one side of my head, where the hair is the softest.  I think it's time to go back to a professional. Do you think it's safe? What will it take to turn my steel gray-to-almost-white head of 2-inch curls into a straight, shoulder-length head of blonde hair?? (A wig, I know!!!) I was just kidding about the last part, but what will it take to turn me blonde again, and is it safe?  (Plus I went so long without needing a hairdresser that when I finally went to the salon for a neck trim, my stylist was no longer there and they wouldn't tell me where he went. So now I have to look for someone new.) Had I had any idea how long and sad this hair process would be, I would have gone through the hassle of Cold Caps in a minute.

(I took a bag of my old hair with me. Very sad.) My hair was so short the stylist couldn't use foils and had to pull hair through that gross rubber cap. As for stress, I know from experience, and the scientific research backs up the fact that stress can lower your immune system and wreak havoc on your body. After an especially stressful six-month period of my life (death of ex-spouse, child graduating from high school and going to college, selling 2 homes (including ex-spouse's and all his belongings) and buying one with fiance, moving,marrying and getting a huge job promotion), I developed extreme panic attacks and, within 13 months, had two major surgeries, one for colon cancer, one for compressed spinal cord. Myleftboob, congrats on geting rid of that 230-pound stressor!!",

I will have TCx4, starting on 12/20, so let me know if anyone else is on that schedule. I see ckk starts 12/22. Your comments make me nervous about SE, but they also are reassuring. When I encounter something, I'll know I'm not the first or only one, that there's usually something to counter-act it and that better days will come. With my first treatment on 12/20, I'm worried about how I'll feel on Christmas. I usually host a family dinner party on Christmas Eve, with turkey and all the fixings. You think this year maybe I should plan to order pre-cooked stuff from Whole Foods rather than trying to cook all that myself? Give me your best tips on what I should stock up on before Treatment 1, and what I should take beforehand. I know I need to drink lots of water before, during and after to flush out the chemicals. I've read that Claritin helps, but I'm not sure what that's for. What do you suggest I have on hand for constipation (I HATE that!) And someone suggested Prevacid. I ended up choosing chemo, even though my tumor was small, with clear margins, and my Oncotype score was 8. I did have micromets, which means my MO considers me node-positive, although I know some would not. She said I could forego chemo but she recommended it, so here I am, nervous as all get-out. I'm going to look at wigs today. I considered cold caps, but I'm not sure I can deal with all the logistics of that, especially since it's just my husband and me. Any tips on buying wigs? Anything else? I can't tell you how wonderful it is to have so many new friends online.

This is now my favorite thread, since we're all going through the same experiences at the same time.  I'm a shopaholic, but shopping for a wig yesterday was a real downer. When the cosmetologist put that skull cap on me, I got my first preview of what I'm going to look like without hair. I've told everyone that I don't care about losing my hair, that it's worth it to help fight a recurrence, but I have to admit that it does. I know it will grow back, that it's just temporary, but it will take a couple of years for it to get as long as it is now. Like others, I'm really nervous about the side effects. Some of you, like Leesa, who look so young and strong, are still battling troubling, aggravating effects. It's so weird, feeling great now, but knowing that off and on for the next six months at least, I'll have periods of feeling really lousy. Scariest of all, Leesa, is hearing that DietCoke no longer appeals to you. I've never had a cup of coffee in my life, but I have DietCoke every morning for breakfast. I couldn't get through the day without that caffeine. I'm in the South, of course, so it's not all that unusual. But when I used to travel on business, especially in places like NYC, the waiters would be very confused when I ordered DietCoke for breakfast. I often took to carrying my own, in my purse. Kim, good luck today! Let us know how the first one went. Ckk, I know I felt better once I finally decided to go with chemo. Thought it interesting that your MO expected a high Oncotype score with your grade 3 tumor. Mine was grade 3 also, and I even had one positive node, so I had predicted that my score would be between 21 and 31. Amazingly, it came back an 8. I still opted for the chemo. So here we are!

I bought a small, table-sized one on Amazon and have not woken up with a dry nose or sinus headache since then. It was an unbelievably good investment.  HeathrerB, good luck today with your infusion. What number is this for you?  I agree with everyone who says they're sick and tired of being sick and tired. I spent most of Friday afternoon, and all day Saturday and Sunday in bed. Sour stomach, sour mouth, tired, achy, no appetite. Again having trouble drinking because everything, even water, tastes so awful. I don't want to end up back at the infusion suite getting IV saline. I've tried coconut water (yuk), popsicles(too sweet), tea (love it usually but just tastes bad). Don't even mention Gatorade; I couldn't stand that when I was well. Anyone have any ideas for how to stay hydrated without throwing up??  New week...let's hope we're all on the upswing this week. About time!!! ",

And I like the way you ended your post: \"Find joy in your day.\" I think that's a good reminder for me -- to find something positive in even the darkest days, if it's just marking off one more day until these treatments are over. Thanks, too, for the cancer 800 number; I didn't know about it either. GracieG, like you, I'm wondering whether #3 will be better or worse than #2. Sometimes I'm right there with you, wondering how in the world I can get through 2 more of these. I know about the fatigue and tears hitting you, too. On one of my \"good\" days, I decided to run into a store to pick up a few things. Midweek, I figured the little shop would be fairly empty. No, it was having a sale and was packed. Only one checkout line was open. I stood in line for a while but then just couldn't stand another minute, put down my items, went to the car, closed the door and just cried.  Heatherb, congratulations on getting Nito. What a wonderful companion and distraction. They say animals can sense when someone is ill or depressed and stay close.  Josie, you and I really are on the same track, with both our treatments and the SE. Just like you, these past few days have been good for me,  and I'm going to make the most of this coming week before my next treatment on 1/31.  For all of you, may today be better than yesterday. ",

For a few lovely weeks, I was sleeping like a baby -- until I told the oncology nurse that I was taking 2 Ativan before bedtime. She said I couldn't keep doing that, that it could become addictive and that I shouldn't use it on top of the anti-depressant they were giving me. Now I'm on a sleeping pill, but I don't sleep as well as with the Ativan. Very, very vivid dreams! (Gracie, I was taking 10 mg of Ativan, so you've got a long way to go before you get to that level.) Bela, I agree with HeatherB that, no matter how awful our side effects, we are committed to doing everything possible to keep this disease at bay. Like you, I have had horrible diarrhea. Before my first treatment, I was prepared for the opposite reaction, constipation, and had loaded up on all sorts of laxatives. Imagine my surprise when diarrhea hit several times an hour.  I ended up with such dehydration that I had to go in for two bags of IVs. My doc then put me on Immodium and Nexium, so it's been much less severe. After suggesting that we add our treatment schedules to our signatures, I don't think I did it right myself. Ckk and Heatherb, help me out. Where did you add it on the \"my home\" page?  T/Cx4 12/20;1/11;1/31;2/21",

When you were talking about taking 1 mg of Ativan, I replied that I was taking 10 mg. I looked at the bottle last night and each pill was .5 mg, not 5 mg, so I was taking 1 mg, not 10.   Rachel, we're proud of you for your participation in \"Pirates of Penzance\" despite your chemo. Have you told us what instrument you play?  Glad you had a good birthday with your parents. Ckk, yes, we've all been down there in that black hole with you. Mine is a little deeper and lasts a little longer every cycle. You feel so alone, while your friends and, seemingly, the rest of the world goes about their happy way. I got especially depressed when I looked at what used to be some of my favorite women's magazines. Articles about fashion, about how to organize your time, where to vacation, ads for hair color, razors and shaving cream, shampoos and conditioners, mascara, creams to minimize wrinkles, to take '10 years off.\" It seems like they're written in a foreign language now. I'm no longer one of those women. They don't get me. I can't remember whether your MO prescribed an anti-depressant for you or not. I'm on one, and I think it helps...at least some. I imagine I would be worse without it. Regardless, just keep in mind that we're all here to listen and that you just need to get through one day at a time and eventually this will be over. BTW, I, too, keep having twinges and aches in the OTHER breast. In fact, it was that breast that I asked my ob/gyn about when I went for my annual exam in September.  She couldn't feel anything unusual in either one. It was my regularly scheduled mammo 2 weeks later that discovered the tumor in my right one.  After my DX, the BS scheduled an MRI for me on BOTH breasts, and the left one showed up clear. I can't imagine that something has popped up there since then, and with chemo. But I'll ask about it. Like Heatherb, I'm really fatigued but the terrible mouth taste has backed off. I was still awake at 1:30 this morning, despite my sleeping pill. I finally took an Ativan. Treatment #3 a week from today. Ugh. This is so much tougher than I imagined. Naive me, I thought that nausea was the big issue with chemo and now the docs give you anti-nausea meds, so I expected to feel bad maybe the day of and after treatment. I had no idea how rotten you feel and for how long, That said, today's a good day. My DH and I are going to try for lunch and a movie. Thinking of you all! ",

The past two days were miserable for me, but today I can tell I'm some better, although my legs are shaky and my balance a little off.

I agree with everyone else's recommendations -- wash anything she touched in really hot water, use antiseptic wipes on all surfaces (light switches, toilet handles, doorknobs, too), air out the place. HeatherB, speaking of germs, how are you feeling today? Sore throat worse? Have you called your MO?  Josie, good to hear from you. I'd wondered where you'd been hiding. Yes, you had your infusion on Monday, and I had mine on Tuesday. Funny you should mention being sensitive to noise. I find I'm more sensitive to both odors and noise. I've had to ask my DH to turn down the TV several times.  And I have to hide in the bedroom when he's cooking some of his dinners. I feel bad. I can't ask him to share my diet of baked potatoes and grilled cheese sandwiches, but my nose is VERY sensitive to herbs, spices and such. Also glad you're getting acupuncture. I go every 2 weeks. Ecpelkey, sorry to hear about your fluid beneath the SNB scar. That's a weird one, isn't it? And I felt for you when you said everyone in your household was sick on Thursday and Friday. Don't we get any breaks with this??  I did laugh at the thought of your hair literally blowing off in the wind. I got buzzed before mine got that loose. Also, I'm going to one of those \"Look Good, Feel Better\" classes Monday afternoon. I don't have high expectations. It's the closest substitute I can find for a BC support group. Ckk, I tend to agree that some of us just have a genetic disposition to cancer. Both my parents died of cancer -- lymphoma for my dad, who was just 56, then both colon and lung cancer for my mom. I had colon cancer 14 years ago and have had numerous Mohs surgeries for basal-cell skin cancers (luckily not melanoma, like you had).  My heart races, too. I hear my blood pumping in my ears all the time.  GracieG, my acupuncturist swears by lemon as well, not specifically for cancer but for overall health. She says if she were on a deserted island, the only two things she would want would be lemon and honey. At her suggestion, I've been trying to drink several glasses a day of hot water with lemon. I've been having trouble getting enough liquids and, for some reason, the hot liquids go down more easily than the cold. I just put a glass of water with lemon in the microwave for about a minute. Overall, I've been able to handle sour tastes much more than anything else. I still can't eat sweets or salty foods. Hope everyone has a good day. Who has treatments this week? ",

With one more chemo treatment, then six weeks of radiation, I'm still mentally very much in \"treatment mode.\" I know I will push for as frequent scans as possible. I do know I have a mammogram scheduled by my BS in May, which will be about 6 months from my diagnosis and surgery. Rachel, I imagine your belly button issue is somewhere between the lint ball and melanoma. Maybe a fungus of some kind? An infected hair follicle? A cyst? You'll feel better once you get it checked out. Don't we have enough to worry about without these extra aggravations?? And what a week you've had, first with your BF's keys (did the originals ever show up?) and now this new nuisance.  Heatherb8, I can so relate to the blowup you had with your DH about the dog cage. I'm much more irritable than usual. I had asked my DH to help me unroll and re-roll some large, heavy rugs I was going to take to my daughter. He took one look at them and said they didn't need to be re-rolled, they were fine. I blew up!  As soon as chemo is over, I'm sending my DH away for a month. Seriously. He made the reservations yesterday. We have been stuck in this small house together for four months, with each of us rarely going out. He has been a real dear, cooking every one of my meals, chauffering me to my appointments, doing all the grocery shopping, running to the drug store, washing dishes, taking out the trash, etc. He needs a break. He deserves a break. I think I'll be fine on my own; my daughter lives close by. Today's Day #10 after treatment, so, by the calendar, I should have turned the corner and be feeling good. It's early, and I'm not sure how I feel. Maybe that in itself is a good sign, Take care, all. ",

Hope everything goes smoothly.  I know this is an old gripe, but our discussion of leg and muscle pain reminds me of how little people who haven't been through this understand. So many of my friends assume that hair loss and nausea are the only side effects I have had to deal with. Nobody knows the other agonies you and I have been through -- constipation, diarrhea, thrush, mouth sores, night sweats, hot flashes, acid reflux, racing heartbeat, loss of taste and appetite, sour taste and tummy, insomnia, dry skin, pimples, forgetfulness, irritability, depression, weight gain, dehydration, fevers, bone and muscle pain, extreme fatigue, blown veins, bruises, emotional ups and downs. Hopefully, most of that is behind us now, except for the continuing and frustrating fatigue and bone and muscle pain. We are wounded warriors. We are strong women who have endured these agonies. We will come out of this stronger still. We will vow not just to have our \"old lives\" back but to have new and better lives because of what we've been through, what we know.

I will say that I sure agree with everyone on the wigs being hot and scratchy now that the weather is getting warm. I just ordered some summer ballcaps and other hats from tlc, because I just can't see wearing wigs outside this summer. I have company coming this weekend, and I've already warned them to get used to my being bald because I can't wear a wig inside all the time. I sent my husband away last week (partially as a reward for taking such good care of me during chemo), and I discovered how much I had come to count on him. It really hit me when I made my first run to the grocery store to stock up. Our house is elevated, and there are two flights of steps to get to the front door. I realized that I couldn't get the groceries upstairs! I have to hold on to the railings and pull myself up anyway, and I couldn't do that with bags and bags of groceries. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. I finally had to just leave the non-perishables in the car and take a few of the perishables up each trip, sitting down and resting for 5 minutes between trips. It took me 3 days to get in the groceries! From now on, I'll have to go to the store more frequently and only buy LIGHT things. No more laundry detergent and 12-packs of Diet Coke! Ckk, good luck with simulation today. I start my \"real\" radiation in 45 minutes!! Hope everyone has a good week. ",

There are definitely things in the book I wish I hadn't run across, but the brutal history of earlier surgical and chemical treatments certainly makes me glad we were treated in 2011 and 2012, not the '50s, '60s or '70s. One thing I read just a bit ago did certainly ring true with the emotions many of us have felt: \"Cancer is not a concentration camp (referring to something earlier) but it shares the quality of annihilation: it negates the possibility of life outside and beyond itself; it subsumes all living. The daily life of a patient becomes so intensely preoccupied with his or her illness that the world fades away. Every last morsel of energy is spent tending the disease.\" That supports the feeling of aloneness, of alienation that we all have felt at various times. ",

In fact, I feel so good, so much better that I just didn't want to think about cancer for a while. I woke up one morning recently, after a terrific night's sleep -- no night sweats -- and realized that something felt different. My hip aches and burning thighs were gone. Just like that. Here one day, gone the next. And rads have been a breeze. After 10 treatments, I don't feel a thing, not even a hint of pink.  I also had company for a week, and they just left yesterday. My sister and her husband came to visit to \"take care of me,\" but we ended up having a wonderful visit, doing all sorts of touristy things here in Charleston. We ate out a lot, I had my first wine in 6 months, and I walked a lot, even though I had to stop and rest regularly. Jen: I'm sorry I'm late to the game in congratulating you on your successful surgery and your grit in making that tough decision. The surgery sounds like a real ordeal, with a full 15 hours of surgery and then blood transfusions and the IV problems. I'm glad you're feeling good enough to post, and I sincerely wish you a smooth recovery.  Rachel, thinking about you this weekend, too, and hoping the low point after your last infusion isn't too bad. Just take it a day at a time, and those SE will soon be behind you. Leesa, I applaud you and Ckk for your bike-riding. I'm wondering whether that's something I should consider...easier on the knees and hips and I still am plagued by plantar fasciitis (sp?). I was in PT for that last October when I got my BC DX, so I immediately quit. I had bigger issues to deal with. Despite the upturn in my physical condition, I have the same fears and concerns others of you have expressed. I love Momof3's idea about the shower scanner!!! I wish we could have more aggressive monitoring. I know I will worry about every new ache and pain. Already I'm worrying about a pain in my left breast, the GOOD one. But I have to keep telling myself that I had a BMRI six months ago and that everything was OK then, and since then I've had chemo. And I know there are legions of BC survivors out there, some of my friends and relatives among them. But every day I read obits in the paper for women in their 40s, 50s and 60s who have died from breast cancer. My gut hurts when I read that phrase: \"so-and-so died after a courageous 3-year battle with breast cancer.\" Our local newspaper and TV stations did feature stories on a local 5th grade teacher, wife of a radio talk show host, who had BC, underwent all the treatments and returned to work, only to have it \"return with a vengeance,\" as her husband said, 2 years later. She died at 44, leaving a 9-year-old son. These are the stories that haunt me. Stories of women who did everything we did and have cancer come back so aggressively and so quickly. I just have to tell myself, over and over, that I have done everything I can do to deal with it, and I have to live my life. I'm going to do everything I want to do. I'm not going to put off anything. I don't want to have any regrets today, tomorrow or whenever. Cancer either will or won't come back, no matter what I do. My MO told me that many women experience feelings of doubt and loss after chemo and rads. They feel \"let go\" from their medical support system. There is something reassuring about having all these nurses and doctors see us every few weeks, about having our blood work done regularly, about something listening to our hearts and lungs, about someone asking us if there's anything new or different. It was also reassuring to know that if something even non-BC related came up, there was a doctor to call about it. If I needed a prescription for anything, the MO was there to give it to me. I think there ought to be more support systems for those of us at this stage of our recovery. There might be threads on this topic here on bc.org, but I haven't checked. At least we're all here to help each other. And you're right...we've been through so much...we've come so far... you all mean so much to me!!! I'm off for more activities today with my daughter and her family. Hope everyone has a good Sunday! Love you all!! ",

Like you, I didn't sleep at all the first night. You're right -- the steroids, as both nurses and patients told me. Lisa, welcome to the world of hot flashes! I went through menopause naturally some years ago, but the ones I'm having now, as a result of dropping my hormone replacement therapy, are quite a bit more vicious. They really are annoying. One of my nurses said, \"We can put a man on the moon, but we don't know how to alleviate hot flashes!\" She said two triggers are chocolate and red wine, which just happen to be two of my vices.  Thanks to everyone for their advice and support. I'm 3 days out from my first T/C and feeling a bit low. I want my old life back! The road ahead is long, and I've just started. Right now, I can't see the light at the end of this tunnel. Here I am, feeling not my best at the holiday and waiting for my hair to fall out. Still, things could be worse, right? Hope everyone has a good day and a good holiday! ",

I had my first infusion 12/20, with Neulasta the next day. I was queasy the first few days and achy after the Neulasta, but Claritin and Alleve help, as well as long soaks in the tub. I have no appetite whatsoever, and it's a struggle to try to find anything I want to eat. My lovely family gave me TONS of chocolate candy for Christmas, but I can't eat even one piece. The not-so-lovely diarrhea has hit me hard. I was expecting the opposite, so stocked up on all kinds of laxatives. What's best for this?? Other than that, I'm just tired, with no energy. I sleep a lot now, after no sleep the first two nights. Wednesday, I go for Haircut #1, my first short haircut since I was a teen-ager. That's the precursor to the buzz cut. Like others, I'm wondering whether treatments #2, #3 and #4 will have even more dramatic side effects. Are the effects cumulative?  Betsy, thanks for the TOOLBOX idea. That's my next stop. Hope EVERYONE had a good holiday. At least we made it through it, even though it might have been different from all our others. If you were like me, you were especially appreciative of family and friends. A few days before Christmas, I wrote a dear friend whom I had grown distant from after her husband developed dementia. At the time, I didn't know what to say, so I withdrew and said nothing. Now I'm seeing the same behavior from a few of my friends. I felt bad about my own behavior and apologized to her in a long \"confession.\" On Christmas Eve, she called, told me that we'd always be friends. It was the best present ever! ",

Loulabell, that's a really great idea -- to put up a sign so everyone knows immediately what kind of day it is. CKK, I think you're right about people's true colors showing in times like this. The givers continue to give, the takers continue to do their thing. There's one woman in my neighborhood whom I've just known less than a year. She e-mails me to tell me that she's coming over to water and trim my plants. When she's outside, she will bring up the newspaper and the mail. She dedicated her \"Walk for the Cure\" -- all 38 miles -- to me. And I have a sister, my only sister, who has sent me one card. I'm the one who calls her to see how SHE is (and she's perfectly healthy). And she goes on and on about these wonderful meals she and her husband have been cooking, when the mere thought of food makes me queasy. I know that from now on, I will be a better friend to anyone who's going through this. I've already apologized to one friend, who had BC, chemo and rads 6 years ago. At the time I was her boss. I thought I was being understanding at the time, but now I cringe at how little I did or felt. I didn't know there were a hundred different kinds of BC; all I knew was that there was a Stage 1, which was good, and Stage 4, when you probably wouldn't make it. I never made the effort to really talk to her about what she was going through. As for me, I can't seem to bounce back from T/C #2, one week ago. I tried running one errand this morning -- my first trip out since #2 -- and it exhausted me. I'm back in bed. Still no appetite and that horrible taste in my mouth.   Did someone else say their hair is sticking around? I had my head buzzed about 2 weeks ago, but all the buzz is still there, and I still have my body hair. I thought all of that would be long gone by now. Someone is having a treatment tomorrow -- Josie? Momof3? Anyway, hugs to you --  and all of you. ",

My husband and I just yesterday started thinking about a trip to Barcelona for next fall. Just researching hotels yesterday onllne kept me busy, my mind off my yuckiness.

Ckk, I, too, don't think anyone is \"blocking\" a cure to cancer, but it certainly is frustrating that we've made so little progress. A TV show the other night marked the 40th anniversary of the US government's \"Fight Against Cancer.\" My dad died of cancer 44 years ago, when he was in his early 50s. Still today there's no cure for the cancer that killed him. I Googled it and they're still using the same lousy chemo drug now that they used on him 45 years ago. There's also no cure for the common cold. We've made much progress in cancer detection, and yes, the therapies and drugs have gotten more targeted, but why can't the best brains in the world figure this out? OK, that's my vent for today.  TODAY, I'm feeling...better. Day #8 after treatment #2, and I may have turned the corner. The mouth monster may have started creeping back into his cage, and the tummy tumbler may be taking a short nap. I'm still tired as heck, and depressed, but we'll take this thing one day at a time.  This is my greatest pleasure of each day, coming here to join with you friends.

It's supposed to help boost your white and red (right, girls?) blood count and help your body's defenses, especially around mid-cycle of your treatments. I get one after each infusion. The most common side effect from the shot itself is body aches. My MO explained that it's because the medicine goes to your bone marrow. Most of us get relief by taking Claritin and Tylenol before and after the shot. Momof3boys (Joyce), I, too, am sorry you had such a rough day. I know exactly how you feel. The very same symptoms hit me after both treatments #1 and #2, but hit me harder and more quickly after #2. I have to admit I felt so bad I stayed in bed for 2-3 days. Just hang in there and know that this, too, will pass and today, tomorrow or the next day, you'll start to feel better.  BTW, I also was wondering the same thing about the ladies taking steroids at home. I just get them in my IV. I don't take them by mouth either before or after treatment. I just have Zofran and compazine for nausea. Are those steroids?

We're very proud of your having done this. Kudos to Lisa, especially, for starting this thread, which has meant so much to us. Lisa, Annie and others, I think we all are angry at having to go through this and upset when well-meaning family, friends and colleagues don't understand how awful this can be. It's especially hard on those of you still with hair. You \"look\" normal and well, and many of you still manage to work through this. All those things are a testament to your own strength, commitment to the labor-intensive cold-cap treatments and advances in chemo. As Gracie said, before I had chemo myself, I had NO IDEA what people were going through. I look back and regret how mistaken I was in dealing with a dear friend and a sister-in-law who had BC. I thought that infusion day or maybe 1 day after was rough for them; I had NO IDEA how crappy they were feeling for weeks afterward.   Even I was naive about my own treatments. In the beginning, I looked at the calendar and said, \"Great, my last infusion is 2/21, so I can start rads that week and be through with everything by a particular date.\" Now I know that the infusion is just the start of the bad times, that it takes a good 3 weeks to feel \"almost normal.\"  I, too, wonder if I ever will feel \"normal\" again. With treatment #3 coming up Tuesday, I feel good this weekend, but there's still this cloud hanging over me, counting the few days left when I will feel good, dreading the days after #3, wondering whether they will be better or worse. I'm not sure knowing what's to come helps or hurts.  As someone said on one of these forums, find joy in today! Hugs to all! ",

All my life I've been a good sleeper, at sleep at 10 and awake at 6. Now every night is a struggle. Sometimes I'm still awake at 12, 1, 2, even 3. Other nights I'm asleep by 9 but awake, as I was this morning, for an hour or so about 4 am. And sometimes this is even with a sleeping pill. During the first 10 days after treatments, I can hardly stay awake during the day, but nap for only 10-15 minutes at a time. Frustrating. Robin, glad your foot is no worse, Lisa, I'm so sorry you're in a black hole right now. You will crawl out of it. You're our leader, remember??? We're counting on you to tell us what life is like on the other side -- the other side of chemo!! Your last one was 1/31, the day of my 3rd. I'm hoping to feel better tomorrow, which will be Day #10. I'm mentally going to cede 10 days of feeling bad but then concentrate on feeling good for the next 10 days.  It was so sweet of the vet's office to send you the lovely plaque in Daisy's memory. I think our emotions get whacked with the chemo, just like everything else. I got teary at the Camry ad during the Super Bowl.  But you probably would have reacted the same way, even without chemo. You're still grieving, still raw, missing her so much.   Madison, good to hear you're on the upswing. Karen and Heather, the hot flashes have been terribly annoying, especially during the night, accompanied by night sweats. These are far worse than anything I had during menopause. I think I posted earlier that my BS told me that red wine and chocolate can be two triggers for hot flashes, and I have to say they've backed off since I eliminated those two favorite vices.  HeatherB and others, this fatigue is so much more debilitating than I ever imagined. It's more than being tired or sleepy. Even walking short distances leaves me panting. The lethargy, too. Sometimes I will lie in bed for almost an hour, just delaying getting up to go to the bathroom. I will sit in a chair, motionless, for 15-20 minutes before I force myself to get up. I'm beginning to hate my bed and my bedroom, but really all I feel like doing is crawling into bed. BTW, my MO's office called yesterday about my neuropathy, also referred to as Hand and Foot Syndrome on this site's treatment and side effects page. The nurse said it's a definite SE from the Taxotere. She said for me to monitor it and call again if it started interfering with my daily life, like keeping me from walking. She said the MO will consider whether or not to give me less T in my upcoming treatment. She said it should start going away after treatment. Guess that's it for now. Hope everyone has a decent day. My goal is to, like one of you said, get out of the house and walk for 15 minutes. ",

I think we tend to think about my BC less when we're busy, doing something with others.  As for changes in taste, SO TRUE!!! I am a dyed-in-the-wool chocoholic, and everyone who knows me knows that about me. For Christmas, I received boxes and boxes of chocolate -- Godiva, See's, imported chocolate from Belgium, Ghiradelli, moose munch, chocolate-covered peanuts, Philadelphia. That was just around my first chemo treatment. I have not eaten ONE PIECE of chocolate in 2 months. I can't abide the thought of chocolate. Right now it's as if someone offered me a raw onion. I also steer clear of anything tomato-based, probably because I had such bad acid reflux one night after having tomatoes for lunch and dinner. Before, I loved tomatoes. During my worst days, as I may have mentioned before, all I can stomach are white and yellow foods -- a baked potato, a scrambled egg, pasta with Parmesan, mac and cheese. Even as my appetite and taste buds come back a little, I still tend to want mostly carbs -- bread and pasta. No one told me to avoid my favorite foods while in chemo, but I can understand the logic. A lifetime ago, when I was in college, I had my worst hangover ever after drinking a coconut-flavored drink (well, guess it was way more than one!). To this day, I can't stand the thought of coconut-flavored stuff. Even more amazing, when I was 5 or six, I got sick after drinking a grape drink. Same thing. I still can't drink grape drinks. Oh, well, enough of the \"drinks I threw up from\" memories!! Rachel, I just ordered a dozen pair of inexpensive white gloves from Amazon. I decided that's going to be one of my new defense techniques. I'm also going to sleep in them, with my hands lathered in some rich moisturizer. My skin is so dry! For years, my dermatologist has been trying to get me to wear gloves while driving. She says the hands get a lot of sun damage while you're driving, and my hands are proof of sun damage. I've had numerous precancerous spots frozen. As part of my defense strategy, I also ordered 100 individually wrapped GermX wipes, which I'm going to take with me to the grocery, drugstore, etc. because not all stores offer wipes for the cart handles. At the \"LGFB\" class, they also said wipes are good to clean out germs from under our fingernails, which plain hand sanitizer probably doesn't do. And speaking of shopping, I saw a recommendation on another thread here about Lindi skin products, designed specifically for cancer patients. I ordered the facial kit, which includes cleanser, moisturizer and eye cream. I think it's already helping. Most of my pre-chemo products were anti-aging ones (Olay, etc...), and they were way too drying for my now-paper-thin skin. I ordered Lindi online, but the shop where I bought one of my wigs also carries it. Madison, I'm so sorry to hear about your friend's violation of your trust. I think you're right. A person who will gossip to you also will gossip about you; it's just their nature. I've had a friend or two like that. For some insecure people, information is power. It's the currency they use to try to get people to like them. I had to distance myself from these friends and \"downgrade\" the friendship to one where I would never share anything personal that I didn't want broadcast. My \"good week\" continues. Last infusion a week from tomorrow. And I'm calling the MO this morning about my vaginal lump. Hey, Happy early Valentine's Day to all of you. I'm been telling all my other friends about you, about our friendship, our bond. Coming to know you, to share our darkest fears, our anger, our frustrations, our accomplishments has been the single best thing about this disease. We have shared things with each other we haven't shared with our spouses, partners, siblings. What an incredible group this is. You are my special Valentines in a year we will never forget. I love you all!",

I am now paranoid about germs. The other morning, when I went to the GYN about \"that bump,\" I figured I'd be OK in a waiting room full of pregnant women. But no, one or two obviously had really bad colds and were hacking away. I went up to the desk and quietly told them I was a cancer patient, in chemo, and asked whether I could wait somewhere else than the waiting room. A few minutes later, the doctor's nurse came out, hugged me and whisked me to wait in the doctor's personal office. They were so sweet to me.  Rachel, know what you mean about the drip! And I continue to be in awe of how active you've remained through all this. Have you missed work at all, except for infusion days?? I'm doing fine, appreciating and enjoying this good week before the final infusion. February's half over. Yeah!!! ",

And you're right about our recovery and spring both being on track. My acupuncturist said the same thing, that spring is the natural time for regrowth, recovery, recuperation. I guess if we had to go through all this crap with hibernating, wearing wigs and staying in bed, winter was a good time to experience it.

Weeks ago, I posted something to you on FB about Russia, but I was new at posting and it didn't show up. My husband worked as a journalist in Russia back in the early '90s, and I went over there to drag him home. We took the overnight train from Moscow down to Yalta and even managed to sneak into Sevastopol. I just finished reading \"Catherine the Great,\" which was marvelous. Ckk, hope you have a better day and night tonight. Yesterday, 3 days PFC, was one of my worst days ever -- fever of 100.1, body aches from head to toe, muscle spasms, queasiness, \"south mouth,\" as you said. I stayed in bed all day, napping for 15 minutes, then waking up to repeat the cycle.  Happy to report that I woke up feeling much better today.  Ckk, jealous of you girls who were brave enough to do cold caps. Now that chemo is over, you have HAIR!! I was worried that inches of white roots would be worse than no hair at all, but now I wish I had had the gumption to try them.

But NO SWIMMING???? I'd never thought of that. Do you know why? Rachel, I would definitely pursue that temporary handicapped permit.  I've looked enviously at all those handicapped parking spots as I've trudged by, huffing and puffing.  I spent a good deal of time last night checking the Internet for anything about contaminated Taxotere or skin reactions. There was a spate of postings in 2011 about a possible \"bad batch\" of Taxotere made overseas, but I couldn't find anything from anyone other than patients. I found more, however, about delayed skin reactions from Taxotere, including a posting from a nurse who said she had something like 4 patients in 2 weeks who had delayed skin reactions -- from 7 to 10 days out -- from T.  Skin reactions also are listed as a \"rare\" side effect on Taxotere's long info sheet. And I found one woman's blog with a photo of her hand that looked EXACTLY like mine. In her blog, she also said her hand hurt, which mine does. She said hers was from Taxotere. Mine is slightly better today, although it's the same size as before. I know doctors sometimes pooh-pooh all the stuff on the Internet -- and I agree that a lot is pure bull -- but I'm going to tell my MO what I've found. I'm going to the circus today! My daughter and her husband are taking my two grandsons, 1 and 5 years, to their first circus, and I'm tagging along just to see the 5-year-old's reaction. It always reminds me of the time we took my daughter to the circus, in Norfolk, VA, on a late March or early April Saturday in 1980 or so. We went to the 11 am performance and it started snowing as we left. The people who attended the 3 pm performance that day didn't get out for 2 DAYS!! The biggest snowstorm in a century hit and the governor prohibited anyone from being on the roads. There were hundreds of families with not enough diapers or food or milk stuck in an arena with circus animals.   Well, hope everyone has their own kind of adventure this weekend! ",

I woke up, opened my eyes, stretched in bed and knew something was different. I sat on the side of the bed and pondered this strange sensation. I felt GOOD! It was so dramatic and so meaningful that I just had to write about it. I wish I could adequately describe the difference between how I felt yesterday and every day since the last infusion with how I felt today. My mouth felt almost normal, my mind seemed clear and there was an absence of the \"crud\" feeling that has shadowed me since #4. I even had energy. Still short of breath, but I yanked off all the flannel sheets, washed them and replaced them with cotton. I was a white tornado. It was an amazing change. I hope I never have to feel that old bad feeling again. The circus was fun, but it was enough to make me get a handicapped parking sticker first thing Monday morning. I rode with my daughter and her family. It was pouring rain, really heavy. Traffic was clogged and we were among the latecomers. We had to park in an overfill lot a LONG way from the coliseum. They were walking fast, both because we were late and because it was raining so hard. I could not keep up. I had to stop several times on the way, making them -- including a babe in arms -- wait in the rain until I could get my breath. I was so embarrassed and mad. Please keep reassuring me that this will get better, that this isn't a sign of some sort of lung or heart problem. Ckk, I'm sorry you freaked out about the phlebitis and a connection to the Taxotere. How nice and comforting that you got such a caring and considerate MO on call. Rachel, now we know that you really are human :) You were keeping up such a pace, we thought you were the Bionic Woman, the woman who wasn't phased by chemo. You worked, you played in an orchestra, you guided guests around Philly while some of us couldn't get out of bed. Now you have hired someone to clean your digs and have admitted that chemo has indeed slowed you down. Of course, you soon got up from the couch and took a walk!!  Erica, I was quite impressed that someone from MD Anderson got back with you. It was very informative.  Robin, again this thing about \"generic\" Taxotere possibly causing problems....I'm definitely going to ask my MO.... Sleep well, friends! ",

And I love your idea of the blintz and bagel brunch. Just don't overdo it, kiddo!!! BTW, I think you'll find the Ativan a great help in relaxing enough to get to sleep. Sometimes I take two! Robin, I'm trying to do the hot water and lemon every day. And I found a Gatorade -- fruit punch -- that I can stomach, to try to help with my dehydration. I'm not a good water drinker. I know G has sugar in it, so I can't do this forever. Ckk, I know how discouraged you feel about normal activities being beyond your reach. I was hoping that by this time -- 17 days PFC -- I'd be feeling \"normal.\" But I'm so tired and winded that I can do very little. My daughter was without daycare for her 1-year-old this week, and she and her husband were taking turns working from home. I volunteered to be there 4-5 hours a day to play with the little one so they could concentrate on working. I did it M-T, coming home and falling into bed in the afternoon. Today I had  to leave after 3 hours. I just couldn't do it. I felt bad for them and so disappointed in my body. In some ways, this is more discouraging than when I was in active chemo. My mind says the worst the over, but my body won't catch up!!! Today I also learned that I've been accepted into the radiation clinical trial, but that I was \"randomized\" into the arm of the study receiving the standard 30-day dose instead of the 15-day dose. Bummer. Oh, well, I'm back where I was prior to the RO appt on Tuesday. On a brighter note, getting my first pedicure in 5 months tomorrow!!  Enjoy the weekend, and turn your clocks back (if only we could...say 3 years??)",

How dare I, in middle age, complain about it when this little boy, with his whole life ahead of him, has to deal with cancer not once, but twice? When he should be outside running around and playing, or in school with the rest of his class, he's in a hospital. It's just not fair! Could you get a card for the child or his parents and sign it with ALL our names?? It's the only thing I can think of that would tell them that all of us, going through cancer, are thinking of them. Annie, glad your surgery went well and you're home. Take care today and rest. Ckk, my sleep has never been worse. Not even the prescription pill Rozerem helps anymore. I wake up every 2 hours, with hot flashes and bad night sweats, and have trouble getting back to sleep. I often have to turn on the light and read a while. Even when I'm asleep, it's like I'm sleeping with my eyes open. I wake up exhausted. I talked to my MO about it yesterday and she suggested upping my anti-depressant a little and also suggested all those \"good sleep\" reminders like not watching TV in bed, not eating late at night. I'm already doing all those things! She finally told me to take an Ativan every other night or so, to ensure that I got at least one good night's sleep. It's addictive, so I can't take it every night, but I took one last night and was able to sleep, although I woke up this morning again with wet night clothes. And Deb and others, I, too, am having thigh muscle and hip pains, after walking or even standing for a certain length of time. I never had those prior to chemo. Sometimes my legs are so heavy and tired, I have to lift them onto the bed or into the car. The MO didn't know what caused that. I'm 3 weeks away from my last Neulasta shot. She said the steroids sometimes can temporarily improve arthritis pains, but I told her I never had these pains before chemo. I also asked her about my shortness of breath, the windedness. She thinks that may be due to my anemia. She didn't suggest any supplements, but do any of you have any ideas on how to build my red blood cells back up? I've read somewhere that some post-chemo women have taken prenatal vitamins. I find out today when radiation starts. It's supposed to be 81 here today and pretty nice in the rest of the country. Get outside, ladies! ",

I know it had been an issue for you, standing there new but unused, a reminder of how active you used to be but also a reminder of your DX. Getting back on the bike is a great step forward for you.  And my rads are going fine. No reaction yet, maybe just a little itchy in the armpit. Speaking of armpits, I'm embarrassed at my underarm odor now that I'm more active and the weather is warmer.  I can't use deodorant under the arm getting radiation, but, even on the other side, I'm finding neither the Tom's nor the Crystal is working too well. Anyone else having good luck with a non-aluminum deodorant? Rachel, maybe biting your nails is a sign that you're getting back to your old self?? Glad you had your handicapped parking sticker and could save some steps across campus. Jen, I could empathize with each step of isolation -- as you said, first because you were in shock, then fear of catching germs and now not knowing how to \"be\" with others. For the past five months, I've been in isolation, in hibernation. I think having chemo during the winter made it worse; it was easier to stay in bed, tucked under the covers, than to try to bundle up and get outside. And, for me, the chemo and side effects, the appointments for lab work and infusions, became all-encompassing; that was my life. The first time I went out in public, to a small birthday party, I felt different -- from my old self, from everyone else. I envied the women's hair. I realized even the balding men had more hair than me. I worried about my wig. I couldn't drink wine. I couldn't stand up long. I had to fake being interested in other people's trips and jobs and petty concerns. I left early. BUT, with the end of chemo and the nicer weather,  I am starting to come out of hibernation. I invited a friend to lunch. I'm going back to the gym. I went shopping for some new spring clothes (though, alas, they're one size bigger than I've EVER worn). I think each of us had a different degree of isolation and are gradually finding old and new ways to resume our lives. Gracie, good luck with your grandson Friday. I'm keeping my youngest grandson, who's 1, on Friday, too. My older one turns 5 on April 11, a year behind yours!   Hope all of you have a good day! ",

Most of us who had 4 treatments are in awe that you've been able to get through six. We all have our fingers crossed that the SE are no worse than before. Mine weren't as severe, just lasted longer. Karmil, so glad you're doing well after surgery. And I just an hour ago finished \"Emperor of all Maladies.\" Some of it is so technical -- talking about cells and genomes -- that I just skimmed those parts. Much of it is fascinating, especially parts about the doctors and scientists who were relentless and refused to give up experiments and theories that were pooh-poohed by their colleagues. The treatments we're receiving are so much more refined than they were, because of endless trials and experiments by these dedicated scientists. But there still is SO MUCH they don't know about cancer. One part mentioned a single slide from one woman's breast cancer that showed 13 different gene mutations. Even doctors wondered, \"Will we have to come up with 13 different drugs to attack each one?\" The book portrays cancer cells as ingenious, slippery, able to become resistant to some drugs, able not just to slide from one organ to another but to LEAP from one to another. The book says some small breasst cancers, even caught early, are highly aggressive and some very large breast cancers are indolent and lazy. It says some cancers will metastasize no matter what treatment doctors use, and others will NOT metastasize, even if nothing is done. So we all, and our doctors, are gambling. It's the best we can do. Some of us will never have another problem; others will have a recurrence, no matter how aggressive our treatments. It's not a book to read for entertainment. But I talked with my RO about it today, and she said even she had learned some things from the book, especially about the history of cancer and treatments. Karmil, speaking of \"weird people,\" I had a woman stop her car in the middle of the road when she saw me walking \"topless.\" She gave me a hug, said her mother had had BC and survived, then she showed up at my house a few days later with photos which she said showed my face in the clouds, a sign that God would heal me. And a woman at the gym who saw me topless stopped my car and told me that i HAD to stop conventional treatment and go with stuff from Mexico and the Far East, that her relative had been cured only after going to a clinic in Mexico... I think it's safer wearing my wig!!! ",

I think our reaction depends a lot on the type of skin we have and the strength and location of the radiation targets. My surgical scar is on the inner side of my right breast, so the area between my breasts and up to my collar bone must have been in the target range. My RO told me that the skin there is the thinnest and more likely to burn than the skin on the breast itself. My burn is pretty bad and way more painful than the surgery. I have trouble sleeping because I can't get comfortable. And it screams when anything accidentally touches it. They're treating me like a burn victim, with cold gel bandages and burn cream. The RO says it will heal pretty quickly but that I should never get sun on that area. Still, I'm not complaining, because this superficial pain is far better than the crap we dealt with during chemo. You know what I'm worried about now? (Well, one of a hundred things....) My upcoming six-month mammogram. My breast is so sensitive now. I really, really dread it being squished during the mammogram. And the one I had the morning of my surgery made me cry then, when I had no pain! Melrose, I never iced and never had a single problem with my nails.

Those of us who went through T/C in December 2011 found so much support from each other, since we all were going through it together. Talking with others who are on the same schedule as you will become an important part of your treatment, I guarantee you. Still, here are a few tips from one who went through it a year ago: 1) Drink water, water and more water. After my first infusion, I couldn't stand the taste of any liquid, even water. As a result, I got dehydrated and had to go back in for IV liquids. I tried every sports drink out there and still didn't like the taste. Everyone's different, but ultimately I lived on lemonade and sliced lemons in a glass of water, either cold or hot. 2) If Neulasta is offered to you, take it. It's a shot you get the day after your infusion and it helps build up those white cells that get killed off during chemo. The shot helps your immune system. It can create bone pain, but that's relieved by taking Claritin. 3) Listen to your body, and don't push yourself. You may find that there are certain days in your chemo cycle when you feel really bad. For many of us, fatigue was the worst side effect. Surprisingly, the new drugs they give you before the chemo allieve most of the nausea. When you get that \"hit by a bus\" feeling, just stay in bed and take it easy.  Read, watch videos... Gradually, you'll feel better, until that next round of T/C. After your first infusion, you'll notice what your own cycle is like. I kept a journal every day. 4) That said, if you're able to get some exercise when you feel like it, it will make you feel better. Some felt good enough to continue going to the gym; some of us just managed a slow walk around the block. 5) Have a family member or friend go with you to all doctor appointments, if possible. They can take notes and remember what the doctor says, sometimes better than you can. I also wrote out my questions for the surgeon and medical oncologist beforehand. 6) Again, every person is different, but you will probably have your own set of side effects, whether they're gastro-intestinal (constipation or diarrhea or heart burn) or dermatological (dry skin, nail problems) or sensory (numbness or tingling in fingers, toes or feet, hearing your heartbeat in your ears), and the inevitable insomnia. There is a drug out there for every side effect, and you'll end up taking more pills than you ever imagined. Don't hesitate to call your MO's office about anything that develops. Become friends with your infusion nurses and get their direct numbers. I called mine MANY times to ask about various things. Likewise, if your medical team includes a nurse coordinator, they are lifesavers! 7) Remember that your treatments WILL END. This is just one phase of your treatment. During chemo, you may wonder if you'll ever feel good again. You WILL!!! Along the way, though -- to bring this full circle -- nothing is more helpful than a group of women who are going through this at the same time. Get that new thread started, and watch the magic happen!! Some of these women will become your friends for life. Good luck. Its a tough journey, but you will get through it.",

The pre-meds included Ativan, and that mellowed me out so much I napped through some of the infusion and came home and slept for 4 hours. Zofram also was in the pre-meds, and, so far, no nausea or pain. I'm sure the days to come will be different, but at least this gives me the confidence to say \"One Down, THree to Go.

She said I should be able to sleep better tonight.  BTW, my MO came back from the San Antonio conference saying that thinking about Neulasta is changing, since such a high percentage of patients end up needing it, so she's giving it to me after every treatment. Anyone else hearing this? Josie, I've already bought my wig, too, and plan to have my hair cut way short 3 days after Christmas. Lisa, I, too, am jealous of your still-long hair. I just didn't think I could handle the cold-cap process.  Hope everyone is getting ready for a good holiday, NO MATTER WHAT!! ",

I wanted -- still want -- my old life back. I wanted -- still want -- to be the energetic, take-charge person who once supervised 300 people, who could walk 8 miles, who hopped out of bed, looking forward to whatever the day brought me. PLEASE KNOW that we all have down days. PLEASE KNOW that better days are ahead. See my next comment. JOSIE, you are I are both on Day #12 and feeling the same way. Today was my best day yet! I felt NORMAL. I walked a mile, I took down Christmas decorations, I cleaned the kitchen. I even had an appetite and ate my first vegetable in 12 days and a full, real dinner. Days like today make me feel like we CAN do this.   Someday, they'll probably look back on chemotherapy and regard it as barbaric. \"How could we EVER have poisoned women that way?\" But, for now, it's our best weapon, and we're doing it. What they learn from us will help our daughters and granddaughters. Tomorrow's a new day, a new year!! ",

Rachel, I admire you and others who can administer the Neulasta shots themselves. I was given that option but knew I just didn't need any extra stress or hassle. So I go in the day after each treatment for the shot, which takes all of 2 minutes. Momof3boys, I imagine with 3 little boys, you're used to crises every so often, but it must have been really frightening to hear that one son fainted and then you had to get him to the doctor. I'm glad the pediatrician's office was so understanding about your not wanting to be in a waiting room with a bunch of sick kids. I called my PCP for a prescription, and the nurse said I'd have to come in to be seen. I told her I was in chemo and didn't want to be in a doctor's office. She, too, was very understanding and said they'd mail me the script. Yes, we meet some very understanding and compassionate people along the way. This is a time when we have to be a bit selfish and look out for ourselves and our health. Someone told me to \"play the cancer card\" when I needed to. I won't do that unless it's a matter of my health. (However, wonder whether it would work with a speeding ticket???)  Have a good weekend, everyone!

I think people come into our lives, or we come into theirs, for a reason. God's angels. During this rough struggle of ours, we encounter some beautiful moments. Yesterday, for instance, I went to the grocery store for the first time in 10 days. I wore a wig. My first stop was at the bakery counter, where I asked for a special loaf of bread behind the counter. The clerk said, \"Oh, your hair is so beautiful.\" I wasn't sure what to say, but I told her about my cancer, and she cried and took my hand. She told me her sister had had it and was doing great. She wanted to know my name and said she would pray for me. Now I have a new friend, Michele. In October, my husband and I were planning a bathroom renovation. I made an appointment with the designer who had done our kitchen several years ago. I told her I'd come to her office. No, she said, she wanted to come to the house. The appointment was the day after my biopsy. My husband still was out of the country, on his way home. When the designer sat down, I started crying and told her I was waiting for biopsy results. We prayed and talked. Then the phone rang. Breast cancer. I know she was with me at that time for a reason. Gracie, I'm a huge Panera fan, too. My DH gave me a Panera card in my stocking at Christmas and the other day, on one of my first days out since the last treatment, I picked up Panera's mac and cheese and a loaf of cinnamon raisin bread to bring home. Comfort food. I keep writing Panera to tell them to open a store near me. And I'm on T/C despite a low Oncotype score, an 8. The MO recommended it because of my positive node. Yeah, beforehand, I had heard it called \"chemo lite,\" too. Sure!  Josie, my eyebrows and lashes are hanging on, although I see a bare spot or two. I think I've read on some other threads that women have lost them AFTER their last chemo. That will be a bummer!  Erica, glad your first infusion went well. Are you sure you weren't at The Ritz?? Breakfast, lunch and a newspaper!!! And be ready for more night sweats. I go to bed with a towel and one or two sets of PJs set out in the bathroom, just in case. I've gotten so I can wipe down and change almost without opening my eyes. Lisa, that is scary about your numb toes. All sorts of strange things happen to our bodies with these lovely chemicals in them. I think I'd at least mention it to your MO on your next visit. He or she will probably advise you not to stand in the cold with thin shoes for two hours!!  And so excited to hear that you and Annie both have visited Barcelona. I'll PM you both to get some suggestions.  Hope today's a good day for everyone!!! ",

But I have to admit that when I first looked at the calendar before chemo began, I did the same thing myself. Last one 2/21, then that's it. Sure. I'm so thankful I have only 4. I don't see how I could face months more of this. Annie, Lisa, Baileybump and Heatherb8, you all mention this terrible fatigue we're having. Me, too. The MO had warned me that the fatigue was one SE that would be cumulative, and boy, was she right. I am so sick of my bed and bedroom. I feel like a dog chained to a post, but a dog without the energy to even get up to stretch the chain. The weather has been lovely here, and I've been craving fresh air, but I just don't have the energy to walk. I admire any of you, like Lisa, who got in a 45-minute walk. My legs are trembly, my thigh muscles shaky, and I barely can walk from the bedroom to the kitchen without getting tired. This is SO NOT ME!!! Rachel, so sorry about the lost key incident. Shouldn't we get some breaks from life's roadbumps and hurdles?? Robin, I certainly hope you don't have a staph infection. I got one several years ago from a pedicure (airport spa!!!)  and it was a bear to get rid of. I was on antibiotics, had to take baths in a Clorox solution and the infection would pop back up every few months for more than a year. Get your spot checked, please! Don't know if any of you saw the Super Bowl commercial for Dorito's with the huge Great Dane. It was voted most popular commercial and won the creator a $1 million prize. The dog is owned by a lawyer in Virginia Beach, who did some work for us when we lived there, and the creator is from that area, too. The neatest thing is that is was a low-budget ad, one I think he submitted in a contest.  I'm getting out of the house today for the first time since last Wednesday -- acupuncture this AM, then the LGFB class this afternoon. I'm still shaky but most of those activities just involve driving. The LGFB class will be the first time I've gone out \"topless.\" Figure they ought to see me at my worst! Anything I do there will be an improvement.  I dreamed about it last night, though -- reactions from people who saw me bald... it was definitely like a horror movie...

It's more than fatigue, too -- lethargy, inability to get up and do almost anything, a depression of the body and mind, too.

Josie,  I applaud you for thinking of having a portrait done as a bald woman. Right now, I can't stand to look at myself in a mirror, and only my DH has seen me bald. But maybe, after this is all over and I have hair again, I would appreciate having at least some good photos of me bald, just as a reminder of what I endured, what I conquered. So now would be the time to do it. Thanks for nudging us in that direction. Also, neither my BS or MO has ever mentioned anything about what to or not eat, although friends have sent me jillions of e-mail links to articles about what to avoid. My appetite has been so erratic during chemo that it's all I can do to get something down; I have to admit my choices have not been healthy ones.  Like you, giving up sugar would be really hard for me. I like sweet tea and all kinds of desserts. I'm not a great cook, but I like to bake. How do you know which websites and articles are legitimate, or backed by real science? On the web, one can say anything is true, when it's not always. How do you eliminate sugar?? Ckk and others, what are you going to do about alcohol? I had just started drinking red wine about a year before DX for the heart benefits (I've always like white wines), but I gave up both during chemo. I think I could live without alcohol, but should I?  And, like others, my skin is so dry it's pitiful. I looked in a magnified mirror the other day and was horrified to see how much deeper and more extensive my wrinkles are, especially around the eye and neck. I look about 80! I wonder whether any of that will reverse itself after chemo... Speaking of skin, I'm wondering whether after all these treatments I will be so happy to be alive and feeling good that I don't care about wrinkles or gray hair. Or will I go to the other extreme and want Botox, laser treatments and such to look my best after looking and feeling so awful all this winter? Before my DX, my dermatologist had suggested laser treatments for the extensive sun damage on my face, chest and hands. Very expensive, though, and, of course, all that went out the window after my DX. Anyway, I'm just wondering how I will feel. But one thing: isn't is good and healthy and positive to be thinking about something, anything AFTER this is over??? These are my very best days in the chemo cycle. Yesterday, my DH and I went out to lunch and then I went shopping for spring clothes for my grandsons. I even cooked dinner for the first time in 3 months!! (Sorry, I know some of you don't have the luxury of having a husband cook for you every night.) Days like that remind me that I will have a long string of good days once the final chemo is finished and the SE out of my system. Amazing how my mental attitude follows my physical state...feel lousy, think lousy thoughts...feel good, think more positively... Here's to a positive day for everyone!! ",

Rachel, have you been able to reach someone about the thrush?? Lisa, sorry you're plagued by hot flashes, fatigue and burning muscles. I have all of those. And I, based on your recommendation, ordered the Anastasia brow kit online from Sephora, and I love it. So far I haven't had to use the stencils, but I can tell the brows are thinning.  Today's FOURTH AND FINAL chemo is over!!!! It went incredibly smoothly. My favorite nurse was there and got a vein on the first try. I went out to lunch with my daughter afterwards and then came home for a long Benadryl-induced nap. Someone --- not sure if if it was this thread or not -- had asked what I was going to ask my MO on today's visit. Here's what she said: --I may not feel like myself until about Memorial Day. It will take that long, or longer, to regain my strength and energy and recover from the chemo SE. She said for some women it takes 6 months. --She doesn't recommend any specific vitamins or supplements to speed up that process. She said I could take them if I wanted, but she isn't a big advocate. --She recommended Neurotin or Gabapentin (same thing) for the neuropathy. She didn't feel it was severe enough to warrant scaling back on the Taxotere today, as long as it was not interfering with my daily activities. She said she and another colleague wrote a grant proposal to study why and how chemo causes neuropathy, got a pat on the back but no money. She said they surmise that chemo affects the nerve coverings. --She said I WILL NOT have regular MRIs, X-rays and scans to detect any new cancer. (I have a feeling insurance companies have something to do with this.) She said they depend on patients, who know their bodies best, to speak up if they notice any abnormalities, and then the doctors will investigate. I will have mammograms every 6 months for about 2 years, which is reassuring. --She said there's no reason I can't travel (commercial air) between chemo and radiation because the Neulasta shots have kept my WBC up. --She said I don't need a lymphedema sleeve for flying and don't really need to worry about lymphema. She said it's much less prevalent now that they do SNBs instead of removing all lymph nodes. The chance of lymphedema is greater if you have 10 nodes removed than if you have 8 removed, even less if you have 6 or 5 removed. I had 3 removed. She said as a precaution, in normal circumstances, it might be wise to use the OTHER arm for blood work and pressure (NOW she tells me!!), but that, if it's an emergency, medical perssonnel should use either one. Anyway, sorry if this is TMI if none of you were the ones who asked.... Oh, Lisa, now I have a GOOD customer service story to offset the awful one yesterday. I ordered one of those edible arrangements of fruit to pick up early this AM to take to my infusion nurses. When I got there, they said the arrangement wasn't quite ready and asked if I could come back later?? I said no, I was on my way to a doctor's appointment and this was for the nurses. I told them I would wait in my car, since there were no chairs. A few minutes later, a woman brought the bouquet to my car, apologized profusely and handed me a box of a dozen huge chocolate-covered strawberries. She said they were free, to make up for my wait. OK!!!! Josie, did you finish today??? THought about you.... Can you tell the steroids have kicked in????? ",

Regardless, you'll get through it one day at a time and will be closer to the end. Also, kudos to you for chewing out your MO for not calling you back. I'm proud of you for standing up for yourself and telling him what you need and don't need. I think bc will make all of us more assertive women. Sorry about the prospect of IBS, but so glad you got checked. Knowing is so much better than worrying, and I'm sure IBS is common and highly treatable. Hope everyone else has a good week. Any other treatments this week? Who else has more treatments ahead of them, other than Erica and Rachel? ",

Mine is more diffused, starting at my wrist and fanning out to my thumb and middle finger. It's pink and swollen and aches; it feels like the IV needle is still in there. I did call the MO nurse and she recommended continuing the heat and ibuprofen and calling tomorrow afternoon if it's not better.  She asked if it was hard, and I said no. Do you think it still sounds like phlebitis? Ckk, sorry to hear you're starting to get some neuropathy. In addition to the fingertip sensitivity and numbness in big toe, my right wrist twitches occasionally, too. I think I may consider a cleaning service, too. Good idea. Take care, everyone! ",

I'm definitely going to call the MO nurse back and see if I can run by for her to take a look at it before the weekend.  It's no better this morning. It is definitely a general area of redness, it's warm, it aches and throbs and it hurts to stretch my hand. I know I immediately jumped to the conclusion it was phlebitis, and told her that on the phone, but I guess it could be an infection or cellulitis or something else. Coincidentally, I have an appointment with my dermatologist this morning, and I'll have her look at it as well. I'm having her check a couple of spots that have developed on my lower legs during chemo. I'm also going to ask her about a new moisturizer for my desert-dry skin and whether I could use Latisse for my disappearing lashes. Joyce, good luck today!!! Check in with us afterwards. You'll have plenty of time for that tonight!! Lisa and Annie, the fact you're both starting the hormone treatment is another marker along the way. You've been through surgery and chemo. Now on to the next phase. It's a sign of the times that we'll be sharing stories about that experience. I start Arimidex but not until rads are over. I've heard very different stories from women on these; some say it was no big deal. Two friends decided to stop because they couldn't deal with the SE.  Karmil, I agree with Ckk. The AC needles are NOTHING compared to the needles we've experienced with lab work, Neulasta and IVs. My daughter is like you; she can't stand the thought of someone sticking needles all over her body. As I've told her, some of them you don't even feel going on; others might give you a tiny pinch. It's not as bad as having your finger pricked. They don't go in very far.  But I, too, close my eyes!! Hope everyone has a good weekend, good weather or bad!! ",

Every time I shook hands, I wondered how many germs I was getting. Does that person have an allergy or a cold? Was that a smoker's cough or a flu cough? Is my wig on straight? I found myself stumbling when people asked me what I'd been doing lately or why they hadn't seen me around the neighborhood. I looked with envy at the women's hair. Everyone seemed so happy and carefree. Everyone was drinking wine; I had ginger ale. Everyone else was eating buckets of steamed oysters; I had chicken.

My DH has been in the house with me for 5 months, cooking every dinner for me, sitting through every appointment. I'm sending him away for a month, back to our house in the Bahamas, where we both usually spend each winter. I told him that he needs to get back to the life he loves, and his heart really is on the island. I told him that I need to be on my own a little, to regain my independence. I'll be in radiation while he's gone, but that's OK. I don't need him holding my hand for that. When some  very kind neighbors heard that my DH was going to be gone for a month, they sent me a beautiful, long e-mail, saying that he shouldn't worry, that they would take his place and would cook my meals for me, take me to my appointments and watch after me. I was touched, but also slightly offended that I was considered some kind of invalid, or, as you said, CKK, a \"sick child.\"  I wrote them back that I would be happy to accept an occasional invitation to their home for a lunch or dinner, that I'd love to go for a walk or go to a museum, or just come by to chat. I said I wanted to be treated as a friend, not as a cancer patient. Like you, I'm private and independent, too. Before BC, my DH had never been to any kind of appointment with me. I think you said the right thing to your DH. Maybe you can try to talk to him again about it, and make it more general, telling him all of us are going through this, struggling to find ways to move from being a cancer patient to being our old selves. Some of us are throwing out clothes we wore during chemo. Some of us are cleaning out whole closets of clothes from our \"old lives\" and starting anew. Some of us are vowing to lead healthier lifestyles. What you're asking of him is a part of this transition. You could not have made it through surgery and chemo without him. He's been there for you every step of the way. He's been sort of your \"training wheels,\" helping to support your bumpy ride. Now you need to try to ride on your own.",

I realize there are short-term side effects and possible long-term side effects, but I think it's worth it. That said, no matter what the doctors recommend, the final decision about surgery is up to you. I know several women who had Stage 0 DCIS and still chose BMX because they didn't want to have to worry about either radiation or local recurrence. We all have to make the right decision FOR OURSELVES. I had a friend who was in tears about an upcoming surgery because she didn't like her surgeon and didn't think he liked her but was the only surgeon doing that kind of surgery in her hometown. She was petrified and said it just didn't feel right. I went out on a limb and asked her to consider going out-of-state to a facility that did hundreds of that kind of surgery. It meant she and her husband had to stay in an extended stay hotel for a month. In the end, she was so happy she did it and has never stopped thanking me. Moral is: Do what feels right for you. No one will be inside your head and heart down the road other than you. If you proceed with the radiation, now that some of us will be taking that journey with you as well, just like we did with chemo. I had my tattoos Tuesday and should start rads in about 2 weeks.

Pages and pages of hair color, mascara, shampoos, conditioners and styling products, tweezers, razors, nail polish, weight loss programs, athletic shoes to firm up your butt, a million creams to minimize wrinkles, a hundred tips on anti-aging. It made me sad, that none of that applies to me now. It made me angry that all I want to do now is AGE! Maybe, after we get through this, we're less superficial, we care less about how we look.

The cancer center where I'm being treated offers discounted massages for patients -- just $45 for an hourlong massage by a trained oncologist masseuse. They even have a special table with a foam insert, that lowers, to accommodate your breasts (or lack of). I had a massage the day before my surgery and the day before my first T/C. I know it helps me relax and reduces anxiety. Research has shown that surgical patients recover more quickly from anesthesia after massage. I'm also getting acupuncture tomorrow, to see if that can help with SE.  I, too, would love some kind of celebratory get-together after all of this is over. I'm in Charleston, and it's a wonderful city to visit, but I'd be willing to fly anywhere to meet up. GracieG, I had to laugh when I read about your desire for comfort foods. Until a day or two ago, I had no interest in eating. It was all I could do to eat a scrambled egg or baked potato. When the appetite started creeping back, I told my husband I wanted mac and cheese. The next night I craved mashed potatoes and green peas. That was my New Year's Eve dinner",

I went through menopause with minimal discomfort, then was put on hormone-replacement therapy. The day I received my BC DX, the doctor said to stop the HRT immediately. Cold Turkey. Throw the Pills Away. The hot flashes and night sweats I've had since then make menopause seem like a glass of lukewarm water. Several mornings a week I wake up to see puddles of clothes leading from the bathroom to the bed, pajama top, pajama bottom, panties, socks. It looks as if someone had a romantic midnight romp, throwing off their clothes as they jumped into bed with their lover. But no, the path leads the other way. It's just \"chemo me\" with another one of her night sweats!",

I had my Neulasta shot yesterday, but with Claritin and Tylenol, have had experienced any aches and pains...yet. Cross my fingers! I'm on my way to acupuncture now. Ckk and Lisa, you're both role models for others who want to save their hair. You're honest about the hard work involved, especially at the end of a rough chemo day, but I have a feeling that in years to come the cold caps, or newer iterations, will become almost standard, especially for younger cancer patients. Remember how clunky televisions and stereos were when they came out? Boomboxes anyone? Now we're got sleek flat-screen TVs and Nanos and Ipods that slip into your pocket. Maybe cold caps will go the same route.   Rachel, weird that the ONLY sign of any neuropathy I've had is just what you experienced -- pins and needles, slight itch, in the middle of my left palm. Happened both times after chemo, but luckily has not gotten worse. So glad you and your mom are getting some special time together. I so wish my mom were still here to be with me.  Hugs and strength to all! ",

      "Content": "Jan 17, 2012 03:24PM - edited Jan 17, 2012 03:25PM by WaveWhisperer Hi, fellow members of the \"Sick and Tired...\" Club...  Josie, I've had the bone pain for up to 6 days after the Neulasta shot. E.g., today's Day #5 after my last shot, and I'm still taking Claritin and 2 Alleve. How did some of you managed to get Vicodin?! I'm jealous!!! Heatherweather, yes, I have two scripts for past-treatmet nausea, the Zofran and Compazine. Same as Rachel. The Zofran bottle says to take for 2 days after treatment, but my MO said it's OK to take it longer, if needed. The MO added Emend to my IV this time, and it helps. I didn't know they came in a pill as well. As for eating ice cream, it tastes great on the way down, but it runs right through my system, giving me horrible gas pains and diarrhea. I'm taking Nexium and Immodium, but the milk products still don't cut it. Like Lisa, I love my DietCoke in the morning. But where I used to chug at least 2 before noon, now I can barely finish one of the tiny plastic bottles. But if I don't have it, I get a terrible migraine. It still doesn't taste right. I have been having the most luck with lemonade, as someone suggested. The tartness seems less offensive than anything sweet. Isn't it awful that we can't even abide water?? ECpelkey, the phenergan is a prescription anti-nausea pill, sometimes given for morning sickness and other nausea. I don't know its potency compared to Zofran and Compazine. I would see how it works for you and, if it doesn't, ask your MO for something stronger the next time. GracieG, I, too, am always perplexed about what to say when people ask, \"How ARE you, dear?\" My DH sends out regular e-mails to our friends to give them updates, and most of the replies come back with something like, \"So glad you're doing SO WELL,\" or \"Glad to hear the chemo isn't so bad!\" I overheard him telling someone on the phone, \"To look at her, you wouldn't know anything was wrong!\" What universe is he in? I look like an alien and I feel like a poisoned dog. Annie, you're so right that we do have it easier than women who have been through chemo in the past. I read somewhere that some women had chemo for up to 2 years. And we all remember the movies and books about cancer patients puking their guts out. When I first talked to my MO, I told her I was more worried about nausea than losing my hair. I just can't stand being nauseous. (Goes back to childhood carsickness.) She told me that if I got nauseous, she and the pharmacist aren't doing their job.  In the future, women will look back on our chemo regimens as being barbaric, I imagine. They'll probably all take pills, keep all their hair and get some kind of supplement to boost their energy. Someday.... Hoping better days are ahead for all of us. Do you think the short, dark days of winter make us even more depressed during this? ",

HeatherWeather, just one more treatment for you. You're almost there. Maybe when we can all say \"just one more,\" it will be the push we need to get us over the finish line. For those of us at the back of the pack, it seems far, far away. My MO told me that changes in fingernails were a common side effect of T/C, especially ridges. So far I haven't noticed that, but I think what you're seeing is not unusual. Speaking of side effects, yesterday I had a pretty good day but last night, after I went to bed, I felt like my heart was racing. I could hear the blood pumping in my ear. I woke up DH and told him, asked him to take my pulse. He took my arm and said, \"I don't feel any pulse. You're fine. Go to sleep.\" So I never really found out what my pulse was...I don't think it's serious enough to call the on-call doctor on the weekend. And this morning my nose was bleeding. Any of this sound familiar? Any suggestions? Thanks. Stay warm and safe this weekend. Hear much of the northeast and midwest is getting or has gotten snow. ",

I hope they'll take the eye off my wig, missing brows, pasty skin, etc. Can two earrings do that much???  Rachel, what have you decided to do about the \"thing\" in your belly button? After my shower yesterday, I noticed I have several dark reddish round things on my lower legs, which were not there before chemo. My first thought was melanoma, since I've had a long-running battle with basal cell carcinomas. I'm going to show them to my MO at my next visit, but I can't imagine that they'd want to even biopsy them while I'm still in chemo. That's why I'm not calling my dermatologist yet.

I have one friend -- also not among my closest -- who acts similarly. She HAS to be the first one to know things, to share things. She feels it's not news until she has announced it. She wants to be the source of information, like she's the most connected, the most popular, the one everyone turns to. When I was diagnosed, I told my husband that I was sending a group e-mail to ALL my friends at the same time, speciifcally so that this particular woman was NOT the source of information about my health. Since then, I've been careful not to share with her anything that others don't already know. I've even taken some perverse pleasure in sharing a few details with a few closer friends, so that, if anyone in one of those  groups asks about how I'm doing, it will be one of them, not the other friend, who has the latest information. Is this female pettiness or what?",

My temp, also, has been in the 97 degree range, when I've taken it for a baseline, so I think your doc probably is right.  Lisa, I'm sorry you had such a tough night with the hot flashes and then such fatigue at work today. I'm a little surprised that you're feeling this tired this far out from your last treatment. Don't most of us feel almost normal after about 2 weeks (other than the puffing and wheezing)? Do you think you've overdone it? Do you think you should ask your MO for blood work?

I'm still feeling great and will have acupuncture tomorrow. My downhill slide will start tomorrow afternoon. And Karmil, I just go to a regular acupuncturist. I don't think you have to look for one who specializes in cancer patients. However, I do get my massages from a oncology masseuse at the cancer center where I'm treated.

Even though our docs told us the fatigue would be cumulative, I assumed that, once chemo was over, our bodies would begin to recover and we would gradually begin to regain our strength and energy. Still, I have to consider that my MO told me yesterday that it might be Memorial Day before I felt like myself, maybe even longer. Has anyone read anything specifically about post-chemo recovery?? Lisa, thanks for explaining more about the physically demanding requirements of your job. That is indeed something to consider-- that you were working half days during chemo and now are trying to work full days. Please don't make yourself sick. I remember after two of my major surgeries in years past, I was out of work for a full six weeks, then worked half days for several weeks before returning to a full schedule. And mine was a executive job, mostly desk-based.  And chemo is more destructive than a single surgery. Interested in others' experiences and thoughts.  ",

I think we all know what it's like to want to take a break from cancer, to want to avoid reading about it, talking about it. Right now this thing consumes our lives.We all pray that it won't forever. Bowel issues are common with chemo, but anytime blood is present, you need to be checked. I'm angry that your MO didn't call you back. That's one of my greatest frustrations with the medical community -- not responding quickly to patients' calls. And, of all specialties, MO's should be the most sensitive to their patients' needs. Call again early Monday morning...can you contact your MO's nurse or the infusion nurses directly? I learned the names of my two favorite infusion nurses and when I had a question -- and I had lots of them -- I would call the office and ask to speak to Kelly, telling the receptionist that I was a patient. I'd get through every time. I had less luck trying to reach the doctor's nurse at the cancer center; they return calls only at the end of the day. Anyway, we're here for you, as you know. Josie, bone pain and queasiness for me, too, a few days after the last infusion.  Hope everyone can have a good Sunday. ",

She named it \"Freddy.\" Freddy died...and  died...and died... At least four times I ran, in a panic, to the pet store, saying \"I need another goldfish just like this one. And I'd hand them a plastic baggie containing the dead fish. My daughter never knew, until I fessed up years later. We shared a good laugh. I was in doctors' offices all morning. I met with the MO about my hand. She did not think the inflammation  was related to the Taxotere and wasn't familiar with problems with some batches. She surmised that it was a bacterial infection starting from the IV site. I'll continue on Bactrim. Then I had my consultation with the RO. I've volunteered to participate in a clinical trial testing whether women of a certain age with certain particular cancers benefit just as well from a shortened rad schedule as the standard 31-day treatment schedule. I had to apply for the trial, so I don't know if I'll be accepted. Half the women receive 26 regular treatments plus 5 boosts, or 31 treatments. Half receive 15 treatments, with slightly higher doses of radiation each day with the boosts spread over the entire 15 days. Interesting.... I had my CT scan, positioning and tattoos today, too, plus blood work required for the trial. Stay tuned... I think it's a good sign that we're posting less frequently!!! ",

Joyce, my fingers are crossed that your WBC will get better quickly and that you'll be able to start rads. I know you're disappointed about the delay, but everything will work out for the best. Karmil, hope the support group works out. I searched for one locally but got frustrated...a printed sheet I had from the cancer center had a wrong number and when I called the American Cancer Society, I kept getting a recording. Eventually, I gave up the idea. This forum has been all the support I could ever ask for. Rather than meeting just once a week, we can get advice, answers or a shoulder to lean on 24/7. And everyone can speak up as often or as infrequently as they want. Plus, we're all in pretty much the same boat, with stage i or ii cancer, going through chemo at the same time. I can state emphatically that I couldn't have gone through this without all of you. Here's my \"chemo brain\" blooper of the day: Yesterday I went to the gym for the first time since my DX. I took my wig with me but didn't wear it into the gym because it would have been too hot and scratchy. (My first appearance \"topless,\" which is a story for another time....) Anyway, from the gym I drove to the outdoor mall to quickly run into a store to return an item. I grabbed my shortish wig and pulled it on quickly. While I was in the store, I happened to see myself in a mirror and gasped. The wig didn't look at all right. Was this my wig? (Like who else would have had a wig in my car??) Had I pulled the wrong one from a box in my bedroom? (But what idiot would have bought one that looked this silly?)  I left the store abruptly and went back to the car to see what was going on. I had put the wig on BACKWARDS!! Find something to smile about in your day!! ",

I'm afraid I don't have any advice for you, but it makes me mad that your doctors have treated you so cavalierly. I know that with diabetes, circulation problems can occur. It certainly sounds as if you need to keep looking until you find a doctor who will give you some concrete advice. Have you been to your primary doctor even though the endocrinologist wasn't much help? I hope you can find soe relief soon. Rachel, good luck with the pledge drive. I was devoted to my public radio station when I was commuting to work in another city, and I used to dread those semi-annual pledge drives because it interrupted the programming. But I know it's necessary for the stations' survival. Do your station have one day when people call in donations on behalf of their pets? That always was a hoot! And it made me smile to read about your new friend. I have three new friends in my neighborhood, whom I didn't know or didn't know well until my DX. Like your friend, they have been very sweet and reached out. So I guess there are some good things that have come out of this horrible experience. (You ladies are the best thing, though!) HeatherB, I also would cover up when I went to bed and then wake up with bad night sweats and hot flashes. Just over the past few nights, I have tried your suggestion and have just used a sheet, and it's been better.  Gracie, I know it's frustrating not to be able to exercise, but I think you're right to just be patient and follow the doctor's advice. You'll be back walking before long. Keep reminding us of when your exchange surgery is coming up.  Jen, congratulations on all the weight you lost. I've gained 15 pounds. And good to know that your leg pain is better than it was. I want you to know that I was considering not going to the gym today -- a mild cold -- but after reading your post, I WILL GO!!!

Day by day, they've let him do a little more, watching him. Yesterday he must have been \"at the controls\" in the booth outside the rad room. When the big circular machine began moving into position, instead of swinging out, it moved down and down until it crushed my outstretched left arm. I could hear lots of yelling in the control booth, and, of course, I was yelling and crying, too. The ladies moved the machine off me and came running out to make sure I was OK.

I got marked up again, with magic marker. The tech was doing so much marking that I finally asked her, \"Are you going to sign this masterpiece when you're through?\" Luckily, no more tattoos, though. The RO had to come in to OK the new positioning, but the boost itself was super-quick. I always try to count during the rads, as a way to keep my mind from thinking about what's going on. With the regular rads, I could count to 40-44 on the first position, 35-40 on the second position. With the boost, I only got to 20!

I put my first one off a bit, worried that I wouldn't feel good enough to attend a special event. Then the MO scheduled it for the week before Christmas. I asked if we could put it off until after Christmas. She said no. Looking back, I'm glad she did, and I wish I had gone ahead and started chemo sooner, because I'd be closer to being finished now. Some treatment centers offer a \"chemo school,\" to show you what it's like and acquaint you with the nurses and set-up. Other places will just walk you through it, if you ask your MO. Honestly, the treatments themselves are no big deal; it's the side effects we deal with later that cause us problems.  DEFINITELY take someone with you. I have taken my husband to EVERY doctor's appointment and chemo treatment, for physical and moral support, to ask questions that I forget to ask and to remember things the doctors have said that I forget. I don't have many friends in town, so you're lucky you do have friends who have offered. Take them up on it. Depending on the time of your treatment, you could go to lunch before or after. Or pack lunches and eat them during treatment. My husband and I both take Ipads with us, and we play each other on \"Words with Friends.\" This is a scary journey, but you are not alone. These forums are a great source of information and support. You might also ask if there's a BC support group in your area, or your BS or MO may be able to put you in touch with another BC patient who has actually been in your shoes.  You'll do fine. Hugs, ",

You have a gift for saying just the right thing to each of us.  April, welcome to both you and your mom. You sound like a very special daughter; your mom is lucky to have you beside her during this tough journey. Among all the forums, this is one of the best because we're at pretty much the same stage of the journey. Heather, yes, I'm already on Zoloft and take Ativan as needed. I inherited a genetic tendency to depression, so I'm aware that some of what I'm feeling -- the fatigue, lack of interest in eating, the struggle to even get out of bed -- is symptomatic of depression as well as SE from chemo. I met once with the oncology psychiatrist and was totally turned off by her, but maybe I'll try her again. Annie, I think the back spasms may be linked to the Neulasta shot, although my MO said it was an uncommon reaction.  Josie, I think we have the same mouth sensations. You did a good job of describing it as scalded or burned. Nothing tastes right.  CKK, I think you're right about the stomach acid and small meals. My MO put me on Nexium and Immodium yesterday, and already the gastric distress is better. I'm eating lots of bananas, toast and trying to eat small snacks several times a day. The past few days since Christmas were pretty miserable. The diarrhea, headaches, stomach cramps and back spasms were horrible. It was all I could do yesterday to get out of bed to get to the MO. The lab results were OK. \"You look fine on paper,\" she said, \"but, in person, you don't look so good!\" She immediately suspected dehydration, because of the severe diarrhea and my inability to tolerate liquids. So she sent me back to the infusion suite for an IV transfusion of two bags of saline. After sitting with me for close to 3 hours, my DH said, \"Don't you think it would just be easier to try to drink something?! The Nexium, the Immodium, the sleeping pill and the IV infusion did wonders, I'm happy to report. I feel almost normal today. By 8 am, I had run the dishwasher, put out recycling cans, brought in the newspaper and folded some laundry. This is from a woman who yesterday could barely get out of bed. Days like today give me hope that not every day will be a bad day! I got my hair cut short today, and even that wasn't so traumatic. So, again, thanks for propping me up when I was leaning really low! ",

I've just been through 1 treatment so far, but I couldn't sleep -- even with a sleeping pill -- until night #3. People had warned me about that, and they were right. Apparently it's the steroids. Next time, I may not even fight it; I may just stay up and get some things done, knowing that in a day or two, I'll be exhausted and sleep well. HeatherWeather, I had my stylist save my hair, when he cut it, but I didn't know about sectioning it off in rubber bands, etc. I wonder if anyone still can make a halo from it. And thanks for your update about your surgery. Sounds like the chemo is working. Rachel, I do hope you're able to go to your New Year's Eve ball -- and have a ball yourself!  Today's Day 11 for me, and I still have my (shortened) hair. Has anyone tried a Latisse-like product, originally for lengthening eyelashes, to try to keep from losing their brows and lashes? The woman I bought one of my wigs from said some patients find that it helps retain their lashes and brows, so I've used it every night. I'll let you know my experience with it. The one I'm using is OTC, costs about $75 a tube. That's pricey, but I'll be saving lots on haircuts and color in the next year. ",

Many of us are alive today, will be alive 20-30 years from now, because of research done earlier which indeed \"changed the rules.\" We're getting chemo drugs that weren't around 30 years ago. Many of us have sentinel node biopsies, whereas years ago, every lymph node would have been removed. Many of us have had breast-conservation surgery, whereas years ago a full mastectomy was automatic. Partial-breast irradiation is new. So is the Oncotype DX test itself. The BC patients who came before us made the best choices available to them at the time, although, with new advances, they, too, made have complained about the rules changing. Likewise, we're making the best choices for ourselves right now, even though, even six months from now, some protocols will be changing. We have to applaud anything that changes the rules because, hopefully, those changes will benefit those who follow us, if not us. SORRY for jumping on that and getting on my soapbox. I guess I'm just feeling feisty today. Please forgive! HEATHER, I know the prospect of a first surgery is scary. I've had four surgeries over the years. I can tell you that none of those surgeries, including a major abdominal surgery for colon cancer, was as rough as going through chemo. I would imagine many other women here would attest to the fact that even a BMX is easier to endure than what we're going through with chemo. My advice would be to concentrate on the outcome: that the surgeon is getting rid of your cancer, that this is a good thing, a TERRIFIC thing. You've been through the toughest part. Really.  APRIL, I ordered the \"Cancer-FIghting Kitchen\" from Amazon yesterday, so I'm eager to try some of the recipes. Thanks for suggesting it, as well as the coconut water. Now I'll have to get that whey powder, too.  MOMOF3BOYS, So glad you managed to get some sleep and that you're getting out, even in the cold, for a walk.  GRACIE, Welcome, too. I encourage you to take the Ativan, whenever you think you need it. Usually, I don't like taking too many drugs, but with this BC, I'm jumping at anything and everything that will make me feel better and alleviate these maddening side effects. I'm taking an anti-depressant every day, a sleeping pill every night and an Ativan as an additional calming agent when I need it. I have prescription Nexium and Immodium for the diarrhea that got out of control last week. I take Claritin and Tylenol before and after the Neulasta shots. I use Biotene mouth wash. I'm a walking pharmacy, even without all that chemo poison in my system. Yesterday was my best day yet since chemo #1 12 days ago. I felt almost normal, except for the lack of appetite and everything tasting like straw. Went for a walk, which was lovely. Hope everyone enjoys New Year's Eve in their own way.

Several times when I've had surgery or colonoscopies, I've been dehydrated from fasting before the procedure, plus I was freezing in those flimsy hospital gowns in a cold hospital room. My usually plump veins were almost non-existent. The nurses would cover me with warmed blankets, sometimes hot, wet towels on my arms, until the veins would pop back up. It's definitely worth asking about. Ckk, I'm so sorry for what you and your whole family has been through, with strep in the house. Your poor daughter was probably scared to death of worrying you and didn't say anything, but it put you at risk. As you said, a good lesson learned. It is hard for us moms and wives to be the patient, when it's in our nature to be the caregiver.  My next infusion is 1/11. So far, for me, the first week was a gradual downhill spiral, leading to several days of severe diarrhea, IV fluid infusions, body aches and real flu-like feeling. After that it's been back uphill. I'm counting on a good week until the next infusion. Everyone else OK today?? ",

So can we join a group -- as you're suggesting -- without all our posts showing up on our own page?  Annie, good luck tomorrow. And yes, I chew ice chips at the beginning of the infusion, but my taste buds still go haywire anyway, so I don't know if it helps or not. I think it's unbelievably sweet that your son wants to accompany you. I think I'll ask my daughter if she wants to come with me for my last one next month. Joyce, so glad to hear that you're back in the land of the upright. Those dark days are really dreadful. Baileybump, yes, enjoy your good week. I don't think we'll ever again take \"feeling good\" days for granted.  I had #3 today, and it got off to a rough start. A new nurse -- new to me -- could not get the IV in. She tried two veins in my left hand and then one in the crook of my arm. By then, I was crying pretty hard. My husband couldn't tell if I was having an emotional breakdown or if the nurse was killing me. Both, actually. Finally, that nurse gave up and got the nurse who always before had gotten the IV in the first time. She was so sweet. She came over, calmed me down and said, \"Let's just leave that left hand and arm alone. It's had enough.\" She tried the sister vein in my right hand, and got it the first time. Relief. I came home with four bandages, two on the left hand and arm from the unsuccessful stabbings, one on the right hand from the successful IV and then the one in my right arm from the blood work earlier. I asked my MO when radiation would start, and she told me it may not start until 6 weeks AFTER my last infusion. I'm really bummed. I didn't ask her why it might take that long to even start it. She said I might be able to negotiate with the RO. I asked her to get the ball rolling and make me an appt with the RO ASAP, but that's still not until March.  I just want this to be OVER!! After my DX, my breast surgeon thought I might be able to do just the lumpectomy and then 5 days of partial radiation. Then, during surgery, she found a positive node, so the abbreviated radiation was out. Then, after Onco, I decided to do chemo. And now I hear it may be mid-May before I'm through with treatments. That will be 7 months after DX. I know a lot of women go that long or longer. I'm just BUMMED!! And, of course, tonight I'm also WIRED because of the steroids. It's after midnight, and I'm still going strong.  ",

On the eyebrows, lashes, I have half an eyebrow over each eye and am beginning to notice gaps in the eyelashes, despite nightly use of a Latisse-like product. Went to the \"Look Good, Feel Better\" class today and the instructors had some warnings and tips I hadn't heard before, including: --At all costs, avoid waterproof mascara because it contains tar and over time will cause lashes to drop out. --During chemo and radiation, avoid having our hands soak in water and use gloves when washing dishes. They said soaking softens the skin too much and makes it more suspectible to infection. There go my long bubble-bath soaks! --When using hand sanitizer, make sure to clean under the nails. --Nail polish is OK and may prevent nails from cracking or getting too soft. But don't use acetone polish remover. --Use disposable mascara wands, eyeshadow brushes, etc. during treatments. It felt good to get out of the house, but this fatigue is incredible. I can't imagine how much weaker I will get after treatment #4. Have a call in to my MO about the neuropathy...pins and needles sensations in hands and feet, numbness in ball of one foot and tips of my fingers are becoming numb. I think someone on one of these threads said it might be a result of a build-up of the Taxotere or Cytoxan, forget which one, and that the MO might want to dilute it next time or slow the drip... ",

Erica, good luck today with your treatment #2. Wishing you plump veins and good blood results. Loulabell,  at the \"Look Good, Feel Better\" class yesterday, the instructor said we shouldn't use false eyelashes...something about the glue smothering the roots or something. But I have bought some, and I'm going to try them when my lashes are gone. Even with a wig, I think we look too \"different\" without brows and lashes. I've bought some brow stencils and powder, too. GracieG and Ckk, we're all in the same boat with the overwhelming fatigue and the frustration at not being our usual active selves. I saw myself in a mirror yesterday, at the hospital for that class, and, with my bald head and slow, shuffling walk, I looked like a hospital patient on her last leg. I wouldn't say this anywhere, except in the security of this forum, but my mind goes to dark places and I wonder if this is what it feels like in end-stage cancer. First you can't walk a mile, then you can't walk around the block, then you can't get out of bed, then you're in a wheelchair. You quit eating.  I really do try to stay positive. This is just such a horrible experience. My mind tells me that it's temporary, and I know from the two previous treatments, that I will feel better on or about Day #10. But while I'm in the worst of it, I feel and look like someone who is so sick. Sorry about that, ladies. Your regularly scheduled program will resume shortly! ",

I once had a brain scan and that's what the report said: \"Brain unremarkable.\" I was mightily insulted, until the doc told me that was a medical term. Ckk and Heatherb8, welcome to the meltdown club. I think we all get to the breaking point at least once or twice during this. It all goes back to no one, not even our closest friends and family, really understanding how awful this is, physically and mentally. It's worse when we look OK (now when was that???) and try to keep up our old schedules. Those of you with jobs and kids at home don't have any way to avoid that.  Lisa, I think you're really feeling the effects -- good ones -- of not having another treatment ahead of you. I'm so glad you're experiencing this feeling of freedom and joy; I hope we all will be there soon. I always want to say the \"glass is half full,\" but I have to admit that during my \"good\" week, I'm always dreading the next treatment. I'm 10 days away from my last infusion, so this should be my \"good week.\" My taste buds are a little better. I'm still really tired but definitely better than the last week. However, I work up at 4 this morning to go to the bathroom and discovered this hard lump on one of my labia, something that wasn't there yesterday, something large under the skin almost like a piece of wood.  I cried and prayed and could not go back to sleep. I searched the entirety of this site and couldn't find any reference to anything like that. I decided I would call the on-call oncologist, but then, with daylight, decided that this wasn't like a fever, wasn't life-threatening for the next 48 hours, and I'll wait to call on Monday. But whom do I call - my MO or my GYN, whom I haven't seen since my DX?? Is this related to the neuropathy I'm having? Is it a tumor? (What are skin mets anyway?)  Why do we have to worry about all these other things while we're dealing with BC and chemo?? Will we always think the worst anytime we find any abnornality?  I decided to keep it all to myself and we went to my little grandson's 1st birthday party today. It was the first \"event\" I've been to since chemo. Did every child and their parent have a cold? YES!   And then there were the whispered words of concern and support. My daughter's MIL was there and said, \"I hear it's a little bit like having the flu.\" Well, yeah, but not really. \"I felt just like that when I was pregnant,\" she said, knowingly. I just nodded. Yeah, the flu. Plus headaches and nosebleeds; dry, itchy skin; constipation, diarrhea and hemorrhoids; no appetite; everything tastes like crap; anemia; hot flashes and night sweats; loss of all your hair; blurry vision; insomnia; acid reflux and heartburn; extreme fatigue; depression; pain in your hands and feet; sensitivity to smells and sounds; immune suppression; and on and on. As for the weather, even here, deep in South Carolina, it's supposed to be down in the low 20s tonight!! ",

Among the things I'm going to ask my MO: --How long will it be before I recover from the effects of chemo -- the fatigue, the low WBC and RBC, the neuropathy, the chemo brain? When does hair begin to regrow? --When will I be safe to travel (commercial flights, etc,)? (And thanks for the suggestion on the QVC oil. I'm going to order some. My scalp itches like crazy...)  Karen, I think we all can relate to your movie misadventure. I feel as if I'm in a fog most of the time. The other night I asked my husband a question and then realized he had just answered the same question from me about 5 minutes earlier.  --What supplements should I take to help with the anemia, the neuropathy, with getting back my health and energy? (I stopped taking everything while in chemo...) What things should I avoid? (I know soy, e.g.)  --What kinds of scans will I have and how often from now on? (All I know of right now is the mammogram in May, about 6 months after DX and surgery...) --When will I start Arimidex? Will that be only after my rads or during? (And at some point I will have to break down and ask about the side effects from that...)  Part of my anxiety probably has to do with being \"released,\" as CKK said, but not so much from chemo as from my MO, whom I adore. Both my BS and MO -- both women -- have been incredibly caring and have taken an inordinate amount of time answering all the questions my DH and I have had.  I trust them implicitly. I like them. I am in awe of their skill and intelligence.I wish I could see them forever. I've met my RO once, and I know I won't have the same relationship with her. My GYN and PCP are women, too, but the GYN is harried (30 patients in one day, most of them OB patients) and the PCP is kind but not brilliant. Ckk, thanks for the suggestion about the book about chemo brain. I'm definitely going to order it. Now what was the title of it again? (Just kidding:)  Gracie, hope you had a better night's sleep. Just mark off the days, one by one, until you're back on your feet. #3 hit me harder and faster, and I imagine #4 may do the same thing. Thanks for the tips (and warnings) about the search for a vein this time. I'll try eating sone salty stuff and I'll just grit my teeth and pull out the tissues in case they have to keep stabbing me. Yep, Josie, CKK and I have our final treatments this week. Josie and I are Tuesday, Ckk on Thursday. Let's add our \"final infusion\" photos to the FB page, as some others have done. It's raining here, so I won't get a walk today. I walked a bit yesterday and was shocked at how I was puffing and how my thigh muscles burned. I guess I'll just have to start slow and build up. Hope everyone has a good Sunday! ",

All sorts of feelings today...I'm nervous about their finding a good vein...I'm excited and relieved that this is the last time I'll have to do this...I'm dreading the last round of SE and wondering how bad the fatigue will be this time.. I had an embarrassing meltdown yesterday. All weekend, I had worked to wash, iron and hang a LOT of spring clothes to take to my favorite consignment shop. They were hanging on every door in the house. I knew yesterday was my only window for doing this for several weeks. I was at the shop and standing at the door, clothes hanging over my arm,  for its 10 AM opening. I could see employees in there. Finally, at 10:05, I rapped on the door. They ignored me. I knocked harder. A woman came to the door and not too nicely said they were closed for inventory.  I told her that yesterday was the only day I could drop off the clothes, that it would be probably 3 weeks before I could come back. She said, \"Then come back in 3 weeks.\" I lost it then. I told her I was a breast cancer patient undergoing chemo, that my next treatment was today and I would not feel up to coming back, that I had worked all weekend to get these clothes ready. I started crying. She went to get the manager (a new one; I knew the old one), who came to the door. By then, I was almost sobbing. At first she was not so nice either, saying that they were jammed, their computer wasn't working and she could not make an exception. Then an employee who knew me and knew I had BC came up and hugged me, gave me a tissue and persuaded the manager to just take the clothes, that she would put them in the system later. I didn't realize how close to the surface my emotions were, how little frustrations and rejections could send me over the edge.   Rachel, so sorry about the thrush. Hope you can get something to take care of it today. And I meant to mention that my dreams also have been quite involved and dramatic, including a few nightmares. Heather and Gracie, hope that each day brings a little relief from the fatigue. I'll be right there with you, in bed, (oops, you know what I mean!!!) in a few days. Have a good day, everyone! ",

Thanks a lot.:) Now I think I've got that one, too. Last night before bed, I noticed that my IV hand was red and throbbing. It hurt enough to wake me at 5 am today, so I hit the computer and it does seem like it's superficial phlebitis. Odd that it wouldn't turn up until 9 days after the last infusion. I'll call the MO nurse this morning. I'm using warm compresses and have taken Alleve. Who else has had this and how did you handle it? BC, the gift that keeps on giving....Right! Hope all is well with the rest of you.  Josie, good to hear from my chemo partner. Glad you're not having such bad SE this time, although the bill from your MO is pain enough! I haven't gotten a single bill from chemo yet.   Annie, exciting to hear about hair regrowth!

It was a little tougher than I expected because I had to lie perfectly still, with my arms bent over my head, for about 35-40 minutes while the techs took lots of something (X-rays? photos?) and came in and out to gently readjust me several times. At least they put two warm blankets over me and for most of it my boobs weren't exposed. At one point I wished I had taken a Valium before going. Even though it was completely open, I had this tremendous urge to wave my arms and jump off the table. They also did more tattoos. I guess the last one were \"trial\" ones, and today's were a different color. My chest is painted from shoulder to belly button with magic marker lines, but they said those will wash off. Two good things, though. (Silver linings, as the nurse blogger would call them.) I found out I'll have to have only 22 treatments, 16 regular and 6 boosts, so I'll be through on April 17th!!! And I got the 8:30 a.m. time slot I wanted. Even though the center is just about 7 minutes away (poor Robin, I'm sorry you have to drive so long), I didn't want the rads to interrupt my day or come at the end of the day when I am already tired. They said the 8:30 slot is a coveted one, and it just opened up today when someone finished their treatments. Here's my chemo brain story of the day. When I got to the center, one of the nurses said, \"You're getting a jump on things, aren't you? Or do you just want to make sure they don't run out of beer?\" I had no idea what she was talking about, so I'm sure I looked puzzled. \"Your green...,\" she said.

And I share your concern about the future of women's health -- too say NOTHING about the future of women's rights. Do you know that my former home state, Virginia, just passed a law requiring every woman who wants an abortion to undergo an ultrasound? A story on the front page of our newspaper today (probably the same one you referred to) said that too many early- stage breast cancers were being treated aggressively, that many of them would never turn into anything life-threatening. BUT HOW DO THEY KNOW if they will or won't? Isn't it better to treat aggressively than to let it just lie there and decide whether or not to kill someone. The article seemed to blame early diagnosis, which seems ludicrous.  Speaking of health conditions in foreign countries...we live part-time in the Bahamas, on a sparsely populated island that gets short shrift from the Bahamian government. The communities on the island raised money to buy a mammogram machine for the local health clinic, but the government would not send one because they said there was no one on the island qualified to read the scans. (Technically, that's true, but the clinic could have sent the films back to Nassau for reading by a radiologist....) Rachel, glad you're better.

I also teared up when I read about you and your father giving those Seder blessings. We all have a lot to be thankful for. We've been through six months of mental and physical hell, and we're here today, battle-scarred but alive. I spent Easter weekend with my daughter and my two grandsons, the first time I've been able to do that since my DX. Whenever I stay there, my #1 grandson always sneaks into my room to wake me up. (I'm always awake anyway, but we love the game.) Yesterday, he did that, then crawled into bed with me, and we snuggled for a long while. It made me teary. So did the next experience. I asked my daughter if I could see grandson #2 sleeping in his crib before she woke him up. He was so adorable, his little 13-month butt sticking up in the air as he slept so peacefully on his tummy. I hope I never take moments like that for granted.  ",

As you might have learned from reading our stories, much of the support we got was the result of our going through T/C together, at the same time. So, in addition to our topic, I heartily suggest that you read -- or FORM -- a topic for ladies starting T/C in April or May 2012. It also was helpful for us to add our diagnosis and chemo schedule to our signature, so we knew exactly who was getting chemo on certain days. Some of us were \"chemo buddies,\" getting treatments on the same days. If you can't figure out how to do that, let us know. Chemo isn't for the faint of heart and spirit. Frankly, it's a tough road. It's tough on your body and your emotions. No one -- not even your closest family -- will truly understand your frustrations and the depths of your despair as you cope with myriad side effects. At times, you may wonder if you can even get through it. BUT, you WILL get through it. Your body and spirit both will recover. You WILL get your old life back. And, in the process, on these sites, you'll meet some wonderful women who will listen to you, talk to you, help you night or day. If you're lucky, like we have been, they will become the most special of friends, for life. FOR LIFE!!!!  Bless you, our new friend. ",

I'm now through with all my \"active\" treatments, just have to start Arimidex after meeting with my MO next week. This is a huge weight off my shoulders. I'm feeling better every day, except for the serious burn on my breast and chest. They gave me some gel packs for burn victims, which seem to help. And at least the skin doesn't have to be subjected to any more abuse. For those of you who still have rads ahead of you, it's really nothing to worry about or be afraid of. And the days seem to go by quickly, especially since you're in and out, it doesn't tie up your whole day and you feel OK to go ahead and lead your life. Days with chemo seemed to d-r-a-a-g by. And, of course, we were in chemo during the winter, too, which made it even more depressing. Good luck, all! ",

It was an amazingly accurate and beautifully written view of living with cancer, our \"uninvited guest.\"  I'll just share a bit of it: \"You dance when you can, you weep when you must. You notice what you have Instead of what you don't have You practice thankfulness And forgiveness.\" The poem was by Ruth Carter-Bourdon. She must have been through this herself.",

Before learning about this site, I never had heard of the Oncotype test, my surgeon never mentioned it, and it was not included in any of the written material given me after my diagnosis. I had my first appointment with the medical oncologist today, and I asked about Oncotype. She seemed pleased that I was a knowledgeable patient and said it was something she definitely recommended in my case, since I already fell into somewhat of a gray area, with micrometastasis in one node, which some doctors consider node-positive and some consider node-negative. She said my PR+ER+HER2- would argue against chemo, but the grade 3 tumor and the micrometastasis might argue for it. She said the Oncotype results would help both of us decide the best treatment, although she did warn, as many of you did also, that the results still could be inconclusive. But I want as much information as possible and will feel better making a decision on further treatment (chemo or no chemo) after hearing from the Oncotype, the CT scan and the bone scan. Again, this is a marvelous resource! ",
