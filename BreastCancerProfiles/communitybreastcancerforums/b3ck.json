Im writing here because I'm concerned about my breast and when I talk about it to others they brush me off and tell me its fine.. likely to comfort me but it actually just makes me feel like maybe they think I am over reacting... aany-who.... I had recently been having some dull pain in my left breast for the past few weeks.. nothing terrible but enough for me to notice... 3 days ago I woke up and my left breast was very sore, more of a dull, full pain. I took a look in the mirror and it was quite red. I whacked my bra on for the day and assumed it was the way I slept. That evening I took my bra off for the day and my boob felt heavy with a dull throb. There was a red mark that was about the size of a kiwi fruit (couldnt think of anything else).. that red mark was mostly over my breast and part of my nipple, then extending off that red mark (going up my breast and in towards my arm) was a ring of redness and the centre remained skin-coloured.. the next day, the exact same and no change. Today, I saw my gp. I showed her my breast and explained to her the past few days and my concerns about inflammatory breast cancer (i read a bit on google) and even though its unlikely i would like it ruled out. She told me there are no lumps in my breast and i would need to have lumps for it to be IBC (thats no right is it?).. anyway she has referred me to an ultrasound clinic and I will go and do that next week when they are open... Does this sound even remotely concerning? Should i request a biopsy if this redness doesnt subside?? At this point i just feel like im making something out of nothing. Log in to post a reply",
