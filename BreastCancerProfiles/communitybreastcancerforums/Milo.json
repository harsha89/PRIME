The tubes are from the pink October and have pink labels that show $4 of the purchase price supporting the Breast Cancer Research Foundation; plus they have pink caps. Besides being useful, these tubes of hand lotion will look appropriate at the chemo nursing station.",

I have been reviewing this site to learn more about what to except with my hair regrowth and I finally have a couple of items that I can add to help everyone. 1) I have used Latisse since it was introduced and I have always loved the product. Through a local spa, I joined the \u201cBrilliant Distinction\u201d program and received points on my Latisse purchases. I have been able to purchase it at two local spas in my city (no visit to a doc was necessary). Prices ranged from $90 to $120. Sometimes I was able to buy one get one free depending on the promo. Upon being diagnosed with BC I did some research. Latisse, also known as \u201cbimatoprost is made by Allergen. Allergen also makes \u201cLumigan\u201d which is also \u201cbimatoprost\u201d. Latisse and Lumigan are the same product (is this what some refer to as \u201cgeneric\u201d Latisse?). During one of my initial appointments with my oncologist I asked him whether Latisse and Lumigan were indeed the same product and could I just use Lumigan and save money? He went to his computer and did a few minutes of research and found they were indeed the same product. He gave me a prescription for Lumigan 3% which is covered under my prescription insurance so I am able to get a 3 month supply for about $10. At my 3 month PFC treatment appt with him, I had him renew the Lumigan prescription through 2013. I am fine with skipping my \u201cBrilliant Distinction\u201d points to save mega $$$. 2) Since I had already purchased Latisse and had 2 bottles on hand, I continued to use it during my chemo treatment. I had normal lashes all during my chemo and my brows thinned but looked normal. I don\u2019t know if Lastisse/Lumigan made my lash regrowth faster but here\u2019s my timeframe: May 1st \u2013 final chemo treatment \u2013 lashes seemed to thin out. May 8th \u2013 my lashes lost their color. May 10th \u2013 I did some research and found a wonderful person and she did lash extensions for me so I could look normal since my lashes had faded out May 18th all except 6 lashes have fallen out. Wore sunglasses outside and wore false eyelashes when necessary. June 21st \u2013 After constant looking at my lashes in my 10x mirror, I thought I had enough length on my top ashes to have new eyelash extensions done. But upon my visit to my eyelash professional, I sadly learned NOPE :( not enough length and I needed to wait. I was crushed. June 26 \u2013 Yay \u2013 I have enough length on my top lashes to have eyelash extensions done \u2013 SO BEAUTIFUL \u2013 I was happy to finally look \u201cnormal \u201c( normal as long as I wore my wig). My brows were also back and I had enough length on my bottom lashes to use Clinique bottom lash mascara- it has a super tiny mascara brush and works great on the bottom lashes. 3) I have about the same amount of hair as AEM as I am 2 weeks behind her final chemo treatment date. Unfortunately, the color of my hair resembles that of a calico cat. My natural color is a medium blonde. But my new hair growth is black, brown, red, white, gray and blonde. So in addition to having \u201cman hair\u201d, I have a disjointed hair color. Since I look HORRIBLE with short hair, I will need to continue to wear my wig for the foreseeable future. Ugh. My best to everyone! ",

The good news - it was 100% free of formaldehyde and formaldehyde derivatives, will last at least 3 months, and it makes my hair look much longer.  The bad news - it ended up costing me around $500 (I live in a large city), made the ends of my hair look split or crinkly, and it took about 4 hours to complete.   The super bad news is that I've had to have my hair trimmed 3 times since the straightening.  But the super good news is that I have hair that is 1.5 inches below my ear lobes. I stopped wearing my wig at the end of Dec 2012.  It was a very well made wig and still looked new, so I brought it and all its related accessories to a very large cancer center so they could give it to another women.  I was apprehensive about giving it away as I feared that doing so would lead me to have cancer again.  But I wanted to start 2013 fresh and have no cancer related items in my home.  So each, and every possession associated with going through chemo/radiation etc was given away or tossed before Jan 1 2013 (cancer books and clothes worn during treatments were donated, eyeliner, eyebrow pencil, false lashes were tossed.) I also tossed all leftover meds. The only thing I still have that is associated with breast cancer is a red folder with all the insurance statements and my medical records.   I hope I made the right decision giving my wig away - I am a triple negative BC person.",

He gave me a prescription for Lumigan 0.03% and he has since renewed it for a year.  Lumigan is really used is for glaucoma so that's why it is covered under normal health insurance.  Once Allergan realized it helped grow lashes, they slapped on a new name on the bottle and sold it as a cosmetic item and gave us the opportunity to pay full price for it. Ask your doc for a  prescription for Lumigan 0.03%. Ensure you get 0.03% as there is a 0.01% Lumigan too. The 0.01% Lumigan is weaker and therefore not the same strength as Latisse.  I used Lumigan every night all during chemo and every night since it ended.  As I mentioned in my post to AEM, I only lost my lashes once - right after chemo ended. Latisse comes with a huge number of small brushes that you are suppose to use with the liquid.  Those brushes absorb too much of the liquid.  I have my own very small brush that I use every night to apply the Lumigan.  This small brush came with some eyeshadow I had purchased (I had never used the brush for the eyeshadow) and the bristles absorb just the right amount of Lumigan and make application to my lash bases a breeze.  I keep the brush clean and store it in a container so I can prevent eye infections (never had a problem so far).  Once you get the hang of applying it to your lash bases (I use it on top and bottom lashes), it is easy and can become part of your nightly routine.    AEM - I am sorry Latisse/Lumigan has not been as kind to your lashes as it has been for others.  It's not fair. It's so upsetting to lose eye lashes once, so losing them several times is too cruel.  I hope you are now past the phase of losing your eyelashes any more times.  ",

I am curious to hear whether others have used Lumigan/Latisse and still suffered lash loss.   Hi All - Also, I checked into the cold caps.  My onc doc said that I would need to have a trained person with me all during chemo in order to change the cold caps.  Cold caps need to be replaced during chemo in order to keep the head \"frozen\".  My doc explained it wasn't an easy process to change out the caps.  My chemo area did have the freezer available for the cold caps though.  My wig was super super expensive, so the cold caps and help changing them would have cost me the same - but I could not find suitable help in changing the cold caps. I am hoping the process improves in case I ever have to go through this terrible process again. ",

In Jan 2012, I was diagnosed with triple negative BC and went through a lumpectomy, TC chemo and radiation. My radiation ended July 2012 and I had a few months of peace until July 2013 when my tumor markers jumped. In Sept 2013, my oncologist told me that my breast cancer had spread to 3 lesions on my spine and my average remaining life was 18 months to 2 years. I started Doxil in Sept 2013 and I have had monthly Doxil treatments since then. Next week, I will have my 25th Doxil treatment. I have been fortunate as Doxil has kept my cancer from spreading to another part of my body. My PET scans show no activity in the 3 lesions on my spine:) The only side effect that I have suffered from is skin problems on my feet (no sandals for me). I have been so fortunate to not having any heart problem problems due to this treatment (I do 4 spin classes every week). I've never had a port and had all chemo treatments via arm veins.. My life is completely normal and no one around me knows I have Stage 4 cancer and I go to chemo every month. Only 4 family members know I have stage 4 cancer. All medical people (ie dentist, nurses, dermatologist etch) say I don't look like I have cancer. I work 40-50 hours a week, travel for work and lead a very normal life. I feel very blessed and every day I am so grateful for my overall good health. My oncologist says he does not have any other patients who have had 24 Doxil treatments, had no significant side effects, and have had Doxil work to prevent cancer from reoccurring. My oncologist says I must remain on Doxil until it stops working. I have been looking for others in my same position. I think sccobie said she's had 14 treatments. Does anyone know of others in a long term relationship with Doxil? I think it would be great to get some advice? I can't imagine I can go on indefinitely with monthly Doxil treatments. I would like to be able to adjust my mind to my future. I wish you all much health and happiness. Thanks so much.",
