I am calling my doctor today as soon as the office opens, but I was wondering about vaginal bleeding.  I am having what is like a moderate period.  Is that common?  My doctor didn't mention it.  I had a little spotting the day of the surgery.  Then that went away for about a day.  Now I am having a regular flow. Also, when do the menopausal symptoms hit?  I have not had any yet, but I was borderline pre/post menopausal already.  I had this done since I cannot take tamoxifen or lupron or zolodex, and am ER/PR +.  I had taken arimidex for a few months with few SE's but then got period back. The ooph was done so I can take armidex again. Would love to hear any experiences, tips, from anyone who faced something similar.  Katherine, lumpectomy, SNB, mammosite radiation, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, Aromasin Dx 12/1/2008, IDC, 1cm, Stage I, Grade 1, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
