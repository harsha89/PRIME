    "Content": "bettychester wrote: I am 7 almost  8 weeks post lumpectomy surgery with sentinal node biopsy of right breast. Last week, my breast swelled, hurt, and was slightly red around my nipple and incision site.  The incision is right underneath my nipple.  I called the doctor on call since it was a holiday, and she precribed my antibiotics but if it worsens to go to urgent care.  Well, I went to see the surgeon this week and they said that it was a seroma.  And that I need to let antibiotics finish but if it worsens to get it drained. The area of incision  puckers in and that area and the nipple area is purple.  I'm not sure if I need to wait and follow orders and just wait until Monday to call or if this is something I need to worry about.  My nipple is sensitive and I have some shooting pains but rarely.  Please give me any advice.  I need to know if I should go to urgent care or not.
