      "Content": "catty1 wrote: I feel ill with worry and keep bursting into tears.  For some time I've had a mysterious itch deep in my left breast.  It came and went, and I figured it had something to do with my menstrual cycle.  Yesterday (Friday) the itching was more persistent, and now there is a rash there.  It's 5cm X 2cm, on the lower side of my breast.  I never had such symptoms in my right breast.  There is no swelling, hardness, or dimpling (yet).  I am VERY flat-chested, so it's doubtful to be from moisture.  Of course this developed on a Friday when my Dr's office is closed.  I am scared enough to go to the ER, but I know they'll just tell me to follow up with my own Dr. ASAP.  So I'm waiting with bated breath till Monday, hoping he can see me that day.  I don't want to waste time with a mammogram and just want a biopsy first thing.  Is this reasonable?  I'm so scared.  Thanks for listening.  (My age is 47; no history at all of cancer in my family).  Log in to post a reply",
