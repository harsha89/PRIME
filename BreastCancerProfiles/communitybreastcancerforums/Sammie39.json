In the UK, there are charities and campaigns to support and help fight BC all the time. Your story surprises me because there are times when people who have a serious illness in the UK, can be sent to the US for life saving treatment that they don't have here. It's a funny old world. Thank you for your reply somanywomen and wishes of Good Luck. I am already saying the John Lennon quote to myself. Thank you!",

I don't understand B9, though I'm sure this will all become clearer when I go to the clinic. I have been having discomfort since last night. It's not painful, it's just strange. I'm hoping it's all in my mind because I'm aware of what it could be. Today my shoulder blade feels heavy as does my breast and I have a burning sensation in my nipple. I feel a bit grubby as well, like I haven't bathed for a week, lol. It's the strangest feeling...I had a cyst in my twentie's, I don't remember it feeling anything like this. I'm convinced it's a little bit more serious than a cyst. Women should trust their instincts but this is something I hope I've got wrong. I understand there are different kinds of BC, I just hope mine is an innocent bump and all these weird sensations are all in my mind. I will let you know the results when I know! I am already feel the love and support and I haven't even had a diagnosis yet. Thank you again Lisa.",

Jinnypel, my doctor faxed the information through to the breast clinic whilst I was in the surgery, I had to follow it up by phoning for an appointment on the monday. Mollymo, I did get my appointment within 2 weeks but only just. I think they're cruel making me wait so long. I have until thursday afternoon to go and then hopefully all will be a lot clearer. Have to go, my son has just got up. Be back this afternoon. xxx",

I will keep my fingers crossed for you Lace08 and just hope that we have innocent lumps.  I think the worse part so far is realising we had lumps but not getting them checked sooner. I'm sure we'll be fine :-)! It's good to know we can let off steam on these forums with other women who understand and have been or are going through the same thing. Thank you to you all. Be back thursday evening! xx ",

Why didn't I visit the doctor ages ago? I felt the lump again thursday night whilst having a good grope after removing my bra...what a relief (when you take your bra off, not finding the lump) :-) This time was different though, after I felt and prodded, I was left with a noticable ache, it wasn't painful but it felt strange, I can't explain the feeling I had for the rest of that evening. I went to see my nurse yesterday who felt the lump too and said I ought to see the doctor. I saw him in the afternoon, he has given me the number of the breast clinic, I have to phone them monday for an appointment and will be seen within two weeks. What I'm concerned about is I've had an itchy nipple for some months and put that down to the detergents I wash my clothes in and when I squeezed my nipple sometime ago, a clear liquid came out. I thought this was down to breast feeding which I might add, I stopped 15 years ago? why have I been so bloody ignorant, I'm 39 years old and I'm the first one to tell people to get checked if they're worried about their health. I'm really worried now, I didn't ignore the lump, It just didn't enter my head what it could be. I feel really foolish and am hoping and praying it's just a cyst. My breast feels odd today, not to touch but just weird, like a very faint burning sensation inside. I think I'm being paranoid and it's just on my mind because I know there is a lump there now, but when I look back at the changes I've had over the months, I'm thinking how stupid I have been for not doing something about it sooner. All sorts of things have been going through my head today and I'm feeling really anxious.I wondered if anyone else experienced the changes I have?  I'd appreciate any reply, just don't be cross at me for being so dumb.

It's been a very long weekend and I have been getting upset, especially at bedtime, though not in front of my 15 year old son. I've never looked forward to making a phonecall as much as I am this one tomorrow morning. I know that sounds a bit silly  but I have become increasingly anxious since friday and am desperate to get things moving. I will take your advice and hopefully I won't have to wait another two weeks for an appointment. I will be back with good news, fingers crossed. Thank you again Anna.",

Of course B9 is benign, tut, tut how daft am I, lol :-). I called the clinic and explained my symptoms and how worried I am but the earliest appoinment they could offer me is  the 18th Feb! The woman said I can call tomorrow to see if there's any cancellations, I will do that but as I said to Kerry above, I have taken comfort in the fact that there are several different types of reason's why the breast may develop a lump, so I think that's what will keep me going. I confided in a good friend yesterday who told me she had a lump removed 13 years ago. I'm meeting her tomorrow and she will help me stay positive too. Thank you Anna, I'll be in touch soon!",
