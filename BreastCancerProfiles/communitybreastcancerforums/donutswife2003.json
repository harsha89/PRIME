I have this tight band across my chest that feels like a band of steel being clamped down and pain radiating from one shoulder blade down the inner side of my arm. What's up? These symptoms seem to get worse when I am tired or stressed. I did not have reconstruction so that isn't the issue. Over all I would say my recovery went well up until the last few months. I guess I am just wishing someone could tell me I am just crazy and maybe that will make me feel better. No one seems to understand or they look at you like you are crazy. My family sees me going about my nornal day, working, etc and think everything is normal as it  should be and just don't realize the physical discomfort involved with  daily living. Any suggestions??

My report says present perineural infiltrates. I know this relates to a nerve but as far as the cancer goes I'm not sure. Margins were clean. I felt comfortable when my surgeon went over the report with me but he didn't mention anything about the infiltrates. Am I just reading something that is nothing or should I be concerned? I also get some shoulder discomfort in that side after I have been up and doing things throughout the day. I see the oncologist for the first time this week for further followup.
