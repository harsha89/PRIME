My son is wondering what is wrong with Mommy because I was crying during service.  Having people coming up and telling me they are sorry is really surreal (Liefie -- you are spot on the surreal part.)  The journal is a great idea as I already seem to have my notes scattered around.... thanks to outdamnspot for that advice.  I had a notebook, but it's too big and I have a leather journal that is just right to go in the purse.  Bevin, really really appreciate your input on talking to my little one.  I want him to know it's serious, but only what he really needs to know and you helped give that some perspective.  Afterall, he doesn't know what \"cancer\" is or means. Lastly, if anyone has any good books they have read on BC, that really helped them understand and get through, I'm interested to hear.  Thanks again everyone.  It has been helpful to vent and be unjudged.

PICC line inquirers--- I've had my PICC since I started chemo. It is what I would call \"bothersome\". It is a serious decision. You can't take the PICC in and out between chemo's. The PICC is a cardiac catheter. The tube is inserted through your arm into a large vein. The tube runs from your arm all the way to the very top of your heart. Make sure you understand what you are getting, why, potential complications and the ongoing care regimen. You cannot get the external PICC line or entry site wet...no swimming, Saran wrapped and taped for shower and bath time. If you have it for an extended time, it itches (a lot!). It is always covered with a tight clear-view PICC bandage and a mesh sleeve which is changed weekly by an RN. If you have any other questions let me know. I don't mind answering.",

Sorry, I'm skipping around on a lot of subjects to catch up. Jen, so glad you brought up the subject. I feel weird too with little hair and one boob, and I'm premenopausal. I listen to a speech from my Onc every time I go about double up protection (which I did purchase and left visibly on my honey's night table).......ha! If only I needed to. I can't stop coughing for 2 seconds. Since my DX, last September....de nada. I think I qualify for the Nun convent. ⛪ Sigh. I was hoping for the chemo to kill my horrible periods, but NOOO, just like my leg hair....hanging on. My friend says I should see a therapist on the subject......hmmmm. I'm thinking it over. This week I had to deal with kids in my son's class, 2nd grade trying to figure out if I'm wearing a wig. He's very embarrassed over it. I have 1 week before my 4th AC.

I don't find it bothersome for regular activities (like a lot of things we have to endure...you get used to it!), but it itches like crazy because your skin is sealed under a clear patch of \"bandage\" at all times. Realize that you have a tube coming outside your boda y that goes straight to your heart, so being super careful about infection is an understatement! You cannot get it wet. You should Saran Wrap and tape before every bath or shower, adds to skin irritation ( I got these plastic bag wraps that cinch up from online...but they don't work the best). Other things to know... It is not small. I have 2 small tubes but they have caps that are about 3/8 inch diameter and about 1-1/4 inch long, that requires that you wear a mesh sock at all times to hold it close to your body. You will need to wear at least 3/4 sleeve shirt to cover it up. The PICC runs from your arm to just above your heart. So, there are very serious risks, including Deep Vein thrombosis, highly recommend you read up on that. My surgeon refused to do portocath, so I went with PICC because I had 16 infusions ahead of me....and I bruise really easy. At that time I was already black and blue on both arms just from all the testing. If there is anything else you want to know, please ask! Good luck, Dawn",

I'm taking control today and shaving it off. Anyway, all you BC Warrior Princesses keep the faith! We are on a journey through this valley and we will prevail. Rock on!",

I am so jealous of you exercisers...so I am determined to hop on my elliptical today, even if I slide off after 5 minutes. It's raining in So Cal this morning, so no walking! I am on day 11 post AC#3. #3 has been a doozy...... I trust God has a plan, but He is sure is challenging me this week. My 7yo boy having school issues, my work division is in process of being sold (don't know if I will have a job to go back to), my right hand at work gave her resignation to me yesterday, and I am Still fighting the bronchitis and voice issues. Sigh. 😳 Something good will come out of all this. Lord, provide patience and strength please! Nicole, you have a great sense of humor. Loved the seal comparison. You have made me laugh so hard, which hasn't been easy for me to do. I think I'm suffering mild depression, but I'm just stubborn as hell and I don't want to start taking meds for it (Mom is bipolar and takes lots of meds). Anyway, back to the slick body.... I was SO hoping to not have to shave for this time; it was supposed to be a highlight! I lost ~97% of my head hair, but that 3% is hanging tough and growing!!!! My lashes, eyebrows, legs, and arms are like they always have been. Still having to shave the legs regularly. But armpits and girl parts are \"seal skin\". Hahaha! Glad to hear a lot of you are having similar happenings....it's nice to not be alone! Is anyone else dealing with insanely dry skin from AC? I'm so bad, like I have never experienced before! I am a desert. I am even using a form of infused olive oil now to try to relieve it....plus I noticed new wrinkles in my face. Oh NO!!!!!. I am working on getting enough liquid in the system to stay hydrated. Any suggestions? Finally, I can't remember which of you recommended the BUFF head covers......but THANK YOU!!!!!!!!! I ordered and I love them. I even got one for my little guy and he loves it too! I wear it for sleeping to keep my head warm at night, so much better than sleep caps I tried before (darn seams hurt my sensitive head). And I wear them all the time except when I'm \"wigging out\"! 😃 Thanks for being here..... Dawn",

Thanks for all the well wishes for my next round of AC tomorrow. #4 and Im a nervous wreck hoping it won't kick me into relapse of the bronchitis, which I finally crawled out of after 7 weeks. Round 3 was hell and my energy is still missing! I had the same trouble with food and drink last round. Nothing tasted good. Someone recommended ginger ale and it is ok. I found some diet Canada Dry...just so I won't be drinking so many calories in juice. Water is just disgusting, can't stand the thought of it after the chemo. So I'm inhaling it like crazy today. After AC, I have 12 weekly infusions of Taxol. Anyone else taking this regimen? Prayers lifted for all of us. Best of luck to Nicole, who is just a few days behind me for AC4. Dawn",

The past couple of days have been hard, emotionally and physically. I have a 7 yo son who has been sick with a virus for 2 weeks. Despite masks, gloves, hand washing....I caught the crud. Been coughing my head off. Had to take a trip to ER on Sunday, spent hours there getting lots of blood tests and cultures. My WBC are extremely low, but they sent me home to rest, drink liquids, and watch my temp. At least the ER Doc had a great sense of humor and his wife had been through BC. The biggest thing is that my hair is now coming out by the fistfuls. It is disheartening. No matter how much you think you prepared mentally for this moment.....it comes and it sucks big time. I have a plethora of scarves, 2 wigs, and a few hats. But geez, I was really hoping that against all odds that it would hang on. I knew that this was \"the week\"....and so I noticed I've been putting my hands through my hair a lot. So when you start getting a lot in your hand. Whaaaaaaaaaa! So I crawled into my shower, sat on the shower stool and bawled until the hot water heater ran out. This morning my pillow is full of hair and I'm thinking maybe today is GI Jane Day. Today is my 19th anniversary. Dear Husband, welcome to your new wife. Chrisvel, I'm with you in heart. Today's the day! Good luck. <3",

I also get the bloated, swollen tummy (along w my burping, farting, nausea, and lethargy). This morning my 7 yr old touched my stomach and asked, \"Mom, is that your BELLY?!?!?\" There's no filtering what my boy thinks! It's good to be able to laugh about all this mess though. We can get through it! Thanks for the tip on the grape w lemon sparkling... Will definitely try this. I will also be on my last round of AC in about a month, Feb 4th. I can hardly wait to get it over with. They say the taxol is not nearly as bad. I am hoping and praying for truth in that statement! Peggy, I haven't had the magic mouthwash, but baking soda and salt in warm water is good to help ease the irritation. I had bronchitis for 6 weeks (not fully recovered yet as chemo seems to trigger snot and coughing all over again), plus I had laryngitis. I ended up at the throat specialist since I had no voice for 4+ weeks. He said AC is causing acid reflux, inflaming your voice box, causing the loss of your voice. Who would have known that? Only one thing is for sure, there is never a dull moment on AC! :). So take good care of your throat! ~Dawn",

Kiwi, please do try the Pepcid AC, even though you may not think you are having acid issues, that's what that feeling like you have food caught in the back of your throat is! I had it too! I also lost my voice for 4 weeks to the acid and did not think I was having acid problems either. Then I went to a throat Dr and he told me otherwise! Give it a try.... Dawn",

Now I guess I will go check out the weekly taxol board since that's next for me. I've had the heat rash and hot flashes every time with AC. My MO scared me about taxol (the steroid highs and lows, neuropathy, cumulative tiredness). So I want to see what everyone else has to say. Hope everyone has light SEs this weekend. Hugs, D",
