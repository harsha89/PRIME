I have a hx of blood clots, Deep vein thrombosis. have survived 3 pulmonary embolisms. and as a result of the bloodclots had to have a complete hysterectomy at age 22. i am not on hormones. but since october i noticed a pea sized lump in my left armpit. in february i went to the dr. who said it was just swollen lymph node. went to a different dr. in april which by this time the pea sized lump was bigger ..felt like it was underneath the pectoral muscle. doc sent me to a surgeon who says he didnt feel anything there..sends me to have an MRI of the armpit. MRI is negative. but now this mass is worse ..its now making the top part of my pectoral muscle feel stiff like a stick to your ribs kind of feeling and my left breast area is numb even the nipple 80% of the time. shoudl i go to another dr? please give me some advice ..any will do ..thank you ..oh yeah i'm only 29 too.  Reese reesespcs Log in to post a reply",
