My tumors were to big and have to have chemo first i go for my 3rd treatment tomorrow and then 3 more to go. Then I'll have surgery i'm opying for double mast with implants so i have to have expanders. Do you know long before they switch them out for implants? I'm gald to hear you still have cleavage. I'm a dd and the dr said i would be less than half that size and that upsets me. Did the rads shrink it alot? I'm glad everything worked out for you.",
