I have had 2 benign fibroadenomas, 1 borderline phyllodes and 4 benign phyllodes removed with 19 unknown tumors remaining between both breasts. I'm scheduled to have my follow up with my surgeon on friday and I'm looking for any advice you can give! My surgeon just keeps saying there isnt much of a difference between the two types of tumors that its not a big deal that I have so many that its common. I'm just so frustrated with her and I dont know what to do! She already told me with all of my scar tissue and tumors I wont be able to breast feed ever and she hates to even take out the tumors and doesnt believe in MRIs. This cant be normal... thanks for listening... *Meg Log in to post a reply",

I am so stressed out over all of this it feels like its never ending. Hopefully I can find a good specialist for these. My ObGyn told me he would be happy to write me all the referrals I need because even he had no idea what a phyllodes tumor was. Its so frustrating to have something that very few people know anything about. I have my post op appointment with my surgeon tomorrow and I've printed her out articles from countless medical journals on these things because I know shes just going to say \"phyllodes... fibroadenoma... they're all the same!\" She actually did say that... I just hope tomorrow goes well its going to be a busy one! Thanks again for the link! *Meg",

Before my last lumpectomy last friday my surgeon and I talked about my situation and I asked her if that was an option and she said she wouldnt do that for me at my age but now that the 4 tumors that came out were all pedunculated phyllodes I'm hoping she might have a change of heart I dont know. Yes these were benign but I've now had them come out of both breasts and the first one was borderline. I'm still bruised up and hurting from my surgery and I'm so sick of the emotional roller-coaster every time I have them taken out that I dont know what else to do. So I actually dont mind hearing that since my surgeon made me feel kind of crazy for considering that. I spent my day today figuring out a back up plan and getting my test results and films in order to get a second opinion on all of this at one of the big hospitals in Chicago. I dont know how so many woman are so strong this just drains me... *Meg",
