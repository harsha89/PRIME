I am bracing myself while at the same time I am doing ALOT of self talk trying to keep my head in line. I had trouble keeping my head on before BC .....Ha! Its going to to be harder without the weight of my very thick hair...which is being chopped off tomorrow...oh boy. Any tips for the fatigue, anyone worry about driving. My husband will drive if I need him to but what a pain...actually he won't let me while on dexamethasone...too manic for him I guess. I did tell him to not let me have access to credit cards on dex days. Bad plan. Spent about 500$ today before 10 am... granted its xmas...but thats usually my whole xmas budget not just one trip to walmart and llbean! Ella1",
