    "Content": "Apr 15, 2018 03:17PM - edited Apr 15, 2018 03:20PM by GmaJoLynn I continue to be amazed by the comments made by my plastic surgeons (started with one and then after she told me \"I'm just frustrated with you and you need to see Dr. (noname), who is in the same office)\". They have both made comments that were terrible. I had immediate reconstruction and the PS came in my hospital room and told me what size she put in and laughed and said \"I had to really work to get it in\". The fact is I had told her no larger than 500 cc (to match my other breast) and she measured all the breast tissue removed (even the tissue taken out from my armpit (lymph nodes, etc) and weighed them and it weighed 550 so she put in a 550 size implant. It didn't take and three days later when they took my bandages off my skin was black (the size of my hand, fingers included). It made me sick. I have now had 5 reconstructive surgeries and my skin is SO thin. I am concerned and going to go back and talk to the PS about it. I'm thinking of having it (left side) removed and not replacing it. It's in my armpit and has drifted down and sideways. It feels like I constantly have something under my arm. I wish I would never had immediate reconstruction and I will probably end up having the implant taken out. I don't have the strength I used to have and it looks horrible. I would rather be flat and strong and comfortable in my own skin. I'm sorry you had to go through this. I can't believe how uncaring and brutal the comments are that I have received from my PS(s), both in the same office. So many rude comments that I am astounded at their lack of professionalism. I guess that's why it's good we have this site, so we know we are not alone in being treated poorly. It's hard because at the point where I was getting the rude comments I was dependent on them to fix me so I didn't tell them how rude they were. But when I'm done, I'm going to write the state medical board. I don't think I will even let them touch me again. I don't know where to go to get it removed. I live in Alaska and I could go to Seattle but I don't who to see and I'm scared of getting a quack... I respect your decision to not have reconstruction. I guess medical personal are human and just like the general population there are people that are rude, disrespectful and just plain cruel. Doesn't make it right. Some PS are so arrogant and if you mention anything you don't like they cop an attitude, like how dare you criticize my work. Jerks!",
