I have ICD invasive ductal carcinoma, had a partial radial masectomy about a month ago. Officially, I'm Stage II N1, if you know what that means. masectomy about a month ago. I was the other extreme. I found the lump on a Thurs, ultrsound on Friday, biopsy Monday, Surgery on Wednesday. It was like a tornado. I think anybody who is that insenitive to your condition is \"burnt-out\" and should stop praticing medicine. Your decision to go somewhere else was absolutely the right one.  ",

I'm getting 6 treatments every three weeks. The first treatment itself was tough, can I didn't know what to expect. Since then the side effects and not bad. I currently have neutropenia (low white cell count) and have had a couple of injections of \"neupogen\". Would love to share experiences. I jst jeard about this webpage from someone today. I have read alot about my cancer-- oh I have ICD invasive ductal carcinoma, had a partial radial masectomy about a month ago. Officially, I'm Stage II N1, if you know what that means.",
