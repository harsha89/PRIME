About 7 days ago my left side got a little red and is sore from just under the breast to the end of my rib cage. I did go to a doctor, but she did not know what it could be. Her advice is to watch it for now. The pain is not strong and I don't need to take any medication. The fact that there is some pain, tells me something is wrong. Any ideas? Thanks, Sawen Log in to post a reply",
