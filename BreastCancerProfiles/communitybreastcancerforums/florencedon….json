My concern has been about metastases, not about local recurrence in the scar or a new primary breast cancer.  My onc estimates a 10% lifetime risk of a brand new breast cancer. If you want to talk to your oncologist again I would specifically ask him ... What does he mean by 80% chance of recurrence, does he mean 80% chance of metastases or 80 % chance of metastases, local recurrence or a new primary? You are 3 years out from diagnosis (yah!!!), How does the passage of time without metastasis affect your odds of developing metastasis? I assume you are able to tolerate whatever treatment was recommended; how does completing treatment affect the estimate? (prior to the injections for low blood counts and the drugs for nausea, a huge percentage of people could not complete the recommended chemo plan) I would suggest talking to him because I think it is likely that you will hear information that is more hopeful.  If you do decide to have this talk, give the onc notice you want to talk about this so he is  prepared and you may want to bring someone with you. Some food for thought:  I am in the health care field.  Now that I am attuned to breast cancer, I ask women much more about their breast cancer than I did in the past.  I am upset frequently to find women who don't know much about their breast cancer and are not taking their tamoxifen.  I assume the sisters on bc.org will have a better prognosis because they are informed about the disease.  I am sure being on this site decreases you lifetime risk by 5% I wonder how treatment will change when circulating tumor cell tests are more common.  will we change treatments when there is an increase in tumor cells circulating in the blood even before they settle in to grow in the bone or liver?  If you develop mets five years from now, we'll have more treatments than we do now.    The glass is 3/4's full!  donna",
