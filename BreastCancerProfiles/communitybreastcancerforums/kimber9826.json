Just this Sunday, I felt a large lump on my right breast. Called my doc Monday morning and had my visit today. He did a breast exam, and I showed him the lump I found. He continued to feel along my right breast and found another one under the large one I found that is around the size of a walnut. He then proceeded to the left breast and found two more smaller lumps. His facial expression alone scared me to death. He has schedule me for a Ultrasound rather than a mammogram due to me having breast implants. It will take a few weeks to actually have the test due to my area and limited space, although he told me he would make sure they knew it was urgent and to wait for the call/appointment. Is an ultrasound good enough to understand if these are not cysts? I would image they would perform a biopsy but now after reading a little I'm questioning why my doc would make me wait so long if he had concerns or why not just get a biopsy asap at the hospital.
