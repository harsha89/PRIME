However, it had been almost a year and here i am with this pink mark on my right breast. It doesnt really hurt, its just there?? Not sure how to make it go away but it looks like a small light bruise with a peeled pink spot in the middle, both flat . Really strange to me. Currently i don't have the money for an appointment, i will though if I know its serious. Log in to post a reply",
