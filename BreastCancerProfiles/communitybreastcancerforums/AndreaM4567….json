Really, thank you everyone. I am going to take a very deep breath and do what I need to do for my husband and children.",

All this time I've been paying so much to get my hair done and now I am getting it undone. So shouldn't the fee go backwards? LOL! I will see if my neighbor will do it. I am not sure how she would feel about it. I do not want to see it fall out. I think it will be too hard. Thanks again!",

      "Content": "Apr 13, 2008 06:20PM AndreaM4567 wrote: Hi, I am two weeks post DIEP on Tuesday. So I think I can answer some of your questions. 1. How long does the surgery take? I was told 8-10 hours. Mine was 13. 5 hours because I am plus sized so there was a lot of tissue to work with. Also, they found a large hernia that needed to be repaired. So I had a few extras happen during my surgery. 2. What is the immediate post-op recovery like?  Following my last WLE I awoke with the worst thirst ever and a very sore throat. I woke up wonderfully believe it or not. But I made sure that I told everyone that would listen how much trouble I have with anesthesia. Everything from hard time breathing to panic attacks. As a result, it was the best anesthesia experience I have ever had. Even at 13. 5 hours. Yes, my throat was slightly irritated but nothing that bigged me for a long period of time. But they will tell you that it will be sore, so expect it. I kept asking for the nurses to moisten my mouth with a sponge and that helped. It seemed like the morphine dried my mouth out terribly which also effected my mouth. They were very kind with that sponge. Ask for it as often as you need to. Also ask them to put ice in the cup because the coolness was heavenly! I remember saying I was nauseated out of surgery so they gave me nice meds for that. I remember I was sick per se but more stressed and had that knot in my tummy. So I asked for nausea medicine 3 times. It was wonderful because it put me right back out. 3.  How long do you have to stay on bed-rest for? They get you up within 48 hours. I refused on day 3 because I was in so much pain. They are absolutely rabid about you getting up. I understand why but I wanted to call my own shots. I know my own body and it was never my intention to sit and wallow but I was in pain. So I did the breathing machine exercises and that made them happy. Today is day 12 and I actually feel \"ok\". I heal very quickly and I have to say, this has been the hardest thing I have ever done. Do not expect much for at least 2 weeks! 4. How much pain is there? Ask if they are going to give you abdominal pain blasters. They are like hoses with holes all along them that release pain medication into your belly. Heaven! I had no abdominal pain until today and it is just my incision pulling. Other pain, not so bad. Hit your morphine pump often! I had mine for 4 days. Then I went onto pill form Morphine which lasts longer but I didn't like it as much. Now I am on Norco (a stronger version of Vicodin). I was also on Diluadid which I do not like. 5. How long do the drains stay in for? I had 5 drains. One came out right before I went home on day 6. The others I still have. 6.  How much did it restrict movement?  Did the Surgeons say not to do certain things? No lifting over 5 lbs. for 6 weeks. But it will not matter because frankly, I can't pick anything up. My right arm won't go above my shoulder and my left arm is a tiny bit weak. 7.  What about the girdle thingy?  And support bra?  How easy were they to live with? I do not have any girdles, bras, etc. I am open which is kind of nice because the pain meds make me hot and sweaty. 8.  What about going back to work?  I'm a Nurse so working in a very busy environment? At least 6 weeks. Right now I am even wondering if I will be ready to do anything at 6 weeks. They are assuring me I will be but right now I can barely walk to the restroom still. Please do not be in a rush! Any other questions, ask away. :)",
