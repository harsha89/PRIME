Worst when any fabric touches skin but bad even with no shirt on. Surgeon's office recommended 800mg ibuprofen every 6 hours and to check in tomorrow if that doesn't help. I may ask about topical ointment instead of Gabapentin or other drugs based on comments in this thread. Only relief I've found so far is putting ice packs across chest but can't sit around all day with them on. Thanks all for helping me know I'm not just dreaming up this pain! Just sorry others have experienced it too.",
