The top was definitely slower than all the rest. It has been 4 1/2 months since I finished chemo. The top of my hair has filled in completely no holes showing but it is still somewhat shorter than the back and sides of my hair. Don't know why it comes in like this but it all fills in after awhile. So don't worry you will get hair on the top of your head!! LOL Karen",

Now it's been about a month longer and it does not have any fuzzy at all straight and thick. I have about 1 inch and I am almost five months since the end of my chemo. What I use which I do not know if it helps but it seems to is Protein Powder. My brother who is a health nut insisted I try it and I believe it has helped with thickness.   I thick the hair on top is fuzzy because it is the last hair to come in. At least for me it was I had a lot on the back and sides and than the top came in. You look great just tell yourself at least I have hair!! LOL Karen",

I just wanted to say that on the first day of Chemo I was as anxious as could be but it was really nothing. I had blood work first which included getting an IV (not sure why they didn't give me a port), than a visit with the doctor (they take your weight,blood pressure and temperature) than off to the chemo area. The room I had was very nice it overlooked Boston. They started the IV and the nurse stayed with me to make sure I didn't have any reactions which I didn't. I really didn't feel a thing. It took about two hours for the AC chemo and than I went home. I was very lucky I experienced loss of apetitie, but no nausea. Around day three I would begin to feel tired but within a couple of days my energy would be back. It definitely was doable. I did lose all my hair, most of my eyebrows and eyelashes and all the other hair on my body. That was probably the hardest part for me. Now it is six months since chemo and I have a full head of hair. I hope the best for all of you and you will all be in my prayers tonite. Karen",

I can honestly say that it was not that bad. With the AC I was lucky I did not experience the naseau but I did have loss of appetite so I had to force myself to eat, my taste buds were off. With the Taxol my appetite returned but I experienced more fatigue and some muscle aches which I took (2) Advil for and it helped. I also worked full time through my treatments ( 32 hours a week) except for the treatment days. I completely understand how you feel about hair loss. It was the hardest part for me but honestly once it happens and a few weeks pass you accept it and move on. I bought some wigs but I felt most comfortable in hats. Now I'm looking forward to my hair returning. I kept telling myself four - six months without hair is not bad when you know that the chemo is killing the cancer. I didn't try the cold cap because my treatment was in Boston and they didn't offer it. I will keep checking in. Feel free to ask any questions about my treatments. I will help in anyway I can. KAT",
