I was diagnosed 4/7 and had double masectomy (left radical)scheduled for 4/24 then had it on 4/30/2014. Getting ready to schedule reconstruction surgery but want to wait till after summer. I finish infusions in July and want to get scan results before more surgeries. I Like to believe that the surgery was successful, that the cancer was removed, but the risk of spreading was so great the doctors weren't gonna do surgery.? So I don't like to list the diagnosis cause I don't like to look at it. (IDC ER+ PR+ HER2+ 4cm IIIa grade 3 7of10 lymph) Looking forward to visiting with survivors that have gone through treatment, thanks, Amy",
