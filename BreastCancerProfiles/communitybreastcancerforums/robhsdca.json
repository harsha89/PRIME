I am sure I am no more scared than anyone else is in this situation, but I am scared and could use some help trying to decipher our biopsy report. It's a Friday and we just met with our family doc who could not/would not tell us much but just referred us to an oncologist that we are waiting to hear from to get in and see. We have a 4 year old daughter and a brilliant life ahead of us that we have fought to build, and now have nothing but time and our imaginations to eat away at us. So I am here to hopefully get some help from you all with our biopsy report. Anything you can provide in plain English, and straight talk without sugar coating anything will be appreciated. Here is what I am looking at: Panel of Immunohistochemical stains for tumor is as follows: P63: Negative, indicative of absence of myoepithelial cells E.Cadherin: Positive, indicative of Ductal differentiation CK-Pan: Positive for Tumor Bloom Richardson Score 6/9: Tubular Formation: 3/3 Nuclear Grade: 2/3 Mitotic Activity: 1/3 Ductal Carcinoma In-Situ: Not Identified Vascular Lymphatic Space Invasion: Not Identified Lymphoplasmacytic Response: Mild Thanks in Advance!

I want to understand the Bloom Richardson and how it may relate to what's going on, and so much more. I just want to be able to wrap my brain around it all so we can be ready to attack.",

We have not seen the oncologist yet---diagnosis was just on Friday and today is only Monday, but the weekend in between was an interesting mix of hope and worry. One of the things we find hardest to swallow right now is that as a matter of annual routine, she had a mammogram just back in October, and now this has shown up only a couple months later with differing tumor sizes told to us, ranging between 3 and 6cm. I personally am astonished if a tumor of 6cm exists that it could have grown from nothing in a mammogram just a few months back, especially with the mitotic score of 1. I am very grateful my wife found this in just routinely examining herself upon feeling some pain. I think that once we have a plan in place, even though the surgery and treatment will be a difficult process, just knowing what we are facing and what we are doing will make a huge difference in how we are feeling about it all. On a side note, to piggy back to your picture Sandy, on Saturday we decided we wanted just a fun, family day and we have annual passes to Knott's Berry Farm---when we got there they were in the middle of their \"Fight for a Cure\" annual celebration that we were not aware they even did. Maybe a sign in itself---we sure took it that way! ",

Nothing is showing on MRI's or any other test in the left. The doctor is suggesting a lumpectomy with node removal, followed by radiation and then chemo if they feel it is necessary at that point. She also told us where we are at leads to an 80% survival rate, which my wife was happy to hear and it scared the hell out of me---two opposite reactions. Either way, we are encouraged some now that we have some direction and looking forward to getting moving on surgery and treatment very soon, following some genetic testing to rule out gene mutations.",
