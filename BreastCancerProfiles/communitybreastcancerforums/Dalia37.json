And I still have sensitive skin, it hurts a little and is bothering me all the time, it is like a dull pain, constant, always there. Last month I had a follow up and doctor told me that it was normal to be sore and that the pain would be chronic but he didn't seem concerned about it. I thought the pain was due to the mastectomy but he thought it was all together and that it wouldnt go away, so now I don't worry about it.",
