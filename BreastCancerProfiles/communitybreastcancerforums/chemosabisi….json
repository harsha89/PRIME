My path will then be Xeloda and Tykerb. I still just numb.  Don't know how to react to this news.  I know sometime soon, I will get angry and thats what I need because I'm going to fight this with everything I have. It feels good to be back, I have missed talking to so many of you. Nicki",

I have a very good friend who set up a blog for me.  If anyone is interested its in my signature here now. I did speak with the Thoracic Surgeons nurse yesterday and I have an appointment on Tuesday, March 17th.  So things seem to be moving along.  Once again thanks for you support.
