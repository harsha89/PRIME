My first chemo treatment was 11-11 and I am so glad to have #1 (out of four) done and behind me! I really think that anticipation was the worst thing about it! Everything went smoothly the day of my treatment and I have had virtually no side effects other than a little heartburn, a mild headache and a little general achyness. Advil worked like a charm though. My taste is a bit off, but that isn't stopping me from eating at all. I was able to walk 2-3 miles every day (including day of treatment) and I'm back at work full time (until the next treatment.) I did take the rest of last week off as I didn't know how it would affect me, but in reality, I could have worked if needed to. I just wanted to post some encouragement for those of you just starting! You might be JUST FINE! I hope you all are!!!! My second treatment is December 2nd. Knocking on wood that one goes as smoothly. Hugs to everyone!",

I went to emergency room and they didn't know what it was, but did US and ruled out it being anything that would kill me before I saw my GP. Went to my GP and she didn't know what it was either, but called me later that night and had talked to a breast specialist about me and said that was what it was. It went away in a week or so. I don't think any of my doctors have seen it show up that long after surgery. But it is fine now. I do do yoga 4 times per week, which really helps keeps that area under my armpit somewhat loose, but it is definitely still not quite as flexible as my other arm 2 1/2 years after surgery. That is the one things that reminds me of cancer every single day is that tightness in my breast and armpit",

After the lumpectomy had healed, my breast and arm felt pretty much normal. It was the radiation that really tightens up the area and I believe is why I'm still feeling tightness. I had read that it takes a good year to recover from radiation, but I think I'm on the lifetime plan. It certainly isn't like it is pain or anything, just a tightness - a friendly reminder of the disease. Just an FYI - I did hot yoga during most of chemo and radiation, but had to stop during the last few weeks of radiation and until my open sores healed. They didn't want sweat getting in the sores or the rubbing of the fabric on my breast. I did get fairly badly burned compared to most people according to my radiologists, even though I didn't really think it was bad as far as pain goes or anything. Very manageable in my opinion (although not going to yoga killed me!)",

It was a surprise to learn of one positive node and that chemo was recommended. Standards still are the chemo is recommended if any nodes are positive. The Oncotype test didn't trump that in my MOs opinion. She would have been ok with me not doing chemo, but with an Oncotype score of 19 and one positive node, both my first and second opinion oncologists recommened chemo. As much as I tried to get out of it, who am I to question someone who was many years experienced in the field with my internet research?",
