Generally speaking, I have a pretty high pain tolerance. But I just tried to really touch it for the first time since the procedure, and it actually made me nauseous it hurt so much. I have a good sized circular bruise from the procedure that is about 3 inches wide by 3 inches tall, but it hurts like heck even beyond the bruising, no matter where I try to press on it. Is this normal?! Kirstin Log in to post a reply",

In my case, they biopsied two spots; he used the same incision for both, but he really had to yank on me to get to the second spot. It felt like he took my breast into the other room and jumped up and down on it to get that second biopsy. He said it would likely bruise pretty bad. I just didn't think it would be this sore still. I will leave it alone. Thank you for responding!!!",

Probably a good thing I did, otherwise it might be even worse? They said I could shower, but it hurts even for the water to touch it. I explained in my original thread that I was having pain prior to the biopsy, so I'm guessing the biopsy just aggravated whatever was causing the pain prior. Maybe if I hadn't already been having pain, it wouldn't hurt like this post-biopsy? I don't know. I hurt worse all day after the 2nd mammo and US last Monday.",
