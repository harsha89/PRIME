    "Content": "ashley98 wrote: 2 months ago i found a medium to large (imo) lump in my right breast. It's slightly oval shaped and hard. It's a bit moveable, not like escaping around my breast, but it moves slightly in the region it's in. I've also had breast pain, on and off for a month and now much more regular, once a day at least. Recently i've had a numbness/tingly/uncomfortable and painful feeling in my left arm and painful left armpit. I'm not sure why. I've also noticed a lot of random bruises (i think i'm bruising easily?) and some neck/back pain. This could be due to sleeping. My right breast also feels harder and lumpier compared to the left. What do you think? I will try to answer any more info you need Log in to post a reply",
