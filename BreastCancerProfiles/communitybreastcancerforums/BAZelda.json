I am now using triple antibiotic ointment and telfa pads. My breast feels like a small knife was left in it. I am also having trouble with my arm where nodes were taken out and then radiation boost - pain and discomfort causing lack of sleep. I get no sympathy for this pain and was reluctantly given Tramadol. Tramadol does not work. I also take 3 Advils and 2 extra strength tylenols to get through until about 1 am then I just take the Advil again. It is wearing me down. I faithfully put calendula oil, MIaderm and aquifor on my breast during radiation. I don't feel it helped me. Post radiation has me feeling as bad as I felt in chemo- nausea, fatigue, insomnia. It seems once you are this far into treatment the MO, RO and BS all drop you and my primary care doc isn't experienced in dealing with my issues. I can't wait to feel better.",

I also now have a skin tear under my breast and I am putting everything on my skin. Calendula, Miaderm, Silvadene, Triamcinolone and even some clotrimazole under the breast then slather Aquaphor. I was seeing the light at the end of the tunnel here and now I want to jump off the train and walk.... I plan to call tomorrow and discuss this. I really just want to stop now! I think this cake has been in the oven too long! Advice please!!!! How can 4 more zaps make a difference other than put more dents in my breast??? ",

I am better this week as I found this radiation-therapy-breast-cancer and it made me feel like I should continue the radiation. I was undecided and did not feel that I had enough information. The first day of radiation I looked at the room that had a seaside painted on the wall and those awful cloud fluorescent light covers it looked like a funeral parlor! Plus they had me climb on the table and it reminded me of a coffin! I sobbed every time for about a week. They wanted me on antidepressants and in a support group and I said no, I knew why I was sad and I wanted to be around happy people! So now I am better although I am worrying about my clavicle --it seems thickened. I am also having to take nausea pills after radiation and at bedtime. This has been going on for a week now.",

I think the tears come from not being able to keep up as before and fears of the future which I can't control. I'm reading on mindful meditation. Also the flow of treatment keeps going even when you are not recovered from the last. Big chemo, surgery, radiation and continued Herceptin. Then there are the souvenirs -peripheral neuropathy, memory problems, arm and breast numbness, bald head.",
