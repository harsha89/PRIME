My son (he's a little over 2 now) knows mama has a boo boo and he gives it kisses to feel better, but he's just so rough sometimes and I've taken a few good elbows to the chest since my bmx 2 weeks ago. I wonder if he'd understand the concept of a cancer boo boo? We also have a few stools and it's incredible how quickly they adapt. Yesterday he wanted to sit on my lap while I was sitting at the computer, so on his own he pulled in a stool from the dining room and climbed on up. It makes me think he also might be able to handle changing his crib into a toddler bed. That kills me though because he sleeps so well in his crib and he loves it. It's his own little place...But I am lucky that I have help. My husband and mom have worked out a schedule so that someone is always home. And on the days where they both can't get out of work, my MIL or BFF come over. I am grateful and very lucky, but secretly would love a day to myself! ",

I'm still not crazy about wearing a wig and mostly go scarf when I'm at home or getting treated, but I teach first grade so I wear it every day to work and you just get used to it.
