I have had the mastectomy and lymph node removal. I am now on Tamoxifen. Last week I got the news that I was in Remission and there is no sign of it anywhere. There is always hope. I have been told that my positive attitude had a lot to do with it as well. Life goes on and somewhere out there is always someone worse off.  Its been a hard battle but its been worht it. ",
