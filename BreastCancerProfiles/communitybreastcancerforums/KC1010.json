MO wasntconcerned about the fever because it was a known side effect, and the hope was that it was a signal that it was working. That went on for 2-3 months, and then they added dex to my pretreatment before infusion. The fevers stopped, but so did the Gemzar. I only lasted 5 months before progression. I sometimes wonder if we didn't add the steroid if I would have gotten more time. The chills/fever were pretty brutal for those 2 nights a week though.

Also,I guess they were in a 'hard to reach spot'. He opted to take a sample from a bone lesion on my iliac instead. I've been asking my MO at each visit when is it time to do another biopsy. She insisted that it is very rare for cancer to change, and we wouldn't gain new info from another biopsy. However, now that I told her that I contacted an IR from another hospital, she now says it may be time for a liver biopsy. Go figure! Babs - I love the story of your DS and DD making amends.

I was too scared to see how many 'numerous' means, and exactly how bad it is. I'm now have radiating pain in my right trapezius muscle every time I breathe in.

Your strength and knowledge are incredibly admirable! I wish you were right on this one. I talked to my MO at length this morning, and it appears the immunotherapy is doing nothing, except attack my healthy organs. There is significant progression in my liver\u2014practically the whole liver is now involved with new mets and old ones growing. I also have progression in the bones and spleen, with new mets showing in lungs. My MO's fear is that if we treat the right lobe with Y90, my left lobe won't be well enough to support my body while the right lobe 'heals'. She also doesn't want the other mets to go haywire without treatments while we wait for the 4-6 weeks until the Y90 is complete. So, Y90 is on hold until we can hopefully shrink the liver mets a bit. We should be getting results back any day from the Tempus test on my recent liver biopsy (pretty much the same as F1, Guardant, etc). Hopefully that points to a treatment that might work. Halaven, Doxil and Abraxane are on MO's short list while she does some more research. I sit here, still in the hospital while we wait for blood cultures to come back to rule out lung infections. I still get short of breath and cough after exerting myself (just showered, and it felt so good). I also have to give a bowel sample to rule out C-diff (fun, huh?!). :) Lynne - you are so right about videos. We never had a video recorder as kids\u2014how I wish I was able to watch some old vids. We do take a lot of videos, but not nearly as much as we should. I have been completely camera shy for the last 1 years (aging and weight gain). I've been slowly getting over that since my daughter was born. I know how important it will be to the people I'm leaving behind. xoxoxo to all",

I don't know how they can say I failed any of my initial chemos, as I only took them for a short period of time, then moved on to Anastrazole as maintenance. I was considered cancer free for the 2 years until the mets were found. How can they say the first chemos failed me when I was no longer on them? Also, Gemzar worked for me for 3 months (the only time my TM's went down, and mets were stable or shrunk), but I was getting fevers/chills 2 nights a week while on it. They added a steroid to stop the fevers, which worked, but did it also diminish the effects of Gemzar? I had progression on my next scan after the steroid was added. I'm thinking about asking to be put back in Gemzar, without the steroids. I can live with 2 nights of fevers if it's knocking out these mets.

From what I read, my cancer is as aggressive, if not more aggressive than TNBC. This is because of the PR- status, the EGFR and ESR1 alterations. I wouldn\u2019t skip Faslodex without giving it a try. It works great for MANY.",

With all of the losses we\u2019ve had, I found myself in a depression thinking I\u2019m not far behind. My heart aches for all of those beautiful women and their families. I\u2019ve been doing OK. Had my 2nd dose of Opdivo last week, and wound up having a reaction. I was driving home, and all of a sudden could not stop shivering...full on from head to toe. I pulled over to call my nurse, and could barely dial because my hands were shaking so bad. She said to head back right away, or call an ambulance if I couldn\u2019t make it. When I arrived back, I had 6 people over me giving me hot blankets, morphine and Benadryl infusions, and I took ibuprofen. Within an hour I was back to normal. I guess this could be a good sign that Opdivo is working, and it\u2019s a pretty good possibility that it won\u2019t happen with future infusions. I had Y90 mapping this past Tuesday, and they will treat my right lobe this coming Tuesday. I\u2019m also having terrible lower back pain and fevers all week. My MO had me go in today for a stat CT of my back to make sure nothing was crushed. Nothing crushed...just extensive mets. I\u2019m now on Morphine extended release tabs, and will take Norco for breakthrough pain. The thing that sux about all of this is that both treatments (Opdivo and Y90) are slow to see results...so while we wait to see how effective these treatments are, my cancer could be going haywire. My dd turned 6 last week, and had her first ballet recital, and lost her first tooth today. All I can think about these days are all of the \u2018firsts\u2019 and milestones I will miss in her life. I have been so strong my entire life, even after this wretched diagnosis. I\u2019ve been an emotional mess these past few weeks. Sorry to dump this on all of you, and thank you for letting me dump this on you. If anyone understands, I know it\u2019s each of you. Z - I am so happy you\u2019re feeling better these days! I was truly concerned, and it makes my heart happy that you\u2019re seeing good results from Abraxane. To all - I wish you lots of happy, pain free days! And praying that whatever treatment you are on gives you a nice long run. I used to pray for a cure (and still do), but I\u2019d also be happywith a treatment that gives us many many years filled with nothing but joy. xoxo KC",

I just received scan results after being on Faslodex/Kisqali for 8 weeks, and I have significant progression in my liver. This is the 3rd treatment that failed me since MBC dx just over a year ago... 1st was Ibrance/letrozole, 2nd was Gemzar. I had the Guardant test (ordered by my 2nd opinion MO), and results showed that Faslodex should have worked for me...no such luck. This is why my MO does not usually order these. The results, more often than not, are not actionable. My MO recommended moving on to either Halaven or Xeloda, and I have chosen Xeloda. Just waiting on Insurance approval, and hope to start by the end of the week. Kaylynne - what kind of urea cream did you buy? Amazon has a few different kinds, and hoping to get the right kind...

He was apprehensive about doing it because you're not supposed to be on Chemo at the time of test, because the CTC's might not be present in the blood. I had just started Gemzar, so he wanted to give it a shot. Results came back that I would not respond to hormone therapies, which I had already failed 2, so we expected that. However, the test did say that I should respond to Faslodex. I switched to Faslodex when Gemzar stopped working (5 months), and Faslodex didn't work at all. After 2 cycles, we did a scan, and my liver went crazy, and my TM's doubled. This is why my MO doesn't like torun the Guardant type tests...it often gives ambiguous results. I started a heavy dose of Xeloda (5000mg a day) last week, hoping it knocks these suckers back! Scan in 5 weeks. I'm not sure if I'm a candidate for Y90, but it's on my list to find a great IR to have the conversation. I ask my MO every time I see her, and her opinion is that it would do more damage than good. Time for me to hear for myself.",

So, update...started Norco around the clock on Friday. My fever spiked to 102 on Saturday, so I called the on-call doc. He said let\u2019s just keep an eye on it, and call if it persists. I spent the day in bed, going between chills and sweating\u2014it was brutal. Woke up yesterday, feeling the fevers were gone. However, when I tried to exert myself in the least bit, I would sweat profusely. So, spent the day in bed again. My gut was starting to hurt again\u2014I haven\u2019t been able to get my bowels right for several weeks. I was going back and forth between constipation and diarrhea...attributing it to Norco. I tried to get moving last night to try to get my bowels moving. I ended up short of breath, and coughing up phlegm, and fever back up to 102. Called the doc, and he told me to go to hospital for observation, and see what\u2019s going on. They were thinking pneumonia. Had CT scan today, but resident will only tell me some of the results...my MO will give me details in the morning. Turns out I have colitis, most likely from the immunotherapy attacking my healthy organs. They started me on a steroid, and I most likely will have a colonoscopy/biopsy in the morning. GI doctors never responded to the resident\u2019s request to see me today\u2014damn docs and holidays. I asked how the lungs look, and he hemmed and hawed, and said MO will review with me in the morning. I pushed for more, and he said \u2018let\u2019s just say it was an abnormal scan\u2019. So, I guess the cancer has progressed to my lungs. He also said there was further progression in the liver. So, here I sit in the hospital, feeling pretty good, other than the constant sweating from the fevers coming/going (fevers most likely caused by tumor burden and colitis). All of the docs and nurses say I look good, too (grr!). My Y90 planned for tomorrow will be rescheduled, but my MO thinks it\u2019s still important that I have it. I wonder if my IR will still do it, now that I most likely have lung involvement? He said in one of our consults that good candidates have the cancer in other areas under control. We shall see what comes of all of this tomorrow. BAbs - soo happy to hear of your Y90 results!! Love and prayers to each of you!",

I've been following your story, and have asked my MO about localized treatment to my liver on several occasions, and I'm told that I'm not a candidate. I have several small mets in both lobes. Gemzar had them stable for all of 3-4 months. My TM's kept going up on the Ibrance combo, but then came down nicely each month on Gemzar. The scan results this week were very surprising...we thought for sure I'd be stable, but instead had progression in all areas--liver/bones/spleen. The Guardant360 test shows that Faslodex should work for me, so I'm hopeful. I just turned 50, and we have a 5.5 year old daughter. I'm convinced that all of the infertility treatments/hormones I took to have her sped my cancer along...maybe even caused it? I wouldn't change a thing though--we went through a lot of heartache to have her, and we prayed and fought for a long time--she's the light of our lives.

Sorry I haven't updated in a while, but here goes what's going to be a long post. I went to see one of the most highly respected Breast Oncologists at NW's Prentice Wmn's Hospital last Tuesday. He had nothing, zip, nada to offer me. I felt like he felt like I was wasting his time, thus I thought I wasted my time. His thoughts on Y90 is that he usually recommends that for palliative reasons. So, since I still feel good, and my liver numbers still look good, I don't need Y90....yet???? I've failed every treatment since diagnosis in Jan '17, my TM's are over 1000, and the progression in my liver has been significant (I'm too afraid to ask what % is involved, but they say 'significant'). What? he wants me to wait until my QOL sux, and I have no energy for this, and may no longer be a candidate??When we left the meeting, he said 'you know where we live...next time you progress check with us about trials before moving on). I talked to my IR and my MO. I started Opdivo last Thursday. We're going to go ahead with the Y90, but I'm going to wait until after my dd's 6th Bday and her 1st ballet recital (she's so excited!). Mapping planned for 5/21, with first lobe tentatively planned for 5/29. I'm sort of going to be my own test subject here. Since Opdivo can take up to 6 months or more to work, and you can get worse before you get better, we won't know if it's working for a while (which is scary). We are going to scan that first lobe about 30 days after the first treatment. If that lobe looks significantly better than the other, we will move forward with the 2nd lobe. If both lobe are looking good, then there's a sign the Opdivo may be working, and we'll hold off on treating the 2nd lobe. My prayers are that this works wonders...I need to catch a break. I'm still feeling pretty good, other than occasional fevers from the liver tumors. I had some heavy duty lower back pain one night, that actually required Norco for the first time in many many months. No pain since, though. Spring has finally arrived in Chicago, and it was a beautiful day today. My whole family went to the Cubs game yesterday, and my dd and niece got to run the bases after the game (2nd time for each). It was a great day that I'll always cherish. Wishing everyone the very best. Those in pain, may it subside soon. Those waiting for treatments\u2014May it be the miracle you need. Those with great scans\u2014keep them coming. I'm praying for all of you. ",

When I was released from the hospital on extended release morphine, steroids, laxatives, etc., I literally could not manage to read or write a single thing\u2014my eyes would close to sleep as soon as I started reading. I even found myself falling asleep at redlights\u2014which told me I had to hold off driving for a bit. The fatigue was nothing I had ever experienced, and I\u2019ve been pretty much out of commission, other than a quick outing here and there, and it takes EVERYTHING out of me. Ive been pretty down in the dumps...knowing that there\u2019s very little I can do to help my family, and my dd wants me to play with her so often\u2014it breaks my heart. I\u2019m now calling in family and friends to take her out, and keep her busy and happy. My Tempus sequencing finally came back last week, and I have multiple mutations...ESR1, CHEK2(genetic), FRS2, PTEN, MDM2, and FGFR1. There\u2019s on clinical trial out of U of Wisconsin, which focuses on the PTEN, and involves parp inhibitors. Still waiting to see if I can get in\u2014it\u2019s a phase 1 trial. Meanwhile, I started Halaven while we wait. I had my first treatment last week, and went for the 2nd treatment today. Neither my usual nurse or my MO was there. I had a new nurse that I had never seen before hand me blood results and tell me my neutrophils were .1, and she\u2019s not sure they\u2019ll move ahead with treatment today??!!?? .1!! Even I know you have to be at least .9 to move forward. She made me wait while she pages my doc, and I finally got up and said I\u2019m leaving\u2014knowing I won\u2019t get treatment today. She rescheduled me for next Week. I asked about a neulasta shot, and she said they would do that next week if they don\u2019t come up. I guess that explains a lot of my fatigue. I took myself off of the morphine earlier this week, and am weaning off of steroids. I just want my energy back. Z - glad you found the right supplements. I\u2019m going to pm you a little later to get the brand/doses you are taking. Hope everyone else is doing well\u2014so happy to hear the good news, and heartbroken over the not so good news. Prayers to everyone! Xox  ",
