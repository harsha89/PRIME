Stubborn is a good thing, I bet you're going to do well. Smiles. I had breast cancer (IDC) one year and 7 months prior to getting dx with a recurrence a few months ago. I had a mastectomy the 'first time' but this is my first experience with chemo. Good to know that L-Glutamine also helps with neuropathy. I have it from a condition having nothing to do with chemo so that's good to know. But yes, it does help with bone pain from chemo. Ask your MO about how he/she recommends using it. Also learned I was low in B-12 and B-6 from all this blood work so am supplementing with that as well as Vit D-3. Sam, many thanks for the cookbook link! Am a big believer in eating healthy and we love to cook so it's a win-win. It got good reviews and I could see a few of the recipes online. Looks great. Best...  ",

I'm leaving for M.D. Anderson for a week of appointments. I'll have the chemo done at home but they will determine the protocol. I'll go back to MDA for rads because they have the best proton radiation protocol. Thanks for sharing..",
