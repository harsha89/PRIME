I have DCIS in both, with a questionable area in the right. None of the treatments offered are reasonable, all are extreme, traumatic, and in my opinion, barbaric. I don't know what to do. I like my breasts. They are nice. And I feel fine, I run, bike, am in good shape. I'm \"healthy\", or so I thought. The more I read, the less I feel hopeful that I will be able to feel. Normal again. Now I'm hearing that implants are problematic. And I hate the idea anyway. I don't understand how women voluntarily get breast implants to make them bigger, I nev understood that. And ironically, here I am, one who loves my beasts the way they are, and now I have to remove them.",

I felt like I was being led down a \"default\" path, but I have stopped that train. They did an MRI which showed more suspicion, and want to do more poking and prodding. I have decided no more poking, nor more tests, we know there are bad cells in there, they need to come out. All of them. So now it is down to which team. I have to meet with them and figure out what works best for me. And it is so fearful not knowing all the steps.But I have to learn and chose each step before taking it. I keep hearing \" one step at a time\" but surely I need to know what the steps will be, and where the heck they will lead me, or I won't go! Maybe there are aome steps that will show up unexpectedly... Anyway, I'm on the roller coaster, I know none of us want to be on. I thought I paid some dues for a while with my parents deaths last year, thought maybe I would have some time for peace, solice. But no, I am challenged again, for some reason. And I have no choice but to take the challenge. I have a child and a husband. I am so afraid to evn tell my child, so far she doesn't know. We wanted to have a plan first. By now it seems that will take us longer than we anticipated, so we are going to tell her soon. My poor baby. She's been through so much. I hate this.",
