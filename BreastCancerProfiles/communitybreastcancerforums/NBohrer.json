They implanted it while I was asleep with my re-excision. I guess I am freaking out because there is a foreign metal object inside my body! Went to the surgeon today and he said my breathing sounded ok - sent me for a chest Xray anyway to make sure - but most likely the discomfort is from the swelling and bruising, so I'm holding ice on it hoping this improves soon. I hope I can get to the point where I am not conscious of it.",

I couldn't lay down in bed last night - breathing and coughing problems so I'm off to see the surgeon in a little bit and see if anything is wrong. I was diagnosed 12/11 with IDC; SNB & partial mastectomy & axillary dissection 12/19; re-excision and port implant 12/28; pos nodes; ER/PR +; HER2 is amplified; Stage III; so surgeon thinks I will have an aggressive year of chemo but I haven't met my oncologist yet - next week I will. Ready to get this show on the road! I'm so glad this board is here. I have a lot of support from friends and family but they're not there (thankfully). I look forward to sharing all of our ups and downs.",
