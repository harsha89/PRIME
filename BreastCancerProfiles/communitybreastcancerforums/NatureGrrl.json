For what this is worth:  You won't have to stop living your normal life.  Radiation isn't nearly as devastating to the body as chemo. A lot of the fear we have and stories we hear about how awful radiation is are based on old treatment plans.  They used to do fewer but more intense treatments, which were harder on the body, and they also can target the areas being treated much better. I had some fatigue but nothing like chemo (which did significantly impact my life).  You may be tired, you may want to nap some or go to bed earlier, you may have some skin reaction (I had discoloration but no blistering or itching), but you will be able to live pretty much as always.  My diagnosis was also out of the blue and devastating, but since I've been a caregiver for others who have gone through cancer, I wasn't uncomfortable with the treatment options I was hearing (it helped a lot that I already knew and trusted my oncologist and his staff).  By all means, get other opinions and ask all you need to ask to be comfortable with whatever you chose.  And listen to your gut.  Best of luck and a warm hug.",

There are a number of anti-pink threads going right now, and as I've read them, I've wanted to copy and paste various comments into a document (names removed) and send it out to all the media who keep promoting pink, who just don't get it, and who never hear this side of things.   However, although I know our comments are considered public, I still regard them as being shared here within the context and support of the boards and so in my mind they're private.  Besides, I believe bc.org would have to clear that first anyway.  But most of all, I've never wanted to violate anyone in any way by copying without asking.  But I'm wondering... what if we cleared it with bc.org, and start a thread that at the top says, if you'd like to share comments on how you feel about Pinktober and the pinking of bc  that will be shared with the media, please post here... would that work for anyone?  We could compile for so many days, make sure everyone knew we wouldn't use names, locations, etc...  Does this sound like a remotely reasonable idea?  Any thoughts? I only suggest it because darn it, the world needs to hear us, not the Pink Promoters!  I've composed a couple of letters I'm sending out (one to the \"bras across the river\" promoters and one to our local paper) but my voice alone doesn't mean as much as many voices together.  Alone, I just feel like they'll read my letters and say I'm snippy and bitter :) or something like that... but having the support of many voices, they might realize the problems with Pinkober, etc. Lowrider, I posted a comment about National Metastatic BC Awareness day using your facts on my FB page... a small something, but something.",

PS  I was surprised to have joint pain AFTER chemo but not so much during -- the NP told me that was because the steriods in my body were masking a lot of the pain, and that time would take care of it.  I don't know if that's right or not but I do know the pain is going away now.",

The only caveat was to not apply anything to my skin for at least 3 hours before treatment because that could cause skin problems (intensify the radiation effects on the skin).  I followed all this every night religiously.  Oh, and I was told not to use any deoderant under the radiation arm for the duration, so I didn't. I had no burning, itching, blisters, etc.  My skin got pink quickly (faster than \"normal,\" which had me worried) and towards the end, red, but that was it. I'm fair skinned but never burned easily, FWIW.  Was it the aloe vera and shea butter?  No way to know for sure, but it sure didn't hurt to use it. I had some fatigue from radiation but nothing like chemo. My rad. techs were good about getting me right in and out so my wait time was minimal.  Overall, it really was a breeze compared to anything and everything else I've been through.  Everyone is different, of course, but they really have changed treatment so much over how it used to be done and the majority will experience less SE's than used to be the case.  Hang in there! ",

I got a similar kind of talk as yours from one person before I started treatment, but when I saw the techs who gave me the treatments they all told me to do what I wanted, just try not to rub/scrub the marks.  I lathered my breast and underarm by hand. My marks came off no matter what I did (or didn't do), so I just re-drew them after my shower every night before they faded too much (the techs OK'd this -- not a daily problem, but over the weekend they would fade a lot). For some reason that ink didn't want to stick to my skin at all -- it started flaking off as soon as they drew it on and it dried.  Only other big caveat I got was to not put anything on my breast (lotion, oil) for (gosh darn chemo brain!) either 3 or 5 hours (I can't remember which!) before treatment, because that could exacerbate problems.  I used aloe and an oil-based product at night. I do have permanent tattoos now but they're just pin-point dots, 5 of them, and  even after I got those they used the sharpies. They potentially have to remark you every 5 treatments anyway (they'll probably check you to make sure you're lined up right).  And if you see them every day, they can touch up the marks if need be.

The worst thing I had was pain from the Neulasta shots, common with A/C, I ached so bad after the first one that I could barely stand to walk 1/2 a block, but the women on this forum mentioned trying generic Claritin (not Claritin D, just the plain Claritin) for that... my oncologist OK'd it and I'll be darned if I didn't have any pain from Neulasta after that.  Worth remembering if you'll have those shots.  I just took it nightly for the rest of my treatment (I have allergies anyway so it also helped with those).  Check with your oncologist to make sure it's ok with him/her. Take whatever you'll enjoy doing.  You can read, knit, listen to music, write, etc., just about anything you can do while sitting.  I also got up and walked around some, dragging my IV with me, but truthfully mostly I napped a lot and read some. Oh, yes, my hair started falling out exactly 14 days after my first A/C, I shaved my head to avoid the aches from that and also to get it over with (I thought seeing my hair come out daily would be too traumatic).  Everyone's different in how they approach that, though, so do what feels right for you. Drink lots of fluids to help flush things out and to stay well-hydrated.  Very important. Expect orange/pink urine after the A/C for a few hours :) I won't say A/C was easy or fun but it wasn't anywhere near as bad as all the stories I heard that had me terrified.  I was glad when it was over because I was so blasted tired but it was all manageable.  Important thing is to keep your oncologist informed about anything that doesn't feel right to you -- and to ask any questions you need to ask.   We're all here for you.  Best of luck and a warm hug.",

Chemo can be hard (I respectfully disagree with the previous poster on this one) -- actually getting it wasn't hard, but dealing with the accumulation over time was; I had serious fatigue, mainly, but I can't say it was like the flu.  It was more overwhelming than that, but everyone is different, some do go through it easier than others. Youth is on your side on that count. If you're given steroids with/after chemo (I got them around every A/C treatment), that was the only time I found myself feeling impatient, but it only lasted for the time I was actually on steroids (I think it was 3 or 4 days each A/C, which was once every 3 weeks), and once I figured out what was going on, I expected it and could deal with it.  I wasn't taking care of a child but I was taking care of an elderly woman with dementia, and sometimes it felt like I was taking care of a child.  I guess all I'm trying to say is, although it at times was difficult, I did it, and you will too. It's not easy nor fun, and in an ideal world we'd all have someone to hug us at the end of the day and give us what we need, but you can do it. By the way, if he says \"I'll see you through this but I can't say where I'll be a year from now,\" he's not going to see you through it, because it doesn't end the minute treatment is over; it's an ongoing process of healing and recovery.  Best of luck to you, and please do use the boards for support and understanding.",

This is what my radiation oncologist  recommended, and it worked great for me:  I used aloe vera gel (Jason's, 98% aloe vera) every night, and shea butter (or sometimes aquaphor, but mostly shea butter) on top of that to help seal in moisture.  I had no problems.  It washed off easily in the shower the next morning, and I had no blisters, peeling, etc.  throughout my 38 treatments.  My skin did turn pink/red but was almost completely normal within a few weeks after treatment ended.  They recommended the shea butter/Aquaphor/even Vasoline as an important part of keeping as much moisture in as possible. When I showered I only used soap on my hand to wash that breast and underarm.  No scrubbing needed to remove any \"stuff\" from the previous night's application. It does pay to avoid anything with alcohol very high up in the ingredient list as it can lead to drier skin.  I also wore no bra or cami for the 2 months, only loose turtlenecks, and I found this much more comfortable than having fabric rubbing tightly against my skin, but this will vary a lot by person.  My skin is much more sensitive to tighter fitting clothes (like camis and bras) than it is to being touched by itself so I wasn't about to wear anything that would aggravate it more. So just keep in mind on some of those details, not to be alarmed if you get a different recommendation from their dr.  than what is listed.  Bottom line:  If in doubt, ask your rad. oncologist or tech team.  Oh, our waiting room always had a jigsaw puzzle going on a gib table, it was the first time I'd seen anything like that in a dr. office and it was lots of fun -- a good ice breaker and something to do if you had to wait (I usually didn't).",

Bedtime at 6:30 even is good (I've only had to do that once, but I slept 13 hours, sheez!). I'm a generic claritin taker, too, and it does seem to help a lot with the Neulasta aches.  This time will be a better test for me than the first round, since I didn't start taking it until mid-way through the ache cycle. Haven't had any nausea of note (knock on wood!!!!) but I have ativan and Zofran ODT for when I might... and when my stomach nudges me I pop a  half a Tums.  So far, so good on that.

      "Content": "Mar 8, 2011 01:08AM - edited Mar 8, 2011 01:10AM by NatureGrrl Meg. I'm prone to anxiety as well, although I've noticed as I've gotten older and learned more about myself and found ways to cope with things, it's gotten quite a bit less frequent and severe.  Coping with anxiety is hard, and everyone is different and has to find what works for them, but here are some things that have helped me: 1.  meditation.  I'm not good at it, and I don't practice as regularly as I'd like, but it helps, even in small doses or emergency situations (like an anxiety attack when I'm waiting for my mammogram results).  There are many different ways -- I like visualization, and TM, the best, but again, it's what works for the individual.  Breathing exercises help me, too.  If you're interested, look for the \"Relaxation/ Meditation CD you'd recommend?\" thread in the \"recommend your resources\" forum.  There are several good ideas there. (edited to add, link doesn't work but it should be easy to find the thread). 2.  I ask myself, what do I know right now?  and what can I do to make this better, right now?    I answer those questions.  That brings me more clearly into the moment, instead of projecting ahead. 3.  Once I've figured out what I know and what I can do -- I act. I do what I can and let the rest go. If I can't do anything right now (for example, unless it's an emergency, I can't call the dr. on a weekend), then I've done all I can do and I have to let it go.  Letting go can be hard, but for me, I've found that if I even have the intent to try to let something go, that gets me started on the path, and before I know it, I've actually moved on.  4. I call a close friend and share what I'm going through.  Sometimes the process of getting something said out loud starts to lessen its power over me.  If a friend isn't available, in many communities there are 24-hour crisis hotlines.  5.  I eat something healthy, like an apple.  I know it sounds simple and like it won't help, but it does.  Same with going for a walk or listening to music or watching a comedy or whatever I find soothing.  6.  Also, I try to get enough rest!  My mind can't cope with things nearly as well if I'm not rested. 7.  Before it happens again, I make a list of things I can do to calm myself when it does happen.  Then I have something concrete in front of me when I need it and can't think as clearly, and I can pull out my list and use it. 8.  I've seen a therapist.  Professional guidance is very helpful.  9.  Last, but maybe not least:  I still keep some ativan on hand, small dose.  I don't like using drugs if I can  help it, but I've also come to respect that they can really help.   I was having some serious anxiety last fall over a situation and was getting overwhelmed and finally took an ativan a couple of different times to help me through it.  And, if anxiety is an ongoing issue, I wouldn't hesitate to talk to my dr. about it and maybe go on a daily med for awhile -- I've done that in the past (about 10 years ago, and also when I was going through treatment) and it's always helped ease the stress, and once I've gotten back on my feet and feel I'm ready, I stop whatever I'm on. I don't know if this is really what you were asking for or if it's of any help, but it's here FWIW.  Please do keep us updated.  Thinking of you!",

I take 800 iu's of vitamin E daily -- it helped a lot with the cracking (more on my fingers than my feet, but still a big help).  My fingers were extremely painfully cracked but once I got back on the vit. E they were fine. Drink lots of water.  Winter heat/dry air doesn't help, either.  I can't think of anything else but others will chime in with good ideas.  Best of luck. ",

You might ask your radiation oncologist about the questions you have about people getting similar treatments.  I think the every day thing is standard partly because it's easier on people to get less strong treatments more often than stronger treatments farther apart.  Within that, I'm guessing dosage, etc., may vary quite a bit.  I had most of my treatments on the entire breast but the last 5 treatments were targeted to where my lump had been.  There's room for a lot of variation within the every day program.

Nerve regrowth is very slow, so it's a long slow process to get over neuropathy.  My fingers have been normal for a couple of months or more, and my feet/toes are almost there.  If you progress like me you'll see gradual but steady improvement. As mentioned, some people don't ever recover fully, but many do or at least see improvement. SE's from radiation include fatigue and possible skin reactions.  Find out what your radiation oncologist/techs suggest to put on your skin. I used 98% aloe vera gel every night, and put shea butter or Aquaphor on top of that to seal in moisture, and only had skin redness -- no burning or blistering.  But everyone reacts differently, and your ability to tan/burn plays no role here (or so I've been told). I had some SE's after chemo -- aches and pains.  They went away within a few months.  I was told the steriods I was taking during chemo probably masked the pains until I was done with it.  Not sure that makes complete sense to me :) but it's one explanation. Also, chemo can cause damage to other parts of your body. I've had numerous extra blood tests since I finished all treatments to check various functions and rule out other causes of fatigue. In my case, I've had minor heart damage and I have mild hypothyroidism now. I'm on meds for the first (and hoping that time heals the damage at least some) and waiting to see my doc about the second.  So don't be surprised if other things crop up that weren't problems before.  Keep your doctors informed of any symptoms.  The problems I'm having, though, are minor and mild compared to not having my cancer treated! And one thing that I don't see mentioned often as an SE:  emotional impacts.  I didn't have time/energy to really digest that I even had cancer and what all that meant until I was done with treatment, and then I went through some depression/grief/etc., but by that time I was able to process it fairly quickly.  Some people also experience a feeling of abandonment after chemo ends because they aren't getting the regular support of the oncology staff (but daily radiation made up for that in my case!).  And, the really good news (to me, at least!) was that I finally got my mojo back!!  I feel like my old self, but much better, emotionally -- more grounded, happier, stronger, experiencing joy, etc.  Don't be surprised if you go through some emotional SE's as well. Best of luck through rads.  You've got the worst behind you!  Hang in there -- things will get  better!",

As soon as possible, call your dr. and schedule an appointment.  Knowing is better than not-knowing, and from what you say, it sounds really likely this can be the neurofibromatosis, although I know nothing about that condition -- I'm just basing this on what you said in your post. To the best of my knowledge, cancer doesn't present with cold symptoms, so I wouldn't read much into that. Take some deep breathes.  We all live with that fear (I have wrist problems and after I got the x-ray, the first thing I asked was if the x-ray showed cancer) (the answer was no) and it's hard not to jump to conclusions, but try not to borrow trouble.  Do things to help you relax, try to get some extra rest, eat well, and find something to make yourself laugh (I turn to baby-laughing videos on youtube at times like this -- they always make me smile!).  Let your dr. know ASAP so you can get this dx and moved on with the (very long!) rest of your life.  Warm hugs and best of luck.",

The radiologist and surgeon wanted to make sure the entire original lump area was excised, thus the double wires.  The procedure for me was almost pain-free.  This was 2 weeks ago. They took the lump (which my surgeon described as \"large\" and my oncologist called \"relatively small.\"  Figure that one out!  It was 2-3  cm.) and under my arm, a lymph node and some surrounding tissue which ended up containing 14 lymph nodes (!). If there weren't a scar/incision there, I wouldn't be able to tell they took anything out of my breast, and most people assured me that the body has a way of \"filling in\" what's taken anyway.  Oddly, and to my surprise, I was very calm for my lumpectomy, even knowing that I still might come out of it needing a mastectomy (not the case, however).  I found the surgery & recovery have been pretty darn easy.  But after 6 months of miserable chemo I guess a little cutting didn't seem so bad!    It's natural to be nervous, especially if you haven't had surgery before, but it really will be ok -- it's one of those things where the anticipation is definitely the worst part.  Hang in there -- sending hugs -- Carol",

One advantage to having a/c every three weeks, at least to my mind:  I got a nice rebound after that first week of being wiped out, and felt halfway human again for several days (my cycle was split about 50/50: 10 days of fatigue, 10 of real energy) before getting zapped again.   I really took advantage of that 10 days of energy.  It makes the fatigue days more bearable to know that there is some sort of recovery, even if temp.  I'm on the upward swing of my second cycle; fatigue today is a tiny bit less than yesterday, so I'm looking forward to the weekend.  For me, at least, even a moment of feeling human and normal makes the rest of it a lot more bearable. FWIW, even though my first treatment went OK, I was pretty anxious over the second, but it's actually turned out to be a bit easier -- not less fatigue or anything, but I knew what to expect and have been listening to my body better and overall I've found it less stressfull and easier to roll with the punches.  I hope you have the same experience!  Hang in there!",

My NP suggested vit.B6 supplements to help prevent/delay neuropathy, and I have been taking it religiously twice a day since I started chemo.   Did it help?  There's no way to know for sure, but it didn't hurt.  I'm also still taking Neurotin, which helps minimize the symptoms of neuropathy (but doesn't cure it or stop it) -- I still have symptoms but when I stopped taking it the symptoms were worse so I decided to keep taking it until they go away or are almost gone.  So even if you get neuropathy keep in mind that there's a med out there to help. Bottom line, even if you get some neuropathy, for most people it's managable and goes away after chemo stops.  Best of luck!",

I've also had a lumpectomy and some of the scar tissue does feel like lumps,  I had to get used to the changed feel of what's normal in that breast.  And, I have an area of my breast than sinks in; it's where all that tissue (the lump) was removed. But having said that -- I would (and do) call my dr. with any concerns.  If you find your dr. unresponsive, find another dr.  During treatment, I used to call my oncologist a couple of times a week and felt bad about it until the nurses said that they have people that call several times a DAY, and that I should always err on the side of caution. I wouldn't wait three months to find out about that new lump, either, but having said that, how big is the new lump?   I had some \"spots\" on my lung that were monitored for almost a year and got very frustrated being told I had to wait yet another 3 months after every CTscan -- but they were too small to biopsy.  (They finally vanished).  I don't know if that could be the case here or not, if that lump is too small to otherwise test, but a second opinion never hurts, especially if it gives you peace of mind.  Second, on seeing therapists/counselors:  three weeks is a very short time to have been seeing someone.  You've been going through some significant trauma and still have some unknowns over your head.  That's going to bring up a whole variety of emotions that could include fear, sadness, etc... all normal and all take time to process.  When you have health issues like this another thing that's hard is that there is so much that you can't control -- so what helped me was controlling the pieces I could.  You'll have to figure out what that is for you; just remember that your emotions are one of the things you only have partial control over, and it's ok to feel them; in fact, it helps to allow them to be there so that you can better let go of them.  If that makes any sense!  As mentioned, meds aren't a bad idea, either, if you start feeling too overwhelmed.  You and your therapist and dr. can decide. Finally, and this is the hardest part about waiting, but try to focus on what you know and what you can do, and try not to let your imagination run wild with what might be.  Like I said, that's really hard, but don't let the joy of today be overshadowed by the \"maybes\" of tomorrow any more than you can help. I know how scary this is. I walked around for 3 months with a lump in my breast, convinced I was going to die because I had no insurance and if it was cancer no one would treat me.  I finally realized that no matter what, knowing was better than the way I was living.  Take action, do what you can, find things that calm you, hug everyone who'll let you :), take deep breaths, try to eat right and sleep enough, and remember, no matter what, you've found the right place for support and comfort, and you can do this.  You're still strong.  Feeling all those icky emotions doesn't make you less strong; but it's just part of life.  Warm hug...",

Check more into your own insurance program, too.  With group coverage they can't deny you coverage but they can impose a waiting period so you might want to find out about any thing like that so you won't be blindsided later.  I know you both already feel overwhelmed and you don't need more surprises than you're already getting. I agree, don't wait to start setting up appointments and gathering information.  Knowledge is power, and you'll feel like you're doing something because you will be doing something.  I found it helped me a lot to take control where ever I could, rather than letting the cancer control everything.  I started treatment before I found out if I would have insurance; you may be able to do that, too.  I don't understand why they can't tell you more after her biopsy -- after mine, I was able to find out type, grade, stage, etc etc., all the details, although some took a few days longer to get back than others -- you might have to ask more specific questions to get more answers?  Don't know, but I do know it doesn't hurt to ask.  After a biopsy you'd think they'd have what they need but I certainly don't know about all biopsies, just mine. Best wishes and a warm hug to you both.",

Do ask your oncologist if it's OK if you decide to try it  (the generic Claritin). My WBC plummeted, even with Neulasta, but again, I'm not in your category, so I really can't compare my situation with yours. I  do know I prefered dealing with Neulasta to coming down with an illness that would put me in the hospital or keep me from continuing treatment -- but again, my situation is not the same as yours.   There are no clear answers to most of this, as you're realizing :)  Gather information, let it sink it, then listen to your gut and go with it. Steroids are optional.  Everything is optional.  Steroids are used to combat nausea.  For me, I'd way rather deal with the steroid SE's (short-lived and aggravating, but short-lived) than throw up.  Even with steroids and other meds I had nausea, but I never came close to throwing up.  Not everyone feels that way about it, though. Discuss it with your dr. and decide for yourself.  Some women are able to at least reduce their steroids and therefore have less SE's. I know it's overwhelming but you have to be your own advocate -- so bug your dr. with all your questions.   Don't let him/her treat you like a drive-by patient -- and if he is, find someone else.  This is your health and life and deserves to be treated seriously. Age is relative.  To me, 42 is young. Pretty darn young, actually.   I'm 58. And BTW, I'm not old!  :)  It's relative.  That may be why your dr. keeps saying that.    Good luck, big hugs, and hang in there.",
