I eventually went to the doctor because I felt some unusual lumps in the left breast that went along with the pain. The doctor ordered an ultrasound of the left breast and everything looked fine. They told me that it was enlarged glands/milk ducts and that I shouldn't be concerned (I stopped breastfeeding my baby about a year and a half ago). It has been about a month since my ultrasound and I am still having a fair amount of pain in my left breast (almost feels like mastitis without the redness) and I just noticed some dimpling last night. I can only see the dimpling when I raise my left arm over my head but it is in the area where I am having the breast pain. Should I be concerned? I feel like I am being paranoid because my ultrasound was clear. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.Â  Log in to post a reply",
