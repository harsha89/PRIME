I'm not fully diagnosed yet but I had an excisional biopsy (small lumpectomy last week). My treatment/diagnosis hasn't gone very normally - I had confusing results - about 3-4 weeks ago I had mammos plus thin needle aspiration (got abnormal looking cells plus told it looked multifocal therefore mastectomy).since had MRI (nothing interesting),plus about 6 more mammos plus multiple ultrasound plus core biopsys (clear - they are wondering if the the cancer is in little clumps and that they missed) and finally an excisional biopsy. This was not a bad procedure but I'm very bruised (in colour - but not sore ) and I have a 6 cmscar as they tried to take out all of the lump to work out what it was. They may have the results today. So if my core's Ihad come back negative he'd have done the mastectomy last Thu - as it was I just got the core biopsy. Looking at other posts however people have taken upt to 2 months depending on circumstances. Hope that helps. KatieC",

I have no external stiches just glue. I have no pain - yesterday they were very keen to give me some morphine after the surgery whilst I sat around, read, recovered from the anestheitc and had a sandwich etc (keen to feed me too as I'd been starved over night). I had some parecetamol after that (again because they were keen rather than I had pain). Today I took some parecetamol when I got up but no pain at all now unless I prod it - so I guess I should poke at the wound! They provided me with enough morphine based drugs for a week and the same with parecetamol plus another batch of anti-inflamatories (can take all together). Over 24 hours out of surgery now so I'm going to get a shower!!! Results for me next week. Good luck. ",

Sor far I've got a mixed diagnosis - I'm expecting clarification today -mammos - dodgy plus a palpable lump -thin needle aspiration plus ultrasound - abnormal cells (Doc said that they had found another possible dodgy area on the mamo plus the lump therefore mastectomy ) - more ultrasound and core biopsys plus another mammo- normal (possibly missed the cells) plus the decided that the second dodgy area was just the earlier mammo so now back to one unknown lump - more ultrasound - indetermnate but they believe they hit the lump on the cores - MRI - no abnormal hotspots/ more mamos - well just not clear either way - excisional biopsy (andnow the proud owner of a 6cm scar) results were due Tuesday but still being processed so now due today!! Anyhow I just want to talk to people who understand. Waiting is **!!**",

My core cut were 3 decent size slivers. Doc is sending be back for more MRI, ultrasound, biopsy but just wondered if anyone else had had this? Docs convinced cancer but can't quantify/qualify yet. Suspect that I have a heterogenous lumps and the core cut missed them all. Thanks KatieC Log in to post a reply",
