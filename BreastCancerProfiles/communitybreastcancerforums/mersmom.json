Try talking to a tatoo artist.  I asked for something different and because I had not prepared for an option until the appt. when it needed to be done I ended up with four black dots. One of them is right between my breasts and looks like a big blackhead. I am going to try a tatoo fade cream to get rid of mine. Don't be suprised if the radiology team tells you not to remove them post radiation.  I wish I would have done more research prior to treatment. But then at the time my only concern was getting through all of this. If you are allowed to use something post it ...I am certain many would like an option. Hope all goes well with you.",

I had a hard lump at my incision site and talked to both my surgeon and onc. They told me it would go away in time and it finally did. It took almost  a year..some of the gals I went through treatment with also had the same problem and everyone was different...one gal took 18 months.Hope this is helpful. There are lots of wonderful women on this site with more knowledge and more help than I could ever imagine.Find a thread to help you and do not be afraid to ask questions.  I had lumpectomy,partial mastectomy,radiation,radiation burns,infection in burns,shingles and am now dealing with the SE's from Arimidex. But you know I am alive and with the help from all these gals coping with all of it. My best to all of you. Catch my hug! Teri",
