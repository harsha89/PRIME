      "Content": "Apr 11, 2008 12:52AM - edited Apr 11, 2008 12:57AM by RN2teach Hey Js, It has been a busy couple of days. Had an \"away\" ballgame last night (our team lost ) and got in late. The state board of ed. visited our school this morning along with WV's governor, so it was an interesting day. Took off right after work for onco appt., which went well. Bloodwork was great so Taxol #3 is a go for tomorrow. Met ds at S&K to help him order his tux for prom and went to Quaker Steak & Lube for dinner after... Realized on the way home that I hadn't put out my substitute materials (had them ready, just not out where the sub could find them), so stopped in at work to take care of that on the way home. Ended up tidying my room, updating my grades online, and printing off missing work lists for the kids. Got home about 11pm. Had to take my decadron at midnight and chased it w/ benadryl. Hope I can get to sleep at some point, but still too wired to consider it. DCMom- I am on DD Taxol every other week. My biggest complaint: bone and muscle pain, pretty intense beginning 36 hours after chemo and lasting 3 days or so. I do chemo on Fridays, have my worst days Sunday-Monday, and the pain level drops steadily after that until I am pain-free by Friday. I have had to take a narcotic to sleep on the worst nights and sometimes during the daytime--but it works and allows me to go on with my life, so no worries. (I agree w/ Tinalee that this is much more tolerable than AC!) Jenn- beautiful gs and the dogs are precious. Deb1023- glad the second round went okay. I appreciate hearing about your se's, so whine when you need to . I had the peeling thing on my fingertips also. Kris- congrats on being finished w/ AC! That IS something to celebrate! Vettegal- thinking of you and Denise. Sista- good to see your post. I'm sorry you weren't feeling your best for dd's Bday. Julie- hearty congrats to ds for being selected for the TKD exhibition! Jenn, Maz and LJ- hope today went well in the lounge for you gals. D1- monitor that pink tata carefully and keep lathering the creams to it. KathyL- haven't done my cards yet either... will get that done this weekend. Tinalee- I hear some of that winter weather is headed our way. UGH! Dana- it's just us two at the bar tomorrow--bottom's up! Carol- YEAH, baby! I'm seeing the light. In just 2 short weeks my chemo journey will come to an end. SIS Kimberly- thinking of you--we miss you! WVGirl- where ARE you???? Hope you're okay.  I'll check in w/ you gals tomorrow. Paula",

This is the first evening I've been able to rest at home all week. I took a nap earlier... hope it doesn't interfere with my ability to rest well tonight. Tomorrow night ds has a tournament and I'll be in my usual place working concessions. We have a good view of the game since the building is behind the batter's box and has a full window on that side of the building. It gets a little chilly after the sun goes down, so the concession stand is the perfect place to avoid the chill! Carol- Oh, you made me LOL talking about dh's gift. Look out now that he knows that battery-operated devices give you a thrill! hahahaha Wendi's book arrived today-thanks again for sharing it with the Jewels. Oh, and I'm with you on the DWTS loser... too much ps for that chick, I think! Julie, Tinalee, and AZDonna- I hope things went well for you on your LAST trip to the chemo bar today. Congrats on being finished with chemo and may the se's be few. LJ- ¾ of the way there-not as good as being finished, but the end of the chemo train is just around the corner. Kimberly- lovely philosophy. It is so good to have our resident poet back! Confession time... I haven't even filled my cards out yet... I'm going to do that NOW, right after I post this message. Julie- yikes on the tv! On the positive side, thank God he wasn't aiming at someONE! It was an expensive lesson, but much less traumatic than some of the heartbreaking stories you hear on the news. It will be about 8 more years before the impulse control/reasoning area of his brain is completely developed, so prepare yourself for more no-common-sense moments in the foreseeable future! I'm really sorry about the tv, though... what a bummer! D1- little robin red breast-how funny! Congrats to CG on the internship. Joan- glad you checked in. So, you're 2 weeks out from chemo and already have fuzz. That sounds promising! Kris- good to hear from you. IMHO, I find Taxol much more tolerable than AC as far as fatigue and stomach trouble. It is a BEAR on pain for me, though, and I need something stronger than Tylenol for the first few days (esp. to sleep at night). But that passes and things get back to normal. I have enough energy to work and keep up with my own kids and my students and all the spring activities associated with teenagers. Hope it goes well for you with this part of your chemo! KathyL- sounds like you're a much valued employee. Glad you have some good options to consider. Good luck with your decision. Deb1023- hey girl! How have you been after Taxol # 2? My thermometer is definitely on the cold side most of the time. Night sweats haven't happened here yet, but I do occasionally feel the need to rip my topper off and cool the head! Patty- happy belated Bday to vetteguy. Glad you are able to be there for your sister. Best wishes to Denise. No need to apologize-- you are doing what you need to do. We're thinking of you both! Maz- oh, my dear! I am so sorry to hear about Val. You haven't had much time to absorb the fact that she has cancer and now this... You and Val will be in my thoughts and prayers. Your adventures on the Grey Rabbit Bus sound fabulous! You'll have to bring pictures to the retreat next year. Dana and WVGirl- best wishes for a smooth treatment day tomorrow. Rest well, Jewels!

      "Content": "Apr 21, 2008 02:48PM - edited Apr 21, 2008 02:53PM by RN2teach Hey Jewels, Just heading out to a baseball game. We have a busy week w/ 4 games scheduled. Vettegal- wonderful news! I'm so thankful that Denise's scans were okay. Now hoping they get her treatment started ASAP! Kris- I'm on Taxol every other week, not weekly, but for what its worth: have something on hand for the bone/muscle pain. My onco doesn't want me taking ibuprofen or aspirin because Taxol lowers the platelet count so much. He even frowns on tylenol taken regularly because it can mask a fever, but that is what I take most of the time. I have needed a narcotic pain reliever just about every night during the first week to calm down the pain so I can sleep. Here's hoping you won't have that much pain--it doesn't seem to be a consistent side effect for us Jewels. Please take LJ's advice on the iron: My blood counts have taken a nosedive, but I'm taking iron every day and so far the RBC/Hgb are in acceptable range. I have only experienced one bout of nausea on Taxol and I'm not taking any of the antiemetic drugs that I have on hand (phenergan and compazine). I need something for constipation, but not as much as with AC. I take a Colace every day (I needed 2 a day w/ AC). I'm with LJ--Taxol is much easier to tolerate than AC. GOOD LUCK! LJ- thanks for the link to the fatigue info. Tinalee- your bike outing sounds fantastic! Glad you are having good weather and can get outside. Kimberly- here's wishing you a very easy day in the chemo lounge. WOOHOO for the last one!! I'm right behind you!! Kathy- You're beautiful just the way you are, but I hear you on the photo ID. I'm sure they'll re-do the pic for you later--you'd have to be heartless to be mean to a BC survivor!  D1- hope dd's ankle is better today. Carol- love the new picture--even though I need a magnifying glass to see it! LOL Julie- wishing you a restful fog this time. Take care of yourself! Gotta go. I'll try to check in later. Paula",

My plan should be ready by Monday and the rads onco said I might be able to start by Tuesday or Wednesday. I have 6 areas marked for treatment. Two of the nurses at the center were BC survivors (One for 8 years, the other for 5 years) One is a NP who I worked with when I first got out of nursing school 24 years ago. I'll see her once a week through my rads. Deb1023- hey, girl! I'm sorry Taxotere is so rough on you. I've had my bad days with Taxol, but nothing compared to yours. I'm not sure why, but Taxol #3 was my worst. Taxol #4 was the same on symptoms (pain and fatigue, mainly), just not as intense. Bad timing on the co-worker's departure. Don't pick up the slack at the expense of your health! You know, I've never cried either... I'm glad you shared that. (((HUGS))) D1- what a special experience w/ your dd! I'm so happy for both of you that you went for it! LOL at the bucket list comment-loved that movie. Bummer that your rads was postponed by a day... wonder if they'd consider \"doubling up\" for a treatment to get you finished on time. My rads said I could potentially have 2 treatments in one day (at least 12 hours apart). Carol- love the picture of you and Steph. AND the pic of you with ds-what a neat hat he has! As for the tattoo... well, I know they're all the rage with teenagers, and the one your ds described was SOOOO sweet! (Gotta love a boy who wants to honor his mom in such a permanent way.) Neither of my kids have asked for one yet, so I'm not sure how I'll feel. Right now I'm leaning toward making them wait until adulthood for tattoos and piercings... The only arguments against them that I have are the risk of infection and that many teens regret their impulses to express their creativity through body art. So, ask yourself if ds will be responsible in caring for the tattoos while it heals, and is he mature enough that you think he won't later regret his decision? (It does sound like he's given it some thought and picked a discreet spot for the tattoo). I'd definitely be against one in a highly visible location. AND finding a reputable tattoo artist is cricital.  Tinalee- so, is your port out already, or soon to come out? I see my surgeon next Tuesday-guess I'll find out what to expect on mine then. Kathy- I believe Avastin is only approved for clinical trials and late stage cancer. I'm glad to be early stage and I don't meet the requirements for the clinical trials that I've found online. Still researching my options for treatment and follow-up... LJ- only one more to go! Glad everything went well today. LOL at the apple smashing-sounds like something I'd do. Maz- I'm so glad you're finished. May your last fog be light and easy. Patty- been thinking of you and Denise. I'm sorry you had a bad bald day. I've seen your balditude-you look great. Screw \u2018em all-just keep that smile on your face. Very good idea to have Vetteguy take care of the boob massage!! LOL Sherry- hope Friday is a nice warm spring day in MI. Kimberly- I think you're onto something with the apple smashing in the grocery store. Julie- good luck on your appt. tomorrow with the ps. ((Hugs)) Sorry ds' comments hit you hard. It was a good life lesson for him to learn how much you can injure someone with your words. However, I'd like to sucker-punch whoever said you look 10 years older... I've seen your pics and I'm not seeing that! Therese- are you working this weekend? Have a good one! Whew! Took a while to catch up on 2 days' posts. It is after midnight here, so technically Friday-TGIF!!! Paula",

By the time I get home from rads all I can think of is a soak in the tub and my pjs! Fell asleep during DWTS both nights and never saw the end of Team USA vs Tenn. last night. The fundraisers on Tuesday were exhausting, but well worth the effort-- we're $1,000 closer to our goal. I think we have about $4,000 to go... We have a few donations forthcoming--so hoping that Friday's McHOSA night is our LAST fundraiser! Julie- I've had you on my mind and in my prayers. Hope your surgery went well! CHJ- good to hear from you. Sounds like life is going to get hectic with the moves. Sending wishes for good weather and lots of energy for the tasks ahead. Kathy- I'm glad things are going well with you on the work front. Do be diligent in taking care of yourself. I worry about you with those babies at home.  Guess that's why we have them when we're young... LJ- watching for your post on that PET scan. Fingers and toes crossed for a good report. D1- sounds like a good outing with your ds. So, the nails are still funky, too? Bless your heart, girl! Is there a se that you missed?? Not many, I'll bet-- thank God its all over but the healing! CathyCA- I agree on the tats. Mine are tiny specks (barely visible). I felt them, but it was a quick pinchy feeling--nothing major. Joan- oh no! Red already? Keep me posted on the new cream. I've had some itching last 2 days. Tina- Hope the snow stays north of you! Kimberly and Carol- I am praying for both of you as you make the decision to rads or not to rads. Both of your margins are tiny--even if they are outside the acceptable range... I'm glad you're getting the second ops. I'm behind you both, my sisters, in whatever you decide. Best wishes to you both! OK, so I totally blew off my start time at work this morning so that I could post. My boss is sooo kind to me--I really shouldn't take advantage of that! We're having a \"company picnic\" for the students, so no class time this morning. I'd better head out, though. Lots of prep to do for the festivities. Students will arrive at 9am...

I've been involved in several different projects at school that kept me hopping the first part of the week. Wednesday brought all of that to a screeching halt. My nephew was visiting during his lunchtime and found my dh walking around dazed and unable to talk. By the time I got home he was having a full-blown seizure. An hour and a half and 20 mg of Valium later he was still seizing and had to be taken by ambulance to the ER. MRI showed 3 new masses around the old tumor cavity. Saw the neurosurgeon today... surgery is not an option. He can't have any further radiation to that area of the brain either, but stereotactic radiosurgery might be an option. We'll see the rads doc next Tuesday. Tomorrow morning we will meet with the oncologist to discuss chemo. Hoping to get him back on Temodar as his tumor is very sensitive to that chemo. Should be able to bring him home tomorrow. Carol- thanks for calling to check on me Wednesday. Your timing was great (even though I was driving!) I needed to share my troubles. Thanks for listening, girlfriend! To our JJs with new boobs: congrats on the new ta-tas and happy healing! Dana, D1, and everyone else making treatment decisions: thinking of you!

I'll look forward to hearing about them when you return! My rads are going well. The boob is a little pink. I have 19 more to go... Hair is coming in and just this week has started to look more brown than white. Still very, very short and sparse, but moving in the right direction. No eyelashes, but no arm/leg hair either... I need to get to bed so I can get to the hospital early tomorrow. Should be able to post again this weekend and update you on the latest. Take care, Paula",

Sorry to read about your ex-bil's cancer. Keep us posted on his situation. Julie- another Jewel who had a great weekend! Glad you were able to get your boat in the water and take a cruise on the lake! One of our neighbors brought me a huge bucket of fresh strawberries from his farm, so we're enjoying some strawberry desserts. My mom makes a terrific strawberry freezer jam so I gave her some of the berries for that. LJ- best wishes for a successful surgery and a speedy recovery tomorrow! WVGirl- good to see your posts. Aren't you having your last treatment this Friday? AC # 4, isn't it? You're almost finished!! Joan- my rads twin! I just had # 16. Notice a little bit of pink after each treatment, but it subsides by morning. No soreness or tenderness yet. I do have some swelling under my arm and my bra feels uncomfortable after my treatment... can't find one that I can wear comfortably, so I've taken to wearing those tees with the shelf bras-works out okay for me since I wear scrub tops all the time... those things hide a multitude of sins, know what I mean?! Looks like my rads schedule will be delayed some for dh's treatments. We saw the rads oncologist yesterday and he referred him to Duke for stereotactic radiosurgery (like the gamma knife). We will see the medical and radiation oncologists next Monday morning. There's no time to waste as his type of tumor doubles its size in as little as 2 weeks. He has 3 areas of concern, but the radiosurgery will only deal with one area and we will be discussing chemo for the remaining areas (which are too big and ill-defined consider rads). On the positive side, these two areas have always \"lit up\" on his previous MRIs... they're a little brighter now, but they've always been there-might be scar tissue or swelling instead of cancer... Time to hit the sack. Take care all, Paula",

Dh's niece invited us to use her condo, so no motel bills! We got good news at Duke. Dh's 2 distinct tumors are still there: one is stable (same size-good for a GBM which can double its size in 2 weeks), the second one is smaller and doesn't look as bright. The 3rd \"area of concern\" that was spotted on his May & June MRIs is GONE! So, he is responding to the meds and will continue on this trial. We arrived back home yesterday, dropped dh and ds off at home and then took dd to science camp for the week. Needless to say I am exhausted from all the driving I've done lately-6 hours to Duke, 3 more hours to the beach, 8 hours back home and then 3 hours to shuttle dd to camp and return home last night. Dh is still getting carsick (nausea, but no vomiting, thank God!). I'm going to check out airfares to Raleigh and see if we can start flying down. As it is he's been in the bed since we got home recuperating from the trip. I've caught up on the threads. Looks like most everyone is doing well...

Glad the aloe and grease (aquaphor) are keeping things tolerable for you. And ditch that bra, gf! Ah! A weekend of boating, good friends and good food (King Crab... YUM!). Sounds like just the ticket for celebrating summer! CathyCA- I love the nag calendar! I think I'll need one of those for ds next year. Hope you got your older son settled into a good place to continue his rehab and that he continues to do well. CONGRATS on being finished with rads!! Sounds like the weekend concerts were a nice way to celebrate. Deb- glad you had a good fishing trip-sounds very relaxing. A catch big enough for the wall, eh? WTG! And, yes, I'm tired of being tired and feeling achy and walking like my great-grandmother when I first get up from a chair (you shoulda seen me after those marathon driving spells!). I have noticed just this week that my legs aren't giving me as much grief at night. Hope that's a sign of good changes and not just a fluke d/t being so tired from all the traveling. SisKimberly- great news that PT is improving your ROM so quickly. I enjoyed your Chicago travel logs and all the pics. You look beautiful! Jenn- I hope you've had that knee looked at and everything is okay with that. I'm so glad your friend's son is coming around. Hope for another good report on him next time you post! Looks like you'll be finished with rads this week. I hope your skin holds up well for the last few treatments. I ended up red and a little tender around the nip and under the collarbone. My whole rads area is still peeling and my skin is slowly returning to its normal color. My nip is a hoot (pun intended) right now as the dark skin is peeling away from the inside out, so I have a dark ring around the edge... kinda reminds me of the Target dog, ya know?! KathyL- happy belated anniversary. Sounds like you had a wonderful evening. Intolerance issues? Yep, I've got a few... mostly for people who get bent out of shape about little things like waiting in line, etc. I just want to shake them and tell them to GET A GRIP! I hear you on the career tanners! I love a little color-just enough to take away my Casper look-but I was careful to lotion up with SPF 30 at the beach. Glad you treated yourself to a massage-bet it won't be the last one! D1- Cleaning away as always, I see! Glad you had a nice visit with your ds and her family. How nice to watch DC fireworks. I watched a little of them on PBS on the 4th. FOUR missing nails? That ain't fair atall! I'm still sporting black nails on my pinkie toes. The others are discolored but not black. My fingernails look okay but they're weak and ugly looking. I am also still on the fence with regards to genetic testing. I will see my surgeon and oncologist again in September and I'm giving myself until then to decide. I am fortunate to like both my surgeon (he's a babydoc whose specialty is surgical oncology) and my medical oncologist, so I'm going to continue to follow-up with both. They both approach follow-ups differently-surgeon wants scans, onco prefers mammos and bloodwork. Figure I'm getting the full package by continuing with both. I admire your sensitivity to the snobby boss' wife. Maybe BC will bring about a positive change in her attitude. I hope it is a good experience for both of you. Joan- hear, hear on the good report from your 6 month check-up! And your puppy is absolutely adorable! Vettegal- good to hear from you! You, Vetteguy and Denise have been in my thoughts a lot. ((HUGS)) It must be difficult to watch Denise choose a treatment option that you don't agree with. I'm praying that she'll choose the right path for her and that you'll be able to have peace and support her through her treatment. Hope that knee heals up quickly! Tinalee- two sons with short-term goals-life is good! So a move is in the cards for you? Colorado is a beautiful state. Hope things move forward smoothly for you! Julie- glad your trip went well (yep, I'm with the dogs-I was practically barking myself when I pulled into my driveway yesterday!). Good catch on the Lyme Disease-glad your dh is getting treated early. CHJ- LOL at your bedhead. I have enough hair now to cover my scalp (finally) and just this morning noticed that it looked messy. Still don't need anything other than my fingers to comb through it though... Does anyone notice the hair is growing in all different directions? My crown is sticking straight up, some goes to the left, some to the right. Not long enough yet to tell if it is going to be curly or not... looks straight for the most part. Oh yeah! I'm cheering you on through your last week of rads! Diana- Ariana is beautiful!!!! Congrats to you and your family on the new baby. I know I don't have to tell you to enjoy her! Kris and CHJ- Both my surgeon and onco agree on wanting me to keep my port until next year d/t my being triple negative and wanting to make sure I'm cancer free for 1 year before they pull it. I don't have any port issues, so I'll go with their recommendation on that. Dana- I'm so glad to hear from you. You've been in my thoughts and prayers. I can't believe you have to deal with a court case in the middle of cancer treatment and nursing school. It is a testament to your strength and spirit that you are doing well with school in spite of everything. October will be here before you know it! As for the cancer, praying for wonderful news with your scans next month. Glad the ex is being supportive-what a blessing! Keep moving forward, Lil Warrior! Sista- I'm sorry to read that you have a worrisome enhancement on the MRI. Glad the ultrasound and mammo didn't show anything... what was your surgeon's explanation for the enhancement? Scar tissue? Swelling? Breast changes? All of these could cause some enhancement, I think... Still, I wouldn't hesitate to get a second opinion, like D1 suggested. Good luck as you begin rads this week! Okey dokey, all caught up! Have a great day, Gems! Paula",

      "Content": "Aug 11, 2008 09:49AM - edited Aug 11, 2008 09:50AM by RN2teach Good morning, my Jewel sisters! We're back from Duke with good news-Ed's tumors continue to shrink! The MRI comparisons were beautiful to see. There's been a change in both of the tumors this time (only one was shrinking in July). Praise God! He'll continue with this clinical trial, of course, and we'll return to Duke in October. The fatigue is still a very troublesome se for Ed. He naps through the morning and afternoon and only has a few evening hours of feeling \"halfway decent\" before bedtime. His docs were actually considering LOWERING the dose of his trial meds d/t his fatigue, but I nixed that plan. Dang it, those tumors are shrinking-he can lie in the bed for a few months, right?! LOL I'm really not that unfeeling, but I think you know what I mean.... So, we're experimenting with the times that he takes the trial meds. The protocol calls for morning doses and we've adhered to that for 2 months. Now we're moving them to the evening. Hopefully that will make a difference in his daytime fatigue. Not a lot going on here otherwise. Took ds and his friends up to the state fair yesterday. I dropped them off and traveled a couple of miles down the road to a local park. Sat by the river with a book for the whole afternoon. Lovely! Today is my \"payback\"-the boys are meeting me in my classroom in a couple of hours to help me move rooms. Have also been working on curriculum-I took my laptop to the park yesterday, but couldn't tear myself away from my book... I am officially back to work on Thursday. Tomorrow ds and I head out for a couple of college visits. We've put together a nice portfolio to take with us over the past week. It still needs work, but it is a good beginning. Ds even got a haircut-a pretty dramatic one, too! I actually thought our hair was the same length until I took a pic of the two of us... not even close! Geez this hair is growing slooooooooooooowly. Here's a pic of me and my colleagues at conference last week.  I will be back later to catch up with you all-looks like it has been a little quiet. Carol, congrats on being all finished with rads!! I've been thinking of you all weekend. TTYL, Paula",

Haven't been online for a few days, but I've been thinking of you all. It has been a busy week. It took two days to get my classroom completely moved and organized. It looks great! Took ds for his college tours on Wednesday. My first official day back to work was Thursday. Carol- got your message Wednesday. Sorry I couldn't talk--ds and I were in the middle of college tour #2 when you called. I'll be looking forward to your post about your trip to CA!  Hope you're healing well and the rads burns aren't interfering with your 'cation fun. Kimberly- what happened with the HOA meeting? You make your own wine-- how cool is that?! Wish I could have been there to squish some grapes with you two! Lucy- another Jewel sister! Welcome!!! Maz- you're in my thoughts. Hope you have located a suitable caregiver for your mother by now. Congrats on being all finished with rads! How is your son doing? Kathy- sending relaxing 'cation vibes your way--enjoy the beach! Sherry- ooolala! So, how was your date? I've been thinking of you a lot. You've got a lot going on in your life with your daughter's upcoming wedding, the new job, all the tests AND a new man in the picture! Take care of yourself, girlfriend! Joan- 2 weeks in California... now that sounds like a great vacation! Good for you! Julie- so, do you have students already? Our classes start on Aug. 26. This week I'll be going to the clinical sites (hospital, etc) to get things ready for my students' clinical experiences. Also teaching CPR/first aid to the staff on Wednesday. Nearly 4am here... still not feeling tired enuf to sleep... wtf? Oh well, guess I'll go read for a bit... maybe that'll do the trick. Hope you all have a good Sunday. ~Paula",

Had a busy week at school-curriculum, meetings, etc. I taught CPR all day Wednesday to our county's school staff and was on my feet for 8 hours with only a quick break to gulp down a sandwich. Man, was I pooped after that day! Dh and I both had doctor's appointments yesterday with rads oncologist. I'll be having my first post-BC mammo in the near future. I'm not too sore, but the BC boob is definitely still traumatized from all the action this past year... not looking forward to squishing it for the mammo. Lots of activities coming up this fall: a couple of college visits with ds in early September. Mid-month I'll be out of the classroom for a few days with the WV HOSA officers (my student org.)-we're visiting the state capitol and meeting the governor on the 17th and going to Washington DC for a leadership academy Sept. 20-23. A couple of September doctors' appts for me (med onco. and surgeon), then back to Duke with dh Oct. 1st. First weekend in October we're putting on the state leadership conference for WV HOSA. Think I'd better be eating my Wheaties! Just in case that wasn't enough to plan for, we are short one health occupations teacher and looks like we'll be starting the year with a regular teacher sub... not a nurse. This will require me to plan out the lesson plans for both classrooms and rotate the kids so that they get all of the healthcare training they'll need (vital signs, sterile technique, infection control, patient care procedures, etc). Hmmm, forget the Wheaties-I need SPEED! SIS Kimberly, that supergirl cape would come in handy right now. I've just finished reading this week's posts. Everyone sounds great! Carol, my friend-I'm LOVING my Jewels CDs! I listened to them all week while I was working in my classroom. Dd was totally grossed out to see me rocking to Flo Rida. (It's a wild song, but I love \"Low\"). All of the CDs are great. Looks like you'll be home today from your \u2018cation. Have a good weekend! D1- your trip sounds wonderful! I'm so glad you all had a great time-thanks for the postcard from Hvar. Beautiful! I daresay that's as close as I'll ever get to being there... Have fun on your college tours this weekend. How fun that you'll meet Joan! Kathy- another \u2018cationer returning home. Best wishes for the coming week-going back to work and getting dd settled into the school routine. Sherry- The wedding is today! Sending warm thoughts your way. Can't wait for the wedding report and to see the pics! Kimberly- glad you got that room ready-you got a lot accomplished in one day! I'm so glad you and Carol and your dhs had such a great visit. Makes me sad that I couldn't be there. The pictures were great! Oh, and  I'm sorry about the fence-what a bummer that your HOA is being such a PITA... Julie- how painful to watch your son's team endure such a humiliating loss! Hope their next game goes well. So, you're REALLY back to school-grading papers... NOT one of the things I love about my job! Sounds like you're going to have a busy September, too... good luck getting your house ready and on the market. I hope everything goes well with that! LJ- finishing up rads, eh? Hope the skin holds up for the last ones. I agree with the rest-the boost contraptions are weird-looking. Glad it's almost over for you. CathyCA- great way to celebrate that \"empty nest\"-with a road trip! Hope you had fun. Here's wishing the rest of our Jewel family a great weekend. Paula",

I've spent most of the weekend right here in front of my computer working on lesson plans for myself and the sub. I have a good game plan established and feel a lot better about our ability to get these kids ready to work in the hospital in January. I hear you, Superior Mother! My ds is pumped about being a senior also. He only has 3 AP classes in his schedule this year, but we've worked a couple of college classes in as well. He is also taking health occupations classes, which will help him to score high on the entrance exams for the college health sciences programs. He'll be taking those in February. He came home with his first paycheck yesterday. Hmmm, could it be possible that it was 30 years ago when I brought my first paid earnings home? My, my... I would LOVE to meet up with you while I'm in DC. There are going to be 2 of us chaperoning the students, so I'm sure I can work in a visit if you don't mind coming in. We're staying in McLean at the Hilton Tysons Corner. I'll bring the agenda home from work tomorrow so we can make plans. How exciting! In answer to your question: isn't \"relax and smell the roses\" the same thing as \"chill and sip the vino?\"  I agree... I was trying to be funny (guess not!) and rework it to get Carol's mind off of the gardening. Speaking of Carol... sorry to hear about your gf and her baby girl. I'll keep them both in my thoughts and prayers. Zach sounds a lot like my Dale-- not a bit self-motivated to achieve academically. This year that seems to be turning around as college is looming. He saw from his recent interviews just how much his performance will impact the $$ he is offered. Hope that mindset lasts, but he IS a teenager still.... funky brain wiring and all that... Sherry, hope you got your bed ready to fall into when you get home today! Hope your day at work goes well. Heard from the newlyweds this week? Kathy, curls eh? My hair def has a different texture (I was stick straight also), but it isn't long enough to tell about the curls. I tried spiking it up last week, though, and it collapsed in spite of the gel-- I KNOW my \"real\" hair would have stood up on its own at this length. On a positive note, my SIL's hair came in different but eventually made it back to its original texture AND color. So, hopefully you'll be a natural blonde again... tho maybe not as soon as you'd like.   I'm off to finish up the laundry and proof ds' scholarship essays. He has a couple with deadlines this month. Then the evening is mine... think I'm going to kick back with a good book. I've read a couple of good ones this summer. My favorite was \"The Story of Edgar Sawtelle\" by David Wroblewski. It is the story of a boy who is mute and his dogs--I loved it! Elizabeth Berg's \"Dream When I'm Feeling Blue\" about 3 sisters during WW II was good also. I just finished \"Body of Work\" written by a doctor (Christine Montross) about her experiences dissecting cadavers. The book sounds morbid, but it really wasn't--promise! Well, maybe a little... but this woman writes so well! Anyone have suggestions for my next read? Paula",

Man, I remember when sleeping in meant you woke up in the PM! I'm gearing up for a busy week: all-day curriculum meeting Tuesday, accompanying student officers to meet the WV gov. on Wednesday, and off to D.C. on Saturday. Not sure what to do about dh yet while I'm gone... dd will be here, but she can't manage him alone. Have a few days to figure something out. It's been quiet on the boards.... Therese- good to hear from you. Glad your nips are now in place--let's hope they stay there (right, KathyL?)! If I remember correctly, you're up around Dallas. Hope you fared well during Ike's journey through your area. D1- Oh dear! Cancer SUCKS!!!!! Sending plenty of positive vibes and prayers for your sister. The waiting game messes with your mind so much... ((HUGS)) Kris- I got the same advice from my stylist. I was reassured to know I could get rid of my Santa beard w/o having to worry about it coming back black! I had my cheeks and chin be-fuzzed on the 3rd and I'm still smooth, so it doesn't appear to be something I'm going to have to do that often. Sherry- another walker in our midst! I know it will be a positive experience for you. WTG! Norma- you must have resized that pic cuz I can barely see you! Your hair looks so cute-- much longer than mine, I'm thinking. I think I'm picking up more curl as it grows. It seems to be straight, but then has this flip on the end. Can you post info on how we can order a calendar? I'd love to have one and I know the rest of the Jewels feel the same. LJ- I feel the same way 'bout this wavy stuff... Maybe it would be different if I'd had curls b4. Wonder how long this imposter hair will hang on. Never thought I'd be wishing for my stick straight hair back, but I do! Julie- vent away, girlfriend. Not fun when the frustrations hit you from all sides. The education system can be so political... frustrating is probably a mild word for what you're feeling! Hope things work out well for you and your program. The house listing got off to such a good start... sorry to hear that things have gotten bogged down. Sending good wishes that you'll get that straightened out quickly. Happy house hunting! I saw an ad in a magazine for the Stand Up 2 Cancer program that was on TV last weekend. Did a search and found the whole broadcast online at their website. It was good... got a bit teary here and there, though. Also wanted to report back on the tumor markers I'm having done: CEA, CA 27.29. I'm also having liver function tests. Here's info on the tumor markers From the American Cancer Society: The markers most commonly used to follow patients with advanced cancer or to detect recurrence are CA 15-3 and CEA. The CA 27.29 test is also used by some doctors. The CA 15-3 and CA 27.29 are probably equally sensitive, while the CEA is less sensitive. These markers are most useful in measuring the results of treatment for patients with advanced disease. Generally speaking, blood levels go down if the cancer responds to treatment and rise if the cancer progresses. Some doctors use these tests to look for signs of recurrence in women who have no symptoms of cancer after their first treatment. But most professional groups do not recommend using these markers to follow women already treated for early stage disease. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA): CEA is the preferred tumor marker for following patients with colorectal cancer during or after treatment, but it is not useful as a screening or diagnostic test. The normal range of blood levels varies from lab to lab, but levels higher than 5 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) are generally considered abnormal. The higher the CEA level at the time colorectal cancer is detected, the more likely it is that the cancer is advanced. Many doctors use this marker to follow other cancers, such as lung cancer and breast cancer. CEA levels are also elevated in many other cancers such as those of the thyroid, pancreas, liver, stomach, ovary, and bladder. They are elevated in some non-cancerous diseases and in otherwise healthy smokers, too. CA 27.29: CA 27.29 is another marker used to follow patients with breast cancer during or after treatment. This test measures the same marker as the CA 15-3 test, but in a different way. Although it is a newer test than CA 15-3, it does not appear to be any better in detecting either early or advanced disease. It may be less likely to be positive in people without cancer. The normal level is usually less than 38 to 40 U/mL (units/milliliter), depending on the testing lab. This marker can also be elevated in other cancers and in some non-cancerous conditions, and it may not be elevated in some women with breast cancer. and from the American Society of Clinical Oncology: Cancer antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3), cancer antigen 27.29 (CA 27.29), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). These tumor markers are found in 50% to 90% of patients with metastatic breast cancer (cancer that has spread outside the breast). However, high levels may also be a sign of another condition that is not cancer. Some doctors monitor these tumor markers to find an early recurrence (the return of cancer after treatment) in patients who do not show any signs of cancer after surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy. A doctor may also use this test to learn whether cancer treatment is working. Interestingly, neither society recommends scans or breast MRIs for F/U of breast cancer... both assert that scans/MRIs have not been \"proven\" to reduce mortality. Both recommend clinical exams and mammograms... that's it... Catch ya later, Paula",

Couldn't have made it through this year without you. I found my tumor on the Sunday after Thanksgiving last year-- Nov. 25, I think. Had my mammo on the 30th. I'll be going in next week for the annual squeeze and smash. Carol- hope the golfing weather is good today in AZ. You haven't mentioned your port surgery. Hope that means it is healing well and not giving you any grief on your 'cation. You said it well: \"no stop, pause, rewind or fast forward in this thing we call life\" SO true... but gee, what I coulda done with a rewind button... Carla- ah, I see yesterday was your cancerversary. I'm glad it's 2008 and all of that is behind you! Cathy- you did it! Congrats on completing your walk. Can't wait to see the pics. Kimberly- hope the port removal went smoothly yesterday. And a clean PET scan for Kath is wonderful news. Now you two can focus on kicking some BC butt! Kris- I'm glad your doc is being aggressive with this new tumor. You are so young... You have my best wishes and many prayers!   CHJ- A clean mammo--wonderful! Praying for good news from the MRI. Dana- how's the studying going? I'm praying for a good testing experience. When's the exam? Julie- ready for some turkey today? Hope everything went well yesterday. And to all of the rest of my Jewel family, Happy Thanksgiving!",

      "Content": "Dec 10, 2008 11:33PM - edited Dec 10, 2008 11:34PM by RN2teach Happy Anniversary Jewels! Thanks to everyone for your kind words. I can't adequately express just how much you all mean to me. It just boggles the mind that I've only met D1 in person. My ds graduates early--May 30. My last day of work is around June 15 and I'll be with my students in Nashville from June 24-27. So, Carol, a Jewels reunion on June 19-21 would work well for me. Lake Tahoe sounds fabulous.   Things are blissfully quiet around here. Dh is doing much better. Thank God, the steroids are doing their job. He's much more alert and able to talk and understand us again. He's even feeling well enough to do some small chores around the house. I'm almost finished with Christmas shopping. I did most of my shopping right here at my desk in my jammies-- gotta love modern technology! The kids and I did go out Monday evening to get dh's gift: a new tv and home theater system to replace the tv that went belly up last month. I have an armoire that I have had earmarked for a home entertainment system since I bought it back in the early 90s. Dh bought this humongous 52 inch HDTV around the same time, so my armoire has been serving as a storage cabinet. Now it is finally being used for its intended purpose and it looks great! KathyL- happy belated birthday!! I can't believe your final herceptin is just around the corner. Congrats on being finished with your treatment and feeling good. Wishing you many, many decades of health and happiness! (hope you didn't catch dh's virus...) Kris- back to work already? What a woman!! Breathing a sigh of relief on reading that your PET Scan is clear. LOL at all your witty remarks. You crack me up! Carol- puttering around in the yard still in December? Glad the weather is nice enough to allow that, although you know those marathon weeding sessions always make you feel like crap the next day! Ah, I see you had your MRI a little while ago. When will you get the results? Julie- I almost cried over the pups until I read a little farther and saw they were just missing for a little while. Glad they're okay. Our house is all decorated for the holiday on the inside, but I had some trouble with the outdoor lights and still haven't gotten around to putting them up. Maybe this weekend.... Cathy- good to see your 3-day pics. What a beautiful place to walk! Maz- HAPPY Birthday to you tomorrow! Glad you checked in and all is going well with you. D1- got my Christmas card yesterday--thanks! My new pic was taken in Senator Byrd's office in DC while we were there in Sept. I just got a haircut, so it looks much the same. Yep, I still have the pesky cowlick... Hmmm, we always have long wait times for the onc... where's my cocoa?! Interesting about the Megace. It is a targeted therapy drug that inhibits hormone production from the pituitary and adrenal glands. I'll have to investigate that one myself (inquiring minds wanna know and all that). Sherry- I'm happy to hear that you're through with K-Mart. It was having a negative impact on your health and who needs that after what we've been through, eh? Glad you got an early Christmas present to celebrate your new work-at-home job-- just what you needed! Kimberly- What a long day you and Kath had for her surgery. Hope she's feeling well this week. And you've found time to decorate in and out, work on a distinguished school award AND participate in a charity event. You're one busy gal! Norma- I got my calendars today. They're terrific! Love your new avatar pic. You look like you have more curl than I do--it's very becoming! Guess I'd better shuffle off to bed. My students are conducting a health fair for the middle school tomorrow. I've got to be there early to unpack the equipment from my van. Take care all, Paula",

Dh isn't feeling well, living in a constant state of confusion and lethargy. His chemo was delayed a couple of days because of abnormal values. He'll start his next round tomorrow. Ds had a great birthday bash. We had 20 teenagers--12 boys, 8 girls-- all playing Guitar Hero, Rock Band, listening to music, etc, for 8 hours. They took over the family room tv and set up another set in the dining room. It was total chaos and they had a ball! Most of them are under 18 and have to be off the road by 11pm, so that made a good stopping point. It was all too much for dh. I took him to his sister's house nearby and picked him up at the end of the party. I stayed around, but out of the way-- so different from those little boy parties when I had to entertain the masses... I got some great pics. They're such hams! Kimberly- what imagery your poem evokes! I love it! Back to the laundry-- one of the last chores of 2008. Happy New Year, Jewels! Paula",

It is the end of the semester here and today has been full of sub lesson plans, grading papers, final exam reviews, and working on scholarships (my ds's as well as writing reference letters for some of my students' applications). I procrastinated a bit on this stuff--had it with me all weekend and didn't touch a thing, which wasn't smart... I always work well under pressure though! I'm planning to be off for the rest of the week as I don't know what to expect at Duke. Gotta pop into the imaging center tomorrow afternoon for the CT Scan of my neck and then we'll be on the road around 2pm.  Can't tell that the steroids have helped a bit with dh's communication ability-- if anything, he's worse... practically down to nods and gestures now. His spirits are still fairly good... he's an amazing man! Vettegal- Laguna Beach looks heavenly! Love your hairstyle and color! Wendy! Glad you popped in. You sound pretty chipper, so I hope that means that all is well with your health-- 'cept the sleep issues, which many of us seem to have... I've popped a few of dh's lorazepams over the past week. Having trouble getting my brain to chill out so that I can get some zzz's... geez, I can't imagine WHY?   Maz, just wanted you to know that you're in my thoughts and prayers.   Cathy- Hip-hip-horray! Nice to hear that another Jewel will be de-ported soon. Congrats on finishing treatment. Are you the last one to finish up with the Herceptin? Carla- your new avatar looks great-- you look like a teenager! How's the butterfly feeling these days?   Joan- three cheers for the clear MRI. Wonderful news! I'll bet Lucy looks adorable in her pink bows, but I'm with her-- never been much of a foo-foo girl myself (aka frills, ruffles, and bows). D1- dd is 15. I was practically flat at her age.... 3 of dh's 4 sisters are big-busted, so I guess she got that gene, huh?  Add me to the Reggie fans. I SO wanted to see the Reggie and the Piano Man tour a few years back.    Off to bed... I'll check in from the blackberry and send an update, if I can.  Paula ",

There's no pic, so I wanted to make sure... Thanks again for the great meal. I can't wait until dh gets over this round so we can feast!  Julie- did a friend request. As soon as you confirm, I should be able to view your pics. I'm new to the whole Facebook thing. There's a link for it on my Blackberry and my sister has an account, so I finally did it a week ago.

Still chilly here-- it's up to 22 now after being -2 this morning. I think the arctic blast is over here. S'posed to be 30s by tomorrow and lows in the 20s. A heat wave!  Poor dh is still in bed.

I can turn up a Farley in practically every branch of the old family tree... If I were a dog I could be registered as a purebred! Fortunately for my IQ, no close relations married.

Sipping some wonderful flavored coffee that my SP sent to me a few weeks ago. (Thanks again, SP!)  I've got the blues this week. I know my whole family is in dire need of some grief counseling. The kids are both exhibiting stomach upset and ds is having sleeping problems. I'm in tears at the drop of a hat and poor dh... he can't even express what he's feeling.... I've contacted hospice and will have to talk to the onc. about a referral when we see him next week. Carol, I've been reconnecting with so many folks on Facebook. One of the neatest contacts that I've made is an old high school classmate who I haven't seen in 15+ years... She has an online business that is just terrific. It is a website for women that features how-to videos on a variety of things for the home, the garden, cooking, entertaining, etc. There's even a section on there right now that teaches the fundamentals of football (very timely w/ the SuperBowl coming up!) Here's the link: http://www.howtv.tv/index.html (BTW, Carol, if you love my accent, you'll get a real kick out of Pam's!)  Carla- nice to hear that dh is making some positive changes. I second the suggestion that now might be a good opportunity to get into some marriage counseling. Good luck!  Kimberly: leave it to you to give us homework! I don't know anything about Vegas and the only thing that really interests me about the area is the Grand Canyon... But I can surf the web with the best of 'em, so I'll give it a go.

About Facebook: I'm feeling pretty comfortable there now that I've made everything private. I am using my full name there, but have limited the info that one can find when doing a search to my name and a pic. They cannot send me a message unless I add them as a friend. Have to admit, I'm paying a lot more attention to what I'm posting here since I've read up on this topic (thanks again, LJ, for the link). On FB, I have decided to be very selective with the applications that I add (all those pokes and stuff) and have removed most of the ones that I had allowed access to my account earlier. If we're worried about stalkers and such, maybe it would be best to remove the references to our LV trip from this thread (as far as dates and hotels goes, not the general stuff). This forum is open to everyone, after all... our group on FB is much more private and anyone who doesn't do FB can be kept up-to-date via PM here or via email.  I'm going to check my old posts after I finish posting this....  Maz- thinking of you today.

Hmm, I don't remember the baby commercial... back to hulu to check it out... Wendy- happy birthday!! Deb- another good song fr. PF. I love the guitar solo in that one. I'll catch you on FB.

I still notice it when I stretch my arm, but not painful anymore. AZ Donna- rest well and feel better soon! CathyCA- have a good weekend in Park City! Joan- we're here for you, girlfriend! Sending good vibes your way. Judy- glad to hear your chemo will be given local. Jenny- I'm still on the fence about the wig thing. I thought I would like wigs better--seemed to be the less conspicuous way to go. Well, that was before I saw what I looked like in a wig! So, I have a couple of caps and a couple of wigs. Carol- the FUBC bracelet was a sweet gift--I love it! DianeB- very glad to hear that the CMF went well for you. LJ- hope those dark days are lighter this time. KathyL- I am so sorry to hear what you've been through. Take care of yourself. You're in my prayers. D1- I loved your idea for Kathy's little ones. Vettegal- so glad everything went well today. I am 1 week from Tx # 1 and still no metal taste. I have made it a point to baby my belly, like LJ mentioned in her post. Remember that your skin, nails, mucous membranes in your nose & mouth, and stomach lining are all made up of rapidly growing cells. Chemo hits those types of cells a bit harder, which is why you get the sahara mouth, heartburn, etc. So hydrate, moisturize and eat small, easily digested meals. Jenn51- you're allowed to get the blahs whenever you want. Glad you checked in--we've missed you! Sista- glad your treatment went well. Your question is a good one. There are two reasons given for condom use. (other than birth control, of course) One is that condoms should be used for the first 3-4 days after each treatment because some chemotherapy agents might be present in sexual fluids. The other is to protect the one undergoing chemotherapy from possible infection when blood counts are too low. So, at least for the first 3-4 days, anyway... which wasn't even an issue for me, cause I slept through most of those days with my first treatment! My students gave me a very sweet gift today--a necklace with the \"What Cancer Cannot Do\" poem. I'll end with the words for anyone who hasn't seem them yet: What Cancer Cannot Do It cannot steal eternal life invade the soul shatter hope. Cancer cannot destroy peace suppress memories silence courage conquer the spirit kill friendship corrode faith cripple love. Have a wonderful weekend, Gems! Paula",

Jackieb and AZDonna- be thinking of you tomorrow as you have your chemo. (Jackie, hope the first one goes well for you!) Catch you later, Gems Paula",

My stomach is a little shell-shocked, so I skipped the AM coffee, but like Kris I wanted that caffeine! I swore off coffee with round 1 for a week and expect to do the same this time. I found Twinings English Breakfast to be a good substitute. For all you Gems out having a se-free Saturday, enjoy yourselves! For my Sisters in Survival who are sidelined by se (FUBC), I'm right here with you. We'll have our day in the sun next weekend!

Jenn51 and Sista2- we are so glad to hear from you girls. I'm sorry the FUSE have sidelined you. Remember, there are no rules when it comes to chemo. As our wise Gems here keep saying: listen to your body. Okay, all of you gals with cravings- add my name to the list. Between tx 1 and 2 it was fresh fruit. This cold has prevented any cravings this time. Between the chemo and cold I haven't got a taste bud left! Denise- welcome to the Jewels! Since it will take you awhile to get thru the posts and find the info you need, I'll recap the constipation advice. Many here swear by Miralax taken once a day from the day of treatment thru day 4ish(?). Others of us take Colace during that time. And don't forget to stay well hydrated. Drink plenty of water--it helps tremendously. Kris- here's hoping you need no more abx-- we have enuf to worry about w/o yeast infections! Carol- happy treatment day. Kick some bc bootie today! I had a very nice surprise yesterday at work. All the ladies that I work with joined my classes in wearing hats in my honor and at lunchtime they presented me with one of those edible bouquets (fruit arranged to look like flowers--it even had choc. covered strawberries!) I have a couple of pics to share later. I wish all of you working gals had a work environment like mine. It makes this journey sooo much easier. And speaking of work-- gotta finish getting ready and head out! Have a good one, Sisters! Paula",

My tea tastes okay, water is nasty though. I'm carrying my mouthwash with me so I can gargle more often--seems to be helping. Everything else is going okay. Colace is keeping things moving on the other end. Oh yeah, I was having a big prob. with the watery eyes as many of you all reported. I did warm moist soaks and massaged the tear ducts 3-4 times a day thru the weekend and the watery eyes are gone. I'm doing the soaks once a day now. Hope this is helpful to some of you who are experiencing this problem. D1 and Sherry- Vernor's??? Sherry- how exciting to have your dd's wedding to look forward to! It sure sounds beautiful. Keep us posted on the plans as they develop. Kris- your back pains sound so familiar. On the hopeful side, I had the spasms after my first Neulasta, but not after the 2nd one. It has been 6 days since #3 for me... holding my breath that the spasms stay away! Get some good drugs to help you through the rough days! Your support group is awesome, BTW--thanks for sharing the picture! Kathy- I love hearing about your little ones... potty training.... def. one of those things I DON'T miss. Hope it goes well for you and ds! Joan and Tinalee- hope the se are mild from your chemo this week. PaLady- you had it rough there trying to take care of your ds during the \"dark days\" after your chemo.

My whole body is sore today (had that after round 3 also). Slept for 12 hours, but was awake every few hours to drink H2O and relieve the Sahara mouth. dh bailed out and went to the guest BR... guess I was tossing too much. I'm having more nausea this round, too. Have taken several doses of phenergan--it's working well, thank God! Judging by how I feel right now, I'm going to be enjoying this beautiful sunny day from the recliner. It is supposed to be really nice here the next few days (we're SO ready for that, right CHJ?!). I should recover by tomorrow and be able to soak up some sunshine. Sista- sounds like your insurance is taking an unnecessary hit on office visits. Hope you can get that corrected easily. Carol- nice pic--that position looks so familiar--take away the dog and add a big fat yellow tabby and that's me! Insurance companies just don't get it on prevention... it makes no sense! Our insurance has been pretty good thru dh's cancer and tx. They denied one $4,500 PET scan (called it experimental). We lost that battle after 3 appeals, and would have gone to litigation had the hospital not decided to write it off for us. (They've received the bulk of the $300,000 for dh's tx so far... maybe that made them generous?). I just got a bill for my port that I'm going to be calling on tomorrow. They paid $210 and left me with $390 to pay... I miss our FSA. We lost that when dh became disabled (my employer doesn't offer one). For the past 2 years we have accumulated around $5,000 per year out of pocket expenses... I shudder to think what it will be this year with mine added on. KathyL- thanks again for this week's list! I'm praying that everything will work out for you to attend the memorial service for Wendi. Sista- are you up for tx on Thursday this week? Theresa- I'm a bit nervous about Taxol, too, but forewarned is forearmed, right? We're prepared! WVGirl- glad you had a nice dinner. Add me to the Relay participants-- dh lost both his parents to cancer in the 90s. We've been involved since then. I've also been active in breast cancer fundraising for ACS. I have done several teaching sessions on BSE. Used to sell Longaberger baskets (Ohio-based business) and they have an annual breast cancer basket w/ proceeds to ACS. That's how I first got involved. I'm looking forward to the Komen walk this year... ours is early (May 3), hope I feel like walking. My students have really taken up the breast cancer cause. They're wearing pink ribbons and plan to pass them out at their leadership conference this weekend. They will be doing the Komen walk also. Wow! I have outdone myself for a foggy day... my Darjeeling and toast must've given me an energy boost! I need all your good vibes this week. I will be staying after school to prepare my students for their competitions. I leave on Thursday and will be working long hours thru the weekend. Okay, time to take my chatty fingers to the recliner Paula",

My bratty resp. bug took me down yesterday. Went to work and within an hour started chilling...put on my coat...still shivering... added my scarf (my neck gets cold)...still chilly...broke out the blanket (nice to have a clinical lab for my nursing assist. students!). Started out w/ norm. temp, was 101 by lunchtime. Got my ducks in a row at work and headed over to onco office. He did labwork (WBC low, but not too low for chemo this Fri), NP swab (up the nose--not a fun thing), and chest xray. Started on Avelox, an anti-infective. Took tons of cough meds (didn't need the whiskey ) and slept well. Feel pretty good this morning, esp since my Hgb was only 8.1... should be feeling a little sluggish, I'd think! D1- sounds like your legu is an expert. Glad to hear that you're getting the best care. Thanks for the link to the taping info. Kathy- can't wait to see pics from the daddy dance. And, as always, excellent info for Jenn on the possibilities of that shadow on her MUGA. We are fortunate to have you as a Jewel! Therese and Kathy- I breastfed my 2 kiddos as well... so much for lowering the risk of BC!  CHJ- I broke out the funky earrings when I lost my hair. Haven't had any of the earring issues, tho.

Feeling pretty good right now--a little tired from all the benadryl, but I napped a little during my infusion. My blood work had improved dramatically since Tues. w/ my WBC up to 8.9 (4.something earlier) and Hgb now 9.3 instead of 8.1. Everything went very smoothly. My nurse hovered for the first 30 min. I also was on BP monitor thruout the infusion. About 1.5 hours into the tx my cough started acting up... nurses descended on me from every corner! Nice to know they are diligent. Carol- you are such a SHERO and a good example to all of us for reaching out to those around you and offering your help and support. BTW, how is Kalen? Hope she is doing well. Dana- your feelings always matter, but there will always be people who won't get it. Vent those feelings to those who care and choose to respond to every situation positively (hear, hear SIS Kimberly--take her advice--there is no use wasting negative energy on clueless people!) As always, hang in there, LW! Tina- you and our NE sisters (isn't someone here from Maine?) definitely see more than your \"fair\" share of snow. I spent a year of high school as an exchange student in Finland. The snow, darkness, and cold temps took some getting used to but it is a beautiful country. I've never been to MN, but I know the area has a good number of Finnish immigrants so I suppose they must have felt at home there. Anyway, like you, I am waiting for spring and taking every opportunity to soak up the sunshine when it makes an appearance. Sheshe- What a journey you have had to take care of yourself. I'm so sorry that you haven't had the family support you needed. Are they coming around now that they realize that they were wrong? I'm so happy that you are finally getting the care that you deserve! KathyL- glad you're making the most of your productve days! Kimberly- good to see your post. Glad you're still feeling well at this point. May your fog be thin and rise quickly! D1- I am a positive person by nature, but I know the Jewels have given me an extra dose of strength to fight this battle--nice analogy to the military, BTW. I was a little extra chatty today, thanks to my steroid buzz. I DID march in today on a mission. I need to start my rads within 2 weeks after finishing chemo in order to take my students to their conference in Dallas this June. So, I met with my onco's NP today and gave her my game plan--I mentioned it to my onco Tues. and he indicated that it was doable. Of course, all of this is contingent on my blood levels staying up and chemo remaining on schedule... Deb1023- hope you've had an uneventful day in the chemo suite today. I really did get the suite today- the corner rooms are enclosed and have a window to the outside world. Say plenty of sunshine this morning, but the clouds rolled in right at the same time as my Benadryl coma and it is raining now.. Mom just delivered my supper--time to go! Paula",

You were way ahead of us on dealing w/ the hair loss... no wonder you've got good info to share on hats and wigs. Vettegal- Cancer def. helps you get your priorities straight, doesn't it? One of the positive things about dh's cancer 2 years ago was that we were forced to slow down. We spent the summer (while he was going thru chemo and rads) kicked back on our front porch visiting w/ neighbors and friends. Porch sitting is now a new form of relaxation for us!

I believe I got my state abbrev. confused and moved you north a few states from Mass. to Maine. DUH! LJ- another brilliant response (to D326). Glad you're a Jewel! Kimberly- I learned to drink coffee when I was a high school exchange student in Finland. Finns pride themselves on their coffee which is rich and strong. When I came home, I found our brands just couldn't compare... when you make them strong, most of them are bitter. Gevalia is Swedish coffee and very similar to the Finnish coffee I learned to love. And, yes, I order it online. They have lots of varieties (I prefer the Traditional and Stockholm roasts) and they also have some excellent teas. Wishing you a wonderful weekend in Tahoe! Dana- glad your treatment went well today. CathyCA- you are another Jewel who inspires me to keep exercising. Thanks for the positive influence, sister!

Julie- hope the migraine is over and you're resting well tonight LJ- So, you have 5 more weekly T/H, right? Glad this week's went well.  D1- Sounds like your bil is going to be okay. I'm glad he's feeling better. I don't know if the Xrays serve the same purpose, but dh had a CT scan every week so the physicists could adjust the angles on his rads. He got zapped from 6 different angles and they had to be precise to hit the tumor bed and minimize brain damage. Jenn- my dh has taken over most of the housework and laundry in the past 2 years. The kids whined about how he did their clothes (he can't fold well, so everything is wrinkled, and he can't recognize who the clothes belong to, so we all get each other's clothing). Anyway, beginning in January I \"solved\" the problem by making the kids responsible for their own clothes. They have their own hampers in their rooms. Unfortunately, dh isn't cooperating... and the dd has PMS this week... PALady- I read with interest about your experience getting lined up for your rads, since I'll be there in a month. Sounds like I'd better work hard to be sure I have full range of motion in my arm... D326- best wishes to you as your begin your chemotherapy. Sunshine- congrats on being finished with your chemo!!! Carol- happy 98th Bday to grandma! Therese- wishing you lots of energy for your first weekend back at work. How sweet you are to walk in honor of your support group! You're a rare Gem, texRN! Dana- hey there, how'd it go today? Have a great weekend, everyone!",

      "Content": "Apr 1, 2008 11:34PM - edited Apr 1, 2008 11:37PM by RN2teach Evening, Js. I'm feeling better every day. We had a beautiful sunny day w/ temps in the 70s-ahhhh! Woke up this morning pain-free and didn't start hurting until lunch time-and even then I just had general aches-not the intense pain of this past weekend. Not enjoying the pain, but at least it can be relieved with meds and I don't have the fatigue and the rot-gut feeling that I had w/ AC. I'm glad to be at a pain level now that is controlled w/ plain old Tylenol. Good luck to our chemo warriors today: Joan (joteach-LAST ONE!!!), Judy (sheebas), and Wendy (wing). Hope the se's are light and short-lived! Maz- hope you're feeling better! You, Kimberly, Julie and Peg have three chemos at once.... I'm amazed at how well you are doing/ Hang in there-you're getting closer to the finish line. Kimberly- I'm glad you had a relaxing weekend away. Hope this weeks chemo se's are light. I'm not a fan of narcs, either, but they sure are my friends right now! This is the first time I've ever had to take anything stronger than Tylenol/Advil. My surgeon gave me an Rx for Lortab after my lumpectomy and I never filled it. Onco warned me that I might need it b/c I'm getting a pretty good dose of taxol. Glad he was looking out for me! I had a lumpectomy and that's it for me. I've lived with these gals for 46 years-16 years in their current saggy state. We've come to a peaceful co-existence. Jenn- I'm having those sharp stabbing pains on my breast, too. Mine just started within the last few days. They start sometimes from deep in the breast and radiate out to the armpit... other times it is just the opposite. I don't have any new swelling, no warm spots or red spots, or any other signs of trouble... wonder what's up with that? Wow, hate to see your water bill this month! I can sooo imagine myself doing something like that... Carol- welcome home! I'm looking forward to hearing about your retreat. Hope chemo se's don't get you down too much. Sunshine- good to hear from you. Glad you were off with your dh having some fun! I have seen a few of my EOBs for chemo. It wasn't as much of a shock for me after dh's cancer 2 years ago. I think his total bill for chemo was over $30,000. And if that sounds bad, his radiation bill was over $65,000! As you said, thank God for insurance (and special prayers for those who don't have it!). Therese- I know what you mean about the Jewels... I wonder around and post occasionally elsewhere, but I have to check in with my sisters every day! Tina- I'm glad my pain was short-lived, too-I can do this! And just 2 more to go for both of us! Sounds like your friend has a very good prognosis-I'm happy for both of you. Kathy- thanks for the link to your Relay page. I'm doing the Komen Walk on May 3 and Relay for Life in June. We've been involved w/ Relay for a while (dh's parents both died of cancer in the 90s). CarolC- I'm so glad you have a good lawyer on your side. My best wishes to you on finding a workplace where you are valued and can be happy! CathyCA- haven't been to see the Boss since I had kids... Sounds like fun! D1- thanks for the skinny on rads. Those of us coming up fast behind you appreciate knowing what to expect! I think you're doing the right thing with your skin. My friend, Pam, who did so well (no burns) did the same thing during her rads. Sending many healing thoughts and prayers for your bil, as well as your whole family. Paula",

My ds has had ballgames the last 2 evenings. He's hitting the ball really well this year. He fielded the ball well and had some good plays. I can still remember those T-ball days when he'd spend as much time chasing butterflies as chasing the ball! I'm lucky that dh enjoys DWTS, too. Still can't decid on the fav. Kristi , Marli, and Shannon are great. But there are a coupla fellas who are easy on the eyes and can dance as well... Jason dances really well for a big fella (I think he's 6'6\"). And the guy who dances w/ Cheryl is good. Carol- Reggie is just too adorable for words!  Sounds like the retreat was fun. I'm glad you enjoyed it.

You deserve it! D1- I'm glad to hear good news about your bil. Will be praying that the MRI shows no damage from his ordeal. I'm sorry that you've had worsening of your le. I hope you and the legu can keep it under control while you're doing rads. The guide wire thing sounds painful! I didn't have that. The worst thing for me was the dye injection in the boob for the sentinel node biopsy.

Tinalee and Donna- you're a week ahead of me on T # 3. Best wishes for a smooth treatment and few se's! Sunshine- Happy last day of chemo!! Oh, and I wanted to mention some other Taxol se's I've noticed. Unfortunately, I've got some swelling. My weight had been steady thruout all these weeks until now... I'm up about 5 lb. My rings are tight. Even my loosest head garb leaves big dents in my scalp. I'm leaving my headgear off more and more as the weather warms up. My students and co-workers are tolerating my baldness just fine! And my fingers look really weird. I remember someone asking about this some time ago. The pads of my fingers look wrinkled--like I've stayed in the bath too long. I'm also having some skin peeling on the tips of my fingers. Fortunately, I only had a tiny bit of neuropathy around day 2-3. OK, all caught up... not feeling the least bit sleepy, but I've been up for an hour so I'm going to try to catch some zzzz. Paula",

Everything went very well--ds was one of the inductees and also gave the invocation. I was so proud of my boy AND all of our new members.  Kimberly, I went straight from school to the post office and mailed my SP cards and SAS envelopes to you.   Jumped back in the car and headed to the ball field. I didn't realize when I signed up for concessions this evening that I would be working all 3 games. On the positive side, the two gals I worked with are great and we enjoy each others' company. But we were SO ready to get out of there when the last game ended at 11:30pm. The highlight came late: ds hit a homerun in the 3rd game, bottom of the 5th, to tie the game! Unfortunately, we ended up losing 12-10, but ds was PUMPED about the homer--the first in his baseball career! Carol- I read a chapter of Wendi's book last night. She was so beautiful... it IS going to be an emotional read, I think. \"To boob or not to boob\" --got a good laugh outta that one! Julie- sending strong, healthy, feelin'-good vibes your way. Hope they help to keep the se's away! Glad the earthquake didn't do any damage--a TV is enough for one week, eh? KathyL- dang! Figured I might be okay in the eyelash department since I've only got one more chemo to go... so I'm going to continue losing hair AFTER I'm done?? I know I didn't sign up for THAT side effect. hahahaha  So, Kathy, I guess you won't get THOs (titty hard-ons) with the new nipples when the weather is cold? Therese- hope your ds is feeling better now. Are you back to working every weekend? Glad to hear your BRCAs came back negative. I'll be having mine done soon. Joan- LOL I thought the same thing about Priscilla--she CAN'T smile! I know Neil Young wasn't talking about plastic surgery when he wrote \"The Needle and the Damage Done\" but for some reason I always think of that song title when I see a botched ps. Dana- you're in my prayers--I want you to be able to tolerate your treatments and remain in the nursing program. Keep moving forward and don't waste precious energy on negative people--IGNORE THEM! Well, I think I'm winding down from my busy day and can get to sleep now. I've always been that way--when I worked evening shifts I would get home at midnight and I could never get to bed before 3am. Hope all of you Gems have a great Saturday! Paula",

YOU don't need the stretch but I'm thinking I could benefit from a little elongation--take away a bit of the chub, ya know?!)  Lemme see... chubby me.... Or stretched me...  Hehehe... too bad it ain't that easy to change the image in real life! Deb, Deb, Deb! I am so glad to hear from you my tri-neg sister! I'm a little blown away that you've been prescribed Arimadex also, but I guess it is no less weird than my surgeon recommending an oophorectomy for me... hello? thought estrogen wasn't a big deal for me... besides which I'm post menopausal (last period was in 2006). I'm so sorry that you're having trouble with LE. This BC just keeps on giving, doesn't it? Hope the therapy gets everything under control for you. Sending positive vibes and lots of prayers your way! Glad you popped in to update us on things in your world, Vettegal! Congrats on being finished with your treatments (and give that sweetheart of yours a BIG hug from the Jewels--we all love Vetteguy. I'm so happy that you have such a great dh, Patty!) Tell Denise we're thinking of her and cheering her on through her treatment decisions. D1- you are a hoot, girl! I was thinking the same thing w/ Therese's entertaining SP gift... guess we got us a pair of dirty minds, eh? Ok, now I must bow to pay homage to the Queen of Clean among us Jewels. You humble me with your escapades into the dark regions of the dust bunnies. May the force be with you sister, cuz I ain't goin' there! I done hired me a housecleaner... but I DO understand the whole having-to-clean-behind-them thing. Hope the G & T tastes good this evening. I'm enjoying a great pinot grigio to celebrate being finished with my rads. Speaking of rads, how'd the sim go today, LJ? Hope the arm held up well. Thanks BTW for the words of wisdom you add to this thread along the way. I really appreciate the good advice. Therese- you sound great! Glad things are going well for you. So, you're close to Dallas, eh? I have family in McKinney and Allen. I'll let you know next time I'm down there for a visit. Maybe we can meet up! Hope you have a great time at the gathering tonite, Carol!  Glad you guys are having good weather there, too. Should make the evening out that much sweeter! We're having some rain here, so no hammock, but the front porch swing is nice. I took a nap in the swing this afternoon--very comforting to sleep to the symphony of a summer rain... I'm so happy to be finished with my treatments... feeling a little melancholy, but trying to shake that off. Dh's cancer will keep me from dwelling on myself too much. He's having much more fatigue now... sleeping most of the day and night. Hopefully d/t trial meds and not tumor progression... we'll get another MRI in 2 weeks. Thank you D1 for starting this thread. Where would I be tonight without my Gems to share with?! Love you all! Paula",

      "Content": "Jul 21, 2008 12:05AM - edited Jul 21, 2008 12:10AM by RN2teach Hey everyone, Busy few days here. Dh is on Prevacid now and is feeling much better. I've been practically glued to his side and afraid to leave him over the past week. He had a small seizure Tuesday and I was afraid there might be more to come. Ds and dd have some experience dealing with his seizures, but I feel better if I'm in control. By Friday he was over the worst. Saturday afternoon I got an invite from some friends to go out to dinner and a movie and I jumped at the opportunity to go out and unwind for a bit. We saw Mama Mia. I had heard such good things about the play and the movie was quite enjoyable. I love Meryl Streep-who knew she could SING?! (And what a trip down memory lane hearing all those old ABBA songs). Topped the weekend off with a shopping excursion this afternoon with my bf (my beach trip buddy). Very nice! Just caught up with all the posts. Can't believe I haven't posted since Wednesday... Maz- my friend, I am very, very sorry to hear of your father's death. It is a lot to cope with after losing Val so recently. I'll be praying for your strength to deal with your feelings and to finish with your radiation. I'm glad that scary hospital stay didn't show anything serious. It does sound like a classic anxiety attack (you definitely had good cause for one), but please don't ignore the symptoms if they return. Take care of yourself! Carol- I was SO surprised to get a visit from the seafood fairy on Wednesday! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! You are terrific! Wow- can't believe your onco is shifting gears on your targeted therapy... You're all set for Tamox and now it will be an AI? Talk about messing with your mind! Hope ds made it home safely. I second the comments on what a great experience this was for him competing nationally-and 4th place ain't too shabby! Take care of those tootsies, gf! Kimberly- ya mean Sun Chips aren't a health food???  LOL at the image of you bouncing around on your exercise ball! I second the motion to adjourn to the condo at Tahoe for further curriculum development. Julie- the boating trip sounds wonderful! Glad you got to enjoy some lake time! D1- congrats to dd on her super AP scores. I just got ds's in the mail... wish I could brag, but the boy bombed his... Dang it! Oh my... just read about your friend's death. I'm so sorry. FUC!!! WVGirl- Glad to hear from you and that your surgery went well. HURRAY on the good path report!! You've been so strong through all of this and your DH has definitely not been there for you. Hope you're healing well and getting the support you need right now. Don't hurry back to work before you're fully recovered. LJ- thanks for sharing your pic of your bracelet. I love it-much better than the standard ones. My dh has that same charm, so I have the info to order my own here somewhere.... Your emerald is beautiful-what a wonderful remembrance of your mother. Kathy- glad you caught the dehumidifier before things got out of hand. We opted not to have a basement when we built out house d/t to the moisture factor here... Hey, 40 hours a week with two little ones makes you a SHERO in my book, gf! Dana- you're still in my prayers, Lil Warrior! Sherry- Your dress for the wedding looks very pretty. I think the shoes are TOO cute, but I wonder if you need a little heel with that length of dress. You might consider wearing your sister's heels for the wedding and slipping into those adorable flats for the reception. I can see what Kimberly is getting at about the color. (I found the same thing with one of my beige caps while I was on chemo. I was so pale that the beige made me look washed out.) Play with your makeup and consider adding a little color to your dress or with your accessories-esp. right around the neckline. I love the style--very classic. I'm so excited for you-your smile is contagious! Sista- LOL at the sales clerk's reaction to your comment! Would have loved to see her face (and yours!). Norma- Davis & Elkins is in a beautiful area of the state. It is about 3 hours north of us. Ds and I may be checking that school out as well. Wouldn't it be neat if we could time our boys' campus visits at the same time?! Keep me posted if you decide to visit there. CathyCA- Hurray for the \"boring\" check-up. Here's to your getting back to being ridiculously healthy! Jenn- so good to see your post. No need for excuses, girl, you have a life to live! Congrats on being finished with rads!! Glad you're getting that knee looked at (finally). Oh, best wishes for your doggie friend (poor thing!). Hmmm, dh is back up and feeling perky IYKWIM...  gtg Paula",

Dh had several big seizures Friday evening. He was stung by a wasp just an hour prior to the first episode... dunno if that contributed to the seizure, but I wonder... He slept through the weekend and is starting to feel better. I'm a bit uneasy about leaving him, even though both of the kids will be here and they're trained to take care of him. I take dh for his next MRI on Monday and we'll be heading back to Duke next Wednesday. I always have trouble getting to bed before a trip-too much running through my mind.

He should be able to rake in some college dough. If he has time, you might want to get him started on scholarship essays. The basic essay for many scholarships should include his career goals, why he chose the field he will pursue, and how he plans to reach his goals. I start my seniors off with this essay every year and they take that essay and tweak it a bit for most of the scholarships they apply for. I agree with you about the lack of guidance on college/career planning. There's a great website that I use with my students: http://www.educationplanner.org/ that you might find helpful. Sherry- so, did you take back the cute flats? I hope you found some that you'll be comfy in for the wedding. I'm glad you made it out of the store without having to beat someone with your shoes. (They'd have deserved it, of course!) SO glad to hear that Brandy survived the job cuts! Julie- home already?! Glad you got to come home today-you'll rest better there than at the hospital. Kick back and let your men wait on you (if yours are like mine, that doesn't happen very often). I'm off to bed for a few hours-gotta be ready to go in 5 hours... Wish you all the best for the rest of the week. I'll catch you on the weekend. Paula",

My classes are full- we have block scheduling, so 2 classes of 30+ and another smaller block of 17 for my elective class of medical terminology. I have a game plan established with the sub that is going to be win-win for both of us. She's an English major, so she'll be working with the kids on their college essays and portfolios. Frees me up to teach healthcare AND gets me out of lots of essay proofing- gotta like that plan! So, happy Labor Day holiday to all the Jewels. Hope the weather is nice for those who have the weekend off and have plans! Carol- Ouchy on the mole removal! Take it easy on the gardening. You'll have to substitute \"chill and sip the vino\" for \"relax and smell the roses\"! Sorry to hear about the tattoo business. ((HUGS)) to you and Zach. Our teenagers' bodies mature faster than their brains. They'll be in their early 20s before the brain has completed \"wiring\" itself in the area responsible for making good decisions and controlling impulses. I'm glad Zach's health screen was okay and keeping fingers crossed for the 6 month follow-up. Sherry- thanks for sharing the wedding pictures. Like Kimberly, I loved your necklace- great accessory! You were a lovely mother of the bride. I'm so happy everything went well. LOL at the image of you mopping the floor on the morning of the wedding. Joan- You have a great head of hair! I think you'll be getting a lot more compliments on your new look! Enjoy your last days of liberty before the school year begins. Hope you have a smooth first week of school! Julie- wow! Things are moving fast with the house. Don't envy you all the cleaning and keeping things picked up for the house to be shown. Good luck! Kimberly- looks like school hasn't slowed you down any- off on another getaway, I see! Hope you have a wonderful time in Ashland. Kris- thinking of you today- how did the port removal go? WTG dropping 10 lb. since chemo. I'm with you on the facial hair- double AARRRRGGGGHHHHHH! LJ- yes! Another Jewel finished with rads. Congrats. I was moved by your post: \"I'm going to just believe that people like him are background noise in the great journey. That the people who count are the ones who give you hugs when you finish rads, who put little cards on your desk just to say they're thinking of you and pulling for you, who mow your lawn without you even asking .... They're the ones who matter.\" BEAUTIFUL! Jenn- oh my! Take care of yourself and those knees. Hope you heal well from your surgery. May the dark places be far from your world, my friend. Off to enjoy the weekend. Take care Gems, Paula",

Working with subs (different ones each day... sigh!), doing my own lesson plans and sub lesson plans, rotating the kids between classrooms to get their skills training in, keeping all the online gradebooks up-to-date. Looks like we might be getting a nurse on board by November 1. Ain't gonna be an easy month, but at least the end is in sight... Carol- Thank you for the pictures- they're wonderful! I got a bit teary as I browsed through this photo journal of our journey together. I feel so fortunate to be a part of the Jewels. I know you gals have saved me a ton of dough on therapy! How great that your fil has made a \"love connection.\" Hope things work out for him in that area. How's Steph doing? KathyL- enjoy your date- you and dh SO deserve some alone time. How cool that you'll meet Robin Roberts as well! Sherry- losing toenails now? I didn't end up losing any, but I know from past experience that they should grow back quickly. If I recall, D1 had all her nails when I saw her in DC. WTG, Ms. Hot 2 Trot, on making your own love connection. Good luck! D1- good news on the mammo! Good to see that the silicone pad is working some magic on that scar tissue. A $400 bra? Dang! It ought to play music or somethin' for that price... LOL at dd dropping out of college to pay for your boob holders. Your surgeon IS a dolt! (Cool word, btw). You know, we have entirely different issues going on with our dh's, but I hear you on thinking that some professional help might be in order. And I am right where you are, I think- I don't have the energy to pursue another medical appointment at the moment. Our homecoming week was the week we returned from DC. The kids had some wild costumes that week. On \"inside out\" day the kids had articles of underwear outside their clothes. Most of the girls wore their bathing suits, but the fellas had their boxers over their pants. I guess I wasn't paying much attention with ds, cuz I didn't notice till late in the day that his boxers had muffins with STUD across the top of each muffin.... Julie- Homecoming week is almost over for you- hope it's going well! Sounds like your Volley for a Cure was a great success. What was the final amount raised? What a great pic of you and Norma! Both of you have so much hair. You look like you have bangs even! I'm getting there, but my shortest hair is in front. So all you want for Christmas is your two front nips? Heh heh! OMG, Kimberly! Thinking of you and Kathleen and praying that Friday will bring good news and the two of you can go have a grand celebration. Hmmm, after reading your to-do list I'm thinking I shouldn't complain! Reading your comments and Carol's reminder was timely advice for me as well. Thanks! Good for you getting involved in registering voters! You're a true patriot. I had made my choice for President a while ago... reviewed the whole thing after the VPs were chosen and I'm sticking with my man. Gotta hope my track record is better this year... My choice has been the loser for the past 2 presidential elections. Joan- congrats on completing your walk. (A Pet walk? Too cute!) Your pic is great- look at those curls!   CathyCA- OK, I was practically drooling as I read about the eats for your bridge group. I'm with Carol- I don't know a thing about the game, but I'd be learning fast if I lived in your neighborhood! Whoa! You'll bring goodies to the Jewels gathering? I vote for the west coast! Maz! We've missed you! I'm glad to hear that your trip to FL went smoothly. ((HUGS)) GREAT news on your tumor markers!! Looks like you are taking care of yourself and moving forward. How is your ds doing? Hope all is well with him. Therese- happy belated birthday! I'll be turning 47 soon also. LOL at your birthday present. Mother Nature has a lousy sense of humor sometimes... LJ- funny, I had a case manager call me a couple of weeks ago. I knew what it was all about only because we had one assigned to us when dh was diagnosed with cancer in 2006. The case manager was a nurse who called right after his diagnosis and every few weeks thereafter to make sure our needs were met. I'd say it's a bit late for us to have a case manager at this point, wouldn't you?! WVGirl! So good to hear from you! Your interview was great--you did well! I'll be bringing ds to Mo-town soon for a tour of WVU. It was originally scheduled for Monday the 13th, but had to cancel as my port is coming out then. I'll PM you when I have the visit rescheduled. Perhaps we can meet!  All caught up. Hope you didn't get tired of reading b4 you got to the end! Take care all! Paula",

She was busting out of her jeans and her bras... got that all taken care of now. I got to shop for myself as well. I was selected by Coldwater Creek to participate in their customer experience program. They sent me two $50 gift cards and I had to make two separate visits to shop and complete their online survey rating the experience afterwards. Today was visit # 2. I got a lovely blouse the first time around. This time I caught the sales just right and came away with a jacket, a shell with lace trim, and some funky earrings. As much as I love my job, it is wearing me out. My heart is going out of rhythm a lot these days (atrial arrhythmia), and I believe a lot of my palpitations are stress-induced. I've had this before, but it is much worse now. I've cut out all caffeine- even chocolate (sob!)- as it sends my heart pitter-pattering away. I have no other symptoms besides the palpitations, but I do need to have a check-up and deal with this... another doctor's appt... sigh... So, D1 is off to the Bahamas already... Drat! I missed sending a bon voyage.. Kimberly- OMG You could have been writing about me when you expressed how you're feeling these days. ((Hugs)) I don't have a remedy, but I'm thankful to have a safe place to come and express what I'm feeling and have someone who will understand. Hang in there (and I will too!). Carol- quite the chef these days, eh? Your meals sound yummy! How like your wonderful self to reach out to Muriel and help ease her puppy loss. I love that about you! Glad Zach's sessions are going well. Cathy- looking forward to hearing about your weekend walking adventure. Hope the weather was beautiful and the feet were up to the challenge! Kathy- 2 jobs, birthday parties, budding artists, swim lessons, friends with cancer... I'm ready for bed just reading about all of it. I'm reminded of what a true SHERO you are, going through all of this with little ones. Glad you were able to get your beach house secured for the family vacation next year! Julie- sounds like a wise plan to get the house listed with a neutral party. It does sound like the delay might have been good- allowed you to re-think where you want to move. Congrats to ds on those wonderful grades AND on landing a part in the play, even if it isn't the lead role. His time in the spotlight will come! CHJ- great pictures! You were definitely in the PINK there. Glad you had fun. Sherry- more great pics! I'm sorry your family wasn't able to join you, but glad you went ahead and enjoyed yourself. Hope you have a good week at work! Carla- how are the fall colors up there? Our colors have peaked and the trees will probably start shedding their leaves this week. Haven't rescheduled our WVU visit yet, but will be getting that done this week- I'm looking at the week of November 10-15. Better get back to the laundry (last load). Wish you all a wonderful week.",

      "Content": "Jan 7, 2009 06:26AM - edited Jan 7, 2009 06:28AM by RN2teach My Mac arrived last night. This is my first venture into Apple land (except my iPod, but I'm talking computers). So far, I love it! There's obviously a learning curve, but I'm flexible. This computer is a late Christmas present to me. Last time I needed to give myself something it was the Blackberry just after I finished rads... I'll have to watch this trend-- looks like my tastes are getting more expensive!  So, I am awake and sipping coffee before 6am-- definitely NOT the norm for me. I usually rise at the last minute and am throwing myself together while the coffee perks. I fell asleep early last nite (11pm) and apparently 6 hours is my limit, 'cuz I've been awake since 5ish. I had the strangest dream... I was in a cabin in the middle of the woods with my family, getting ready for my Jewels reunion. Dh is chopping firewood ?, ds is showing off his GH skills to some of the Jewels teenagers, and dd is helping me decide what to wear. I'm torn between dd's size 4 prom dress (bwaaahahahaha) and my usual casual attire. Casual wins out and I leave sporting my fav. jeans, a sleeveless blouse, and the cutest sandals (which I've never seen in my life, but I'd like to find).  Segue to scene 2 (funny how that happens, isn't it?) We're coming out the door and they've cut these trees and they're all blocking the road. I calmly scoop them up like they were twigs and clear the way and we're off... in a taxi, which I'm driving. And we're now in the middle of a suburb and Carol, D1 and CHJ (who brought her cat, BTW) are there in another car to meet us at the end of the drive. Carol is driving, jumps out to come say hello and her car rolls away and crashes into a BMW that just happens to be driving by (nice neighborhood, huh?). So, then there's some kind of bumper cars scene... with mud and a little bit of 4-wheelin' and next thing I know you all are driving away, leaving me alone in the taxi to find my way to the Jewels reunion, which is an hour away and I don't know the way. I stop to put gas in my taxi and I'm trying to get D1 on my cell to give me directions. Can't get the number entered correctly, so I hand it off to one of students, who just happens to be riding shotgun... and then, I wake up. Kimberly- I'll be waiting on your dream interpretation. Spare me if it's bad--I prefer to just enjoy the craziness of it.   Patty- the sexiest part of Vetteguy's dance was the laundry that preceded it! Tina- happy tattoo-ing!   Julie- a snow day, eh? I always enjoy those, until June when they're all tacked on to extend our school year! I'm surprised we aren't on a delay this morning. It has rained heavily through the night. Living in the hills, flooding is a problem. Okay time to get ready for work. Dh and I have appts with the onco this afternoon. I have to locate my mammo films and the U/S CD to take with me (now where did I put those?) I'll be back tonite to report in. Should be interesting to get his take on dh. He's deteriorated tremendously since he last saw him in Sept. Can't even carry on a conversation now... I was talking with one of my co-workers yesterday and she mentioned bringing in hospice. I've always been a strong advocate of hospice... funny that I want to resist bringing them in,but I do... I have a friend who works hospice and I'm going to call her and pick her brain today.   Be back soon... Paula ",

Approx 50-65% of brain tumor patients achieve a good response to this treatment, so we're optimistic. We'll be on our way home within an hour or so. It is plenty cold here (teens), but I hear we're headed home to some really cold weather in the single digits. BRRR! BTW, talked to my onc. in Charleston this morning about Ed and he also reported in on my recent tests.

I had the DVR recording here at home, and have just finished watching some of it.  Ed did well today on his own (with the neighbor checking in and me being here at lunchtime).

I'll have to check it out.  LJ- congrats on being finished with your treatments! It has been a looong haul for you, hasn't it.  Thanks for the comments on security and the insights on fiber and GI problems. I posted some info on excursions to our group on Facebook. The rates are reasonable, IMO. The Grand Canyon tour takes in Hoover Dam as well and will take up a whole day (7am - 9pm). Cost is $179, but there's an internet special thru Feb 5 of $85 or $169 for 2 people. The Hoover Dam tour is 4 hours, with about 2 hours at the Dam. The cost of this one is $35 ($29 internet). Red Rock Canyon and Lake Mead are also nearby (much closer than Grand Canyon).  Several sites have tours, but these were the best I found. There are group rates available if we have enough for that... just need to know who is interested in what.   Thanks to all of you for the good vibes. It is still crazy around here. Thanks to all of the decadron, dh was awake in the middle of the night and decided at 3am that he was not only going to quit chemo, but would also stop taking all of his regular meds (incl. BP and seizure meds). I explained that these meds are not optional unless he wants to spend the rest of his life in a hospital. His seizures alone would preclude me being able to care for him at home. Thankfully, he got up this morning and took his meds, except the cholesterol pills, which aren't really an issue at this point... Also got a call from the counselor at hospice which set him off on a mini tantrum. He was forcefully shaking his head during the whole conversation as I was learning what they have to offer. They can offer free grief counseling to the whole family and have offices near here that will be convenient for us to visit. I mentioned to dh that the kids and I could go in to their office and he indicated (with that angry head shaking again) that he didn't approve... WTF? Guess we'll have to sneak off for counseling... Can I just say WTF again? I look a lorazepam last night and didn't even hear the phone ring this morning when they called a 2 hour delay! Scared me a little. Guess I'd better quit playing around with dh's drugs! Catch you later, Paula ",

D1- what a roller-coaster week you have had. I'm sorry to hear about your chemo reaction and the new lump (waiting to hear B9). I have to say you look lovely in your baldness. I admire your courage and spirit! DianeB- I can't fathom how you must feel after two drug reactions. Let's hope that CMF is the right chemotini for you. Hope you get home from the hospital on schedule! CarolC- I'm so sorry about your financial fix. My heart goes out to you as well for the even more frustrating delay in treatment. You do NOT need this stress and I hope you don't mind that I am praying for a solution to both of your problems. LJ13- AAARRRRGGGGGHHHHH SIS Kimberly- beautiful poem. My fav line: gems of your journey I believe ALL OF YOU will be the gems in my journey thru bc! Jenn51 and KathyL- hope you are feeling better Sherry and WVGirl- congrats (?) on joining the Baldness Bunch. I'm just a couple of weeks behind you! I had my first chemotini yesterday- AC. The infusion center has little cubicles with lounge chairs and little tvs. I took some papers to grade and a book to read. My port access went smoothly and hardly felt anything thanks to EMLA cream. I got a dose of Decadron, another of Aloxi, and then Ativan (which they only give to the \"young women\" who might have anticipatory se--so I sez- young women? count me in). Didn't feel much but a little lightheadedness and my nose and sinuses felt a little stuffy, but not bad. Next time I think I'll skip the Ativan as I think it might have added to my symptoms--and I can drive myself if I don't take the Ativan. My best friend drove my hubby and me to the infusion center (dh is a 19 month survivor of glioblastoma, has seizures and can't work or drive). We had a light lunch afterwards and spent a little time in books-a-million (my fav. place to shop) So other than a little fuzzy-headedness, I felt fine until around 8pm last night (about 30 minutes after I ate). I was actually in the middle of writing this note last night when that wave of nausea hit and I wasn't able to finish writing. I took my Phenergan and it subsided some, but I still felt pretty crummy when I went to bed. I slept good even though I was awake several times through the night. Today I went back over for my Neulasta injection. I took my second dose of Emend this morning and haven't had any more of the nausea. Took a nice long nap this afternoon, though, which explains what I'm doing on here this late! Sorry for such a long post. I hope all of my gems have a great Sunday.",

But this morning at 4am when he woke me up to tell me the power was off I was def. thinking that was a DH moment! So, I've been awake since then and have been thinking about life and DHs in general. I thought maybe my introspective moments might be useful to WVgirl in particular, so I decided to share... I have a confession to make... I am usually the DH in my marriage. My dh is a sweetheart, they don't make 'em any better. I rarely have anything to argue about with this man (but that didn't stop me at PMS time). When he was dx with brain cancer in 2006 I was devastated. He has done fairly well, but because his tumor was in the frontal lobe, he has some psychological and emotional deficits along with the seizures. And sometimes I find myself wanting to lash out at him for things he has no capacity to understand anymore. While I can usually control myself, our teenagers can be really cruel to him at times. Neuro is one of my specialty areas in nursing, so I am well equipped to help him, but I have my moments when I am not a nurse... I am a wife who is feeling the loss of my dh as he was b4 cancer robbed him. I'm wondering, WVgirl, if some of this is what is making your dh be such a DH right now. (After all, some men are just overgrown teenagers...) My thoughts are with you! Diane63- honey, are you a night owl or an early bird? By my clock your post was around 2-3am!  CHJ- stay in and rest well today! Vettegal- I'm with CHJ... hope you're doing well! My thoughts are with our chemo warriors today. Paula",

I am not the only teacher going, but it would be a big disappointment to me and the kids if I can't go. If I miss one week, that would put me having chemo on March 6...

Gee, was it just this morning that I was complaining about my stubble? I was massaging chemo shampoo into my scalp this morning and got handfuls of hair for my trouble. I am well on my way to a smooth pate. Odd that I'm happy 'bout that, huh?  My dad came by today and brought me a quilt that the ladies group at his church made for me. I grew up going to that church, so I know most of the women who worked on it. I was so touched! Well, time to take my cold drugs and fire up the vaporizer! I have always been such a night owl, but those days seem to be a thing of the past! Good night, Gems Paula",

I told my chemo nurse that I was actually looking forward to my chemo fatigue 'cause surely it would knock me out in spite of this lingering cough.

We're always ready for new additions. hope your friend stops in soon! LJ- I had a few bladder symptoms b4 last treatment. They went away w/o progressing to a UTI. Hope you can deflect that particular bug, too!  Time to kick back for a little while.

Gotta love those tried-and-true old home remedies   I agree with what you've all been saying about our group. I am soooo grateful that I found the Jewels. I get so much joy, laughter, and support from all of you. It is always a treat to check in and see how everyone is doing. We share our joys and our sorrows. We worry about each other when we go MIA from the boards for a few days. And the advice and info we get to deal with this journey...what would I do without all of you! Carol- sorry about that ticket! Glad you got a bit of a break on the fine. I have a bad track record on speeding tickets--most from my youth. Now if I get caught speeding it is from lack of concentration, not the desire to ride like the wind! D1- I second Carol's thanks to you for creating the Jewels. We now have over 50 pages of Jewels posts...1515 posts... WOW! Julie- hope that headache is gone today. Hope your ds got that report completed and turned in. My ds tends to be a procrastinator. Drives me crazy, but honestly he prob. inherited that trait from me. I love to work under pressure... put out some of my best work during crunch time. CathyCa- I'm glad that you're blessed with a good situation all the way around. Fighting BC is a full-time job by itself! You are a great source of info and support for our group--remembering esp. your advice on financial issues. Thanks for being a Jewel! CHJ- sorry to hear about the death in your community. I know his family will need your support later on. Hope you and dh recover from that cold soon! Kimberly- glad you enjoyed the concert! WVGirl- (((Hugs))). You keep venting here and keep the lines open with the people who are giving you the support you need. Hoping and praying for your strength!  I'm heading out soon for kids' dermatologist appt. Then shopping for new clothes (gotta love those growth spurts) and dinner in town.

I'm glad I was able to spend most of yesterday outside in the sunshine-it was in the 60s and so pretty here. The willows and dogwoods are blooming, crocuses and daffodils are gorgeous, and the frogs are chirping (or whatever frogs do...). Spring is here! Diana63, Julie and LJ- best wishes for an uneventful round of chemo with few se's in the days to come. Looks like I've got lots of company tomorrow at the lounge: WVGirl, Vettegal, Peg, and Dana-here we go! Last round for vettegal and peg-YES! Dana- another beautiful baldie! You look so glamorous!    Carol- loving all the pics you are sharing. Don't you dare feel guilty about not doing shout-outs on vacation. It is great to hear from you and know that you're having a wonderful time, so go out there and have a ball! Diana63- you've got an adorable nephew. You can tell Derrick is proud of those 2 teeth! Sista- hope you can get something to help you sleep-you need your rest! I live in a small community where everyone knows everyone, so I don't get many stranger encounters. Most folks want to know how I'm doing and then they'll share the experiences of some other BC survivor they know (and many times I'll know them, too). Whoever observed that there is an element of one-upmanship in some of these encounters was so right. I usually just sing the praises of the new drugs that we have to help us cope with the se's and go on. I had that same experience when I was pregnant, with everyone wanting to tell me about their morning sickness or their horrid labor experiences... Kathy- glad you were feeling well enough to be outside yesterday. Hope your voice is back and you're over your cold. Therese- your Easter excursion sounds like so much fun. I'm glad you had such a good time. I used to work those weekends, too. I'm encouraged to hear that you're starting to feel like yourself again. You sound so much more upbeat than just a few weeks ago. I'm happy for you! Peg- it takes 2 filtration systems to make our well water usable. It is still hard on the pipes-we've replaced the faucets in our kitchen and all 3 baths, lost a hot water heater w/ a lifetime warranty, etc. And we just built our house 12 years ago... Looking forward to having drinkable water and we'll have the bonus of getting to use our well water to water the lawn/flowers and wash cars! D1- honey, chemo is to blame for everything, isn't it?! Wrinkles, gray hair, cellulite... I'm sorry babydoc couldn't get you in with one of his surgeon pals, but glad to hear you're getting the partner to drain your cyst quickly. CathyCA- a middle schooler w/ cancer would be sooo hard. I lost one of my former students to cancer in December. He was diagnosed at 17 and died at the tender age of 19. His girlfriend is in my class of seniors this year. We've had some emotional times... Kimberly- glad the mound is better (somehow that just doesn't sound right...LOL). So, when are you going to Tahoe? Lucky you! Julie- I am so sorry that you've got the dreaded cough. I'm praying that it won't linger as long as mine did. Remember my good old remedy-whiskey, baby! Wendy- AH! You're our NE girl-I knew we had a jewel from Maine. I was thinking about you when we were whining about our weather a couple of weeks ago... D326- you've come to the right place for info-welcome! I'm doing the AC x 4, T x 4 plan-I'm down to 3 more \"Ts\" and I'm finished. This chemo regimen has been very doable. AC was big on fatigue and stomach discomfort (although the nausea meds kept that in check). T is heavy on bone and muscle pain (again controlled by meds). I know the TAC gals will jump in with their experiences. Good luck in making your treatment decision. So many factors weigh in on the final choice-type of cancer, stage, grade, whether you plan to work or can stay at home, etc, etc. Have a good day, Gems! Paula",

((HUGS)) Therese- good to hear from you. I can't believe you're already a month out from chemo! I appreciate the heads-up on the residual se's.

Taxol #2 is bringing me a lot more pain. I am so sore and achy. Tylenol isn't helping a bit, so I'll prob. take a Lortab so I can rest tonight (gotta go back to work tomorrow). I'm thankful my onco insisted that I have a narcotic pain reliever on hand. Sorry to whine... pain makes a gal crabby! Glad the Jewels have tomorrow off. Hope everyone has a good Monday! Paula",

I am NOT looking forward to being bald, but as you all have said it is a small price to pay and the hair will come back. I have bought/ borrowed several wigs.  They are okay, but I wanted to look like me and I just look WEIRD! May go with more hats after all. My mom and my hairdresser both said they could see me \"topless\"  but I'm thinking NOT in January!! Anyway, you gals are paving the way for me to loose my hair with a smile... thanks for the great stories. Vettegal-- gotta love a man who will wear red toes for his girl! WTG Vetteguy!",

Good day at work, after school I had a checkup with my surgeon, then shopping and dinner with Mom. God willing, I'll have more of the same for the next few days and get lots of things accomplished before Friday and chemo round 2. Kathy- Welcome Home!! Glad your dh took such good care of the kids. What a blessing! CHJ- I'll echo what the others have said-- watch your temp. Hope you're feeling better tomorrow! Deb1023- I was hoping I'd have a partner in the chemo saloon Friday. Hope those counts stay up! CathyCa and KathyL- Thanks for the stellar advice you posted for interpreting research data. I had a couple of research classes while working on my master's. While it was never one of my favorite things to do, I am grateful for that background now. Especially since my oncologist loves to share research info when formulating a treatment plan. (I have the same oncologist as dh, so we have a nearly 2-year history together). D1- LOVED your DH story--thanks 4 the laugh!! I'll be careful not to turn my dh into a DH again! (At least unless he deserves it...) BTW, how are the back spasms? I couldn't remember who had them, which is why I mentioned them. Mine are better and I still think they are a se of Neulasta. I'll be talking to onco about that Thursday. Vettegal- stay on top of that constipation, girlfriend, and pamper yourself for the next few days. Sunshine- sending warm ((((HUGS))) your way. That first treatment is a toughy as you don't know how it is going to go. You will be in my thoughts and prayers this week. Hey Therese- glad you're still with us. Hope the days until your next tx are se-free!  Kimberly- You're next up to the plate. Bat those bc cells outta the park SIS! Be thinking of you tomorrow. Good night Gems, Paula",

It is the only thing we have in common as we're on different chemo.... Dana- your spirits seem much better. Glad things are moving forward for you. Your schedule will be tricky for chemo.

Have been really tired in the evenings and just wanted to sleep. I have a stupid respiratory bug that is annoying as @#$%. Thankfully, no fever and it seems to be better today than yesterday. Hopefully, the Neulasta has given me the WBCs to fend off a major illness. Monday I joined the Bald Babes Club. My students were a little timid and some of them actually cried, but we finally got it all off. One of my fellow teachers is bald and he made sure I got a good close shave! The picture that I'm posting (I hope) is the one of Craig and me after my new do--don't you think we look like brother and sister?! And I'm thinking we kinda look like Mr. and Mrs. Clean (do you all remember the Mr. Clean man?)  So, after the shave I tried out one of my wigs. I don't think I'm going to wear them very often-- or for very long at a time. They just aren't as comfortable. Yesterday I wore a hat to work. Today I tried another wig. I ended up pulling it off by lunchtime and replacing it with a hat!  Funny, I thought my head would be cold, but I prefer having nothing on at all. D1, Carol/Golfer, and Kathy: Hope your treatments went well today! Looks like we have a whole jewel chest full of sisters stepping up for chemo tomorrow: LJ, DianeB, Maz, CHJ, CarolC, Tina, AZDonna, and Sista. I'll be thinking of you all tomorrow! CHJ- you are a lovely baldy! And Murphy is soo adorable--whatta big kitty!! CarolC- glad things are working out on the financial end. Sorry about your vicious round of food poisoning. Hope you're fully recovered. Kris- hope you're feeling normal again! Sharont- you're in the home stretch--last treatment is just around the corner. Yeah! Peg1212 and Tina- welcome to the Jewels! Julie- I am sooo sorry that you're having such a bad time with the N/V. I would encourage your onco to make some aggressive changes to your nausea meds for your next round. Vettegal- you sound so upbeat. Good for you! Tell Vetteguy to quick waxing the bathroom floor Joan- sending big (((HUGS))) your way. I too hope that you have a good support network to help with visits to your mother. You're in my prayers. WVGirl- you are always in my thoughts and prayers. Hang in there!

Sorry you've been having the other extreme of pooper problems. Hope you can get that under control.

I won't be looking as snazzy in my layers, but maybe I can shed them for a photo! D1- I hate that you are still having such problems with your back. Your description of the spasms is identical to my experience after round 1. Mine first occurred 7 days after first Neulasta injection. Worse with movement--esp. when I first sat down, starting around my tailbone, rippling out and around to my hipbones and take-your-breath-away intensity. They would last about 10 minutes if I was settled, but recurred every time I changed position. I had them for 2 days and then they disappeared. I haven't had any with this round. Go in for shot #3 Saturday, so we'll see how it goes this time. I've never had any back problems before either. Sista- keep us posted on your back. Here's hoping you don't have any problems!  LJ- how's your partner? Wishing you both good health!  Vettegal- what a nice card! What time is your tx tomorrow? Mine is 12:30p. Carol- I hear you on the Cream of Wheat! I'm all about comfort foods. I love my coffee, but I don't even want it for the first week after chemo. I replace it with tea to get my caffeine fix. I've been living on hot tea and Hall's cough drops for the past week. Now there's an aphrodisiac for you! I hope everyone has had a nice VDay. I know there won't be as much \"activity\" around here as usual, but we'll make up for it later. I forgot to mention that my dh's first response to seeing my bald head was \"I've never 'done it' with a bald woman...\" Well, I was already sick with this cold when I got sheared so he STILL hasn't....   I'm working half-day tomorrow.

On the good side, I didn't cough last night... I just didn't sleep! Went to church this morning for the first time in 3 weeks. It was a great service, really energized me for the week ahead. CHJ- hope you made it to church yesterday. What a drag for both you and your dh to be sick--get well soon! The transfer to the woman onco that you were originally supposed to have sounds good. I'm glad you have a good plan in place to get the treatment you need.   KathyL- thanks for keeping up with the treatment schedules for us! PALady- I'm not happy to hear that I may have nail prob. with the T treatments. Hope the info that the others have given helps you protect those nails! Maz- glad you're feeling good. Enjoy those taste buds while they last! Jenny- YIKES! Your reaction to the T sounds horrific. I hope the nurses at your center are hovering around you through your treatments. Therese- I'm having the same problem with reading. I normally have 3-4 books in progress at all times (at least my Bible, a book of fiction and one of nonfiction). Typically read a couple of books a week, but haven't been able to get my brain to cooperate lately. Congrats on reaching your last treatment this Friday! I'll be going in Friday for my last AC. Still have Tx4 to go, but I'll be at the 1/2 way point on my chemo so that's something to celebrate. WVGirl- glad you're taking care of yourself. Sounds like you have a great new wig--you'll have to share a pic! Joan- WVgirl reminded me about your Reiki query. We had a Reiki presentation at a nursing conference a couple of years ago. It involves using human energy fields for healing. Very holistic and the demo was fascinating. Deb1023 and Kris- more Neu- victims... hope the remedies help you thru the pain. I seem to have been spared this time and I'm grateful LJ- well, glad for some good news on the T part of treatment. Worse on reactions but easier on se's. Hope you're still feeling good this eve. D1- LOL on your fantasy dream. Having sex w/ a hottie is overrated anyway! One more to go, sister. Your arm snap sounds worrisome. Get that checked out ASAP and take it easy in the meantime. Vettegal- hang in there, honey. You are over halfway thru w/ your treatment. Wish I had a magic cork that would solve your problem... We're all pulling for you. And I am sooo looking forward to spring and sunny days, too!  My ds is skiing with a bunch of friends this weekend. This was a well timed trip for him--I know he needs the release after last week. Thanks for all of your comments on the way he supported his friend. I was so proud of his group of friends and the way they handled the death last week. I worry about both our kids with both me and dh having cancer. It is so hard to read teenagers. We live in the same small town where my dh was raised and we know practically everyone. I'm happy that I have lots of eyes and ears to help me keep an eye on them. So far they seem to be doing okay, but I def. do a lot of praying and watching! Glad none of the Jewels has a Monday chemo date. Catch you all tomorrow! Paula",

I have enough sick days to pull it off with pay, but I love my work and my coworkers and students are such a wonderful source of support and encouragement for me. D1- hope you're feeling okay today. On the neuropathy... I won't be able to pick my nose?? These SEs are just too much! LOL I love your sense of humor, girl! You had me laughing out loud reading your discussion of gas odors. Give college girl a clothespin! Kathy- Another rx to Taxotere... YIKES! Hope you've awakened from the Benedryl fog today. I am sorry for the loss of your friend to BC. I understand a little of what you're going thru... When ds's friend lost his mother to BC recently it brought it too close to home for me, imagining not being a part of my kid's futures. It must be particularly scary since your children are so young, not nearly grown like mine. I'm glad we're able to come here and share these feelings. Sending warm thoughts your way! Vettegal- What a much-needed boost for you to get a great gift from your client! CathyCa- your schedule sounds so wonderful and I'm glad it has the added bonus of bringing you in contact w/ BC survivors. Very therapeutic! I found a website that describes the t-shirt and other head wraps. http://www.lookgoodfeelbetter.org/women/hair_help/alt_cov.htm WVgirl- give me details about the BC conference you were invited to speak at... maybe I can come!

I didn't notice that you're on the 3-drug chemo cocktail b4. You deserve a medal... maybe the BOOBY PRIZE? Carol- LOL at the image of you flashing your gal at the cop. You are quite the writer yourself. Your posts are always full of energy and good humor. I love reading them! Kalen and CarolC- hope you're all finished up with your chemo for the day. Congrats Kalen on no longer being a chemo virgin! Hope the se's are mild. Deb1023- thinking of you and dp this week. We had a very nice family day yesterday after the derm. appt.--a rare thing with teenagers.  I go in to see onco and get bloodwork this afternoon. Hopefully counts will be good for round 4 tomorrow. Looks like I'm in good company--my Triple Neg sisters Therese and Deb1023 are scheduled for round 4, too, right? Catch u later, Gems! Paula",

I had been taking supplemental iron until my last dose of AC-went off of it b/c my stomach was too fragile from the chemo. I agree with you on preferring the natural sources, esp. organics, for my nutrients. I'm hoping that my stomach will tolerate more iron rich foods now that I'm off of AC. Therese- LOL at circling thru the pick up line and forgetting your dd-I can SO see myself doing that very thing! I sure hope you are staying healthy and dd is recovering from her strep infection. I'm praying that you'll dodge the bullet on that one! You have my best wishes as you get ready to return to work. Hope that swelling subsides quickly and doesn't return once you're back on the job. That's great that you're taking classes again-very proactive both in terms of your career and not obsessing on the BC. WVGirl- OMG, what a beautiful poem! I am so happy that you are getting lots of TLC from your co-workers and friends. The flowers sounded beautiful! Julie- I'm soooo thankful that you don't need a barf bag this time around. But, what a bummer that the migraines are still dogging you. Be careful w/ those blackouts-you don't need any more problems! Carol- Glad your insurance saw the light w/o a fight and you're getting your le sleeve. I'm glad the big D kicked in while you were near a clean BR. Bummer that you couldn't take advantage of  the extra time off yesterday. Ummm, hope that cabbage doesn't send you flying to the potty! I've scanned back over some of the early pages. Kinda nostalgic experience, isn't it? I'd like to keep the pages of our journey-I couldn't have made it this far w/o the Jewels! Thanks for the update on Kalen. Hope to see you on the board soon! Tina- thanks for the heads-up on the rash. I'll be alert for that. My ds is a huge Packers fan. He has an autographed pic of Favre-one of his prized possessions. I know he's going to miss watching him play... meant to take him to a game b4 Favre retired... ah well... Kathy- hope you get all your Easter ducks in a row b4 treatment day. And isn't Aunt Flo rude to disturb your good days! The nerve!! Have a good evening w/ your family. Dana- hope you have a nice relaxing evening in your jimmies-in spite of Aunt Flo! I am feeling pretty good this evening. Took a nice long nap this afternoon-made up for the steroid-induced insomnia last night! The cough seems to be lightening up, hopefully for good this time.

I'm on Taxol and every bone/ muscle in my body seems to hurt today... Julie- I forgot to comment on CTE in my last post. I love being a CTE teacher-I have the best of both worlds as I get to teach my students about health care and train them for entry-level positions and college. Most of my students (90%) go on to college to be doctors, nurses, rad techs, dental hygienists, etc. Our state is very supportive of CTE-in fact, every student in WV schools must have at least 2 career credits to graduate. This is def. not your mother's CTE, is it? I kinda fell into this job 7 years ago. Was working PT for the school system doing health screenings and got the call that they needed a substitute to teach this position. I laughed and told them \"I'm not a teacher, I'm a nurse.\" Anyway, they HAD to have a nurse to teach this position so they begged and I agreed to take it on until they could hire someone... I was soooo impressed w/ what these kids were learning in high school (2 years of med terminology, CPR/first aid, infection control, A & P, pathophys, nutrition, G & D, law and ethics, HIPPA, etc, etc, plus 100 hours of clinical training at the end of the program). I wish I'd gone into nursing with the background these kids have! So, here I am 7 years later, now w/ a MS in education, and  loving every minute of my job. It's a great place to be!

I wouldn't make a habit of that- have you heard the old saying, \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" ?

I am also a triple negative and I know what you mean about the uncertainty that comes w/ this diagnosis. I like to stay up on the latest info about TN, but I have to temper my research with some positive info-like survivor stories right here on this site (have you looked at the triple neg. threads here?). Remember that one of the \"positives\" about TN is that chemo is very effective in killing it-so we may feel like S#$T, but our bodies are evicting those cancer cells! I think you're being very proactive in seeking out a therapist to help you deal with everything. Keep the faith, Carol. We are in this together and we are SURVIVORS! CathyCA- hey to you, too!

Deb1023- I've been thinking of you since we both started the \"T\" part of our chemo last week. Glad you're okay. Sending best wishes to your dp as she adjusts to life w/o her mom.

They've done really well-now I hope all their hard work pays off with some $$ for college! Diana63- thanks for the tip on the tea tree oil-I recall reading about that before, but wasn't on Taxol at the time... As for your T being weekly instead of every 2-3 weeks, I believe it is preferred for some types of BC. There are several Jewels on the \"weekly plan.\" Vettegal- good to see your post. I'm glad Denise is visiting the website-there's a lot of good info here. Keep us posted on your journey toward rads and Denise's treatment plan. Wendy- wow! Glad you made it safely through your treatment yesterday! I'm glad you called your onco and talked to the NP about it. Hopefully, your blood levels will recover w/o a transfusion... A few weeks ago I had fever and chills and had to go in for bloodwork. WBC was low 3.8 (norm 4.8-10.8, but 3.8 is good for chemo patients). RBC was 2.8 (should be 4.2 - 5.4) and my Hgb was 8.1 (norm 12 - 15). My onco suggested a transfusion if I dropped any lower. Fortunately, I had blood drawn again just 3 days later to evaluate and my levels were much better (WBC was 8.9, RBC was up to 3.15 and Hgb was 9.3). Hoping you have a similar recovery and can forego the transfusion. I've never had one, but have given many pints of blood through the years. If you have to get blood, rest assured that it should be a piece of cake compared to chemo! KathyL- tonic water... well, I'd be game (how bad can it taste?) if it stopped the eye twitching. I don't remember you mentioning that (can I blame that on chemo brain?). That would be tres annoying! Kimberly- I'm keeping good batteries in my flashlight! Rest well.... Carol- just checked out Ginny's website. Very nice! The donations ticker was cool- she's almost met her goal for this year! D1- yippee on the good dental check-up. \u2018Bout time you get some good news, girlfriend! If the guidewire is worse than the dye injection, I'll just be very thankful that I was spared the agony... Tina- I've noticed swelling in my head (maybe my brain is growing? Hahaha)-I think I mentioned that everything I wear leaves marks on my scalp. Also, in my hands and ankles. I've quit wearing my rings for now and am trying to prop the legs up as much as possible. My nails are growing, too... Haven't lost any more hair since AC, but it isn't growing, either. Well, well, the dd is fighting with her dad. She does her own laundry, but for some reason dh will just randomly decide to wash her clothes from time to time and (of course) he doesn't do them to suit her. So, this is an ongoing issue that I can't seem to bring to a resolution... neither of them is going to give and I'm stuck right in the middle of this frigging argument every time. Time to go negotiate a peace treaty... or barring that, does anyone have a peace pipe? I could use a hit about now! Wishing LJ and Dana a \"good\" day in the lounge tomorrow. Nite all... Paula",

It was good for us both--esp. for her to be able to vent some of that teenaged angst! Judy- I am thinking of you as you begin Xeloda and praying that it will work for you. I'm sorry that you're having such a rough time. Please know that you are being remembered in prayers. (((HUGS))) Jenn- praying for you, dh, and fil during this difficult time. Quite a lot you have on your plate this week... Tina- sorry to hear that your friend's cancer is more involved than it first appeared. Better to treat it aggressively now, though, as Judy said in her post. D1- glad your bil is on the mend. WTG on calling the game. Never heard of a one-ref game b4... Dang! I know pink is the BC color, but having a pink boob is taking it a bit far, dontcha think? Hope it doesn't get worse... Julie- welcome back from the dark side! Glad you're feeling better. (okay, missed your last post... sorry the H/A is back--hope the meds work and you are able to rest well tonight.) Maz- Dove dark choc. is my fav. I had my first piece in ages just yesterday (taste buds are back!) Vettegal- you and Vetteguy look tooo cool in front of your vette. Nice ride! Kris- Yeah! Glad you're done w/ AC. I agree w/ LJ--Taxol isn't so bad. My taste buds are okay. Carol- thanks for the update on Kimberly. And I was touched that you were thinking about me and my family yesterday. You're truly a Jewel! I agree w/ you--it isn't easy for them to have two parents with cancer within 18 months. dh's illness brought such a big lifestyle change for us and we barely had time to adjust before the old BC hit me. I've resisted putting them in counseling only because they are both very against the idea. They have friends that they can vent to, seem happy most of the time, make good grades, and are involved in a lot of activities. I just hope (and pray... A LOT!) that I'm making the right decision for them...   KathyL, Carol, and Kris- oops! A little late w/ your shout out for chemo today! Hope you all had a good round. Wendy and Max: good luck tomorrow. Wish you all a good, sunny day tomorrow... hoping our fair weather continues so I can spend lunch outside again. Take care all, Paula",

Therese- I'm so glad your first weekend back to work went well. Dana- good to hear from you, LW. Sorry you're having some difficulties with a classmate. Just remember that her problems are HERS, not yours, and you do not have to allow her rudeness to affect you. Keep those positive energies up! I'll be praying for good news w/ your CT Scan. Carol- I know adversity strengthens us, but it is tough to take when it's happening to our babies, isn't it? Sorry ds had such a rough day at the rink yesterday. Glad he was able to get himself back out there and skate today. Have a safe trip home. D1- hope you're enjoying your family weekend. Glad you don't have to cook tonite-think you deserve it after the labor intensive dinner you put together yesterday! I'm hoping the weekends will allow the PB (pink boob, or should that be poor boob?) to recover from the rads trauma. Julie- I'm glad you and ds enjoyed the TKD exhibition. Gotta love those proud parent moments! Patty- Wow, your dinner tonight has all the makings of a MAJOR celebration! Enjoy! I'm really sorry that Denise is still getting blindsided by bad news from her docs. I'm hoping that the latest findings turn out to be nothing to worry about. FUBC! Kris- glad you checked in. Veg away and allow your body to heal from AC. Sending you a big ole' Kimberly WOOHOO for being done with that particular rat poison! CathyCA- sounds like you've had an enjoyable time with your friends. Good for you! You have 2 more TC/H treatments to do before you can start rads, right? I, too, am trying to manipulate my rads schedule to fit my summer plans. Maz- I'm glad that you and Val were able to have a good talk. I know it was good for both of you. WTG on getting those taxes filed before the fog rolls in. Hope you are able to sleep away the worst of your se's from this round. Kimberly- it is so good to see your post. We have missed you so much! I'm glad you're feeling better, but don't overdo it-we don't expect shout outs. We just want you HEALTHY! I'm getting my cards/ envelopes ready this weekend and will mail on Monday. Your dh is very sweet to help the Jewels get our Secret Pal project going. SheShe- Carol and Kimberly came up with the Secret Pal project and Kimberly has volunteered to get it going for us. Last I heard we had an odd number of Jewels-don't know it that is still true or not. Anyway, see Kimberly's posts for more info. She posted about it on April 1st and today also. The muscles are starting to announce their displeasure. Time to veg out for a while. Catch you later, Gems Paula",

Had a meeting this evening and then caught the end of ds' ballgame. It felt sooo good to get home and put my pjs on! My meeting was with our board of education to ask for $$ for my students' trip to Dallas. The estimated cost for all 36 of us to go to the conference is over $30,000. We have almost $20,000 raised so far... long way to go, but we're working hard! KathyL- life IS too short to waste any time on a job that makes you miserable. Good luck in finding a position that brings fulfillment without frustration! Wishing CHJ and Wendi an easy chemo day tomorrow. take care, Jewels! Paula",

I can't see the picture you posted, tho... I can well understand why you're being honored by so many--you're a special gal! Kimberly- you're finished with chemo--yahooooo! Now, if your girls will just calm down and get with the program... Good for your nurse on getting those blood cultures ordered. I use the Emla on my port, but I've never done the saran wrap thing-- had never heard of that until it was mentioned to you. Naturally I'm curious and you can bet I'm going to try it out for the last infusion on Friday. LJ- I think you mentioned the leg weakness from Taxol? I have noticed that as well. And it just seems to be the legs... I've had some nights where my legs just throb with pain as well. WVGirl- your DH's thoughtlessness \"takes the cake\" as my granny would say. You definitely don't need those negative vibes around you, so ENJOY the DH's (that would be DICKHEAD'S) absence for a few days! I'm glad your speech at the BC conference went well. KathyL and Carol- watched DWTS (thank God for DVRs). I'd say Kristi and Jason are my favorites, but I really enjoy watching the others. Marlee might go this time, too, although she IS amazing to watch. Shannon is getting some rough critiques from the judges, too.  Wendi: kick some cancer bootie tomorrow! Sheebas: Judy, hope you have time to check in and let us know how Xeloda is working for you. Been thinking of you! My kids honor banquet is tonight, so we are headed out for the evening. Hope everyone has a good one. Paula",

I sweet-talked our chef at school into making truffles to take to my chemo nurses. They were a big hit! Got a couple of pictures to share: This one is of me with my dh, Ed, and bff, Grace. They've been with me for all my trips to the chemo lounge.     Here is a group shot with the chemo nurses.  The blonde on my right and the brunette covering the boobies on my cap were my nurses. Everyone loved my cap (thanks, Carol!). I was awake during the night (steroids), then dozed off and woke up late for my neulasta appointment. So, speeding along to Charleston and... yep, Mr. State Trooper bags me doing 78 in a 65. I guess the bald head struck a sympathy cord-I only got a warning. My dd went with me today and the two of us hit the mall for a couple of hours. First stop was Victoria's Secret. My baby girl, who is not quite 15, is wearing the same size bra as her mama.   We spent the afternoon at the ballfield (ds had a wonderful day: 4/4 and 3 RBIs), then dropped by Mom's for dinner. Feeling pretty tired and the muscle soreness has already started, so I'm reclining in my PJs with the laptop. I need to read through the posts from Thursday evening onward and I'll be back to send a few shout-outs. Hope everyone is doing well. If I fade out before I get caught up with the latest, please know that my gem sisters are always foremost in my thoughts and prayers. I love you gals! Paula",

I woke up in the middle of the night and couldn't get back to sleep d/t pain. I've been up since 4am... Had a full day of aches and pains and still going strong tonite--I'm just waiting on the med to take effect so I can sleep. ds had a ballgame this evening and dd is on the campaign trail--she's running for president of her class. Between the two of them, they kept me going all evening. Tinalee- glad the sun was shining on your world today. Therese- loved hearing about your walk. Mine is coming up Saturday--hope I do as well as you! Julie- I'm trying to come to terms with the follow-up protocol (or lack thereof). I will see my rads onco tomorrow, my surgeon next Tuesday and oncologist next Wednesday. I don't want to obsess about follow-ups, but I plan to ask for an MRI annually in addition to my mammograms. I'd like to have the MRI in the near future and alternate this test with my annual mammogram in late November. Given how rapidly triple negatives can pop up and spread AND the fact that we have no targeted therapies to inhibit their growth, I believe that follow-up testing should be performed more often than once a year. Therese- thanks for your input on follow-up. I have decided that blood tumor marker tests and others that have a high rate of false positives are not worth it. Dana- Hope your pup is doing well after surgery. How ironic that it was a lumpectomy, huh?! Carol, Maz and Wendy: good luck in the chemo lounge tomorrow. Carol: tell Steph we're thinking of him--love the picture! Thanks for the congrats on the nurse award. I'll post a link to the article if it shows up online. I was really touched that my students got involved in this promotion. I'm flattered, humbled, and even a little embarrassed at the attention. Ah, I'm feeling sleepy! Night, ladies! Paula",

YOU, on the other hand, maintain such a positive attitude and high energy in spite of getting the \"QB sack\" over and over again. WTG, SIS Kimberly! As for the six marked areas, some of them are just to get me lined up for the rads beams. I have one on each side of my ribcage, one on the left boob, one mid-sternum, two on the right boob--one on the nipple, and one on my right axilla for the lymph nodes. Can't wait to get my secret pal. Thanks for coordinating that for us. D1- hope the tanning session went well yesterday. I'm so happy that they got you back on track to finish rads this week! KathyL- thanks for keeping up with our schedules. I'm praying that you'll have a smooth transition as your return to work. Tina- glad the port removal went well. I have that to look forward to.

Carol- LOL, I was online reading last night and waiting for ds. He got home safely and had a good time. I haven't found a link to the article. It was nicely done--picture isn't bad either! I'll check the website later. I did find a link to the Komen race that was on last night's news. My mom and I were both interviewed. I'm the first one who speaks (can't miss me in my black doorag and Boobie hat). My mom is the redhead with the pink lei who talks about walking for her daughter and her mother.

So, I'm looking at the envelope, waiting on my java to brew (had to create just the right ambiance for the \"unveiling\" of my SP)... that envelope... something is troubling me about my envelope... Then it hits me--I've stuck dear Kimberly with my postage, haven't I? I've got a whole roll of flag stamps, so my envelopes should be bearing the American flag not a lovely flower... I am so sorry, Kimberly! I saw my surgeon early this morning for a routine visit. I brought up follow-up and was pleased that he takes a much more aggressive approach than my medical oncologist (he's a surgical oncologist). He wants a PET Scan and a brain MRI after I'm about 6-8 weeks out from radiation. He feels both tests are warranted for my tumor profile. He surprised me by suggesting that I consider having an oophorectomy as well. I am going to look into genetic testing and then discuss the ovary situation with my med. onco and gyn. My first radiation treatment went well. Got my tattoos (3 of them) and my schedule. They have me scheduled for 33 total with the last one on June 20. They reassured me that they were working on getting things adjusted for my trip--I'm flying out on the 17th. I'll either double up on treatments or get my 5 electron boosts when I return from Dallas. Julie- hope the migraine is GONE! Well, I'm off to dig in the dirt and plant my annuals. It is nice to be home at this time of day for a change! Have a good one, everyone! Paula",

I am a little worried that I might end up with skin issues with rads. They removed the Opsite from my markings yesterday and I have tape burns everywhere. Doesn't bode well for the future, I think... Carol- my day went \"downhill\" as well, but in a less traumatic way. Ds' ballgame went very well until the top of the 7th. They started that inning tied 4-4... and ended with a 4-13 loss...very painful to watch, although ds did well (2-2 at bat and 1 RBI). Your ds' situation is a bit complicated with the ex. Like you need complication in your life right now... Hope ds wasn't too disappointed. Are you guys looking at cumulative GPA? One very bad quarter can knock that all to h3!!. Sounds like he made a 3.0 the last quarter, with all As and Bs. Maybe you can talk to the ex about allowing ds to get the license if he maintains those good grades this quarter as well. Tell ds we're all cheering for a 3.0 so he can drive this summer! Julie- a BIG congrats to you on NBPTS certification. For those of you not in education, it is a rigorous process to obtain national board certification and, thus, a very prestigious accomplishment! How long did you take to complete the requirements? If I remember correctly, you bought the ill-fated TV with some of your dividends? I've looked at doing it myself--intended to start the process 2 years ago, but then dh was diagnosed w/ brain cancer. I've been debating on starting after I finish treatment. I know it might be a bit difficult with chemo-brain, but I'm thinking I'll need something positive to focus on... Oh, not even a HINT of hair on this head, so I can't help you on the soreness. But, what's up with that? It hurt coming out and NOW it's gonna hurt coming back in?

Carol- I love your new avatar! Great news on the u/s--didn't need any more boob problems. It has been a beautiful day here. My rads was moved up (yep, I still have an unpredictable schedule), so I left work early and got to enjoy a little more of the sunshine. Did a little puttering outside myself when I got home! CathyCa- I like the tagline idea for emails--what an easy way to let people know what you're doing! Thanks for the fundraising ideas. How many weeks since you finished chemo? I finished 5 weeks ago and I have the \"5 o-clock shadow\" look. Jenn- I love those Taste of Home mags. What did you have for dinner yesterday? I am so happy to \"see\" your smiling face here again. Wishing you warms days and a sunny spirit. (((HUG))) Wish I were close enough to give you a real hug! Kathy- oh, girl! I cried at both of my kids' kindergarten graduations! They had slide shows of all the kids with Louis Armstrong's \"What a Beautiful World\" in the background. And then seeing all those sweet little faces as they marched across the stage... thanks for bringing back a cherished memory! Cyberknife was mentioned by our rads onc. Not sure which type of radiosurgery dh will need until we see the docs at Duke on Monday. We're going to Duke because they are one of the best in the nation at treating GBM (MD Anderson in TX is another, but Duke is only 6 hours away in NC). We expect that he'll have the one tumor zapped and then get recommendations for chemo to deal with the other areas. We'll probably come home to have chemo unless there's something radical that we can't do elsewhere. Norma- I am still having leg pain, although it is only bad at night. My onco told me that it might take up to six months to subside! He said it was a side effect of Taxol. You had that, right? Anyway, I'd never turn down a scan for reassurance, but keep thinking positive. Odds are that everything is FINE! Did your brother have cancer? He must have been young. LJ- wishing you a speedy recovery, minimal pain, and a favorable path. report! D1- any pics from your 'cation? I'd like to see how the hair is growing as well--gives me hope for the future. Dana- I'm sorry about your dog (sounds like he is more yours than the ex's). I'm glad you came here to vent and get those negative feelings out of your mind. I'm proud of you for taking care of yourself and recognizing how bad that relationship was for you!  (((HUG))) Wondering about Deb1023... hope you're doing well! My legs are crossed and I have a fat cat in my lap--no wonder the gams are aching! Time to retreat to the bed with a book. Wishing everyone a great weekend. Paula",

Maz- what a nice picture of you and ds. Sounds like you had a good visit. You should be very proud of him for turning his life around. I'm praying for his continued success! D1- you're quite the world traveler, girl! I've only traveled in the Americas and Europe, and I've only visited 1/2 the states. I'm taking dd to Stanford in August for a leadership conference. I had actually toyed with the idea of taking a family road trip to California so that the kids could see some more of our great land. I didn't go in to work today. I spent the morning on the telephone with Duke trying to get dh's new clinical trial started. Had my rads at noon and then took Ed for the pre-trial tests to make sure he is clear to start this trial. If things go well, we hope to get started by Wednesday or Thursday. We will have to go to Duke for labs within 3-7 days of the start date. Catch you gals later, Paula",

I still prefer my version to the real thing (a mohair suit? ick!) Music can really bring back some powerful memories, huh? Was listening to Tom Petty last week and POOF--I was in my bff's Mustang Cobra flying down the road with the top down... made me smile! Carol- Great talking to you this afternoon. Forgot to WOOHOO on the phone to celebrate your last chemo! Congrats on being finished!!! You amaze me with how well you are doing with the walking--you've come a long way from the recliner days, eh?! Remember Kathy's advice on the calcium. The body cannot absorb more than 500mg at a time. Kimberly- your weekend sounds wonderful. I'm so glad you enjoyed yourself. Let's see... next trip is to the Windy City, right? PALady- My oldest (the ds) will be a senior next year also. We have senior pics scheduled for August. I'm struggling a bit with the prices. The sitting fee is $200 and the minimum order for senior pics is $895. If you don't mind my asking, how does that compare with the cost of your ds' pics? Trying to decide if ds should keep the appointment... Kathy- your dd's dance recital sounds lovely. Glad you were able to share the experience with so many friends and family. Joan- by the end of this week you'll be finished with rads! And one more week of school after that, right? Sounds like we'll hit the summer vacation point at the same time. I'm taking a break from rads to take my students to Dallas this week. I'll come home and get my boost simulation on the 23rd and then start my 5 boosts. If everything goes well, I'll be finished on June 30. Dana- you sound wonderful, lil' warrior! I enjoyed catching up on your life. So glad nursing school is going well for you--you're in the home stretch and the finish line is in sight. Keep up the good work! Thanks also for the devotions that you share--good reading! D1- man! who wants to dream about Aunt Flo?! Do ya suppose it is related to the whole hormone issue? Wasn't too long ago you were really torn about starting the tamo... Now that you mention it, I don't think I've had a sex dream since I started this journey. In fact, I ain't had the real thing too many times through this ordeal... (oh sorry, guess that's TMI) Deb- hope you are doing well and enjoyed a nice birthday yesterday! Julie- hope the foobs are feeling more comfy today. I know you're looking forward to getting all of this behind you before school starts. I'll be praying that everything goes smoothly! Tina- thanks for the good wishes. Dh is doing well on the trial drugs. He is starting to develop a rash from the Tarceva (a very common se). Otherwise, he's feeling well and looking forward to accompanying me on the school trip to Dallas this week. LJ- I dunno if going \"topless\" is helping my hair grow any faster, but I've used the same line here. I only wear a head cover when I know I'm going to be in an air-conditioned room where I'll be cold. Good to hear that your legs are settling down and things are getting back to normal in that area. And sounds like you're well prepared for your rads. Therese- so good to hear from you. Glad things are going well for you and your family! I have been helping ds pack for the trip to big D all evening. He leaves tomorrow with the rest of the officers (my principal is traveling with them as their chaperone). Dh, dd, and I will fly out Tuesday afternoon with the rest of the students. Will have the laptop with me, so I'll pop in when I can. Kris and Wendy- thinking of you as you hit the chemo bar this week. Congrats, Wendy, on being finished! Take care all, Paula ",

      "Content": "Jun 30, 2008 11:55AM - edited Jun 30, 2008 11:59AM by RN2teach Good Monday morning, JJs! Looks a little gloomy here... we've been having regular rain showers over the past few days. The creek in front of my house is still dry, tho, so bring on the rain! We had a nice steak dinner to celebrate the end of my treatment on Saturday. Those steaks were melt-in-your-mouth delish. Don't do red meat that often, so it was a nice treat for all of us. Dd tossed a salad for us, and we had fresh tomatoes and a luscious watermelon from the local produce. We invited my mom and stepdad, our neighbors and friends who have supported us so well during both my and dh's cancer journeys. It was a nice time--I'm working myself up to the open house idea, Kathy! Dd passed her test for the learner's permit, so I have been chaffeured everywhere over the past week. Our roads are so curvy and winding with all of the hills. She's doing well--haven't felt the need to scream yet! Dh freaks at everything, so she can't drive when he's in the car. He has always been the overprotective type, but the brain cancer/ treatments have exacerbated his responses. Dh and I are taking off in the morning with a couple of friends for a short beach trip. Leaving the kids behind under the supervision of their aunt and uncle. There seems to be a constant tension in our house between dh and the kids, so I'm thinking the break will be good for all of us. I just hope dh feels well enough to enjoy it. D1- Bummer about the toenail--esp. with it being sandal weather! But I'm glad it didn't HURT, at least.   The new do is gorgeous--you look FAB, dahling! Hey, Julie! Hope the bed stayed dry last night. Puppies are high maintenance critters, but those two are so CUTE! Love the names--Cain and Vader. I like your idea of a Jewels address book, but I second whoever said that it needs to be sent via snail mail once everyone OKs (or nixes) sharing their address with the group. Carol, no A/C? I think its great that you don't usually need it--means you actually open windows and enjoy the fresh air more than most of us! Charleston, WV has just been voted one of the top 100 sweatiest cities in the US, so you can bet we have A/C (actually two units--one for each level of the house). I'm a little sensitive to the cold still (no hot flashes here, just icicles!) so I prefer sitting on our front porch to chilling inside. Cathy- the outdoor concerts sound wonderful. Hope you had a good time. And hope everything worked out well with ds and the car purchase. LJ- honey, you are SO entitled to a good whine when you want it--and we're just the place to come when you feel the need! Congrats on the new DR purchase. I'd say you're long overdue for a new one. It sounds lovely--please share a pic when it arrives. Kathy- take care of yourself, busy girl! I know your life is full right now with your family and work, but I'm glad you're taking time for the exercise. Gotta nip that osteopenia in the bud! Sherry- great pictures of you and Brandy! The bridal shower sounds wonderful--I love snickerdoodles! Good luck with the job hunt. Here's hoping your new apartment will have A/C! A painting class at your cancer center? What a great idea! Kris, thinking of you this week as you knock off another one-- next week is the big finale! We're off to Charleston here in a bit. Gotta get my port flushed and Ed needs bloodwork. We're leaving early in the morning for Myrtle Beach, SC. Have a wonderful week, Gems! Paula",

I read through my scan reports while I was waiting on the doc to come in and they sounded pretty good on the second reading... guess I was a little freaked on the first reading! Anyway, my surgeon said NED (a big Kimberly WOOHOO on that one!). So, I have my port removal scheduled for 10/13-- a teacher work day, so no sub needed. The trip to Duke went well and dh got a great report! His brain MRI shows only one distinct tumor which is shrinking, and another very small \"area of concern.\" I'm just amazed at how well this trial is working. And to think I was dismayed that it was only a phase 1 study! We will return to Duke the week of Thanksgiving. Sherry- So glad that your path report was good! But gee, you didn't even get a break to recuperate! Sorry you're dealing with such a crummy work situation. I hope everything works out the way you want. Carol- good news on the bone scan. Your walking regimen is just what the doctor ordered to keep those bones healthy!  As for the port, I'll have mine removed in short-stay surgery under \"twilight\" anesthesia--same routine that they used to put it in. I was pretty sensitive to the meds they used... slept thru the whole thing. I'm looking forward to getting rid of this thing! Guess you're out on the town by now. Sounds fun even if you'll be up past your normal bedtime. I'm taking a break from my exciting evening: grading papers and getting ready to watch the VP debate. I fell asleep toward the end of the pres. debate. I'm trying to read/research as much as I can on these critters who want to govern our country so that I can make an informed decision on election day. Some days I feel that I've made up my mind... other days I feel as if I may have to draw straws...  Ah, well... Cathy- so your walk is in November? Was thinking it was this month. Guess you'll be stepping out for some long walks this month in preparation. I know you'll do well since you stay so active! D1- On the LE-- doc sez no... if it were LE, I'd have issues with my armpit and arm as well... What I have, according to him is a \"normal\" reaction to the trauma of radiation on the boob. Usually it shrinks the affected tissue, but about 10% of the population has the opposite effect--more fullness. He said it could take up to TWO YEARS to resolve... if it resolves.... it might not... So... I dunno... All I know is, I am a full size larger on the right than the left. Makes bra shopping a PITA. Hope your mammo is as uneventful as mine. Esp. since you already have major LE issues! I'm heading north tomorrow with ds to prepare for the student organization's state leadership conference. The students (40 of them) will arrive Saturday morning with my colleagues for the one-day event. I'll check in with you all on Sunday. Hope everyone has a good weekend! Paula",

Had it taken out Monday under twilight sedation. Dd went with dh and me-she has her learner's permit and drove us home after the procedure. I could have driven, though. Easy as pie, Carol-no worries! We did a little shopping on the way home (just a quick trip into Kohl's and Office Max). I'm glad the work week is over... two more weeks of doing the work of two teachers-our nurse is set to start Nov. 3. I'll still be doing a lot of the planning after she starts, mentoring the new teacher, etc. But it will be a lot easier than planning for a sub that doesn't have a clue about what we teach. (Julie, I'm doing the sub plans because I'm the lead teacher and I'm responsible for getting all the seniors ready for clinicals). Kimberly- thinking of you and your ds. I'm encouraged to hear that her cancer was found so early. WTG getting her to get that MRI!     I'll be 47 next month-been in menopause since age 44. Don't think Auntie Flo will be back to visit here... I just recently started having hot flashes. They're pretty mild and short-lasting, but WOW!    You asked about the funding for my student conferences. We have to raise that money-no support from the school system for the kids. The last conference was on a Saturday and the kids paid a registration fee to attend. Carol- we talked for an hour?! It didn't seem that long-that's how it goes when you're talking to a friend. Thanks for calling! (And WOO HOO on losing your yoga cherry!)    Sounds like Zach's Sylvan visit went well. Hope he got his work schedule worked out. Ds went to weekends only after a month of juggling work and school. It has made things a lot better for him. He has time to keep up with his school work, work on college admissions stuff, and enjoy his senior year. D1- so college girl has a budding romance... what memories that brings back! Glad to hear she's getting awesome grades this year. The freshman year is tough-sounds like she's on track to make the grades she wants. Where does she plan to study abroad?     Funny, our kids had their homecoming dance last Saturday-a week after homecoming. In my day (boy, that phrase makes me feel old), we had homecoming dance after the ballgame.    I watched the debates this week, too. No big moments on this one, IMO. I was entertained a couple of times, but mostly just bored....  Sherry- love those curls, girlfriend! My hair isn't so curly, but it does have a bit of wave. I had a trim this week to shape it up a bit (my first real trim!).     LOL at popping an extra water pill-hope you got some sleep... How's the job situation? CHJ- you look great-love the scenery, too. The Shenandoah Valley is beautiful. Your hairstyle looks familiar... like lookin' in the mirror!     I'm still undecided on the genetic testing also... postponed the decision until my next f/u appt in Dec.    Have fun tomorrow at your Race for the Cure! Hope you're not too bombarded by PINK! (LOL at the pink vacuum-WTF?) There's a Pepto thread?? Gotta check that out... Deb- WOW! That was a big event. I have heard of Corrigan and went to Amazon to check out her book. It sounds great (I ordered it). There's a cool video about her below the book info on the Amazon site-definitely peaked my interest in reading her book.    My neuropathy is minimal-occasional problems with the legs and feet, but don't need the Mirapex anymore (that was very effective for the restless legs syndrome, though) Kathy- glad you had a good weekend away. So, the curls will go when I get a \"real\" haircut instead of a trim, eh?  Ah! I had forgotten about the nip surgery... the stitches are out. Now let's hope this nip is a keeper! Carla- dang! I hate that your DH is still being such a... DH! (((HUGS)))     I got your PM. I have to reschedule ds' visit to WVU-had one for Monday, but got my port removed instead. I'll be in touch when I have a date. Bobbie- hey, there! Nice to see you on this thread. We've \"met\" before on the brain cancer/breast cancer thread. Your dh had a brain cancer like my dh's, correct? How are the two of you doing? Julie- how has your week been after your marathon outdoor activities last weekend? Hope you didn't overdo it with the yard work! LJ- thanks for sharing your exercise routine. I haven't been doing weight training... really need to get started on that. Therese- your weekend sounds FUN! Enjoy! Sorry this turned into a novel... (is anyone still reading?) If you are, I need some suggestions for good books. I'm out of reading material. Have a good weekend, all! Paula",

Met my students at the local nursing home for a community service event and then stopped by the polling place to cast my votes. I spent the weekend catching up on laundry, etc, so I'm going to try to chill a little this afternoon. Looking forward to watching the election coverage later this evening. I took last Friday off from work to attend a Komen-sponsored reception for BC survivors. We were served a delicious meal and treated with goodies. Very nice. I spent the rest of the afternoon shopping for myself. Scored a great buy on shoes ($17) and finally bought myself a medical alert bracelet. I found a sterling silver bracelet with a round charm at Things Remembered and had it engraved. Very tasteful, IMHO. (Not as nice as LJ's, though) Our nurse started yesterday. She is going to be a great teacher! The next couple of months should still be a little hectic while she learns the ropes, but it's all uphill from here. Unfortunately, things aren't so good with Eddie right now. He's sleeping 24/7 and is really out-of-sorts when he is awake- disoriented, dizzy and has fallen several times. Fortunately we've been here when he fell. So, trying not to leave him alone anymore than we have to. WOW! I'm a whole page behind on the Jewels... Cathy- great to read that you fared well on your first training weekend. Hope that the weekend coming will be just as successful. Good luck! Carol- I am so glad you opened that can of worms. It is a relief to know that I'm not alone in feeling out of sorts. One of my co-workers alluded (in a very kind way) to my moodiness last week... thought I was holding it together pretty well... guess not!  Sorry your dh couldn't handle letting you air your feelings. Great advice from your CMF friend- thanks for sharing that! I don't feel that I can take anything else on right now, but my mom gave me some yoga tapes for beginners and I'm trying to work that into my evening routine. (You've inspired me!) So, the port removal is coming up soon. I think you'll be surprised at how good it feels not to have the pesky lump in your chest. I didn't have a bit of trouble afterward- very easy recovery! LJ- I hear you- hard not to worry about what is going on with our bodies after all they've absorbed this past year. It doesn't help to read up on BC- I remember that quote \"We tell them we got it all and send them on their way and tell them not to worry. What else are we going to do?\"  Unsettling, isn't it? PALady- An ovarian cyst, eh? Hope it resolves and doesn't cause you too much pain. Happy belated birthday to your ds. Mine will turn 18 on Dec. 30th. I'll be sending you an email about the calendars soon. Still trying to decide how many I want! Kathy- how wonderful to have a therapist who can truly relate to what you're feeling. Thanks for sharing some of her insights with us! Glad ds's birthday party was a success. Sherry- you're burning the candle at both ends, sweetheart. Hope your new job works out well for you, since it sounds like standing on your feet all day is really taking a toll on your health. Therese- very thoughtful of you to be out there giving support to those who are beginning their cancer treatment! I know I'm a little late on the care package suggestions, but don't forget the aloe. Julie- hate that you have to have the endoscopy from both ends, but I'm glad it is scheduled soon and praying for good news- sounds a little warped to be rooting for you to \"just\" have hemorrhoids, but there it is! I was thinking the same thing as Kimberly- you'll have lots of room for feasting on Thanksgiving, eh?! CHJ- thanks for your input on the blue mood some of us are experiencing. You are a SHERO! Carla- you sound great- strong and decisive. WTG!! We haven't got that visit scheduled yet. Will keep you posted as I can't wait to meet you! Our birthdays are just 2 days apart- we definitely need to celebrate together. Kimberly- what a delightful verse! Halloween must have been some event at your house. Loved hearing about the kids and their costumes. We had 8 kids show up out here in the boonies. As always, you and twinsis are in my thoughts. Her report sounds very encouraging! Joan and Kris- hey there, girls! Good to hear from you. Deb- I'm having a return of the restless legs here also. And I still hobble around like an 80-year-old after I've been sitting for a while. I had stopped my RLS pill (Mirapex), but I'm back on that now... can't sleep without it. Here's hoping that the SE's of the taxanes don't stay with us for much longer! Oh, and thanks for the birthday wishes. Dh and I will celebrate together: he turns 52 on November 14th and my 47th is on the 15th. I suppose the end of this month is technically my cancerversary. I found my lump on November 30th, had my mammo the next week, biopsy the week after that and surgery on Dec. 26th. GTG-time to check on dh and figure out what to fix for dinner. Take care, my friends! Paula",

Tina- almost wet myself laughing at your eyelash story. I never learned how to use one of those things successfully-didn't realize they could be so hazardous! I'm still applying mascara, but the lashes are pretty thin with lots of gaps. Carol- Congrats on taking the plunge for the 3-Day Walk. I'm excited for you! Checked out your page-love the picture of you and your boobie! LOL Take good care of those tootsies-the last thing you need is blisters. I'll have to check out the socks that Ginny recommended. Oh, and I'm sorry to read about your co-worker having a recurrence of lung cancer. Therese- Hope your family is on the mend from the latest injuries and infections. Good thing they have a nurse in the house, eh?! You sound great, BTW! Kimberly, my SIS- I'm thinking of you as the fog permeates your world for the LAST time. The foglight is on high beam for you. Rest well and reenergize! Oh, and yippee on the infection finally resolving for good. Julie- begone migraine! I'm so glad that blasted headache is gone and you were able to get out and enjoy the spring sunshine this weekend. PALady- you look like you have a fair complexion, so I'm glad to hear you're not having skin issues w/ rads. What are you using on your skin? I see my rads doc next week to start planning my treatments. I'll be starting in less than 2 weeks so I can be finished in time for a trip to Texas in mid-June with my students. Joan- looks like I'll be starting rads soon after you-hopefully by May 9. I will be having 25 whole breast rads, with 8 boosts to the tumor bed built into those 25 somehow (I think this is a fairly new treatment approach). Dana- oh, honey! I am so very sorry about your bad news.LJ's suggestion is a good one: explore those clinical trials. I'd be looking for a second opinion if your doctor does not have a new game plan to fight this thing. You are our LW, keep fighting and KEEP THE FAITH, Dana! D1- don't sell yourself short-you ARE a good parent! But I do know what you mean-I'm just glad my kids are resilient enough to be okay in spite of my parenting fumbles. Hope dd's ankle is mending well. Sheshe- hope the muscle strain is better and you're able to get around and do the things you need to do. So, when do you start rads? I'm missing some of our Jewels. Hope you gals are doing okay: Jenn- are you feeling okay? CarolC- how's the job hunting going? Judy (Sheebas)- I know you stopped AC and were starting something else (Xeloda?). How's that going?

      "Content": "May 3, 2008 08:55PM - edited May 3, 2008 08:58PM by RN2teach Hello JJs, I'm already vegged out on the sofa in my pjs. The last couple of times that I've posted here I've been so darn sleepy that I could barely finish my post before nodding off. Thought I'd pop in a bit earlier this evening! Feeling pretty good. Some lingering bone pain and neuropathy, a little bit of swelling, but all minor... Some of my Jewel sisters have it so bad on the side effects-I wish I could take some of your burden and even things out a bit. Baseball season is winding down. Sectional games are this week. Dunno whether ds and his team will advance beyond this level... they have a lot of talent but they're not playing well this year (record 6-10). My boy was in a slump all week... struck out twice, missed a couple of key catches in the outfield. Did the Komen 5K walk this morning with my mom, dd and her boyfriend, several of my friends, and 5 of my students. It was a chilly morning so I had a long-sleeved tee under my pink survivor t-shirt. Wore a doorag and my Boobie cap. It warmed up enough that I shed my cap and eventually my doorag. One nice thing about being bald-it sure helps you cool off quickly! I had lots of inquiries about my cap and only positive reactions when I eventually went bald at the end of the walk. Didn't see any other bald walkers, though, so I was a little conspicuous. I encouraged ds to sleep in this morning and skip the walk. He's not a morning person-he's definitely a night owl like his mama! His prom is this evening and I wanted him to be well-rested since he'll be out late and driving his date home afterward. He looked so handsome in his tux and his date was a knock-out in a red dress. Their prom is at the Marriott in Charleston. I remember our prom was at our high school... that seems to be the exception these days. It is much more commercialized now with girls spending fortunes on their dresses, hair, nails, shoes, tanning, etc. Thankfully, boys are easier on the wallet-just rent the tux, buy the flowers, and take your date out to dinner. I hope everyone is doing okay. I need to catch up on the posts and then I'll be back to send some shout-outs. God knows I won't be sleeping much tonight until ds gets home safely, so I might be back on for a late-night post! Hope you all are having a good weekend. Paula",

I hope this gives you some reassurance. Hang in there! Julie- in case I don't get here tomorrow, know that I'll be thinking of you Tuesday as you get nipped! CHJ- good for you, having all the shopping finished! Hope your weekend was relaxing. We don't have to worry about the lines here, either. Small towns do have some perks, eh? Carol- those pups are so adorable! Seattle's weather made the news here-- primarily the bus collision with the two buses hanging off a bridge. I'd have needed some clean undies if I'd been on that bus!  I watched part of the Gonzaga vs UConn game yesterday. Your team played well, gave Conn. a run for their money. Carla- be careful out there, WVgirl! Glad you weren't seriously injured. Oh and congrats to your college girls for the good grades! D1- you mentioned getting your hair colored. Are you still a blonde? I hear you on the curls. Nothing here but a few annoying bends and flips and a cowlick in the crown.   Kris- surely you're too young to remember \"where's the beef\"?! Seems like that was so long ago... There was a spoof on the Burger King \"Flame\" in our paper today. There's a website called www.firemeetsdesire.com which is hilarious. Click on the body spray a few times and it goes to the burger king dude lying on a bear rug in front of a fire with nothing on but a blanket across his... whopper! My \"cancerversary\" was yesterday. The day was almost over before I noticed the date and realized... it wasn't something I wanted to celebrate anyway... Two more school days and then we have a break until January 5th. Nice! I'll be back soon... Paula",

      "Content": "May 8, 2008 10:51PM - edited May 8, 2008 10:56PM by RN2teach Hey gals, Well, I have 3 rads under my belt now. My treatments are ranging from 5pm to 6:30pm-my center starts zapping people at 6am and doesn't quit until after 7pm. I have a list that shows my tentative schedule for the next month. I'm trying to get the early morning treatment times so it doesn't interfere with after school stuff. I took my iPod in today-makes the time go by faster when I'm listening to some good music. I just put some REO Speedwagon tunes on it yesterday. What memories they brought back! The strangest thing about rads is all the angles. I remember dh had zaps all around his head-just thought it would be different with a boob. My treatments begin with the rads unit under me. It rotates 3 times before it pops up on my right side for 3 (or is it 4?) zap angles on the front side. The whole thing only takes about 15 minutes or so. No worries so far except it is a bit chilly in the room. Since I had a lumpectomy, I still have nipples to announce to the world how cold I am. All I need is a wet t-shirt... NOT! Tina- So, are you going in to work every day now? How's that going? I could SO get into the fuzzy slippers mode right now. Joan- my rads are supposed to be completed on June 20th also. I'm going to have to have some creative scheduling because I'm leaving for Dallas on June 17. D1- What a wonderful neighbor you are! And hand-feeding your doggy-isn't she a spoiled pooch (LOL at the Cleopatra comment). Zipadeedodah! It's your last ZAP! Congrats! LJ- How wonderful to hear another Jewel is finished with chemo. Sounds like you still have a full plate of cancer treatments with the surgery and then rads. Hope the se's from this last round of chemo are mild ones. On yeah, totally agree-chemo nurses ROCK! Kimberly- How nice to have several vacations lined up for the summer! Where is Ashland? I hope you and your sisters have a wonderful visit and a beautiful day for your Komen walk on Saturday. Therese- So, have you got to see your new girls yet?  (I was sooo impressed that you were on here right after surgery!) Ohmigosh-the washcloth story was hilarious! Your comments to PALady were lovely-well put, TexRN! Carol- very funny about the Mariners... I'm just thankful that he wasn't pitching that night! He had a game scheduled for this evening, but it was cancelled d/t rain. I wouldn't have been able to go anyway as the games are in a town about an hour away from my rads center. They'll be playing tomorrow. I have a 4:45 rads time, so I should be able to make it to the ballfield by game time. I've been thinking of Steph-please tell him he's had a lot of prayers going up in the past couple of days. I'm so glad things seem to be working out for ds on the driver's license. If your insurance co. is like mine (Metropolitan), they want a copy of the most recent report card for that good student discount. Tell Zach to keep getting those As and Bs! Oh, and also good luck skating this weekend. CathyCA- you sound like me with the rads appointments. I've been a little pushy trying to get the whole rads thing going early instead of waiting a month. Now that I've started, I'm pushing to get finished by June 16 instead of the 20th. I don't particularly like the late evening sessions, but I figure I'd better quit while I'm ahead since they are working with me on the rest. Julie- I'm so glad you enjoyed your well-earned celebration dinner last night! Sheesh! Five months is a long time to wait for the board test results, isn't it?! Kathy- glad work is going well. Enjoy the nurse luncheon tomorrow! Dana- congrats on acing that test. It is good to see your post and get an update on your treatment plans. Hang in there, LW! WV Girl and Peg- you're up tomorrow for chemo. Be thinking of you both! Wow, it took me a long time to catch up! So sorry this is long... I hope everyone has a good Friday. Paula",

Then Christmas day at my house with dh's family and my Mom-- there were 20 of us here. Had enough food for dinner again on Friday. The undecorating has begun here. It was a gorgeous 70 degrees outside yesterday, so got all the outside stuff down. The tree comes down today. I love starting the new year with a clean house! Gearing up for the big 18th birthday bash on Tuesday. Ds wants to have a party and then have the guys stay over for a marathon session of Halo / Guitar Hero. I'm still trying to decide about the overnight thing.... I don't mind the noise-- working with teenagers has conditioned me well! Dh is another story. Kimberly- good to hear that you and the OBGYN are in sync. Any idea when you'll have surgery? Carol- so, you had a white Christmas! No snow here-- just the opposite... I saw some very confused bees buzzing around yesterday. We've gone from single digit temps to summer in less than a week! The seafood stew sounds yummy. Kris- I see the drain is history and you had a happy Christmas. YEAH! Sherry- there is no such thing as a bad Jewel, girlfriend! Your first priority has got to be your health and your family-- so no worries, okay? How's the new job coming along? CHJ- ditto what you said about being blessed by the Jewels. Your Christmas sounds lovely-- can't get much better than quiet and relaxing in my book! Joan- I thought of you Christmas morning. Happy to read that you had a good day with your family. And there's Tina-- we've missed you! I've imagined you and dh out riding your Harleys around the US all summer. Come back soon and give us an update. Norma- good catch on the thrombophlebitis. Shows you the value of knowing our bodies, huh? Not quite the peaceful, relaxing Christmas you envisioned, though.... Sorry 'bout that! I gave the calendars as Christmas gifts. I pointed October's survivor out to them. I don't think I've mentioned how pretty your pictures are! My computer is trying to crash-- hard disc failure! YIKES! I was just bragging on how much mileage I'd gotten out of this old Gateway on Christmas. I bought it in 2000. I spent yesterday burning all of my pics to CDs and saving my documents to a jump drive. Took me most of the day to accomplish that. So, now I have some peace of mind about it's imminent demise. I'm looking at replacing it with another desktop. I have a laptop to use when/if it takes it's last breath. Off to tackle that tree.... Paula",

I've been awake for a couple of hours, finally gave up on sleep and decided to do something other than toss and turn. Kathy- what a lovely memorial service for your friend's mother. Very touching to read about. The treatment list this week is really short, isn't it? Thank you so much for keeping us updated. One thing, though, Judy (sheebas) stopped AC after the 3rd treatment and was started on Xeloda last month, I think. She is one of our MIA Jewels that I'm particularly worried about. Hasn't logged in here since April 8. Best wishes to you on week 2 of your new job! D1- hope the dd had a good day on the court yesterday. I'm really enjoying the StoryCorps book (thanks SP!!). It is called \"Listening is an Act of Love.\" I found their website: http://www.storycorps.net You can listen to some of the stories online. Carol- congrats to ds and his bf on the big win! Wow! Surfing the net from your car--gotta love modern technology. Hope you're feeling okay. You haven't had much time to rest since your last round of chemo... take care of yourself! Peg- glad your son checked in to let you know he's okay. I've been thinking of you. Joan- sounds like you had a nice birthday and mother's day weekend. I'm right there with you on rads, sister--4 down, 29 to go! Sherry- How thoughtful of dd and her beau to honor you through the Heavenly Hats donation. And btw, how are the wedding plans coming along? What is the date again? August? Hope all the Jewels have a good Monday. I've got a busy week planned. Going to a planning session today for our region's public health disaster drill. Lots of fundraising going on for my students' national conference. I'm picking up Krispy Kreme donuts this evening after my rads--we made $1,500 on that one. We're having a hot dog sale, yard sale and car wash tomorrow--West Virginia's primary elections are this Tuesday, so school is closed. Friday is \"McHOSA Night\" at McDonald's--we work from 4-7pm and get 20% of the total sales. I'll be taking my state officers (incl. ds) to Glade Springs Resort this weekend for their leadership training and executive council meeting. Think I'll get a massage while I'm there!",

I love my new mug \"Embrace the Day\" and the magnet \"Live well, Laugh often, Love much.\" I'm inspired! Speaking of inspiring... Great poem, Patty. Doubt that I can measure up to those good intentions for even one whole day, but it's a good thing to aspire to! Maz- oh, my! Another Jewel having to deal with the possibility of a recurrence. I'm sending up lots of prayers for your good health and a NED report. I'm sorry you're having to go through this... FUBC indeed!  D1- How exciting that you'll get to view the inauguration! I wish I could be there... CHJ- sounds like the onc. change was meant to be, eh? Carol- yep, I've been blocked by the water--usually on MY side of the holler (aka hollow). The \"main\" hollow winds between mountains beside a creek. Then you turn off onto a smaller holler with meanders beside another creek. The main hollow creek empties into the river about 2.5 miles from my house. That's where the flooding occurs, so it only affects my access. The puny little creek in front of my house is about 15-20 feet below the level of my house and has never overflowed its banks in the 13 years that we've lived here (or in the memory of any of the old-timers who have lived here for decades. So, I guess we're safe.  We had a 2 hour delay this morning as the temps fell from mid-50s to the 20s (hate this fickle weather!) and the rain changed to snow and ice. Dh has his MRI tomorrow afternoon. I'll ask for a copy of the CD so that I can check it out while I'm waiting for the report. I've gotten pretty good at noting the changes (of course, I've had 2.5 years of practice). So, I'll be back tomorrow to report on what's up. Stay safe, Jewels. Paula ",

PALady- what a wonderful idea to celebrate the end of your treatments with a girls' weekend! I hope the weather is beautiful and that you gals are having a fabulous time.

Carol- warm weather and deck time-the perfect combo for a nice evening. Wish I were there! Ohhh, just read where you got a little vino in as well. What a treat! OK, I know Debra's report from the onc has you reeling, but take a deep breath and try to settle down. You had 2 opinions and both agreed to CMF for you, right? With that said, I totally understand. When I read about TC being \"better\" than AC + T, I worried... then I read about Taxotere being more effective than Taxol... then I read that Carboplatins are preferred over all of the above... you get the picture, I hope-there's always going to be the \"next big thing\" in cancer treatment. There is a certain amount of \"blind leaping\" involved, but we have done our best to arm ourselves for this battle. That's all we can do! LJ- those reports sound terrific to me. Good to see things are moving along for your surgery now that you're finished with chemo. Therese- I'm glad you took the weekend off after your surgery-esp. since it meant you got to spend Mother's Day w/ your family! A sinus infection? Yuck! Glad it is resolving quickly. Don't worry, honey, you aren't the only one who hasn't found the time to get something out to their SP... WTG on acing your course finals! Joan- #9 rads done for me, too. No redness, tiny bit of itching. I had my treatment yesterday at 6am so I could go out of town. When I was driving up to the rads center at 5:30am, I decided my evening appts weren't so bad after all! OK, I'm feeling a little sleepy-took some Advil and the legs have settled down. Think I'll go back to bed for an hour or so. I'll check in again when I get home. Have a good weekend, all! Paula",

Ordered an Edible Arrangment (a bouquet made with fruit) to be delivered to the staff tomorrow. D1- Glad you found a bag that worked, even though it wasn't a perfect fit. I have a hobo bag that I carried in Dallas. It has lots of compartments and held all the kids' supplies as well as dh's emergency seizure meds. Unfortunately, it is leather and I grew to hate it in the Texas heat! So, when are you going to post a pic of your new do?? I haven't got enough hair to cover my scalp yet, but it is coming in fast now. I have pretty much ditched my headcoverings d/t the heat. There are a LOT of different colors growing in... brown, silver, gray. My mom swears there are blonde ones as well, but I think those are probably the non-pigmented ones that came in first--they're the longest.  Julie- great pics of you and your family at the race. I'm SO jealous of those TAN legs, girlfriend! You look great!!  I got hooked on the Tudors this spring. Have watched all of the first 2 seasons now. (Henry Cavill (Charles Brandon) is a hottie, doncha think?!) Hate that the women all have to die-- Kennedy was a great Catherine of Aragon and I LOVED Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn. Tina- the graduation party sounds wonderful. (taking notes for next year). Our garden is looking good also. We have lots of deer here, but they're giving us a break so far--some years they can wipe us out! WVGirl- I'm sorry the dh is still being a DH at times. Hang in there! You're in my thoughts and prayers as you get those tests done-- doing the NED dance for you! KathyL- I bow to pay homage to the Jewels' very own Rant Queen!  I feel more normal knowing that I'm not alone in having pissy moods. Aunt Flo alone is enuf for a \"hissy fit\" (another of granny's descriptives). Add in the rest of the stuff you had going in one day and you totally deserve to be P/O'ed!  Hope everything works out in your favor! Oh yeah, kudos on the open house. What a wonderful idea to thank all of the people who have supported you through this BC journey. Think I'll steal that idea!  Carol, I hear you on the aquaphor being slimey. Don't smear it on too thick (\"a little dab'll do\"). I used it right after my rads and again at bedtime. Take LJ's advice on the aloe, if your rads doc is okay with that. Aloe has got to feel better than the greasy stuff! (And I love PALady's advice on putting the aloe in the frig!) The main thing is keeping the skin hydrated and your water intake is a biggy there, too. I found the following info online at http://www.curetoday.com/backissues/v3n1/webexclusive/radiation/index.html Bolus, a flabby, rubbery material, is used in certain situations to \"fool\" the radiation beam so it will deposit the maximum dose on the skin surface instead of a fraction of an inch deeper, as it would otherwise. Therefore, a skin reaction is almost inevitable in this scenario. Bolus is usually incorporated into radiation therapy for skin cancers or when a surgical scar, such as a mastectomy scar, needs to receive a full dose of radiation therapy. Kris- your dd's camp looks wonderful! Hope she has a great time. I'm so glad your chemo days are nearly over. We're all cheering for you as you near the finish line! PALady- wow! You've been finished with rads for 6 weeks already? I hope the xrays turn out okay. I'm still having leg pain--mostly at night. My onco referred me to a neurologist, but I don't see her until September. In the meantime, he prescribed Mirapex for RLS (restless legs synd.). It is working pretty well. I'm off to take dh to his onco appointment. Have a good evening, Gems! Paula",

Dh seems to be coming around after being in the bed since Sunday. The Tarceva and Sprycel are working on the brain tumors, but they're also taking a toll on his digestive system. He feels so badly that he is planning his funeral-seriously... Hopefully his onco will prescribe something to help him tolerate the drugs better. Dd is still at camp-still homesick, mostly for the boyfriend I'm thinking-but still there! Ds is still jobless--he is doing all of his dad's handyman duties around the house, mowing lawns, and working at our church's vacation bible school this week. I've also got him working on scholarship essays this summer and we're scheduling visits to several colleges/ universities. I've pretty much \"cut him off\" financially in hopes that he would be more motivated to get out there and work... so far he's happy with the small cash infusion he gets from mowing a few lawns in the area! Whatever! Carol- always great to talk to you-I believe I monopolized the conversation too much (thanks for listening!). I am sure looking forward to meeting you face to face-wish the CA trip would have worked out, but the cancellation was best for our family. D1- hope Kippy is bouncing back and feeling more like herself today. We learned the hard way on those rawhide bones, too. Our golden has had a couple of broken teeth removed (she's 10). SISKimberly- San Francisco sounds lovely! (I was ALMOST there... sigh!). Always enjoy your travel reports. I echo the sentiments of D1, Carol and others: what a SHERO you are! (I'm hearing Gloria Gaynor sing \"I will Survive\" as I write this). I am thankful that you emerged from those dreadful experiences as the vibrant and beautifully expressive woman that you are! KathyL- the pool comments brought back wistful memories for me, too! I know the phrase is trite and overused, but enjoy the little ones... they really DO grow up so quickly... I love my teens, but they're so into themselves, ya know? Hope your long day went well yesterday. LJ- another night owl here to commiserate on that early rads appointment-YUCK! Thanks for the comments on dh. I'll pass those on to him when he starts feeling better. PALady- LOL at the stuffed gorilla! I've been to Cedar Point a couple of times, although it's been years ago since I was last there. I haven't worn a scarf in weeks either, except to protect my scalp at the beach. Jamie Lee Curtis, eh? Funny, I saw her on a commercial just last week and commented that I liked her do. I'd love to see a pic! Deb- thanks for the information and the links. I'm definitely an info hound. Did you notice the TN Ask-the-Expert Conference on this site tonight? I'll be checking that out. Dana- you have done what you needed to do-reported the abuse. Whether or not they use your testimony, they're going to nail this guy, right? Leave it in God's hands and keep moving forward, LW! Sista- have you started rads yet? Hope your first treatments go well. CHJ- congrats-you're finished!!! A big SISKimberly WOOOHOOO to you!! Time to take my java and head back out to the porch swing. TTYL, Paula",

Feeling a little drained today. Didn't sleep well last night so I'm making up for it today. Nausea is minimal and well-controlled by the Emend. Thanks, Kathy, for the tip on the Sea-Bands. Definitely worth trying! And your advice for CarolC was right on the money, honey. Let's hope it brings good results! CarolC- I read on another thread about a med being refused by the insurance company and the drug company ended up donating the med for the treatment. Something to look into.... Carol- I forgot to thank you earlier for arranging the t-shirts designs and orders. I will send my $$ out Tuesday. Julie- Here's plenty of vibes for going back to work. I am planning to work thru this as much as possible. (dh has been off work since May 2006, on SS, but still hard to manage with 2 teenagers and dh's medical bills. Now add mine...) I know you said you don't have a sick bank, but can someone donate one of their sick days to you? That is an option here. It is totally voluntary. Your colleagues receive a formal request from the administrator explaining your situation and asking for volunteers to donate a sick day. One more thing, I worked with spinal cord injury patients for 12 years, so I'm pretty good at developing bowel programs. (Who would ever think of THAT as a blessing?!) I believe you all have covered the remedies for constipation very well, but thought I would add one other helpful item. Get some glycerin suppositories just in case--keeps you from having to give birth to the cinder blocks. Use one or two every 3rd day if things are not movin' on their own. It's like unstopping the drain so the rest can come out. Hugs to all who are facing chemo tx this week. Paula",

Thanks, wvgirl, for the quotes--I needed that! I'm feeling a little needy this morning and you gals are sooo good at boosting the spirit... I think I mentioned in a previous post that my dh is a 19 month survivor of brain cancer (glioblastoma, grade 4). Main problem is seizures, which are mostly controlled by meds (megadoses of 3 drugs). Last night he had 3 pretty intense seizures. Finally got him stabilized around 1am. It is hard for him (and me) to take the seizures in stride since that was the first symptom of his tumor in May 2006. The nurse in me knows that he has brain damage to the frontal lobe, which is a prime spot for seizures. The wife in me can't help but dwell on that big \"WHAT IF\" that everyone who has ever had cancer can identify with.... He was given a 50-50 chance of surviving 1 year and only 1-4 odds of making it 2 years. It's times like these that I am glad to have faith in the Almighty. I know my mind would have continued to play horror movies all night if I hadn't started praying. Any prayer warriors out there, please pray for Eddie!",

Since almost all of us who teach health occupations are RNs, our sessions relate to both teaching and health care-meaning we can get CEUs to renew our licenses. Gotta love getting more \"bang for the buck\" there! We found a fabulous local Italian place just down the road from our hotel-Oliverio's. (Carla, have you eaten there? I believe they've added a restaurant in Morgantown) Things were peaceful here at home while I was gone. Dd was extremely kind and thoughtful to her dad-fixing his meals, keeping the house clean, etc. Not sure what alien abducted our REAL dd, but this new one is a nice fit for our family... we'll enjoy the good mood while it lasts... Dh and I leave tomorrow for Duke. Got the MRI yesterday and we're all set to go. He seems to be feeling okay-not quite up to the level he was before the last seizure, though. I'm hoping the trip will be easier on him this time. We should be back in town by the weekend. We're entertaining guests at the moment (well, not literally... they're actually all still in bed). My cousin and his family are in from Texas. We saw them briefly in June while we were in Dallas. They've been to DC and NY for their vacation and are heading home this morning. He and his wife have 7 kids, aged 16 to 2. They've been traveling together since July 19 in the family van... and they're absolutely wonderful... cheerful, considerate, etc... not sure what planet they're from, but I'd like to visit there sometime! So, things in the Jewel world are okay... everyone seems to be doing well. Sherry- when's the big day? Praying for a beautiful wedding day. I know the mother of the bride is going to be glowing! Julie- you sound great. Glad things are healing well. Take it easy, gf! Kathy- children's clothes are SO expensive, aren't they?! Glad you got some good bargains. When are you off to the beach? Patty- ((HUG)) Let all that frustration out, girl! I can't imagine what emotional turmoil you must be going through in this situation. Ultimately though you are not in control of Denise's treatment and at some point you are going to have to accept that and not let it destroy your peace of mind. I'm praying that you'll get there soon. And, of course, I'm praying for Denise to choose the best course of treatment for her cancer. LJ- excellent advice for Patty. Okay, you're over the halfway point with rads this week. Glad your skin is doing well with the treatments. Cheering you on from the sidelines... Dana- LOL at the soup save--you gals ARE nonchalant about the earthquakes, eh?! Kimberly- ah! Your latest excursion sounds lovely. Thanks for sharing the details. I'm living vicariously through your travels. I've got the itch to hit the road and do a little traveling before school starts back. Unfortunately, dh doesn't feel up to traveling... Norma- got my address list (thanks Kimberly and Carol!) and noticed on browsing through that you've got a birthday coming up! I'm going to wish you a happy birthday right now as I read that you're going out of town tomorrow. Have a nice trip! Carol- Wow! I'm so glad your weekend went well. So, the \"dress rehearsal\" went well... now, when is the main event? Sept. or Oct., I'm thinking... GREAT photo, BTW! I am SO happy that this is your last week of rads (and not a minute too soon, from the sound of your skin). After today, only 3 to go! Have a good one, Gems! Paula",

Like Kris, mine is heaviest along the sideburn area, but I also have some long babies along the chin line... hope this stuff doesn't get any longer or I'll be able to moonlight as Santa this winter! I had the same thing when I was pregnant with dd, but it went away after I gave birth. My SIL (a 10 year BC survivor) says she experienced the same thing... she still waxes, tho, so guess it won't go away. ARGH! (Kris- I'm like you--afraid to defuzz as it might not come back white and downy... definitely don't want black stubble on my cheeks and chin!) Sitting on ice packs? Brrrrr! Hope the stretching exercises and massages help get your sciatica in check. The piriformis is a deep muscle under the gluts, connects sacrum to femur. Whatever were you doing to aggravate that little baby?? (hmm, maybe I don't wanna know...) Might wanna add some stretching exercises BEFORE you try whatever-it-was again. Your neuropathy is showing up late, but who knows? Mine has been here all along, but I'm actually seeing it subside as time goes on. My restless legs syndrome is going away--don't need to take meds for it any longer. HURRAY!",

Just want to say first how beautiful our bald sisters are! Kimberly, Julie and Vettegal, thanks for sharing your stories and your pictures. Each one them brought tears to my eyes. Your smiles are so inspiring. I hope I have that much courage when my turn comes (which should be about next weekend??). Kimberly- love that mohawk! I loved the symbolism in your bald pic under the style sign. You def. have STYLE, sister! Julie- your shaving party looked like fun (a mohawk, too!). Your support group pic is wonderful and I loved the one with Tyler. Vettegal- You are an inspiration with your take charge attitude. And that dh of yours sounds wonderful... Vetteguy is a keeper! Joan- I am so sorry about your mother. Alzheimer's is such a cruel disease. My thoughts and prayers are with you that you will have the support you need to take care of yourself and see that your mother is taken care of as well. ((Joan)) Welcome to Sunshine99 and Jackieb. This is a great place to come for support and information. Jackieb- so glad to hear you have a good support system and a terrific boss! Jenn51- thanks for sharing the inspiration from your email. I printed it off to keep it with me. Happy, happy Birthday tomorrow! Diane63- glad to hear the side effects are subsiding. Diane63 and Dana- it is so unfair that you have to have insurance worries while dealing with your diagnosis and treatment. Cathy came through with some great resources for you. Hope they are helpful. Deb102307- I'm so sorry you missed your treatment. Hope you bounce back quickly and in time to hop back on the train with me next Friday! Vettegal and CHJ- I liked your posts with the poem about yesterday, tomorrow, and today. Funny thing, I was talking with a friend yesterday and she quoted the same poem to me... I publish our church bulletin and I liked it enough to print it there! PALady- glad tx # 2 went well. About the nasal dryness- AYR Nasal Gel (over the counter) is good for that. You can put it around/ in your nostrils with a Qtip as needed. KathyL- here's praying for good blood counts and a discharge from the hospital. I know you'll feel much better at home. I'm thinking of you and your family. WVGirl- I hate that you've had two bad experiences with your port. (((HUGS))) for living with an insensitive male. I hope it was just that he is having some difficulty dealing with your illness. Be thinking of you, my mountaineer sister! And many congrats on having a smart daughter!! DianeB- good to hear from you- hope your treatment side effects are minimal so far!! CathyCA- sounds like your weekend is going okay! Finally, thanks to Mizsissy for stopping in to post and give us such good advice. I have been having some muscle spasms in my lower back (maybe a se of the neulasta?) enough to take a muscle relaxer. Other than that, I am feeling great. DH is still feeling a bit under the weather. It seems to take him a week or so to bounce back after a round of seizures. DD went to her first high school formal dance last night with her boyfriend. It ain't an easy thing to send your 9th grader out with her 10th grader boyfriend with the BRAND NEW driver's license.

It has been a good week. Have been working with ds, getting his portfolio updated for tomorrow's college visit. We have a meeting with the admissions counselor after the tour, so wanted to have everything ready. We're heading north to Fairmont State University this time. A visit to WVU in Morgantown is coming up soon. So, Carla / WVGirl, if you're still reading our thread, I'd sure like to meet you when I come to your neighborhood! Carol- Thank God for the B9 news! I'm so glad (and relieved!). Good to see the update on your friend and the baby. Glad things are going well for them. D1- So, has your dd applied to other schools? She should apply to at least 4... good luck convincing her of that. From what I've read about her here, though, she sure sounds like the kind of student that Vassar would covet (not to mention a lot of other good schools!). I'll continue sending good vibes that she gets an early acceptance letter! Julie- lay low this weekend and heal quickly! Kimberly- hope you've got a rejuvenating weekend in store. I'm feeling a bit out of my groove at work, too. I really believe in the whole \"chemo brain\" now... I'll be right in the middle of a lecture and forget a word, or get tongue-tied and have trouble enunciating a word here and there. SO embarrassing! Kathy and Joan- congrats on going topless! It is strange at first, but you'll get used to it. I've been experimenting with adding a little gel to mine to spike it up a bit. A couple of weeks ago it would eventually sag toward the middle and form a peak--ala mohawk... NOT what I had in mind. It's behaving a bit better now, though. I had my sides and neckline trimmed last week and got rid of the facial hair. I'm having some swelling in my breast this week all of a sudden. Noticed it Wednesday... removed my bra and had this huge dent where the boob had swollen over the edges of the bra. I've had to ditch my Vic's Secrets for the sports bras, but still swelling. I think it is related to the clinical training. Lots of lifting, etc... Hope I'm not developing a lymphedema problem at this late stage. Not much going on in the armpit or side... just the boob. I see the onco Tuesday. Got a call from my surgeon last week and will be scheduled for a brain MRI and a PET Scan later this month. A brain MRI? Whoa! Kris- glad the port is gone! BTW, Carol, I'll have my port removed by the surgeon who placed it. Wendy- how great to hear from you. Glad you're doing well. Better catch some shut-eye. We're leaving at 6am... Hope everyone has a wonderful weekend! Paula",

No more swelling in the boob... must've been all the heavy lifting last week? As for my follow-up scans, those are being ordered by my surgeon NOT my onco. The onc is a firm believer in the blood tests and I got orders today for all of the tumor markers. I'll go get those drawn sometime this week--dh and I both saw the onco and our appts were so late that the lab was closed today. I'll be having the port taken out soon. Had major issues getting the danged thing flushed today. Onc says it is time for it to go bye-bye. I'll be calling my surgeon tomorrow to see when I can get that scheduled.  Still have the mammo to schedule for the rad onc and I have my scans on the 24th for the surgeon. Dh has his brain MRI on the same day and then I'll see the surgeon on the 30th and leave right after to take dh to NC to see his neurooncologist at Duke on Oct. 1. Dh's check-up went well also. He's much more alert and \"frisky\" IFYKWIM since changing the trial meds to evenings. Unfortunately, I'm seeing some cognitive changes lately... med related, I hope... He forgot how to use our washer and I had to walk him through it. I almost cried... silly, I know... Double UGH on all the papers to be graded, my teacher Jewels! I did make a nice dent in the grading today as I waited to see the onc. They're so understaffed (short two oncologists) that we always have to wait, so I took my papers. Made the wait seem shorter, I think. Well, Julie and Kimberly, I'm feeling much better about my speech impediment now. Thanks for the belly laughs. Julie- I think we'd all be better off if all the teenaged boys did pass their dicks down... dunno who'd want to collect them, tho!! Kimberly- what a drag that your classes aren't settled yet. Hope the situation gets fixed soon. I've had a few kids drop my class when they learn it isn't all play, but otherwise no changes. Still trying to get a nurse for the other class, but we've got the curriculum covered until then. You asked why I'm having a brain MRI and PET Scans... my surgeon is a young surgical oncologist and tends to be more aggressive with the scans, I think. I'm going with it as long as my insurance doesn't balk. Can't hurt, I guess?! I SO need to drop 15 lb. myself. I weighed in at 140 today. I'm only 5'5\". My diet is okay, but I'm not exercising like I should... I walk, but it is so haphazard... I'll do good for 3-4 days and then skip 3-4... gotta do better. D1- you're looking GOOD sister--give yourself a break! With that said, I DO hear what you're saying. Everytime I look at a picture of myself, I'm startled at the changes in my body... ain't likin' that one little bit! But you are beautiful--you know that, right?! I'm looking at the conference agenda for Washington... there's something going on all the time, but it looks like I can sneak out around 3:30pm on Sunday (9/21) or 8:30pm on Monday (9/22). I'll have about an hour and a half each time. Let me know what you think. I hope one of those times will work for you! KathyL- I bow to your courage, girl--what a great attitude!! Let's hope the 2nd nip surgery is a keeper! You gave me another moment of nostalgia with the dd practicing her reading... So sweet.... Kris- my facial fuzzies were buzzed off with the clippers when I had my ears and neckline trimmed last week. I'll keep you posted on the aftermath! Carol- your weekend is here already?! I'm sending good vibes and all the positive energy I can muster your way for a wonderful weekend. I almost peed myself reading about your visit to the Lover store for boob decorations. What a trip!!! And how like your wonderful self to bring the Jewels along on your voyage--the collage is awesome! Can we have a copy?! Oh darn! I'm bummed to hear that Steph is having a rough time. I'll remember him in my prayers. The college visit last Saturday was nice. The school has a beautiful campus, smaller size (under 10,000), and all the right programs. It might be a good fit for ds. I have former students in the nursing program there and they met us after the tour--gave us some inside \"scoop\" on the college. That was a nice perk for me! Well, didn't mean write a book... It's getting late--better hit the hay... Paula",

They were a bit freaked out by it--lasting so long and all. So, dh's frisky, feel-good days are a thing of the past for a while. It's always somethin'.... Got your pm, D1. I'll send you my phone #s when I finish this post. I'm excited about meeting you. The two times I gave you are the best for me, but if neither of those times works for you, we'll work something else out. We are driving in on Saturday the 20th. The conference starts at 3pm Saturday and ends at 3pm on Tuesday. KathyL- WTG taking care of yourself with the tune-up! Think I could use a few sessions myself. My stress ball is looking a little stressed out from the work-outs I'm giving it! Carol- I got a little teary reading about your dh's gift and message. Lovely! And then you capped it with ds' gift. Your boys done good, girl!  I second D1's observation--you deserve a little bling and all the love that your men have showered on you! Kimberly- I feel your pain with the class chaos. Hope things fall into place for you soon! Got a sweet postcard from my new SP. Thanks for thinking of me! Better hop off of here and get back to the laundry... Take care all, Paula",

The kids had a wonderful leadership academy with lots of fun activities and we got to do a few neat tours (the Capitol and White House, and the usual monument tours). They did a terrific scavenger hunt-type activity on the National Mall. Had 10 stations and took you from the Lincoln Memorial to the Capitol. It took all morning, but was great fun and the kids learned a lot while they were playing. We were supposed to leave yesterday at 2pm, but our little group of 4 (ds, a fellow officer, my wonderful teacher friend and myself) decided to stay in town and do a museum. We chose the National Archives and then took the Metro /bus back to our hotel to leave. So, we headed out around 6pm... not exactly good timing, but we chatted our way through the stop and go traffic. Ran into 2 road construction areas and one car accident and our 6.5 hour trip ended up taking us 9 hours. Crawled into bed around 4am this morning. Got lucky as our students are doing some type of standardized testing at their home schools and I didn't have students this AM, so was able to sleep in. The highlight of my trip was my Sunday visit with D1. Our fearless leader is AWESOME! She is so warm and funny and our visit time just flew by. I loved all the 'cation pics--her dd has quite an eye with the camera. And her girls are just lovely. They looked like they were having a blast together in the pics from Croatia. Oh, and like Joan said, the girl doesn't have an ounce of extra fluff. She's tall, thin and absolutely gorgeous! (As you can tell from the pics) Ds rolled his eyes at our thugg shot, D1! Wish I'd thought to have you stick around to meet him. He was in the lobby just minutes after you left. Dh and I went to Charleston for our tests today. His and hers brain MRIs... LOL. I also had a PET Scan, blood work (tumor markers) and got my baseline mammo done (was dreading it, but it wasn't bad at all). D1- YAHOO on your sister's NED! What a relief!! Carol- it was so good to talk with you last week. Love the new pics you posted. CathyCA- another exotic vacation. Wonderful! Hope you'll be sharing some pics for us. KathyL- that \"me time\" is so important. Glad you're fitting it in where you can. Your experience at dd's open house made me smile. Kimberly- so, are things settling down at work? Sending lots of good vibes for your teacher colleague. It has to be sickening to watch an innocent person being destroyed by false accusations... Well, off to finish the laundry....",

I have the radiology reports from my brain MRI (clear!) and the PET Scan (shows some areas of slightly increased activity in the right axillary nodes and around the aorta... recommends another scan in a couple of months)... Well, then... we'll see what the doc sez tomorrow on that one. Hopefully, he won't be concerned and will be willing to take my port out before the end of the year. After my appointment, dh and I head to Duke. I have his rad. report as well and it shows more decrease in the size of his tumors... according to the report, it looks like we may be down to only ONE tumor left! Hopefully Wednesday's visit should confirm that good news. Things are really hectic right now at work. Didn't help that I was out 2 days last week and will be out again 2 days this week.

What I really need is a clone... So, things are quiet around here... looks like all is well in Jewel Land. D1- so, gearing up for another trip, eh? How cool that you and your sisters will be working together--what a neat experience! Make sure to pack your camera along with the insect repellant. I'm taking your advice and getting a consult for LE from my surgeon tomorrow. At the very least, I need to get some decent bras for my poor mismatched girls... Carol- sorry to hear that Zach's progress report wasn't acceptable. Hopefully, he'll buckle down and bring those grades up before the end of the term!  So, you have a sick pup? Hope Schatzie is feeling better! Julie- an endoscopy... well, we do what we hafta do, right? I should be back online before your test, but I'll wish you well now, just in case. I'm sending all my positive vibes your way! Kimberly- thanks for the link to the Sutter article-- great write-up and loved your pic. (like Carol said, we Jewels wear our pixie dos well, don't we?!) Thanks for the update on Sherry. Norma- I enjoyed the article about your survivor group-- what a neat name \"Linked by Pink.\" Thanks for sharing the link. Hope everyone has a good week.

Carla- are you snowed in up in Mo-town? Stay warm and safe! D1 and Norma- I used some of my \"free day\" to work with ds on his scholarship essays.There's a scholarship for children of parents affected by BC (awards up to $2,000 renewable).  Here's the link: http://www.maryellenlocherfoundation.org/ D1- I'm not an expert by any means, but I believe that your counseling experience is typical.

Julie- thanks for keeping the Jewels reunion in our minds. I don't get out of school until June 10th (maybe later if we have a lot of snow days) and will be taking my students to a conference in Nashville from June 23-27. So who is going to plan this grand soiree for us? CathyCA- Ah! So, you're all cozy in your room after your first 20 miles. I loved reading your report-- it sounds like a wonderful experience. Best wishes to you and your team! Ed had his MRI this afternoon. We'll pick the CD up and travel to Duke Monday. Praying for some beautiful tumor-free images-- if you'll remember, he was down to one distinct tumor 2 months ago.

So, hopefully you got good reports from head to toe. I hear you on the short do. Get lots of compliments, but then again I was bald six months ago, so I guess anything is an improvement over that, huh? D1- I sure hope the Megace works for you. Remember, all those side effects have to be listed if even one person reports having them. Keep us posted... Carol- I'm bummed to read the latest on Steph. Cancer SUCKS!!!   Julie- we've come a looonnng way in 2008, haven't we? I'm happy-dancing with you on being alive and reasonably healthy... hmmm, wonder what UNreasonably healthy would look like... Donna- I'm so sorry you didn't get good news on your PET scan. I'll chime in with LJ and Kathy. The tricky thing about getting these scans is there are so many false positives. I'll be praying that your markers and CT will r/o a recurrence. The whole recurrence thing is pretty scary, isn't it? ((HUG)) Hang in there! My PET scan in Sept. showed a nodule on my liver. My surgeon was very matter-of-fact about it--called me NED and didn't even mention the liver (I got the report and learned that little tidbit myself). I'll have tumor markers in Jan. and a PET in March. Until then, I'm trying not to borrow trouble. BUT, speaking of borrowing trouble... I found a lump in my right axilla yesterday. When I raised my arm it appeared that the skin was retracting right where the lump is...and it is painful (which is new). So, I called my surgeon this morning and managed to get my mammo (due anyway) and an ultrasound this afternoon. A friend of mine works at the rad facility and they treated me well-- even got to talk to the radiologist, who believes it is just a lymph node that is hardened from the rads. I'll see my surgeon Monday for his take, but I feel much better after seeing the pictures-- it doesn't look anything like my tumor from last year. So, I cried this morning when I asked my buddies at work to cover for me this afternoon so I could get my mammo... and I cried this evening after I got the initial findings... I am usually not given to tears. I can't remember ever shedding a tear with my initial diagnosis, although I've shed many for dh. And I'm not on any hormones, D1. Got figure... Happy weekend to all. We've got about 4 inches of snow here. It will be a bit chilly putting the outdoor decorations up, but I'm gonna do it anyway! Paula",

Now if those pesky cysts would just go away... Insurance companies can be such a PITA, can't they? I hope you'll contact them and appeal their denial on the bone density. It may be that the onc's office didn't present it with the right codes...  My surgeon has suggested having my ovaries out, even though I'm triple negative and my tumor didn't feed on the hormones.... I guess I'm at higher risk of getting a tumor that is hormone receptor positive as well as another triple neg.  I'm not feeling so panicky about my lump since I saw my mammo and US. I'm a little embarrassed at how much I freaked at the possibility of a recurrence. Sheesh!

She has an online business that is just terrific.

Here's the link:  http://www.howtv.tv/index.html (BTW, Carol, if you love my accent, you'll get a real kick out of Pam's!)  Carla- nice to hear that dh is making some positive changes. I second the suggestion that now might be a good opportunity to get into some marriage counseling. Good luck!  Kimberly: leave it to you to give us homework!

I've never been to Vegas and I don't mind walking. Don't care about the gambling. My only experiences w/ gambling are a couple of visits to the dog track and on a cruise, so I'm too green to feel comfortable throwing out money-- although I did have fun at the slots! I'm more interested in the pool and the spa. I'm just praying that dh responds to this treatment and things improve... I know that his prognosis isn't good, though. So, even though I'm planning for Vegas, I don't know if I'll be able to come.  We see the oncologist tomorrow for bloodwork, then chemo on Thursday. I'll be looking for an opportunity to discuss hospice with his onc, but I just can't do it in front of Eddie. If the onc thinks it is time, then we'll talk about it. Or rather, I'll talk and he won't be able to tell me how he feels... F#$% CANCER! Sorry for the blue mood-- it just popped up out of nowhere. Thought I'd throw myself a little pity party and get it off my chest. Think I'd better break out the jelly beans again! I just took a lorazepam, so maybe the brain will shut down and I can sleep here in a bit. Good thing I don't have to get up early!",

Yesterday I took dh to sign papers for chemo, get blood work and see the neurologist. We have a wonderful neurologist who is always straightforward and honest with us. This was our first visit to him since Ed's last tumors popped up in Nov. He encouraged us to talk w/ the onc. about dh's prognosis and how much time we could expect to gain from continuing chemo so that we could make an informed decision. It was a bit emotional for both of us...  We had a discussion about this last summer when his cancer recurred. Even made preliminary funeral plans (for both of us). But, even though we were somewhat prepared, it was still very difficult to think about stopping. Dh took it very seriously and told me last night that he wanted to stop (as best he could anyway, given his limited communication). At this point, lemme just say THANK YOU to Carol for letting me vent to you yesterday. I was still reeling from this change of plans when you popped up to chat on FB... I'm not ready for him to quit--from a medical standpoint OR as his wife. I don't have any illusions that this chemo will cure him, but I believe it might arrest things for a while and hopefully help him regain his speech. IMO, it is worth continuing at least until we get the next MRI in mid-February and discuss this with our oncologist. I told him all of this before he laid down for a nap yesterday, but he was still adamant about not continuing. And I was quite upset, but ultimately I would have supported his decision.  Thankfully, he awakened with a much more positive outlook and has agreed to give it a shot. So, we went for chemo today. We'll have another one in 2 weeks and see the oncologist to discuss his prognosis and make the decision about whether to continue.  Got a call from hospice this afternoon (onc. made the referral yesterday). There isn't a lot that we need as far as nursing care, meds, etc. But I think we could all benefit from the grief counseling. They'll be in touch with me tomorrow to let me know what they can offer. Sorry this is so long... it is amazing how much it helps just to share what's happening with the Jewels! I'll be back to catch up on the posts in a bit... Paula ",

Your dd's school is fortunate to have parents like you. Unless you work on one of these projects, you just don't realize how much work goes into it. Good for you on dropping one of those remaining pesky #s! Not that you need to lose weight, though. I've seen you in person--I felt positively dumpy standing next to you (check out the pic on FB and you'll see what I mean!) As for our LV trip, I agree that it would be better handled privately-- better to be safe. Julie's FB group will be a good place to discuss this and those who don't want to go to the FB world could be kept up-to-date through PMs here or via email, I suppose. Haven't heard any other suggestions. Any other Jewels want to weigh in on this? I'll be home tomorrow and would be willing to investigate excursions, if anyone is interested (I know Joan and I are, at least). We were able to get a limo to the beach in CA and to Six Flags in TX for less than the cost of a tour... might be fun to look into that!  Deb- Oh, goody! I won't be alone in rooting for the Cards (sorry, Patty!) Carla- Glad the tooth trauma turned out to be an easy fix. It makes me laugh every time I see Vegas and virgin in the same sentence! Too bad we are on different ends of the state... would be nice to fly out together.  Wendy- another Jewel in FBland. We're building up quite a group over there. Weren't you on a clinical trial with Avastin? How many doses did you have?  Julie- I enjoyed your FB pics. Your son is so handsome! And y'all have some serious snow removal equipment on the farm, don't you? Your puppies looked like they enjoyed the snow-- they are really growing!   Patty- hope the sun was shining on your world today. Super Bowl Sunday is almost here-- hope you're able to enjoy it. ((Hug)) Dh and ds are rooting for your team, BTW!  Therese- LOL, another perk to the new vehicle-- it fits in the garage! Carol- I love my Blackberry, too! Dh is awake... time to go administer some Zofran and TLC! ",

Julie is right-- there aren't any viruses caused BY Facebook, but Kathy is correct that there are viruses connected with it (and tons of other misc. websites out in cyberspace). The Facebook related viruses usually getcha through email. In other words they \"phish\" out your info, send you an email with a link that looks like it comes from FB, but it actually is the virus... (there's a virus out now called \"Koobface\")  To protect yourself on any social networking site (incl. this one), your personal information should be kept private (emails, address, phone #, etc). On FB, click on settings and change the security settings so that only your friends can access whatever you want to share.  Also, look up Facebook Security and look at your Search settings. You need to control how much info people get when they search for you. I don't mind my pic and name showing, but I don't want people who search for me to be able to look at my friends list (which invades their privacy).  I also turned off all email notifications. When I log onto FB, I always get the notifications I would have gotten via email anyway, and I didn't like all the extra email clutter. That way, I don't have to worry about clicking on an email link that isn't really from FB. I'm sure I'm forgetting other important security details. Julie, can you add to this? And I expect LJ would be able to give us come valuable input on privacy-- in fact, I doubt that we'd catch our Jewel with the lovely hand anywhere near FB-- am I right, LJ? (I say this with the utmost respect, LJ, b/c I would truly love your advice to those of us who choose to venture into this realm) For that matter, anyone else who is savvy, chime in please!  ",

      "Content": "Mar 9, 2008 10:21AM - edited Mar 9, 2008 10:22AM by RN2teach Good morning, Jewels! I am home from HOSA State Leadership Conference. Our kids were terrific and scored big in their competitions. There were 600 competitors from all over WV, competing in 70 events. We brought home 10 Gold, 8 Silver, and 2 Bronze Medals. In all 32 of 55 students placed (several medals were for teams, like my CPR/first aid team of 2). My ds earned a Gold in his team competition- they made a public service announcement on school safety. We also had 3 students elected as state officers-ds was elected state reporter. I think this will be a good experience for my lazy boy-he has so much untapped potential (as do most teens, I guess!). The awards ceremony ended with a farewell from the 2007-08 officers-one of our students was state pres. She gave her speech last and ended it with a tribute to me that was so touching that I sobbed! Judging from the sniffs I could hear behind me, I wasn't alone-my principal sat beside me and HE even teared up! She started by saying that she believed that God didn't give anyone more than they could handle, said I was the strongest person she had ever met, and thanked me for my positive influence. She then talked about my battle with breast cancer and ended by saying that she wanted me to know that I was not alone, that all of my students were behind me in this battle and would be walking the Komen and Relay4Life in my honor. As if that wasn't enough to ruin what was left of my makeup, I received a standing ovation from the whole conference delegation. I can't describe how wonderful (and humbling) that felt. I have a lot to catch up on (I've MISSED you all!). I'll be back later after I read all the posts... just had to share my joy w/ my favorite gems. Paula",

      "Content": "Mar 9, 2008 03:06PM - edited Mar 9, 2008 03:12PM by RN2teach I'm back! Took a while to catch up with you chatty Gems. Carol- HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! Your trip to AZ sounds wonderful. Glad you're getting the le sleeve. We post grades online here as well. Mine are currently 2 weeks behind d/t chemo and the conference. We are supposed to update them once weekly... You've already gotten all the advice you need about approaching the teacher. Glad to hear that ds is up from an F to a C in Spanish. I def. would be concerned if you don't see more assignments posted for him... you KNOW they've got to be doing them... where are they? Busy work-an assignment that doesn't get graded-is frowned upon in the education system today. Just stay positive and focus on what ds needs to be successful and how to accomplish that. D1- thanks for sharing your sister's teaching story-what a SHERO! Your rads guy is certainly preparing you for every eventuality. I prefer to know it all-the good, the bad, and the ugly-and then do my best to beat the odds on those se's. I think you are wise to be aggressive in the weeks ahead at getting a grip on the le and preparing your skin as much as you can for the coming trauma of rads. I'll be taking notes on your journey, since I will be there in a few months. And, ditto what Kathy said about the burns. BTW, what about leg as an acronym for your le specialist? (leg = le guru)   le foreplay-how funny! \u2018bout that book... I think we should do a Jewels book... \"Jewels for our Journey\" or something like that. Our own little \"Chick Soup\" type book for BC survivors. There is a lot of talent in the Jewels gene pool. Maybe each of us could do a chapter (or much more for the more prolific writers like Kimberly and you). I believe I could contribute a chapter to a Jewels book and I know others of us could do the same, whether funny, inspiring, encouraging, etc. Whatcha think? Oh, and I like your curfew incentive. The car keys aren't such an issue here as my SIL who lives \"round the bend\" from us works at ds and dd's high school. Hope you and college girl have a great week! KathyL- I'll add my \"sorry\" that you were unable to make Wendi's memorial service. Glad you took the cautious route-don't want you back in the hosp.! We have been blessed with a well-stocked freezer, too, thanks to our friends and family. I love the Daddy Dance... bet pics from that would be beautiful! Sheshe- sound like your new doc is on top of your tx-glad he's taking note of your possible le. Also good to here that you're feeling better. Dana- listen to Kathy: take care of yourself! LOL at the All U can eat buffet! I had an appetite increase after tx 1, but it didn't return after tx 2. (Taste buds kinds disappeared and took the appetite w/ them) One thing I have noticed is that I have to eat small freq. meals/ snacks because it eases the queasiness and discomfort of an empty stomach. Kimberly- good info on the Tamoxifen-I'm not shocked... I haven't researched that since I'm tri-neg and won't be on ht. NCLB... the bane of many a teacher. It affects me less than most as I'm a career-tech teacher (in my world we aren't perceived as \"real\" teachers). The NCLB counterpart for us is Perkins, which is threatened every year at budget time. I hate the whole teach to the test mentality that prevails w/ NCLB. I could go on and on.... CathyCA- my ds drives dh's '90 Ranger (works out well since dh can no longer drive). He did have access to our Stratus until he got a speeding ticket last year... going 83 mph! I also withhold the gas money if the grades aren't acceptable... we do what we have to do! Vettegal- good to see your posts-means you're feeling better! I didn't know your mother was in treatment also. ((((Hugs))) to both of you. I'm so glad you're getting so many thoughtful gifts lately. I know that is giving you a much needed boost! LOL at vetteguy's \"free hanging\" vision... \u2018fraid mine would be more like \"free falling\" Deb1023- good to be done w/ the red devil, huh? Looks like we're starting Taxol together this Friday. Hope dp had a nice memorial service for her mother. Canaan Valley/ Seneca Rocks/ Spruce Knob is a beautiful hiking, birdwatching, skiing area in the Northeastern part of WV. Lots of interesting shops in the area. WVgirl- LOL for the pens in the dishwasher! I've done a few goofy things like that lately I'm not looking forward to the extra decadron b4 this treatment. (With AC the only steroid I got was thru the IV). I'm curious that your onco stopped the Neulasta since I took mine all thru AC... Peg- ok, so you're ½ through w/ your chemo now. The light is farther away but it is still getting closer every day! Tinalee- thanks for the input on Taxol... I'm taking notes! LJ- what a great onco to drop by for a visit while you're in chemo! Julie- thinking of you and praying that the se's from this round are very mild. Jenn51- I'm thrilled that you have access to free PT!! Good for you! Therese- congrats on being finished w/ chemo! Time for a nap... gotta catch up w/ my beauty sleep. Paula",

I know what you mean about the morning routine-I'm all about low maintenance and mornings are def. easy now! Jenn- thanks for the tip on beliefnet. I'll be checking that out. Hope you got some of that chicken yesterday. D1- sounds like your dd had a GREAT day on the court. Kudos to her for being an A-1 team player. OMG, your dh (and Julie's, too) sounds like mine. I'm a tree hugger married to Mr. Chainsaw Massacre. Our house is nestled between two hills, so of our 3 acres we have about an acre of usable land. Unfortunately, dh's idea of getting more acreage is to chop down every tree in sight. I don't think the word \"pruning\" is in his vocabulary.  Oh yeah, I've had my own little bladder control thing going on w/ this cough (thank God it is almost completely gone). I've been doing my Kegel's more often, that's for sure! Julie- I'd say you deserved a sleep in after your ordeal w/ the migraine. I'm so glad you're feeling better. Kimberly- welcome back! I'm glad you caught the boob trouble early and hope it resolves w/o a hitch now that you're on abx. I should have guessed that our writer would see the value of our journey and save the Jewels posts for posterity-way to go. Carol- ummmm a facial AND a massage-what a treat!!! Deb- I am still having bone and muscle pain (spasms, too), but I feel better today than yesterday. I seem to have been spared from the worst of the finger/toe problems. The tips of my fingers were really sore Saturday, but that went away pretty quickly. Sheshe- glad you found a place for the bridal shower that is going to allow you to relax and enjoy the event w/o worrying about the details. I hope you get good results from your bone scan on Friday. CHJ- good to \"see\" you again. Man, I can't imagine trying to sell a house in the midst of what you're going thru. I know what you mean about responding to the \"how are you?\" question. That's what I love about the Jewels-we can whine if we want to and know that we will be understood and supported. BTW, I remember seeing a pic of you in your wig and I thought you looked nice! I do understand the self-consciousness, tho... I never got used to my wig and resorted to hats and scarves instead. Glad you and dh were able to unwind w/ a little sangria yesterday. Dana- glad to see you're keeping your feisty spirit, girl! CathyCa- this is the perfect time of year to celebrate life and renewal, isn't it? Happy New Year to you, too! KathyL and Maz- be thinking of you two as you head to the chemo lounge tomorrow. Hope everything goes well for you both, and happy LAST chemo, Kathy!! Time to go get my jammies on and get ready to watch the girls dance on DWTS. I'm on the fence w/ the guys... guess my fav. would be Jason Taylor-those football players make sexy dancers... Wow-this post is really long... sorry \u2018bout that. Catch you later, Gems! Paula",

Stayed at school this evening to help some of my students with scholarship applications and essays. I think I'm just about over the first-round Taxol se's-woke up pain-free this morning and just a little achy this evening. Still uncomfortable enough to need something for pain to help me sleep tonite, though. I dislike taking pills, but I dislike pain more LOL Carol- watch out for those low-flying squirrel feeders. Had to chuckle at that one. I've done some research on the time interval bet. chemo and rads-2-4 weeks is the recommended time frame, with most places preferring the 4 week span. My rad onco has already indicated he wants to wait 4 weeks but I'm going for 2 and my onco is behind me if I'm healthy at the end of chemo. Of course, I have an ulterior motive (my students' trip to Dallas) or I'd prob. give myself 4 weeks to recuperate b4 rads... Tinalee- You have some awesome coworkers-what a great idea to do a chili fundraiser. One of the men I work with has the same response as your brother-my baldness disturbs him. Our school is all career-tech ed, so our students return to their high schools at the end of the day and we all have planning time together. I usually take my topper off and run around bald during this hour. Just noticed yesterday that the poor fella can't look me in the eye when I don't have my head covered. Maz- I'm so very, very sorry that your bf has cancer with a poor prognosis. I hope that she is able to tell you herself soon. I also pray that you and she will be able to support each other through your illnesses. Remember that those terrible statistics are just that-numbers. Although they may be pretty accurate, they can't predict every outcome. (Reference my dh whose brain cancer comes with a dismal prognosis-he has outlived his prognosis by 16 months so far). I hope you two have time together to celebrate your friendship and come to terms with what is happening to both of you. I'm thinking of you and praying for you both. D1- hey! I don't drink it anymore, but we call it \"pop\" here instead of soda. Hope you had a good day traveling to see college girl. Therese- sister, don't hold back when you need to unload those negative feelings! One of the reasons the Jewels is so special is that we are always here to support each other thru the good AND the bad. When some of us are down, there is always someone with the right words to help us through. Fear of the unknown is a powerful thing, isn't it? It takes a lot of energy to stay positive-esp. when you are just finished w/ treatment and there's so much negative stuff out there about tri-neg. breast cancer. Just keep telling yourself that you found it early, it has been treated aggressively and you're going to be monitoring closely for any recurrence. Have you talked to your onco about how he/she plans to monitor you? Mine was very supportive and made me feel much better about my \"after-game plan\"-he's all for aggressive monitoring, thank God! I'm glad you were able to get out and enjoy the lovely day w/ your family-hope it was a spirit booster! KathyL and CarolC-yeehaw! Two more Jewels finished w/ chemo!!!! LJ13- Bravo! You said it so well-there's no such thing as a good cancer. I liked your post the first time you wrote it and I enjoyed reading it again. THANKS Kris- haven't \"seen\" you around for awhile. Glad you're okay. Thanks for the rads article link-very interesting. Kimberly- \"right now at this moment is known. That's the focus\" AMEN, sister! Vettegal- give that sweet Vetteguy a hug from the Jewels. I'm so glad you have him in your life! I will definitely have Denise in my prayers tomorrow. We've had a rainy day here too-even a little thunder and lightning. Good sleeping weather... CHJ- Glad you're feeling better. Happy Spring! I lost all my spring bulbs to dh. He needed a project last fall-was getting stir crazy looking for things to do around the house. Not being able to work has been really hard on him. Anyway, I gave him permission to redo the foundation plantings around the house...I was thinking clean-up and add some new things... he uprooted every single thing planted-including my bulbs. Julie- sounds like you had a great day at school today. Aren't those visits from old students terrific? You've obviously been a wonderful role model for her-way to go! Dana- HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY, LW!  LJ, Donna, Tinalee- be thinking of you all tomorrow as you hit the chemo lounge. Jenn- is this the LAST chemo for you? Yeah!!! The rain is coming down steadily here... sounds so soothing. Nite, gems! Paula",

I worked concessions, which was a blessing b/c it was only around 45 with a wicked wind. We've been watching some hoops, too. Of course, we were all thrilled about WV's win over Duke (Yeah, baby!). Deb1023- I hate that you're having such a hard time with the T part of our chemo. I wish I could take a little of your pain and give you a break! (just a little, mind you, I'm not a martyr) I sure hope you get a break from the se's and are able to recover for round 2 (are we on together for Friday again?) I am just about over the se's of round 1. I had quite a bit of pain until Thursday and then I could tell it was easing up. I had the neuropathy thing just a little on Sat/Sun and that went away. My onco told me that if I had severe se's (esp. severe neuropathy) he would switch my chemo plan.  Kathy- hope you're recovered enuf to enjoy this Easter with your babies. Therese- have a good Easter with your young-uns, too. Vettegal- Patty from PA. Nice to put a name to your sweet face! D1- you doing okay? Kimberly and Carol- ship some of that sunshine east, will ya? Carol- speaking of shipping, I got the coolest pin in the mail yesterday. Guess I won't wear that to Easter services this AM, tho... hahaha To all the Jewels laid low by chemo se's (((HUGS))). Feel better soon! We are going to church this morning and then to mom's for dinner. So hoping the sun will shine here today as I'll prob. need a walk after mama's feast. Paula",

Yep, I shed my hat and went \"topless\" in church. ...just for a little while until the ac kicked in and my bald head started feeling chilly. Dinner at Mom's was wonderful and we brought home all the leftovers as she and her dh are headed to NC to see my two ds and their families. I would have loved to go with them, but dd has appts w/ orthodontist and eye dr this week, ds has 3 ballgames... and then there's that pesky chemo appt on Friday (this is #6-- 2nd round of Taxol). CathyCA- wishing you a smooth chemo experience today. Another one bites the dust for you! Vettegal- I hope your family adapted well to your baldness and you had a good Easter dinner. I hear you on the sandals--although I've GOT to get a good pedicure b4 I shed my socks. We had snow flurries yesterday. This week looks like rain, rain, rain, but s'posed to warm up. I really do love spring--everything coming back to life, etc.--but I am sooo ready for summer temps! Kimberly- hope you had fun w/ the egg hunt. This is the first year that I didn't do Easter baskets. My kids both have big ticket items that they are working toward and wanted me to contribute to their piggy banks instead of spending it on their baskets. It was kind of a let-down for me, but they were happy so I went with it. Tinalee--whoa! 4-6\" of the white stuff for Easter. So, did you build an Easter snowbunny? D1- glad you have been out having fun. Good 4 you! Peg- I know you're disappointed about having a couple of extra rounds of chemo (who among us wouldn't be??), but I like your attitude. You just have to go with it. I'll be hitting the chemo lounge with you this Friday.    Carol- that dry mouth thing is still plaguing you, eh? Mine is still there, but much, much better. I'm thinking the cytoxan was the culprit, which explains why mine is going away. Reckon a little corona would help?   Julie- you sound so good! I'm glad you're feeling well. Sounds like you kept the roads hot yesterday visiting your family. Hope you're not too tired today. Deb- I hope those se's continue to abate this week so that you can stay on schedule. I am SO ready to be done with this. You'll be in my prayers. Maz- you and Val are in my thoughts and prayers every day! Have a good Monday everyone. I'll be at the ballfield later to watch ds play. Hope it warms up some... Paula",

I'm very sorry that your family has been burdened so much. I hope we'll \"see\" Denise here sometime soon. Would love to share some Jewel Joy with her.  PaLady- glad you had a good time in Vegas. I hope those tootsies are feeling better. How was your rads sim sesson? Joan- A big YIPPEE that you were able to taste your Easter feast! I'm glad you and your family were able to visit with your mother. I would be excited about finishing up with chemo next week, too. That is a milestone to celebrate! Deb- well, I'm sorry to lose my chemo buddy, but I think you and your onco made a wise choice--slows things down a bit, but worth the wait if it prevents permanent neuropathy. You've been w/o hair for 3 years? I hope I'm not being too nosey, I just assumed your hair loss was recent... Again, forgive me if I'm overstepping by asking about it. Thanks for the thoughts on courage. I really liked that! Kimberly- I like your idea. I imagine my kids will enjoy the egg hunts in a few years. Right now they're in those awkward teen years where they don't want to be associated w/ anything child-like. They are so easy to embarrass. Sometimes I just can't resist doing something silly when we're out in public to get them going (like skipping through the mall). KathyL- I'm happy to hear that your Easter went well. You and dh definitely deserve a night out--those are rare enough w/ little ones, let alone adding BC tx to the mix. On the Powerball, remember you gotta play to win! I haven't played in years, but we could sure use the money. My dh's unexpected disability 2 years ago really shocked our budget. He is on SS, which brings in $60,000 less a year than what he was making as an electrician for AEP. We've kept his benefits, but AEP disability is only giving him a whopping $17 a month... so much for working 29 years for the company w/o EVER taking a sick day until he had the seizure and they found his brain tumor. Jenn- rest well and feel better soon! D1- you inspire me to pick up my exercise pace. I've gotten terribly lazy this winter. I've been walking, but not much else. Dana- I like your avatar pic. LOL at losing the hair down there... it happens. Mine just thinned out. I'm still waiting to see what Taxol is going to do to my hair. I still have eyelashes and eyebrows and I have some stubble that appears to be growing on the head... I guess this weekend will tell the story. Carol- glad you got an extra day on 'cation and get to fly home FC. Three cheers for your dh! Tina- you are sooo good! I've not been much on sweets w/ chemo, but a good homemade cake would take some willpower to resist. WVgirl- hope AC is kind to you this week. Took me about a week to get over each treatment. Not looking forward to all this neuropathy stuff w/ the T... hope it passes me by! CathyCA- LOL at your church story. Wishing you a se-free day. I was awakened at 6am this morning by the sounds of heavy equipment working just outside my window. It is a joyful sound, considering that equipment is working to install water lines so us country bumpkins can finally get public water! That is still months away--they have to get water to all the families on the main road (holler) first and we live on a hollow that branches off of that one. The reason they are out here today has something to do with the stream crossing and having to get the lines in before the minnows spawn in April. That's news to me as I am not a fisherperson, but at least the DNR is on my side--means we can have our lines run and be ready to go when they get to us later this year (hopefully). It's taken me almost an hour to catch up. Gotta go get ready and take dd to the orthodontist and then the mall (she can't pass up an opportunity to shop). Catch you gems later, Paula",

I really shouldn't be having coffee-last thing I need right now is a dose of caffeine on top of Decadron. But I'm having it anyway! I haven't had to avoid it with Taxol like I did w/ AC. I drink Gevalia coffee-highly recommend it if you're a java connoisseur. PALady- how are the toes doing? Hope they're recovered from Vegas! I see you're starting rads next week. I'm having 25 treatments, too. I'll have the whole boob irradiated in all 25 and the last 7-8 I'll also have an extra zap to the tumor bed. Is that your treatment plan? Jenn- I am so very sorry to read that your friend isn't doing well. I'll be praying for him and his family and for YOU as well. It can't be easy to see someone losing their battle with cancer while you're in the middle of fighting your own. Wow, they actually capped your well? We aren't being forced to change to city water, but I will definitely be signing up. Our water tastes good and passes all the public health tests, but something about the salt filtration is eating up our faucets and I figure if it's doing that to the pipes it can't be good to drink!  Anyway, we have to run our own lines to the meter. When we do that, we'll run lines from the well to the outside taps so we can use it for watering flowers, washing cars, filling up the pool, etc. No use paying the city for that kind of thing. Sheebas- hey there, Judy! I have been worried about you, girl. I'm bummed that you're having a hard go of it since your last chemo. I'm one of the ones with the wicked cough for about 6 weeks. There were a couple of weeks there where it was almost constant in the evenings and at night-had to sleep in the recliner and turned to whiskey to get some relief. (It is nasty, but it worked). I'll be adding special prayers for you, my friend. Keep us posted on Monday's appointment when you get the chance. Sheshe- whoa! Sure glad you spotted the problem w/ your picc and got it treated. I'm praying that that's the end of that story as far as infection goes! Kathy- you're not a bad mommy, just a tired mommy! Ditto what Kimberly said-SHERO! Julie- wishing you NO se's from this round-hey' you deserve a break today (hmm, wasn't that a commercial back in the day?). Hope the dang cough lets up, too. Hmmm, so I sent the cough west and the mucus east... I went thru so many tissues that I boosted the share price for Kleenex. I SWEAR I washed my hands b4 I touched the keyboard! Tina- so, you're getting new boobs for your birthday? There's something to look forward to, eh? Kimberly- sounds like your day at school was a real treat. I know you're missing your students, and they are definitely missing you. I can imagine your sunny smile and positive attitude in the classroom-you're the kind of teacher every kid needs! You're off to Tahoe today? Have a wonderful trip! Check in if you can-we're loving these virtual vacations! Kalen- nice to see you! I'm glad the March08 group is a good support for you all. Thanks for the quote at the end of your post-very nice! Carol- watched the hoops last nite as well. My Mountaineers lost, too... Happy golfing today! Dana and WVgirl- race you for the best chairs in the chemo suite today! Peg and Vettegal- I'll pick up the tab since this is your last round! ds has a ballgame this evening (weather permitting). I'll try to check in tonight and let you know how round 2 of Taxol went-I'm on alert for that whole reaction thing many of you experienced w/ this round. CU Later, Paula",

Julie- Praying for you, sister--may the se's stay AWAY! Hope dh is faring well with the boys. That was really sweet of him to arrange a treat for your son. Give that man a pat on the back! Tina- I'm so sorry that your friend has BC. I know that you will be such a good support for her. I'll be praying for the two of you. Oh yeah, girl: play the chemo card on that late charge! LOL at the perky boobs-I know what you mean about the 20s version of my ta-tas not fitting w/ my 46 yo body. but, hey, I wouldn't mind to roll the clock back a decade or so--say b4 breastfeeding.

Dana- thanks for the scriptures, prayers, and the victim/survivor post! I'm so glad you're tolerating your treatments well and staying active. Peg- What a nice treat for you and your son to have a regular breakfast outing! Vettegal- yikes! you had a bad day in the chemo lounge. (I hope you didn't tip the bartender) I'm glad that you don't have to do THAT again-congrats on being finished with chemo!! CHJ- rest well in the fog, love. Hope that the mist rises quickly and you can enjoy the sunny side of life again soon! PALady- Remember to pamper the skin on your breast during your radiation treatments. I have a BC survivor friend who had rads last year and she had very little skin irritation. Her secret was applying Aquaphor generously 4 times a day to the breast and armpit area. Jenn- hope the steak and bloomin' onion was delish-love Outback! I got my dd's \"old\" iPod-she got one w/ more gigs at Christmas. She d/l iTunes on my computer and trained me well. I didn't realize how many CDs we had until I started transferring them. Took me days to get them all uploaded, but it was worth it. I have 1,000 songs on the iPod (go figure that dd needed more space). Kathy- the big boy bed... ah, does that bring back sweet memories. Hope he sleeps well in the new bed. You are so good with the weekly schedules-thanks so much! CathyCA- good insight on the cancer phenomenon-makes sense. D326- best wishes to you. Being a single mom is enough of a challenge w/o adding BC to the mix-I'm glad you have a good support system. Paula",

Ed's sister is going to be here with him in the morning, so I'll be able to skip coming home for lunch tomorrow. (we live about 5 miles from my school) Kathy- bring your man to Vegas with you!

You still have a tube inserted, but only into the rectum to instill gas (air, if you will) into the colon so that it can be seen on CT. IF you were found to have polyps, you'd have to undergo a regular colonoscopy to have them removed. Also, because of the expense, many insurances don't cover this. But it is considered equally effective in screening for cancer, according to the medical profession. I found this article on the New England Journal of Medicine website:   http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/357/14/1403 Took a look at Ed's MRI last night. The swelling hasn't subsided at all, which isn't good... so, all the danged steroids are doing is increasing his appetite. He's eating constantly and has put on a good 10 lb. in the past few weeks. He's already a big boy (230 lb)... As for the tumors, they're still there. To my untrained eye, maybe a little worse. Not a lot of difference between the two scans, though. We'll get the official results on Monday. I hate Friday scans!  ",

I see the rad. onco. today and have my MUGA scan. I start chemo Friday (dose dense AC x 4 followed by Taxol x 4). I am an RN but I haven't worked in the hospital for 12 years now (except for summers and holidays). I am blessed with the perfect job (with the best boss and coworkers in the universe). I teach a program called Health Occupations in the public school system. My students are juniors and seniors in high school who will be our future health care providers. I train them to enter the healthcare system at the entry level and help them prepare for entrance exams and get ready for college. On the down side, I was to start taking my nursing assistant students to the hospital for clinicals at the end of January. On the plus side, there are two of us RNs doing clinicals and we have other specialty areas that work with preceptors. So, I will take all the students who are training in the other specialties (dental, vet, radiology, p.t., etc) and the other nurse will take the nursing assistant students to the hospital and nursing home for training. My coworkers came into my room at the end of the day yesterday and gave me a card with $250 that they collected for me to use for wigs, gas, whatever. What a boost that was!",

CarolC- glad things are working out for you, girl! Carol (golfer)- great pic! Welcome Judy and CHJ. Maz- sounds like you are doing great, esp given that you are getting 3 chemo drugs! Julie- thought of you today as I went back to work. I had a good day--hope yours went well. Kathy- thought of YOU this evening when I put on my jammies and kicked back. I'm glad you are getting some down time and hope things continue to go well with your little ones. I can remember when my kids were the ages of yours... (((HUGS))) Sista- Looks like we're on about the same bc poison. My treatment isn't on the list but I am doing DD AC x 4 every 2 weeks, then Taxol x 4 every 2 weeks via port. I am taking Neulasta the day after my treatment as well. My first treatment was 1/18. Next ones are scheduled for 2/1, 2/15, 2/29, 3/14, 3/28, 4/11, 4/25 if all goes well. Dana- hope your onco visit went well today. Cathy-CA- hope your se are minimal! Take care Jewels. You are all in my prayers! Paula",

I SOOOO want to wear it to school for my head shaving!! But... CHJ- I was thinking the same thing as D1.... Friends United by Breast Cancer... Dana- you're still sounding chipper, girl. Sorry about your dud boyfriend. Vettegal- hang in there! Those se will let up soon! Kathy- your Tales of the Boobsie Twins are hilarious. Glad you had fun with that since the rest of your plans didn't work out. PaLady- You can SO do Bald--you are sooo pretty! Kimberly- (((HUGS))) feel better soon SIS! D1- hope you have a good weekend with college girl. Sista2 and D1- my onco told me he would report it as a se, but didn't think it was related to Neulasta... (I like the idea of giving the docs a shot-- bet the list of se would go WAY up!) My spasms hit for 2 days last weekend. Haven't had one since Sunday. All in my lower back and pretty intense while they lasted. I have my 2nd injection tomorrow, so I'll let you know what happens. I think I'm ready to curl up on the couch for the evening. Thanks for all the shout outs today. It is great to know you have my back and you can rest assured that I have yours, too! Hope everyone has a se-free weekend Paula",

As for the hair, mine started falling out on Day 14 (from tx 1). Yesterday I noticed the sore hair syndrome, but it isn't terrible. Really weird to run your hands thru your hair and have hairy fingers, tho! I'm having heavier hair loss every day. My students are in clinicals until Friday... I'm going to try to hold out for my shave, but I dunno if I'll have enuf for a mohawk by Friday! I don't have any leg or armpit hair and the \"muff\" is thinning too... As for the tastebuds, for some reason round 1 didn't bother mine to badly (I actually gained 2 lb. which I was NOT happy about) Round 2 has definitely had an effect on tastes and smells. My sweet Mama's chicken soup (with homemade noodles, no less) smelled horrible to me and I couldn't eat it So I'm 2 lb. heavier and losing my hair, but I'm kicking those BC cells outta this ole' body!

I just got in from my having my Neulasta inj. Did some shopping afterward and picked up a couple of cute hats. Also picked out some yarn to make some caps. I can knit and crochet, so thought I'd give it a try. Carol- I just loved the story of your step-daughter's engagement. How romantic to be given such a special ring! Have fun on the greens this weekend! Jenn- so good to see your posts. I'm sorry you missed out on Celine last night. I, too, am experiencing limited range in my arm (I had a lot less nodes taken than you, tho...) I do my exercises and I can use my arm without difficulty, just have some tightness and pain when reaching at some angles. Didn't expect to still have this almost 2 months after surgery. My surgeon was pleased with where I was when I saw him a couple of weeks ago. So, I'm trying to not be too discouraged about my limitations. WVGirl- sounds like hubby is coming around. Glad you're getting the support you need. Hope you have a good weekend with few se! Julie- You're probably in sleep mode today and I hope the rest revives you! Gotta love those sisters--how nice of yours to come clean for you! Deb1023- wishing you and your partner a bug-free, se-free weekend. I love the scrapbook idea.  Dana- I am so sorry for the loss of your police officer. I am always touched and amazed by what heros they are and how much they inspire us to be better human beings!  PALady- so not fair getting the Flo again! I hope it isn't too traumatic for you this time. My last period was the day my dh had brain surgery. I was 44 at time, so at first I thought I had quit bc of all the stress of dealing with his brain cancer tx, but they never returned (I had already been skipping for a couple of years prior). So I have been menopausal for 2 years. I would be HIGHLY PO'd to have chemo knock me out of the 'pause! Vettegal- glad your chemo team was on top of your reaction. You gals are def. NOT making me look forward to my 4 rounds of Taxol! Rest well this weekend. BTW, your firefighter story was a tear-jerker! Kris- what a great bunch of men you have around you to buzz in your honor! Kimberly- I like the idea of keeping the head shaved. I thinking I'll take your advice on that one--hate the stubble! LJ- so sorry that you're developing congestion. Hope it doesn't linger and make you more miserable next week. Therese- glad to see you posting again. I have several treatments to go, but the same diagnosis. Triple negative came up last week, I believe. I think there are 8 of us here. At first, I had trouble dealing with the higher risk of recurrence assoc. with triple neg. Mine was calculated at 20% with the dose dense, 3 drug regimen + rads.  Every women has a 1 in 8 chance of getting bc anyway, and as we age that risk goes up to 1 in 6. So, statistically 1 in 5 isn't that bad. Anyway, that's my way of rationalizing it... I am determined to look at the positive side. Mine (like yours) was discovered early and treated aggressively. We are survivors! Joan- been thinking of you and your mother. Hope things come through to get her settled near you very soon! Sending you good vibes as you get ready to join the Bald Babes Club. You're in great company! Well, well, I outdid myself... time for another nap. If round 3 works the same as the previous 2, I probably won't do much more than lurk for the next couple of days. Have a great weekend, Gems Paula",

There is hope that I might kick this thing b4 chemo next week. On a sad note, my ds just served as one the pallbearers for his friend's mother. He lost his mother to bc which she had been fighting for several years. When she went into a coma, ds and his friends took turns spending the night with the boy at the hospice. They were with him when she died. I was so proud of the way they supported him-- pretty good for 16 and 17 yo boys. CHJ- being sick on top of the chemo is a bummer and definitely takes its toll our emotions. I'm very sad to hear your oncologist experience isn't optimal. The oncs in my area (Charleston, WV) are so overbooked that they are working 6 days a week and long hours. I typically end up spending at least an hour waiting for my appt. But when I get to my onco he spends as much time as I need, goes out for info if I request something, looks up research for me, etc. You deserve the same and I'm praying that you will find the right onco should you choose to change. Deb1023- glad the tooth is better. I am so, so sorry that your dp is going through the death of her mother. Hoping for a peaceful, pain-free passing and that your dp has the support she needs to grieve for her mom. I know you are doing your best to support her and sounds like she knows it too. I'll be praying for your peace of mind and strength as you help her through this difficult time. Julie- happy belated 39th Bday. I'm sorry that you are the Jewels' poster child for N/V. I'm praying for a miracle drug combo to come thru that will spare you from this in the future. (FUSE) Carol/ golfer- I missed the Oprah episode with the dancers. My dh and I got hooked on Dancing w/ the Stars while he was doing his chemo/ rads in 2006. My SIL is a ballroom dancer and she spent a lot of time w/ us that year and introduced us to the show. Emmitt Smith was THE MAN during that season and I still maintain that he's the best dancer! Hope your ds did well in his skating meet and you were up to the judging. Kalen- thanks for reminding me of Alice in Wonderland. That was one of the watched over-and-over Disney movies when my kids were little. Do you reckon Lewis Carroll was on LSD when he wrote that book?! KathyL- loved the poem, what great advice. This place always makes me smile, too. That's why its one of the first and last places I check every day. Hope you have a great visit with your Dad this weekend. BTW, I googled Lissa Cole--inquiring minds wanna know-- and there's a website. www.lissacole.com I like the concept, sounds like fun! Wendy- 6-10\" of snow! We rarely see that much accumulation here in southern WV- last time was 1993, I think. My kids whine that our area is covered with a bubble as all the systems this winter seems to bring snow to the counties north, east and west of us and leave us with no snow--and thus, no SNOW DAY from school. Stay warm and safe this weekend! D1- hope you're all thawed out from the ice storm yesterday and your dh made it in safely from CA. Bummer that your dd didn't get to show her stuff in her game. Wishing her good luck in AAU tryouts this weekend! LJ- glad you're okay. I hope the T/H combo brings less se than AC. How's your dp? Hope she's back in good health and able to ditch the masks! Vettegal- Diarrhea... cramps... I'd be depressed too! Good to hear from you and hoping that you're feeling better physically and emotionally this weekend. Hey to Vetteguy! Kimberly- rest well and reenergize this weekend! Sherry- good for upset stomach and congestion... gotta find some Vernors here! Your dd wedding venue definitely sounds fit for a princess. I'm looking forward to the pictures already! B1985UI- thanks for popping in with the tips from your mother. I hope her treatment continues to go well. Come back and see us soon. Tinalee- wishing you Good Jammy and TV Days this weekend with few se to distract you from your rest. I was there last weekend after tx#3. I have \"discovered\" tv since starting chemo. I'm an avid reader (fiction and nonfiction, love history and good meaty books-no romances) but I can't get my mind around a book during the \"dark days\" after chemo. So I've turned to the tube for distraction. I just discovered the Showtime series \"The Tudors\" and have been watching every episode that I find listed. (THANK YOU to one of the Jewels--can't remember who--for the heads-up on this show. It is good!) Therese- another Jewel sidelined by URI. Praying that you'll recover w/o any complications. Jenny- glad you had an easier time with tx#2 in spite of having another reaction to Taxotere. We definitely have a round 2 trend going on with the T. I'll be on guard for that. Thanks for the tip on L-glutamine. This site is a Godsend for being proactive on the se of chemo! Dana- glad that fighting spirit is staying strong. You are always in my prayers. CarolC- hope you're not having to tiptoe around as much these days. Maz- doing okay? Finally, I noticed a few more Jewels who I haven't seen in a while. Hopefully because you're out enjoying life. Wishing you good health DianeB, AZDonna, Diana63. Take care Gems, Paula",

Maybe some of it is chemo-related... Speaking of the FC, it was really bad last night. I ended up swigging Jim Beam straight from the bottle. Finally quit coughing and slept for 5 hours. It doesn't look like I'm going to get to rest up for tx 4. Oh well, maybe THIS time chemo fatigue with beat this cough into submission. Just got The Tudors Season 1 in from Amazon.

      "Content": "Mar 1, 2008 04:14PM - edited Mar 1, 2008 04:18PM by RN2teach Afternoon, Jewels. So, AC is now a thing of the past for me. Treatment went smoothly. My bf and her dh drove my dh and I to Charleston. After chemo we went to the mall for a little shopping and an early dinner. Had a ball in Macy's trying on hats--wish I'd had my camera! Found a nice one for $8.   Had my neulasta inj. this morning, breakfast w/ mom and a little shopping. Came home and took a nap. Had a little nausea--first since Tx # 1. Phenergan kicked it nicely (and made the nap last a little longer, I'm sure!) D1- I'm glad your therapist is being aggressive w/ your LE. I can relate to the multiple doc appts. My dh sees onco, neuro, and pcp, both ds and dd have dermat. dd has braces, too... and then little ole' me. Seems like I have to take someone to a doc every week. This week I was in Charleston (about 30 min. away) 3 days for doc visits, then chemo yesterday and inj. today. On the plus side, I had 2 snow days so was well-rested for 2 of those visits and got some shopping in. As for your rads simulation. I know a little about that from dh. The markings are done in something like permanent marker--it wears off, so will have to be \"touched up\" as needed.  My dh was also fitted for a mask (molded screen-like device) which he had to wear to make sure his head did not move . Not sure if we have to be fitted for anything like that... guess you'll let us know. Anyway the simulation is a practice run through your whole radiation treatment plan. You'll actually be on the machines that will be used and all your treatment team will be involved. It takes a lot longer than your rads will when you get started. We went for dh's simulation a couple of days b4 he started rads. Dana- I'm so glad you're finally started chemo on Tuesday. I second everyone's comments on the flowers that you gave to the nurse at your treatment center--shows an humble, loving heart! I'm always happy to see that you're staying strong and ready to fight--Kimberly aptly named you: the JJ's own Little Warrior! LJ- good to hear T/H is treating you gently. I'm encouraged by the \"milder\" se's. Vettegal- first bath goodies, now flowers! Sounds like the angels knew you needed some TLC after all the bummer se's you've been thru and then your nasty boss. Kimberly- YOU'RE BACK! Glad to see your energy is back! We all enjoy your sunny posts (and we can't wait for some of that sunny CA weather to make it to us!) I was saddened to hear that you lost your mother at such a young age (yours and hers). Cancer is def. a brute. Jenn51- so, you just had chemo Thurs.? I missed that. Hope the fog is short and gentle! Jenn and Sista: No need to apologize for not posting as often. You just do what works for YOU. That's all any of us can do and we Jewels would expect no less than you taking wonderful care of yourself! Sista- My taste buds are on their way out for at least a week. Water will taste nasty. I survive by drinking flavored water, juice, and hot tea doesn't taste too terrible. And my cough (which is nearly gone--praise God!) was the residual of a nasty cold that I caught right after tx # 2 and lasted for a month. Sheshe- I know you're fighting a little extra anxiety with changing treatment centers. I believe everyone has given you plenty of reassurance on the medication thing. Hang in there! KathyL- thanks for the quotes. I found a wooden plaque at a Home Goods after dh was diagnosed that really spoke to me. I bought it and hung it above a mirror in my family room.   In the end it is not the years of your life that matter... it is the life in your years--Abe Lincoln Julie- glad to hear that you had a good day Thurs. Hope your ds did well in his tae kwon do tourney today! As for my LOA, I'm thinking that I may not need one now... I've just completed my A/C rounds, which are tougher than the Taxol I'm doing next. We'll see, I guess. If it ends up kicking my butt, then I'll reconsider! WVgirl- saw a tee in a mall kiosk yesterday that reminded me of you: \"West Virginia Girl.\" Sounds like dh had a minor breakthru- I'll be praying that his accompanying you for chemo is a good experience for both of you. Therese- I'm glad your chemo schedule worked out so that you and dd could share the concert. Congrats for being finished with your treatment! Kimberly- just getting ready to post and saw yours. My sister and I live several states apart but we have a ball on the phone. I love your workout idea--how funny! LOL Well, the tummy is feeling empty and it isn't liking the feeling. Time to find something soothing to eat. Paula",

Hope your 1st Taxol goes well tomorrow. thanks for the shout outs. dh bounced back from this seizure much faster than he usually does. He typically is unresponsive and sleeps for 6-8 hours. He was up with a remote in his hand within 4 hours. LOL ds pitched one inning in the scrimmage (sp) game this evening and said he did well. I can hear him upstairs now playing Guitar Hero... gotta go remind that boy that he needs to get his work done for AP English! He's such a slacker! dd is the complete opposite--type A perfectionist all the way! I'll check in with you all tomorrow. Hope my SIS who are entering the twilight zone after chemo find your way back to the bright side soon! Paula",

Hope you're doing okay! Sheshe- hallelujah! Good news about the bone scan! Vettegal- glad to hear your mother's tumor is responding to oral chemo. Also keeping your ds in prayer. Keep us posted... Dana- don't feel picked on, LW! We Jewels all can use a little refining (diamonds in the rough). I know I always feel that I grow as a person when I am able to look outside myself and gain insight into someone else's point of view. I also realize (like you) that I am human, and therefore fallible, and I forgive myself when I fail to live up to MY expectations. I am my own worst critic and I believe you have a little of that in yourself as well. Kimberly- good to see you're recovering from this last round of treatment.

Glad you're starting to feel better! Carol- hope the Bday party was fun. Since Kimberly isn't feeling up to it right now, I'll do a \"WOOHOOO\" in her honor to celebrate your chemopause. My first symptoms with Taxol felt a LOT like menstrual cramps. I would have been royally P-Oed if chemo brought me OUT of menopause (haven't had a visit from aunt Flo since June 2006).

I'll keep you all in my prayers. (((Hugs to you and dh))) I'm glad Peyton was there to add some sunshine to the day. They are sweet when they sleep, aren't they? I still cherish the memories of my babies' sweet faces when they fell asleep in my arms. Ah, but EARTH TO PAULA: those children aren't sweet babies anymore... they're TEENAGERS!  LOL at your PMS comment--my picture should be in the dictionary next to the definition! God was merciful in putting me in menopause b4 dd started having periods. I was a moody bitch for a couple of days every month... and dd is a chip off the old block. I don't seem to have any mood swings w/ menopause (I think b/c I've been too busy dealing w/ dh's cancer treatment and adjusting to our \"new normal\" with his disability). BTW, I can relate to your feelings about sharing things w/ the Jewels. I feel so close to all of you that it seems impossible that we've never met face to face, doesn't it? Sleep well, precious Gems!

I forgot to mention that I talked w/ my onco about my follow-ups after chemo and rads are finished. He was much too nonchalant about the whole thing for my taste. I don't want to be paranoid about a recurrence and live in fear/dread of it returning, but I DO want to be proactive w/ screenings, etc. So, I'll be preparing my case for aggressive F/U screens and presenting them to him next visit. He may be a bit laid back, but he was very receptive to my requests for dh's follow-ups and I expect to get my way this time as well. He supported me on my desire to start my rads 2 weeks after I finish chemo (typical time interval between chemo and rads is 4 weeks and rad onco was reluctant to start me so soon). Sista- I read that article. It was interesting, wasn't it? Comes a bit late for me--esp w/ the steroids. Things don't taste quite right, but I still seem to be eating a lot. I can't believe I actually weighed a lb. less yesterday than the last dr. visit. Must be b/c I'm walking more now that the weather is nice. Maz- thanks for the update on Val. Hoping she recovers enough to get her chemo back on track. Jenn- rest well and feel better soon. SISKimberly- thinking of you and looking forward to your eloquent posts. Get well soon!!! ds had a game this evening but strong thunderstorms have just started here and they've already nixed the game. So, I'm already lounging in my pjs at 5pm... pitiful, I know, but there you have it! Happy weekend to all. Our weather here isn't going to be so nice--rain, temps dropping, and possible snow by Sunday night! Paula",

My tongue was hangin' out just watching Jason dance on Monday night! What a MAN! Therese- I read John Adams a few years ago and loved it. I've read several other bios by McCullough since then. \"Truman\" is my all-time favorite of his books. I have caught a few of the episodes on HBO, but missed the BC one. Kris- glad your first Taxol is history! Carol- You're such a JEWEL (definitely a rare gem)! As Kimberly mentioned, you are so great at befriending people. I admire your style! PALady- LOL at the hair dreams. Remember Vicky Lawrence in Mama's Family? In my last hair dream, that was what I saw when I looked in the mirror. NOT looking forward to curls like THAT! My eyelashes are all but gone-a few stragglers left, that's all. The eyebrows are okay for now, but given the Jewels' experiences I'm not expecting them to stay. I really chuckled at your attempts to draw brows. Thinking I won't be very good at that either. Thanks for asking about my dh. He is doing well. Since we added the 3rd seizure med, his seizures are much more mild than they used to be and not occurring as often. Last brain MRI was a month ago and he was clear.

Glad to see that Denise's treatment plan is in motion.

I feel very fortunate that my se's have been mild enough to allow me to work-and I'm doubly blessed that I love my job! I had a little surprise this afternoon. It seems that my colleagues and students entered me in an outstanding nurse contest sponsored by Charleston Newspapers to celebrate National Nurses Week... there were around 90 nominees and somehow I won. I was interviewed and had my picture taken after work today. (Oh, joy! I'm SO photogenic right now!). They are going to print my nomination letter (which I haven't seen) along with my picture and interview in Sunday's paper.

Vettegal- hope Denise's surgery went well today. Thinking of you both! D1- Thanks for sharing your encounter with the couple at your rads center. How wonderful that you seized the opportunity to make a difference in the life of that couple! You're incredible, my friend. I'm following your rads details closely. Wondered how the boost would differ from the whole boob treatment. PALady- WOW! I can't believe you're finishing up with radiation just as I'm getting started. I got a call from my center today. I'll start my treatments tomorrow. Joan- looks like we're starting rads together tomorrow. I saw the May rads group-haven't gotten around to posting there yet. I'm to have 28 treatments followed by 5 boosts, not the 25 I had planned on. It is going to be a close thing getting finished by June 16... Carol- loved your picture with Ginny. That trail looks wonderful. Dh and I went to Lowe's yesterday after dropping off the tux. Picked up some annuals to put in planters on our front porch and back deck. I had to settle for watering them in their little containers yesterday and today. Hoping to get them planted tomorrow. Julie- Hope you got everything you needed to meet your deadline so you can relax and focus on your upcoming surgery. Is it going to be this week or next? KathyL- thanks for the tip on the Soothies. I'll keep those in mind if my nip gets irritated. I think ds toughened my nipples up when he nursed-little fella REALLY liked to nurse! Wonder if that will help any...  Kimberly- glad you enjoyed the concert and how exciting that you're planning a very much-deserved vacation for you and dh! I see my surgeon tomorrow morning before I head over to the rads center for my treatment. Ds has a sectional game tomorrow evening. Will try to pop in before bedtime. Paula",

I had a box waiting for me when I returned home from rads this evening. A little java, a little chocolate and a book to read--PERFECT! All packaged up very nicely and mailed from.... (drumroll, please)... Poulsbo, WA! Yep, Carol's my pal. Carol- the first cup of joe went well with the caramels. I just unwrapped the book and I'm so excited to read it! I'd never heard of the StoryCorps Project, but I absolutely LOVE the concept and from browsing thru I can tell I'm going to like the book. You've touched me again with the way that you connect with BC survivors. You really make a difference in so many lives. I'm honored to be your friend!  Hope you and ds have a wonderful accident-free weekend. PALady- yes my rads is IMRT. I guess I wasn't paying attention when they explained the treatment plan b/c I didn't know I would be doing IMRT until the linear accelerator started rotating thru the angles. As for the times, I'm supposed to have 6pm every evening, but 2 of the 4 treatments there have been cancellations so I got to go in early. I was hoping to get an early morning appointment, but don't think that's going to be possible. I'm glad you're in a celebratory mood today. Enjoy! I've had a weird week as far as emotions go. Feeling a bit blue for some reason... Maybe its just adjusting to my new routine. I go to rads alone so that might be part of it. It is kinda funny chatting with the rad techs with my boob hanging out. I will say that doesn't bother me nearly as much as I thought it would, but it IS a strange experience.   Julie- what a wonderful group of friends to walk in your honor. Jules Rules here, too, with the cute animations. Happy Mom's Day to you, too! Therese- glad the girls are looking good. I think you were wise not to push yourself thru those 12 hour shifts. Rest well this weekend.   Kimberly- Good job checking on our missing Jewels. Thanks for the update on CarolC and CHJ. I've been missing Jennifer also. She hasn't been here since April 11 I'm also worried about Judy (sheebas). Her last post here was Apr 7 when they stopped her chemo and put her on Xeloda. Her dh posted on a mets thread the next day. And then there's Jenny (JKiss)- last post on Feb. 24. Of course she's got a 2-year-old, so there's a lot on her plate... Joan- I hope you had a nice birthday today! Tina- A double celebration coming up for you Sunday, eh? Happy Birthday to you! I have 4 rads down, 29 to go. I'll be finished the middle of June. Sounds like you have a good start on your garden. I haven't even gotten the soil ready yet. Usually start in mid-May, so it is time. My mouth waters just thinking of fresh produce! I'll be canning green beans and tomatoes and freezing corn later this summer. We'll be going to a nephew's college graduation tomorrow, then to ds' tournament game. I'll try to pop in after the game. Wishing all of our Jewel moms a Happy Mother's Day this Sunday! I'm off to check out my new book--thanks again, Carol! Paula",

We went thinking dh would be a candidate for gammaknife or a similar radiosurgery procedure. He isn't. He has four areas of concern... four new tumors... two little ones and two ill-defined and not-so-small... YIKES! Given that these tumors have \"fingers\" that aren't always visible, he needs chemotherapy much more than a radiosurgery.  His doc recommended that he enroll in a clinical trial. The one he suggested is a Phase I, which I'm not so thrilled about (those are usually \"wonder if this might work\" studies--not the best thing when you have an aggressive, fast-growing brain tumor). However, after some investigation I found that this trial definitely has merit. I've found at least a dozen similar studies with the same drugs that have shown promising results with GBM. We are scheduled to return to Duke next Monday to go over the protocol and enroll in the study (or decline and explore other options). We expect to be there several days if he chooses to enroll to get started on the drugs. One good thing is that all three drugs in this study (Gleevec, RAD001, and Hydroxyurea) are oral meds, so we can do this at home with monthly trips to Duke. The study provides two of the drugs free and we have to pay for the hydroxyurea plus all medical, lab, and radiology procedures. So, I'll need to check with our insurance to make sure they'll approve these costs. Ed has a niece in Durham who is a research pharmacist and she was able to find loads of data on the drugs and gliomas for us to review. Dh was really discouraged with the news that he has not 3 but 4 areas AND that nothing can be done surgically. It is very unnerving to know you have a bunch of deadly brain tumors in your head and no one can remove them for you. He's feeling a bit more positive today and I think he's ready to give this thing a go. It boosted his confidence to see on the news that Duke was the center chosen by Ted Kennedy, since they have the same type of tumor. I've read the posts, but don't have a lot of time to send wishes out tonight. Carol- I'm happy that your counts were up and things are moving forward (the end is in sight!). Happy belated anniversary! LJ- terrific news on your path report!! Tina- I'm so sorry to read about Cleo. I love my animals and still remember the death of each one of my furry friends over the years. Hope you can take comfort from Penny! Kimberly- welcome back. Your trip sounds heavenly! D1- so you have the PITS instead of the PITA... our SE queen reigns supreme! Hope the PT gets that shoulder back in shape. I can feel some tightness in my armpit area since last week--gotta be from the rads and I'm with CathyCA--I'll bet $$ that your shoulder prob. stems from rads as well. Dana- love your spirit, girl! God bless you as you finish up your schooling and take care of Bandit.   Jenn and Julie- love reading about the growing hair among our Jewels. Mine is coming in dark brown with quite a few shiny white/silver hairs. I'd been highlighting for several years so I have no idea how much gray I have! It is still very short and my scalp isn't covered yet, but I'm going topless more often now that it is getting warm. Thankfully, my kids don't seem to mind...",

Guess I'm catching up on some much needed sleep--having a little trouble sleeping through the night. I've poured through most of the research info on dh's clinical trial drugs. My feelings are mixed. They are showing promise in gliomas but only 20-25% of the subjects actually respond and it only buys them time--all of them eventually had to quit the studies d/t tumor growth. Given the tumor type, this is still a treatment breakthrough--Temodar (the miracle drug for GBM) has similar stats. Anyway, no use \"borrowing trouble\" as my Granny used to say. We're going for the trial and taking it one day at a time. Carol- here's hoping you're all tucked in comfortably and the tummy is feeling okay. I'm remembering you in my prayers and sending lots of good wishes your way! KathyL- What a drag to have your GI system rebel on the day of your tattoo. Thank heaven you had the day off today! So the tattooing is just to give the new nip some color, right? Glad it wasn't a painful process and hope you heal quickly! I am glad you clarified what a flow-a-holic was... cuz I was trying to figure out what kinda \"flow\" some of our Jewels were addicted too and I wasn't coming up with anything appealing!   And you will be a BEAUTIFUL model for the BC coalition--go for it!! Good luck with the cleaning service--hoping you get at least a couple of free cleanings. I had cleaners for years until dh became disabled 2 years ago. Didn't need them at first as I was home with him during his treatment that first summer. Then we just couldn't afford to have them back when he didn't get to go back to work. Eventually he recovered to the point that he took over most of the cleaning and did a great job. I'm feeling a little overwhelmed right now, though, and thinking of getting someone in for a good deep cleaning. D1- I have always picked up before the cleaners were due and finished the job after they left. I loved having them in, though, just to get the big stuff done (they were great with the bathrooms, which was worth the whole cost of their services IMO). LJ- LOL at your hair description. I just saw a lady at the onc's office who was 4 months out and had a healthy THICK head of hair. It was just as you described with the directions the hair was growing. Mine is still too short to tell which way it is going to go. Seems like I can see new growth every day, though. Jenn- I guess you can count me in the restless legs club? I wake up in the night a couple of times a week, legs aching, and can't seem to get them settled in a comfortable spot to go back to sleep. I keep ibuprofen in my nightstand so I don't have to get out of bed when the legs act up. If I can get the aches calmed down I usually go back to sleep. Sometimes the ibuprofen works, sometimes I need a benadryl to get back to zzz-land. I've been taking a multivitamin since finishing chemo and I do think the legs might be a bit less achy--only waking up a couple of nights a week now as opposed to every night. Julie- Pools are a lot of work, aren't they? My SIL (who lives next-door) has worked on hers for a week. It was really gross when she first uncovered it but it looks so inviting now. The temp is still a bit too chilly for me (68). She has a solar heater to boost the temps--being in between two mountains we kinda have to \"pipe\" the sunshine in here! CathyCA- I've never had a boysenberry either. Wonder where Mr. Knott brought to CA from? Interesting story--I'd heard of Knotts Berry Farm, but didn't know the background. I think you'll have a nice head of hair by Sept.--at least judging from others I've seen that are that far out from treatment. (reference the lady I mentioned to LJ above) Kimberly- whoa oh! And don't it feel good!! (Don't remember who sang Walkin' on Sunshine, but what a great song!) LOL at the Waltons' good night routine. PALady- you have your PET Scan tomorrow. Thinking of you! Vettegal- you and Denise (and Vetteguy) have been on my mind. I hope all is well with you. Take care all, Paula",

We've had some nice in-state travels, but I am longing to \"hit the road.\" Just read about your Race for the Cure experience. The dog tag was a sweet gift. I had the same feelings seeing the \"In Memory Of\" pictures on t-shirts. It is good to be alive and strong, isn't it?! Kathy- I'm also watching for your report from the Relay. Congrats on being the top fundraiser!! It is such a joy to read all the hair stories. And we're reporting these with all of the excitement of a new mama watching her baby's first milestones.  You're a month ahead of me on growth and already getting the first trim! Julie- my hair looks about like yours. I'll have to get one today and post it so we can compare! I loved your picture with your ds--you gals have truly beautiful smiles! WVGirl- another Jewel all finished with chemo! Congratulations!! And another Relay participant! The Charleston event is next weekend. Tina- John is a handsome lad. Thanks for sharing the pics. You're looking good yourself! Another lovely Jewel smile! I'm glad ds' graduation went well. I was very touched by the tribute for the boy who was killed... I can't even imagine the pain his parents are experiencing... Joan- how's the boob holding up? You're one ahead of me now. I'm doing okay. A little pink and itchy, but no blisters or sores.   Carol- we'll never tire of seeing your avatar (it is so adorable, BTW) I'm so happy that the tummy issues have passed and you're out and walking this morning. Reminiscing through the thread, eh? I did the same thing a while back. Some good reading there. I wasn't around for the first month so it was interesting looking at those early days. We were all set to go back to Duke this weekend for dh to start on the clinical trial on Monday. Got a call yesterday from the research nurse managing the trial... dh doesn't qualify d/t high lipid levels--something I pointed out to them last Monday when we were at Duke. ARGHHH So, I fired off several phone calls to Duke and by 3:30pm we had another trial lined up. I read over the details last night and looks like he will qualify for this one without any problems. It is another Phase I (sigh!) of Dasatinib (Sprycel) and Erlotinib (Tarceva). Less data on its use with gliomas, but there is some research out there that shows promise. We don't have to go to Duke until a couple of days after he begins this trial. In the meantime, I'll be knocking off my rads treatments until we have to go... possibly even finishing up the whole boob ones (I have 6 more of those to go, then the 5 boosts). Time to retire to the front porch to look through some of the studies I have printed out. Have a good Saturday, Gems! Paula",

Jenn- I will be praying for Melissa and her son. What a terrible situation for any mother to be in! PALady- Great news on the PET Scan. Trying to remember what was going on with you that you had one... was it leg pain? I saw my onco yesterday and he diagnosed me as RLS (restless legs syndrome). Says it is a side effect of chemo that causes peripheral neuropathy (like Taxol/Taxotere). He referred me to a neurologist for further eval and started me on Mirapex in the mean time. Hope your ex-bil does well with his treatment. What type of cancer does he have? Your brother was so young when he was diagnosed. I'm glad he had 10 extra years with your family. I know you cherished those days! Carol- how's the tummy? Congrats on graduating from the Cream of Wheat (COW) diet   Excellent news about Steph! Please tell him we're all sending good thoughts to him! I hope you enjoy your outing and the training this weekend! Sherry= you've had a lot on your plate lately. Don't try to go back and catch up (you can do that later when things settle down for you!), just move forward. Good to \"see\" your posts again! D1- congrats on your dd's accomplishments! Joan- you're finished with the whole breast treatments tomorrow, right? I'm looking a little \"sunburned\" here--esp. my chest right below my collar bone. I'm a bit uncomfortable but managing okay. Kimberly- I'm coming to Palo Alto August 5-15. Dd will be at Stanford the whole time and I'll be roaming around taking in the sites (probably just me, but not sure about that yet). I would love to meet you while I'm out there! Kathy- they still make Sun-In? I put that on my hair about 20 years ago and turned my hair a lovely shade of orange! Guess I'll have to wait for the highlights... Julie- hope you get the pool going for this weekend! Dh started his clinical trial today. First day wasn't so bad. Onco cleared him to travel, so we're on for the trip to Dallas next week. We'll fly out Tuesday. Looking forward to the down time that will follow after that trip is over. I'm ready for a break! Take care all--have a good Friday. Paula",

The kids were great--well-behaved and happy. We took them to Six Flags and the JFK Museum/ Dealey Plaza during some of the very rare free time that they had. None of my students placed in their competitions, but most of them just completed their junior year of high school so there's always next year! Dh tolerated the trip well (no seizures, thank God!). His clinical trial is going well. The only SE so far is the rash from Tarceva. It looks like a severe case of acne, but actually it is from the skin drying from the inside out. Started my boosts today. Should be finished with this whole thing by Friday! My boost area is bigger than I thought it would be, but the actual treatment time is shorter (even with all the simulation stuff today).  Someone mentioned neck pain (Carol, I think?). I had sessions where I was just miserable with my neck hurting. I shrugged off the first one, but after the second one I had my rads team help me get my head in a better position. They were very helpful. Carol- yesterday's paper had a very cute article on a doggie race to benefit Komen. I think you'll see why I thought of you! Click on the photo gallery--the weiners are pics 4 and 5. http://wvgazette.com/News/200806210333 Here's a pic of dh and me in Dallas.  I'm off to finish the laundry. Tomorrow is dd's 15th Bday. We had a small family gathering for her this evening. We're in the middle of getting her packed for camp (I'm taking her up tomorrow). Will be stopping on the way to camp to let her take the test for her learner's permit. Kris- thinking of you tomorrow!  I'll be back tomorrow evening (unless I can't sleep tonite--I took a sinfully LONG nap this afternoon!). Take care Jewels, Paula ",

We'd still be trying to drag them out of bed so we could head to the beach if we'd have brought them along. Just got back from a morning walk and getting a bit of breakfast now. Dh was sooo sick Monday night and slept most of the ride down. (you got it, Carol, this was def. a road trip--about 8 hours). I was afraid he wasn't going to be able to make the trip. Thankfully, whatever viral thing he had going on has passed and he is back to his usual good humor. Have my sunscreen on and ready to head back to the beach. Wish you all could be here with me!

Was supposed to take ds to a college open house this morning... he didn't get up on his own and I decided he could wait until the August event. The campus is 3 hours away and I needed a break from road trips after the 9 hour trip yesterday! We had a great time relaxing on the beach and enjoying the company of our good friends. We've been friends for 20+ years, but this is the first time we've taken a trip together. I know dh hasn't had so much fun in ages. He and bf's dh are both jokesters and they kept us entertained all week. It was great to see that side of Ed again. I read some of the posts yesterday on my way home and finished up this morning. Looks like everyone is doing well. We definitely are having a puppy boom here, eh? Congrats to Deb and Joan on your new pooches! I'll be back later to try some shout-outs. Gotta go hit the laundry detail. Have a good Monday all! Paula`",

Our dishwasher bit the dust Tuesday evening. Boy, was I miffed to have to unload that baby and wash everything by hand! So... as if the $2,000 worth of medical bills that just came in wasn't enough strain on the budget, we added a new dishwasher to the mix. I know it is a luxury, but I replaced it anyway. We're also dealing with a debt collection agency for an $820 medical bill that was never billed to our insurance AND for which we NEVER received a bill prior to it being turned over to the agency. We were first contacted in April and I gave the company my insurance info. Received a second phone call in May verifying insurance info AND another phone call in June checking our insurance information. Got a credit report Monday and learned that this bill is listed. So, I contacted NCO... spent over an hour on the phone, calling 3 different numbers and speaking with 7+ people... none of whom could verify that our insurance had been billed. (I know from my EOBs that no claim has been filed). Did a little research on the company and learned that there is already a $1.5 million judgment against them for violations. Also found out that I should have gotten a written notification of this account prior to any phone contact. So, I filled a complaint with the FTC and fired off a certified letter to NCO requesting the full details of this account. We have always paid our bills and had excellent credit, so this has got me fired up! On a positive note, dh is feeling so good. Thank God! He is doing a few handyman jobs around the house (he loves that kind of thing) and installed the new dishwasher Wednesday. He's even thrown a few compliments my way-something he was faithful about doing all the years of our marriage until the brain tumor 2 years ago. Since then I've had a long dry spell without those warm fuzzies. It is so nice to see the romantic side of him again! So, how are things in the Jewel world? Looks like SISKimberly is off to Tahoe. How nice! Carol- got your message Wednesday. I got a couple of salmon fillets with my king. Thank you again for the treat! YIKES! Burning on the back, eh? Wonder if having the mastectomy is the reason you're experiencing that and the rest of us didn't... I think you're the only Jewel in rads with a pancake. I hope the grease is keeping it under control! So, you should be down to 10 rads to go, right? 2 more weeks and you're finished! So, you're sporting a fresh new hair color! That's got to feel good. I'm still waiting to see what color mine is going to be. I see lots of my original brown, but I'm sure there's lots of silver in there. The longest strands have no color at all, making it difficult to tell the exact color... Julie- getting geared up for school, huh? I have been to my classroom and dropped a few things off, but haven't worked on anything yet. We go to our career and tech ed conference next week and get our new curriculum, so I'll be getting started after that. I go back to work Aug. 14th. I'll probably spend a lot of afternoons at school after conference. I am moving classrooms and I'd like to get that done before I start back to work. I'm the lead health occupations teacher and I'm getting the best classroom-I'll have my own bathroom, a laundry room, and a closet! Yeehaw! WTG getting ds to help you organize your classroom. I plan to get ds and dd to help me move. As an added bonus, dd's boyfriend is something of a computer guru and I'll be taking him along to get my \u2018puters cleaned up and ready for school. Hope your dh is feeling better! D1- LOL at the middle toes flipping off the rest! I know it's been a while since the first ones bailed ship. Are they growing back yet? I think I might keep mine. I trimmed them last week and most of the dark is gone. My fingernails are still weak and ugly, but most of the discolored areas have been trimmed away on them, too. Ditto on the shock of looking in the mirror. I haven't worn a topper since mid-June and I forget how bald I look until I see myself. I had one of those compliments on the short \u2018do this week. Nice to finally have enough hair that someone might think I intended to have this style! I have to thank you and our other cooks here for inspiring me to get back in the kitchen. I've been totally NOT interested in cooking and have been just doing the basics for months now. I'm ready to have some fun in the kitchen again! Norma- hey, I've noticed the same thing-my legs don't hurt as much. My doc started me on Mirapex for Restless Leg Syndrome back in June and I don't have to take it every night now. Add my son to the video game junkies list. His biggest obsession right now is Guitar Hero, but he also loves to play Halo. I'm feeling a little guilty for letting him spend too much time on the games this summer... I know there are worse things he could be doing, but it just seems like such a waste of time... We are having the same problem with visiting schools-the summer is passing too quickly! Good luck with your college searches. I know my ds will stay in state. He has the grades and ACT scores for our state Promise scholarship, which pays full tuition.   Make sure to let us know when we can order the calendar. I definitely want one! How exciting to know someone who is involved in cancer research. His invention sounds promising! LJ- glad you're enjoying the new DR. LOL-my cats have an affinity for the DR table also. We have an island in our kitchen where we usually eat. It took a good week squirting them with water to train them to stay off the counters. It worked. Wasn't up to the fight for the DR-figured I could wash the table down easily enough! CathyCA- Wow! Sounds like your ds did VERY well, considering he had impacted teeth... We are wireless here, too, and with the push of a button I can turn off the kids' internet access. Comes in very handy during the school months, but I have been letting it go this summer. Maybe I shouldn't have... Hope your Herceptin infusion goes smoothly today. Jenn- I'll be thinking of you today as you have the MRI. Hope that goes well... sharing D1's image of you bouncing around the MRI table... Dana- you're in my thoughts and prayers, too. I'm pleased that the doctor is getting his just rewards for his terrible behavior. I'm also relieved that you won't have to be involved in the criminal case-you have enough irons in the fire right now! If they don't need your testimony to convict him, so be it. You will be able to concentrate on school and your health. It seems to me that your chances of winning your civil case would increase with his criminal conviction. Could you hold off on the civil suit until after you graduate? It would surely be a lot less stressful for you. A cruise?! What a fabulous graduation gift! Kathy- so sorry that you've got a bug, but good to know there's an explanation for the symptoms you had earlier this week. I know you're looking forward to being off this weekend. Rest well and feel better soon! I teach CPR to my students, so did the AHA and ARC classes to certify as an instructor. It is one of my favorite things to teach in the classroom. Sherry- my friend, you have nothing to feel guilty about. The great thing about the Jewels is that each of us has our own life to live, even though we are connected by BC. I get so much joy reading about what everyone is doing. By reading about the ways that our Gems enrich their lives, I find new ways to add joy to mine. I'm getting so much pleasure sharing the wedding plans and anticipation with you. Thank you! Oh my! Look at the time... gotta run-I have a lunch date with some friends... See ya, Paula",

I've been here at the 'puter most of the day. Just finished getting the sub lesson plans in order for next week. Also got the laundry caught up (whew!) and ran out to restock the pantry. Wasn't the most exciting Saturday, but I'm feeling quite satisfied at the moment, knowing I'm ready for next week. I did take time to enjoy a beautiful fall day. I live \"up a holler\" with hills surrounding my house. This morning I sat on the deck, basking in the autumn sun and admiring the trees in their autumn finery, backlit by a perfect azure sky.... beautiful! I thought of you all then and wished you were here to see it. Kimberly and Kathleen, I sent positive vibes your way this morning as I communed with nature. You're both in my thoughts and prayers. Thought of Patty and her sister, so I sent up a prayer for them as well. And for Jenn-- hope the sun is shining on your world! Deb1023- thanks for checking in. I knew you were probably just busy with life (as it should be!), but it is always good to hear from you! Love your pup icon! CHJ- hey there, Carol! Glad to see you're doing well. LOL at the friggin' BC awareness comment. I guess all the pinkness of October does bring back all the painful memories of the BC journey... Three cheers to being a survivor! Julie- so the consult won't happen until late Oct., which means no endoscopy until November? How are things in that area? Any further symptoms? Carla- got your PM. Will let you know when we get the visit scheduled. Were supposed to go up this Monday, but I had to cancel as I'm getting my port out. D1- Hope you're having a good weekend with the girls!

I know it must be a bittersweet experience since this was a gift from your dad. I hope that you come back rejuvenated and ready to pass those boards. You're in my prayers. Carla- happy belated birthday, WVGirl! I'm glad your girls were good to you- nothing like a clean kitchen, eh? Also good to see that you are planning for a better future for yourself. You deserve better than a life with an abusive husband and your girls will come around. We're all rooting for you! Kathy- hope the birthday party went well today. Pink eye and flu bugs... ah, the joys of motherhood! Hope your good handwashing helps you dodge the bullet and stay healthy! God knows you don't have TIME to be sick... Hope your doggie is feeling better- poor baby! LJ- thanks for the weight training and Project Gutenberg links. I haven't gotten into audio books yet, but I love to read, so maybe it's time to give it a try. What kind of MP3 did you end up getting? Carol- thanks again for the birthday surprise! Sorry to hear that you're having a bit of pain from the port removal. Hopefully, it will be short-lived. Baby Katie is precious- what a great picture of the two of you! Sorry to hear Zach had another \"wild hair\" while you were out of town. Teenagers can be such a PITA sometimes... I had a bit of a disagreement with dd's bf today. He is more of a drama queen (king?) than my dd, so he blew it waaayyy out of proportion. As if having a high maintenance dd wasn't enough... SIGH D1- I don't know what a Yellow Bird is either, but judging from your smiles it musta been good! I can see the family resemblance- esp. in the smiles, like Carol mentioned. What a treat to revisit the site of such sweet memories! How trying that your college girl's new beau is a dud... my dd is only 15 and in her first \"relationship\" (as the Myspace generation calls it). I'm growing to dislike this boy more and more... he's moody and has been verbally abusive to her on several occasions. It infuriates me! Esp. when I hear her begging and crying... ARGH! I've tried to talk to her, but you can guess how that goes. I'm the enemy. Ah, well... CHJ- So, did the colonoscopy results come back okay? Therese- Congrats on getting your gals all dressed up with the tats! LOL at the \"hair tease away\" analogy- IKWYM, my hair is so... POOFY. I'm due for a trim. Until a couple of years ago, I wore my hair nearly as short as it is now, but it was so straight. Never thought I'd look forward to getting rid of my curls, but I am! Sherry- haven't heard from you since you mentioned getting the biopsy results from your gastroscopy. Hope everything is A-OK and you're just too busy to post. I'm praying for a smooth transition to just ONE manageable job for you in the near future! PALady- as if one ovarian cyst wasn't enough... How'd the US go this week? Hope you got good results. With your BC history (not finding your lump on mammo) and your young age, I can't believe your doc wouldn't consider an MRI... It seems that the standard of care is just the annual mammo, though- that's what my oncologist recommends (and the blood work for tumor markers). I'm thankful to have a surgeon with an aggressive follow-up mindset. He did agree that the false positives can \"have us chasing our tails,\" but believes it is still worth it. Don't be afraid to keep asking for that MRI if you feel that strongly about it. Deb- I hear you on the port removal! Why do you have to wait until January? Kimberly- thanks so much for the birthday card- yours was the first that I received this year! I see your port removal is coming up soon and Kathleen's surgery as well. You'll be in my thoughts. BTW, loved your school's mock election- what a great lesson for your students! Julie- I got my very own birthday animation on the Jewel thread- I've finally made it! LOL  I'd say you've made a sound decision with the remodeling vs. selling, given the economic situation. Happy decorating! Cathy- guess you're gearing up for your last training walk before the big event next weekend. Have fun! I'm glad you've got a cautious surgeon- wish all of the Jewels did... Sorry to hear about your MIL's cancer diagnosis. Not easy to have to relive those experiences, is it? Sorry this is so long- I get a little chatty when I'm catching up with my Jewel pals! Things are going \"ok\" here. Dh and I had quiet birthdays- no celebrations as he isn't feeling well. He is sleeping most of the time still and now having headaches. Trying not to read a lot into it as I know the meds can cause some brain swelling, but still... he's having difficulty carrying on a conversation and can't understand me half the time... MRI is scheduled for next Friday, then back to Duke... I'd better get moving toward the bed. I've sat here for so long that I'm going to be doing my 80-year-old shuffle when I get up.

Ed's MRI showed a new tumor and lots of brain swelling, which explains all the symptoms we've been seeing. So, we'll be traveling back to NC on Sunday (right in the middle of Thanksgiving travelers). He starts a new clinical trial on Monday. We'll be at Duke all day Monday, return Tuesday morning for blood work, and then we'll travel back home. This is a good trial for him, I think. Two oral chemos--Temodar (the standard for glioblastoma) and the experimental drug Topotecan, which is approved for ovarian cancer. Have to read up on that one still...

In the meantime, I've arranged for his two retired brothers who live nearby to check in on him and I'll be coming home for lunch. One day at a time... So, happy 2009! Our NY eve was quiet, but nice. I enjoyed your fireworks, Kimberly. What a view! Hey Sherry- glad to see you're feeling better. What a way to ring in the new year with an ear ache and UTI- double trouble for sure! I see you've had a glitch with the work-at-home job. Hang in there. After what you've survived in the past year, this is small stuff. ((Hugs)) Carol- your phone call was the highlight of my Saturday. Thanks for the chat! I forgot to ask about Zach, but I see he started PT today. Donna- warm weather, a beach and a beautiful sunset.... What a beautiful way to usher out the old year and welcome 2009! I'll be watching for the pics when you get home. You're in my prayers as your doctor's visit come up Friday. Got my fingers crossed for good news. D1- you dropped the F-bomb (my kids' lingo) so many times in that NY Eve post that my granny woulda been after you with a bar of soap! Made me chuckle! Watched part of the Vikings game Sunday  and I said a WTF in your honor. So, hope dd's finger is feeling better.  You have every right to get soapboxy about Tamox. You've been a trooper taking that stuff with the SE's that you're experiencing. Somethin's gotta give... Ah, there's an update on your BIL. Sounds like he's doing well! Kathy- oh, my! Sorry to read about your illness and hospitalization before Christmas. Glad you made it through the holidays and the MRI... and reading on- good news from the MRI! Hallelujah! And the alien implant comes out Friday, I see. I hope you removal goes easy- you'll be glad to be rid of that sucker, I think! Patty- good to see your post! Bummer about the celiac disease- a definite PITA, huh? Good luck on adjusting your diet to stay healthy. Glad to see vettesis is doing well and a big HOWDY to Vetteguy! Kris- Dang! Hope things settle down with the drainage. What's the doc say about all this? I see D1 had a similar experience with her lumpectomy... makes me cringe just thinking about it... Kimberly- thanks for the letter. I was pleased to get a hard copy of your NY poem. I shared it with my work family today and they loved it!   Tina- awwww, Snowy Joey is adorable!  I couldn't get the link to work, but I did find your house on Zillow. It looks great.  Pink skis and poles, huh? That's a new one. You'll have to get a pink ski ensemble and post a pic! Carla- tennis elbow... yikes! Hope the steroid shots helped. Julie- so, the girls are looking good, eh? I had to chuckle at Kathy's comment about using labial tissue to construct new nipples... lips for nips? Makes me shudder just to think of it! Glad things worked out with the new vehicle and you got one you liked even better than the first one. All's well that ends well! CHJ- I watched the Ravens make toast outta Miami yesterday. They're playing well.  I'm not a Dolphins fan, but we follow them b/c their QB, Chad Pennington has a WV connection- his wife is from our town. Better post this and go get ready for tomorrow. Still have to iron my uniform... I'll be dressing in scrubs a lot over the next few months as I take the kids out to the hospital for clinical training. We're working in the lab right now and will start in the hospital in February. Take care all! Paula",

There's a little snow mixed in with the rain and the river near our home is up. Our little holler may be blocked by high water at some point if this rain continues-- usually happens at least once a year. Anybody got a boat I can borrow?! Anyway, my armpit lump is just a firm lymph node (it's actually not as firm as it was last month when I first noticed it). Had my blood drawn for tumor markers and should get those results tomorrow. I do have a weird knot-thing on my cervical spine (neck) that we've decided to scan. Don't think it is anything... feels spongy (kinda like cartilage)... I noticed it a couple of years ago and it hasn't changed/ doesn't cause me any discomfort.  As for dh, everyone noticed the change in him since his last visit in Sept. He normally is chatty and joking around... he didn't acknowledge any of them today. The onc. upped his decadron and ordered an MRI. We should be getting that in the next couple of days. Hopefully this regression will be r/t brain swelling and not tumor growth. If it is caused by swelling, the higher dose of decadron should really help that.  Carol- well, I'm glad I warned you to be extra cautious today... you never know! CHJ- I HATE to vacuum anyway-- don't think having a pink vacuum would help any! Vettegal- sorry you and your sister are having problems. ((Hugs))  D1-  no one can say that you aren't giving Tamox a fair chance. Sorry it's taking a toll on your mood. I cannot imagine you hissing... but wait a minute... you DID have a wild look in your eyes in our thug pics.... hmmmm We can share the loony suite only if I get my own bed.  Back to the laundry...

Dh has several new tumors and increased swelling. I'll be on the phone with Duke first thing Monday morning to come up with a new game plan, then report back to our onc. here. He wasn't very pleased with this new trial that dh is on and has some alternatives for us, if Duke isn't ready to act quickly. I haven't looked at the MRI CD yet... will wait until dh goes to bed-- I'm a little too close to tears to look at it with him sitting here in the same room.

      "Content": "Jan 11, 2009 03:33PM - edited Jan 11, 2009 03:38PM by RN2teach First off, I want to thank you all for your support. I cannot express how much you all mean to me\u2026 women I\u2019ve never seen face-to-face, and yet you are all my sisters.Thank you for \u201clistening\u201d and I\u2019ll ask forgiveness in advance for this long post. It seems to help to pour my heart out here. There\u2019s no improvement at all from dh's increased steroids. Guess the tumors must be affecting the speech center. He seems to understand, just can\u2019t communicate well. He\u2019s always been pretty easy-going and, thankfully, he\u2019s staying in character. He\u2019ll try to say something and then just shake his head after awhile and say \u201cnever mind.\u201d Most of the time I\u2019m able to guess what he\u2019s trying to say.The perks of a 26-year relationship, I suppose.  Most of his deficits are mental. Physically he can still take care of himself for the most part\u2014getting dressed, hygiene, etc. The right side of his mouth draws down and he has slight weakness on the right side (kinda like a stroke patient). His voice is weak, but no swallowing problems. I\u2019ve got a lot of experience working with stroke and head injury patients, so my training will be of benefit in taking care of him. I\u2019m making arrangements for regular check-ins by family/neighbors. I hope that\u2019s enough\u2026 it is so hard to judge. I don\u2019t want anything to happen to him and having a history of seizures means he\u2019s at high risk with the tumors growing\u2026. On the other hand, he\u2019s able to take care of himself so well that having a presence here throughout the day may upset him\u2026 FUBC!!! I want him to be safe, but also want him to be happy. His sister is coming in from Ohio Tuesday, so I\u2019ll have a couple of anxiety-free days this week as far as dh is concerned. Ds is working, dd out with her bf at his parents\u2019 home. I\u2019ve got some papers to grade, bills to pay, laundry to do, etc. BUT, I had to take care of the important stuff first\u2014checking in my Jewel gals! Carol- I spent yesterday working with my music, too. My iPod had to be reformatted to work on my Mac, which means all the music got wiped out. It was all on CDs anyway, so I spent the afternoon uploading all my music to iTunes and then syncing my iPod again. I quit after the 40th CD. I\u2019ve got 2GB uploaded and have room on my iPod for 2 more. Therese- another 3-Dayer. Congrats on getting involved. I sent Carol a couple of books about preparing for the 3-Day last summer.\u201cFoot Soldiers: Stories from the Breast Cancer 3-Day Walk\u201d and \u201cThe Complete Guide to Marathon Walking.\u201d I\u2019m not sure which one she recommends, but I know at least one of them was pretty helpful. You can get them both on Amazon. Norma- FUBC again! I\u2019m bummed that Toni is going through treatment again. She\u2019s really been hammered with this beast. Please let her know she\u2019s in my thoughts and prayers. Dale will do his senior project next semester, which begins in a couple of weeks. Ours is a combo portfolio/scrapbook\u2014very similar to what you described. They have to reflect back on the stages of their life thus far, include pics, and also complete a cover letter & resume, document community service, articulate a 5-year plan for reaching career goals, etc. It includes an interview. The judging committee is made up of English teachers and business professionals from the community, who volunteer to help. It takes place over several days (each student gets an appointment, like a job interview). So, although it will be a wonderful experience, there\u2019s a butt-load of work involved! I envy you that your ds\u2019s is completed already! There\u2019s going to be a lot going on this spring\u2014scholarship deadlines, conferences, prom, graduation plans\u2026 Lord, give me strength! So glad your onc. is taking you off of Tamox permanently. I\u2019ll be thinking of you this week as you see your docs and make those decisions about treatment and surgery. Patty- so, you\u2019ll schedule your surgery this week. With Aunt Flo dropping in unannounced (inconsiderate bitch!), I know you\u2019ll be looking forward to getting rid ofthose organs. LOL at snapfish\u2026 they come up with some interesting names for these photo websites, don\u2019t they? Ditto what the other Jewels said about taking care of yourself emotionally. You\u2019ve been through a lot, gf! Oh yeah, GO STEELERS! Lots of Steeler fans in this neck of the woods. Kimberly- (passing you a tissue and some Tylenol) sorry you\u2019re sick again. Hope you\u2019re on the mend.  I am so happy that you liked the twin heart weaving, and touched that you\u2019re displaying it with a treasured photo of you and ds! You put me to shame with your exercise routine. I\u2019m hitting the treadmill haphazardly, doing a few yoga stretches\u2026 that\u2019s it. Need to do better, just don\u2019t have the energy or the motivation. You, my dear, are a WONDERFUL teacher! I know you\u2019re having a positive impact on your students, even though you\u2019ll have to wait years before you ever hear from them about it. I got visits from 3 of my former students during their Christmas break from college. Two of them are 2nd year nursing students, the other is 3rd year pre-med. They all gave me warm fuzzies about how much my program has helped them in college. I\u2019ve got those comments logged in my memory bank to dredge up when I feel that my efforts in the classroom are futile! I know you\u2019ve mentioned similar visits from former students\u2014keep those memories nearby when you\u2019re frustrated. Good advice to Sherry. Hmmm, your dream interpretation seems to be right on the money! About that size 4 prom dress\u2026 it belongs to my niece. Rach brought it home for me to see recently\u2026 it is way to revealing for Mama\u2014dd has some nice-sized jugs and they\u2019re spilling out of it. So, this is a source of conflict here.SIGH! Carla- remind me again about your new tattoo\u2014was it a butterfly? Where\u2019d you get tattooed? LOL at the weather- grocery angle. Same thing happens here when weather warnings head our way. Ds works at the local grocery store and has complained about how busy it gets when bad weather is headed our way. Happy early Bday to the twins. How cool that you\u2019ve kept in touch with your hospital roomie from 20 years ago. LJ- you\u2019re right there again with good research to share. What would we do without you?! Glad you\u2019re a Jewel! Kathy- sounds like you\u2019re doing well about the de-porting (haha).  Hope ds gets that bike (sounds like a win-win situation to me!) LOL at dh\u2019s birthday present. That has always been my dh\u2019s favorite \u201cgift.\u201d I can relate to where you\u2019re at right now with small children and a busy work life\u2014except you\u2019re also a BC survivor on top of all that\u2026 I'm actually grieving for the loss of that aspect of my relationship with dh. My libido was never up to par with dh's, but we had a good sex life until this fall. He hasn't initiated anything since Oct. and I won't make the first move-- it would be devastating to him if he couldn't perform. (Sorry, TMI!)  D1- WELL SAID! Tina- hope the house showings go well today. I don\u2019t envy you in having to keep the house ship-shape all the time. I imagine it helps that your boys are out of the house. Our house looks pretty good with the exception of the kids\u2019 rooms. CHJ- Go Ravens!! I\u2019m all over the Jewels FUBC Reunion Tour (how apt, Vettegal!). Hopefully, my life will cooperate and allow me to participate.   Sorry again for the length. If you\u2019re still here at this point, you deserve a medal for making it thru this post! Paula",

I\u2019ve only experienced one winter of living in a sub-zero climate. I don\u2019t think I was ever warm the winter that I lived in Finland! It\u2019s prob. -10 or lower there now\u2026 We came home right after Ed finished his chemo. Had good traveling weather\u2014sunny skies until we hit WV. Ran into some snow, but it was just starting so no worries. I\u2019m glad we came home last night. Dh is feeling yucky today. (We all remember how that feels, right?) This is his first foray into IV chemo. I\u2019ve worked out a plan with a dear neighbor for the short-term. We\u2019re going to try hourly checks on dh, since he\u2019s physically able to care for himself and spends the greatest part of his day resting in the recliner watching the tube\u2026 If that isn\u2019t enough, I\u2019ve got some contacts for a full-time caregiver. Now, to catch up on the Jewels\u2026 LJ- I spoke too soon, huh? I\u2019m glad you\u2019re almost finished.  After I read your post I looked back at our treatment list. Quite of few Herceptin gals in our group\u2026 you, Cathy, Kathy, Jenn, and JackieB (haven\u2019t heard from Jenn or Jackie in forever\u2014anyone know how they\u2019re doing?).  Are you coming to Vegas? I\u2019d love to be able to put a face with that hand! D1- some mysterious spotting, huh? How many SE\u2019s can one woman have? ((Hugs)) I\u2019ve never seen Bette Midler, but love her feisty attitude. I could use a dose of The Divine Miss M right now\u2026 Patty- hope you\u2019ve got your layers on today\u2014 brrrrr! Sounds like you\u2019re the Vegas expert here. I love reading about your adventures there. CHJ- I love the banter between you and Patty on your football teams. I\u2019m not a big football fan, but watch with dh. If I had to pick a team, it would be the Browns and they\u2019ve not had a good year in decades(?).  Lots of Steelers fans in this area\u2026 Kimberly- hoping that you\u2019ve regained your voice by now. Sounds like you could have used a couple of snow days\u2026 Kathy- how nice of your co-workers to recognize all that you\u2019ve gone through and throw you a party! LOL at your dh\u2019s libido remarks. I\u2019m a little nostalgic for those days right now, but I recall when they were annoying\u2014 like in the middle of cooking dinner, at 5am (not a morning person, but dh is), etc. Retinal hemorrhages? What the @#$ is up with that? Oh, bother! Sherry- good news on the raise. Hope the training goes smoothly. Julie- hope you ended up with a snow day today, but since you haven\u2019t posted yet, I assume not. TGIF! Cathy- great job, throwing out some good ideas for the Jewels reunion! OK\u2026 guess I have to end this post. The laptop is \u201cannoying\u201d dh. Sheesh! I sympathize on the one hand, but on the other hand I\u2019m thinking WTF? I\u2019m sitting in the family room where dh watched tv non-stop through my chemo\u2026 if it bothered me, I just shuffled off to bed\u2026 humph! Later, Paula",

If you're interested in joining us, perhaps we can get acquainted? Tell us a bit about yourself-- I checked out your profile and see that you've done a mast and chemo, and still in rads, but past the halfway mark.   We are still very much in the early planning phase of our trip.

I'm trying to be nice and share with my family, but I'm tempted to hide those JellyBellys... dd has her sticky fingers in the jelly beans right now! We had snow and ice and school was cancelled today. Dale and I worked on scholarship apps for a while, did some laundry, read a little, and wrote a 50 item test for one of my classes.  We already have a 2-hour delay for tomorrow-- it is sleeting outside right now and the roads are a mess. Wouldn't be surprised if school is cancelled altogether again... we are under a flood watch again and more snow/sleet is expected thru the night.   I've spent quite a bit of time on Facebook uploading pictures, which is surprisingly simple. I've got over 100 pics up and it didn't take long at all to accomplish.  Sherry- I think that whole poking thing on FB is overrated, don't you? LOL  Even though I've embraced the whole FB thing, I can understand that moving our LV discussion there might be prohibitive (is that a word?) to some of our group. Although, like Kimberly, I like the idea of continuing our friendships in a non-cancer-related venue.  D1, could we post the trip details in your header (or whatever you call your post at the top)? That way it would be on every page. I don't suppose anyone has gotten sentimental about seeing all of our treatment info, have they?! That would keep those who don't want to get into Facebook \"in the know\"... whaddaya think, Jewels? Kimberly- I have the same problems with some of the kids in my classes. Sometimes it takes that phone call home to get them back on track... sadly, that doesn't even work for a few. It is frustrating-- seems as if I spend a lot of time trying to motivate kids who don't want to be motivated...  Just read about your good results-- except for the one parent with the 'tude... there's one in every bunch!  Julie- glad you made it home safely! Looks like you're going to get hit by this latest storm coming through... Deb and Therese- you're both in the middle of the bad weather, too. Stay safe out there! Carol- I think we might need another pair of BGP... these are getting a little threadbare from all the use they're getting these days! I thought about you today out there in the cold weather. Hope you're home relaxing by the fire this evening.  Okay, I took the JellyBellys away from dd and now I'm going to have to go put them up before I eat them all... later! Paula ",
