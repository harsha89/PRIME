      "Content": "Heidi207 wrote: Good morning ladies, I'm wondering about scans (PET and Bone) after surgery. Have been receiving conflicting opinions from several doctors and am seeking information about how it worked for you. An oncologist literally told me yesterday that if she submits a scan request with the reason being \"breast cancer\" they will absolutely find something on a PET scan. Then if we repeat the scan several months later it will probably be clear. She did not recommend the scans but told me she would do so at my request, then cautioned me to the results. So, my questions are: Did you have scans post-surgery? How soon afterwards? Did your doctor automatically recommend these or did you have to request it? And of course did they find something?  Your present circumstances don't determine where you can go; they merely determine where you start.

Though I've had more than a few crying jags over the past few weeks I had my first real meltdown last night.My surgery is next Friday (4/20) and I'm both anxious and terrified. I have rhuematoid arthritis and I hit my hand {hard} on the counter last night so I let out a yelp ..... well that turned into a full-blown Banshee scream! Surprised the neighbors didn't come running. My dog took of down the hall and hid under his blanket. I then dissolved into a puddle on the floor and bawled for about 10 minutes. When I could barely breath I had to stop and pick myself up. I feel ever so much better now cause I just needed to get it out of my system. I susepct we all need a \"moment\" now and then ..... but it's nice to know I am not the only crazy gal out there!",
