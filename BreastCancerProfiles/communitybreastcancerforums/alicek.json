Seems to me I got off easily; I thank my lucky stars each time I read these stories. My last check-up, the doctor felt \"something\", thinks it may be just scar tissue but wants to do an ultrasound. I'm travelling right now and can't do it until two months from now. Am I playing with faith? Trusting my luck too much? How quickly does this thing grow/recur? Please tell me I'm not being stupid! My first mammogram in May was OK.",
