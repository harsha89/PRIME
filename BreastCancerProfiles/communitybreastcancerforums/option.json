If it were me, I probably would prefer to rest the day on and after the treatment, as i slept quite a bit those days (the steroid didn't affect my sleep too much either). Maybe you can check with your MO if you start on, say Friday, and see how things go for you, and then if needed switch to a Monday or Wednesday, would that be a big problem -- that will give you some flexibility in figuring out what your own responses are like. Sweetheartin TX, hope everything is fine. My heart racing only happens a few times randomly, and seems to have gone these days (knock on wood).",

I'm hoping they can recover in time and get me through the treatment.  I'm also terrified about the chemo brain, like some of the previous posts mentioned. Need my brain to find another job after all of this. I had 3 anethesia in the past few weeks, and I think I'm already starting to be forgetful.  Saw some mentioning about icing fingers and toes.

MO was open to discuss dose reduction, but I kept it the same. Reoccurance is more scary to me, and as long as the symptoms don't get a lot worse, I find it still manageable. The tingling and nerve pain is probably worse around Day 4 and 5, and then gets better. Does anyone know if the neuropathy symptoms will get worse after chemo stops?",

In my view, it's good to be tested and know for sure.  For the BRAC test, I did a mouth rinse not a blood test. Anyone also did the testing without drawing blood?",
