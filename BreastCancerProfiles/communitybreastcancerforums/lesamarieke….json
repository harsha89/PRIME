The pathology report is where you will find the answers. That is where I had to find mine. I had to figure it out for myself, and I did with help from the net and family. I was devastated when I figured mine out. I could not believe that my surgeon did not know what stage or anything. Anyway I am triple negative and stage IV. I have mets in my lungs. And I had to ask for my scans as well.....You have to be your own Advocate. ......Of course I am not upset with my Dr. he is only human.......Besides it's not his fault. I am here if you need someone. .....Lesa Marie",
