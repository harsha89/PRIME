Our Ontario Health does cover some of the cost, otherwise they are about $400.00 each**",

      "Content": "Justjay wrote: Hello to all, I had a saline implant put in 30 yrs ago, in my right breast only. Prior to that, at the age of 15yrs, I had a silicone one put in because I was radiated as a newborn, my last treatment, I was left under radiation far too long & severely burned. Teen years I was competetive in swimming & my Doc. recommended the implant so I would not feel ashamed of my body in a Speedo suit. The silicone one ruptured due to a motor vehicle accident, it was removed in 1989 & replaced by a saline one. Fast forward to today, my implant is painful with lumps & appears smaller in size. Mar.29/2019, U.S. & mammo revealed irregularularites but no determination what the lumps are. My Family Doc. referred me to a Plastic Surgeon, she initially denied the referral & asked me to return to my orginal surgeon. My orig. P.S. has retired. So, now the new P.S has accepted my referral but my appt. isn't until October 7th, 2019. 6 months from now! I live in Canada & our system is often terrible. I was hoping to at least get my lumps checked. ANY suggestions would be appreciated. Log in to post a reply",

I discovered a burning sensation about 3 months ago. 2 months ago i discovered unusual lumps, discomfort & 4 lumps now.They appear to be attached to each other, except for one. My husband urged me to get it checked out as he noticed my right breast was almost flat & reddish in one area. I was told years ago, I don't have developed lymph nodes. My Doc just said your US shows a previous mascectomy (which I never had) & some lumps which might need investigting. I will ask him for the US & Mammo results from my Doc to see if silicone nodules were mentioned. Sincerely, Janine",
