I had a BMX about a year ago with reconstruction using form stable (gummi bear) implants.  I deeply regret going this route - turns about that I only had a VERY small tubular carcinoma (a very benign form of BC).  Had the BS, or my oncologist told me that this was a possibility - I would never have had a BMX. No one bothered to read the pathology report from the biopsy - if they had, and told me about tubular carcinoma - I also would have elected to have a lumpectomy.  Radiation isn't indicated with this type of breast cancer. As you can probably tell, I'm still fairly angry with my level (or lack) of care.  Anyway -  if there's even a chance that removing them will help with this tightness - I'll do it. ",
