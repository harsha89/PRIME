      "Content": "MLScott wrote: My wife is about a year out of surgery (non-cancerous bilateral skin sparing mx). She went through the expanders and implants and had multiple unplanned surgeries due to complications. Unfortunately, that seems like it's not the end of it. One of her implants flipped. You actually can see a circular impression on her skin -- where they fill the implant. She has been reticent to have it fixed because it's yet another surgery but (1) that breast has pain (obviously not the breast itself), and (2) that breast is flat rather than rounded since the implant is reversed. She and I are not really worried about appearance but we are both worried about the pain. We heard from a nurse today that her pain might be caused by capsular contracture due to having the flipped implant. Basically, even more scar tissue. QUESTIONS!... 1. Has anyone in the community had an implant flip? What did you/they do? 2. Any specific pain management that you might recommend? I know this is pretty specific but if we can avoid another surgery it would be welcomed at this point. Thank you! Log in to post a reply",

That's a nice indirect way. Hopefully he'll get a vote. Will also check Yelp. Didn't know that people review docs there. To answer some questions: Yes, he did spend a fair amount of time with us. And he did answer our questions. It was just the cockiness that got me. And that he was really really late. But I know that happens at a hospital. ",

She'll have the surgery at UCSF, which is generally very well regarded for medical care and cancer research. That said, I'm wondering how to know whether the plastic surgeon is top notch. When we met with him there were a few red flags in my mind but maybe they are nothing? Specifically: Attitude -- he seemed pretty cocky. maybe that's not uncommon. thoughts? He talked about how he has pioneered this or that (I think when he was talking about the use of alloderm, though I'd need to look back on notes) So when thinking about him as a \"cocky pioneer\" I'm wanting to make sure he really knows his stuff and people have had good experiences with him. What I know so far: Nothing bad shows up on the california medical board He has pretty mixed reviews on the various review sites out there (e.g. Realself and similar) but frankly, a lot of what's written sounds kind of fake. Is there any way to get past patients to give us the real story on his work? Is it common (or offensive) to ask a doctor for patient references? Neither of us have ever had surgery so the whole process is new to us. Log in to post a reply",
