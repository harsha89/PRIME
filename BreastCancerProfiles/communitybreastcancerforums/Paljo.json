Stage 3c and 14 of 19 positive nodes. this time last year i thought i had a death sentence from looking at all the stats. One year later my attitude has certainly changed. Some people thought i was crazy to subject my body to more surgery but I plan on being here for a long time, yet so I may as well have a set of boobs.Â  Wishing you all well.....and keep posting the psotive stories.....i love them.",

I thought I was stage 2 and it really through me for a loop when my oncologist told me i was stage 3. I can't seem to get my head around it at all. I don't know why I am so hung up on the stage 3 diagnosis. I just had my second of six chemo treatments yesterday. This will be followed by 25 radiation treatments. I had a radical modified mastectomy on October 20th, 2010. I understand that I will be on tamoxifen for ten years, also. My question is....\"when do you ever get to the point that cancer does not occupy your every waking thought?\" I feel so overwhelmed. I really didn't think that I would be diagnosed with cancer at 49. No history of BC in my family, non smoker, healthy lifestyle.",
