They also cannot have bp's, needle sticks or anything that restricts blood flow to the affected arm. I teach them to just hold out the correct arm when they see a bp cuff heading their way. I second Kira's comment on the electronic medical record, Often a MD order can be entered into the record (often by the nurse). Depending on the electronic medical record, that order may appear on lab requisitions so the tech may know not to use a certain arm. It might be worth asking if an order can me entered into the computer. Just another possiblilty. I suppose I am more likely to ask a patient which arm to use. When i had surgery I put kinseotape on my LE arm as an added barrier and wrote in surgical marker \"no ivs or bps'",

You have to make the decision that you can live with after you have all the information and research. Thats what it boiled down to for me. I do not regret it at all. I am 10 days post op.  there were many factors in my decision. I am 44 and pre menopausal. My mother and grandmother have bc. I didn't feel I could deal with the surveillance in the future or more surgery if the margins were not clean. I wanted to reduce my risk of recurrance as much as I could.  My breasts were never that important to me. The surgeons job is to remove the cancer safely. Mine is to heal now wiht the help of my partner, son and friends. Nicole",

I have been using the UA compression tanks when I exercise, ride my horse and sometimes to sleep when I can stand it. I should sleep in them more. I haven't noticed any differences in the colors in regards to compression but most of mine are dark colored except for one. I buy them at the UA outlet store. I just bought a new one a few weeks ago and noticed it was longer. ",

I thought working 3 consecutive 12hrs shifts was tiring but that was nothing. I was going back to work last week but had a pelvic mass removed (benign!) and total abdominal hysterectomy instead. So not back to work for awhile. Time was the biggest factor I think. I also finally started eating better. When I got the ok to exercise that helped. It goes without saying you have to rule out anything physical first if the fatigue continues. When I go to the oncologist, they ask to rate fatigue as well as pain.",

I am working per diem right now. My employer has kept me per diem but I lost my scheduled hours. I appreciated the support. I hope to get 24hrs when it is available. So many things about breast cancer are cruel. I try to manage the LE with extra manual drainage, wearing the sleeve and glove when not working and wrapping at night if needed. I also work per diem  in a transplant office and can wear the sleeve there. I usually wear a scrub jacket so the sleeve is not visible. My hand LE is well controlled now so I can get away with wearing just the sleeve. I am doing alot of soul searching and am not really sure what I want to do. It is a terrible time to be job searching as we all know so from a practical standpoint, I will stay where I am for now.",

Now, I have numbness under both axillas and r upper arm at times. I have odd sensations to my chest at times such as twinges, cool and tingling. I have 2 jackson pratt drains. I declined reconstruction. If you are unsure, you should talk with a plastic surgeon pre op. If you are certain about no reconstruction, talk with the surgeon about the anticipated appearance of your chest.  Also are you having a sentinal node sampling during surgery? Another consideration is a pre op PT eval and expectations for post op PT. I was a bit unprepared for the emotional reaction after surgery. I went home 12hrs after my surgery. On the second post op day I was an emotional wreck and it was hard for me to give in to it but important to do so.  My partner and friends were amazingly supportive. I couldn't have gotten thru this without them. I am truly blessed to have such wonderful people in my life. Anyway, this is my experience. I agree with KAK that you need to feel confident and comfortable in your decisions. Take care and let others help you",
