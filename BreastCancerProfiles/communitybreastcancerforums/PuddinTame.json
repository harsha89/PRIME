Thank goodness I didn't go the expander route.  I can't imagine accomodating anything under this skin. Thanks for your insight. Lori Log in to post a reply",

I opted not to have immediate reconstruction.  I can't get a DIEP locally and will have to go at least as far as Dallas (2 hours) to get it.   I could have done a TRAM locally, but would have had to change surgeons and go to a hospital I don't trust.  It wouldn't have been worth that even if I'd wanted a TRAM.  I did visit with a PS that was new to the area and new to the hospital I used.  He was creepy and didn't listen to me and tried to push expanders/implants. He said I could pursue another reconstructoin option if that failed. :|  I couldn't get out of there fast enough.  The PS I'm considering for DIEP said that he wouldn't be involved in the cancer surgery or try to influence incisions or anything like that.  His office said the first priority is curing the cancer however the breast surgeon thinks is appropriate.  Then, when that's done, he'll work with what he gets from that. I kind of admired that thinking.  Cure my cancer and worry about reconstruction later.  You wouldn't want compromises made during the cancer surgery in order to ensure a better result in reconstruction. At least I wouldn't. Blessings to you! Lori",

It hurts.  I might have to go get a cami to use the the puffy in--something looser--to wear for a while at work.  I got two vests and a zip jacket.  I already had a couple of cardigans. But I might need a few more things--or maybe not since I work from home part of the time.  I do need to take advantage of the sales, though.  Since I only had a single mx, you can definitely tell when I'm not wearing something.  I went to church last night without the bra and wore a zip jacket but also felt self conscious and kep my coat on as well. Thanks for giving me more to think about.  I need to go assess my clothing situation before next Monday. :)",
