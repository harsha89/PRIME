I'm going to Florida on Tuesday so will look for it there if I can't find it here. I've been using prevacid 30 mg the last few days and it's helped. I'm also starting to think that the tightness in my chest (since mastectomy) might have something to do with my problem. Who knows.  Thanks again.  When I can get some of the acidophilus I'll let you know how it works.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed.",

I have a bit of difficulty swallowing but the problem I have is a burning that goes from the back of my throat to my stomach and very bad acid reflux  (that's what my GP thinks it is). I feel quite nauseated. I wake up with very bad burning in my throat and a lot of burping. It's very uncomfortable and I have trouble sleeping.It also happens when I'm upright but it's not so bad then. My doctor put me on Tecta for the acid reflux but I broke out in big red blotches in my chest area so stopped taking it.  Then I took Zantac and it started doing the same thing. I've tried baking soda and water, ginger tea, the anti-nausea medication I didn't need when I had my chemo and am really watching what I eat. Does anyone else have this?  I'd sure appreciate any suggestions and some one to say that there is hope that this may go away.",
