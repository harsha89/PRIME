Mom done the genetic testing in 2008 and she tested positive for the BRCA2 gene so I knew I needed to be aware that I might get it. I started going to the Cancer Center to have my mammograms three years ago.  This year I went in for my routine mammogram on Jan. 14th.  Two weeks later they called me to tell me they found microcalcifications in the screenings and wanted me to come in for diagnostic screening, that was on Feb. 15, while I was there they ordered an ultrasound as well.  Whatever they saw it was decided I needed to come in for a needle core biopsy on Feb. 22.  On Feb. 24 I got the call to confirm that I had breast cancer in my right breast.  They scheduled me to see a breast cancer surgeon on Mar. 3, he ordered an MRI for Feb. 26th.  The MRI didn't find cancer in my other breast or in my lymph nodes.  He gave me my options, scheduled me to see a plastic surgeon on Mar. 8 and a genetic counselor on Mar. 9 (they did the lab work on Mar. 3 for the genetic tests).  All those appointments behind me I had to make a decision.  Although the cancer was found in only one breast I decided I didn't want to go through all this again.  Whether I test positive for the gene or not does not guarantee I won't get it again.  I mean come on, I have cancer now! So I made the decision to get rid of both of them, we want them to be even right! So what I've found out is that I have invasive breast cancer with ductal and lobular features, stage 1.  I did test positive for the BRCA2 gene.  On April 1st I had a bilateral mastectomy with tissue expanders.  Although I knew I had made the right decision by having them both removed the surgeon only confirmed that fact a week after surgery saying that 2 lymph nodes had been removed from my left breast that showed signs of cancer forming. On April 30th I seen the oncologist and he decided I needed four rounds of chemo, one treatment every three weeks.  Taxotere and Cytoxan.  He ordered a port placement for May 7th.  Let me tell you the IV in the foot is not a pleasant experience!!!  First treatment was May 14th, just three to go.  I don't have too many of the side effects yet..... nausea, constipation, fatigue, muscle pain, headache and I'm currently keeping the mouth sores at bay..... but I've just got started too.  There's a lot of caring and compassionate people on these boards and I've taken comfort in a lot of the posts.  Best wishes to all!",
