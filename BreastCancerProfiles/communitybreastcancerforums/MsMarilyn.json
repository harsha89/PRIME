I just finished up with my chemo on April 12th. So I know this thread really isn't for me but I just wanted to share this with you. It IS a hard road... but it CAN be done.  And I know you've all heard it before but it is true.  And please know that you're NOT alone on your journey, the ladies on this site are so friendly, helpful and we have tons of knowledge and personal experience we can share with you... so come to us that have been there before you.  Sometimes we can help. I've also created a group on Facebook called \"Chemo isn't for Whimps!\"  You can PM me anytime or find me on FB - msmarilyn@ymail.com  (I don't use that email for anything but FB so if you write me there... chances are I won't get it) Takke Care and God Bless, Marilyn",
