My annual mammography of \"unusual structure\" discovery has led, to an ultrasound with a \"less than 1cm\" mass that required a needle biopsy, to the \"need for lumpectomy\" to remove <1cm IDC mass. This explosion has taken all I can muster to keep my mind positive and the play to a minimum. Yesterdays follow up with the BS and a read of the full pathology shows_Triple Positive, node involvement, and a need for a resection or possible mastectomy. It appears that the IDC mass was surrounded by a large DCIS, with additional appearing in the margins! How does one get to that in just a months time? Is this the norm of diagnosis, or should I prepare myself that this is my \"new norm\"? Will it stop now so that we can move forward and slay this beast?

What I am starting to learn on my journey is that the medical community does not fully understand why cancer develops in some and not in others. We all know the risks that increase your odds of getting cancer, but no way of knowing which risk will tip the balance to start the cancer growth~short of having a genetic disposition. So remember that the medical community is human, and therefore not flawless. My mom had post menopause BC in 2001, a maternal aunt the same, but no genetic link. To error on the side of caution for the past 15 years my Dr would include a mammogram(1 or 2 year internals) as part of my health checkup. I can tell you that my diagnosis last month took the wind from my sails, and completely floored my family doctor. There was 15 months between check ups! Was the cancer there earlier? Maybe ~ maybe not. I have moved on from the WHY questions, and spend time and energy on what truly matters NOW. Find a good team that you can trust, learn as much as you can about your mom's cancer and treatment options so you can support her in this fight. There are many sites on the Worldwide Worry Web~use them all with CAUTION, get second opinions if you are not comfortable, ask questions and then ask more questions if you have to. But most of all Love your mom to bits and support her thru this journey. You are an amazing daughter.",
