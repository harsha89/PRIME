My liver function numbers, especially albumin, got out of whack when I was having chemo-induced colitis, which was preventing absorption of protein.  It's really important to watch the albumin, if it gets too low for long, you can get swelling and other problems.   My husband doesn't have cancer, but does have fatty liver disease. His liver function numbers (but not albumin) have been off for years, but he doesn't have liver damage or any symptoms.  ",
