Most doctors will tell you straight up they would be fine with you doing that. Since it is a wellness check proceedure, your insurance should pay for it. If it does not, mammogram and ultrasound cost me $300 out of pocket (mine were diagnostic and my insurance said I was too young to need one) No harm in going in a little earlier if it calms you down : )",

Just is just me.... not that my opinion is really worth all that much.",

I was on antibiotics for a sinus infection and was told that I would need to do another round of one that helps to target breast infections. First thing they ruled out in my case. Took two different breast specific antibiotics in sequence to eliminate it as a possibility. Do give up hope just yet that the meds will work. Ask a close friend or relative that is around you enough but not all the time to see if they notice a difference in your breasts. If you do not want them to know, just tell them you got a new bra and you are unsure of the fit and look. For me, I knew I had some swelling, it was obvious to me, but when I went to my sister in laws house, who knows nothing about what is going on and she asks me why my boob is huge compared to the other, I knew there was an issue.",

Granted each carrier is different and so are the different areas. I have 2 palpable masses. One is spiculated and causes great pain. Birads 5 rating was given by the radiologist with an order for a MRI. Doctor sent in the prior authorization, DENIED. Not enough evidence. several scans and ultrasounds later, different radiologist with the same Birad rating and the same MRI order, two different doctors in two different offices all agreeing, they submitted more evidence of the need, DENIED. Over the course of time, one of my lumps DOUBLED in size. You can see it with your naked eye if I do not have a bra on. My boob is a full cup size bigger than the other side. The evidence is there. I had a biospy, preliminary results should abnormal cell growth. MRI- Denied  Not sure what else we could have done to get them to approve it. Hope you have a better result.  Prayers that everything comes out benign for you! ",
