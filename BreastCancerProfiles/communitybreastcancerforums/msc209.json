    "Content": "Jul 2, 2009 05:13PM - edited Jul 2, 2009 05:15PM by msc209 I haven't really cried yet either. Maybe a fleeting tear or two but not the uncontrollable sob that I know is coming. I have it in both and I read the pathology report, but I don't really know what I'm reading. I too had a sterotactic biopsy and then 2 ultrasound guided biopsies. Turns out it's in both but to what degree? I don't know yet. Had an MRI yesterday and will know more after the holiday weekend. I found out in my hairdresser's chair. The tears rolled down for a second or 2, then I caught myself. I don't want to cry until I have the whole picture. I also think I'm still in shock. It'll be a week tomorrow. I'm 47 & single. No kids. I am trying to be positive but anyone that I tell looks at me so sad. I stopped telling anyone and I won't see my family until I have my full prognosis. I guess we'll see.   I can't help with your info..I haven't a clue yet. I'm sure I'll be an expert in a few weeks though. Good luck seaofhope & everyone else on here.. Michele in FL ",
