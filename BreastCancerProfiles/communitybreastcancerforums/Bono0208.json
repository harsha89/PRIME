I am 27 years old and my husband noticed a lump on my breast a couple of weeks ago.  It feels a lot like a marble and is moveable.  I scheduled an appointment right away and the NP thought it might be a cyst and scheduled me for a mammogram and ultrasound.  I went to both and the Radiologist thought it could be a fibroadenoma but confirmed it wasn't fluid filled and was a solid round mass.  He also found a complex cyst, that I could not feel but the ultrasound detected.  I am scheduled for a biopsy and aspriation tomorrow and am extrememly stressed out by this whole experience.  Hoping for benign results.
