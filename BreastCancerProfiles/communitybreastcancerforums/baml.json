The radiologist did tell me that there was a slight \"asymetric density\" in my left breast and he wants me to come back in 4-6 months for another mammogram, but he said neither one showed a lump. My lump has not gone away and it is irregular shaped....It is hard to explain the shape...it's slightly mobile and very firm, smooth edges.  It is shaped a little bit like a string bean, only not as long.  I am pretty sure it has grown a bit lengthwise but has not gotten any more wide....super hard to explain. In the last few days I have noticed that my left underarm is sore...not my armpit exactly, more like right next to the armpit, between my brastrap and armpit if that makes sense.  If I touch it, it is quite tender and I do feel a small (pea size) lump or two that I am afraid might be lymph nodes, however when I have read about swollen axillary lymph nodes, it usually mentions that they are larger, like a marble and very hard.  Anyone have experience with tender but not largely swollen axillary lymph nodes associated with a lump and then breast cancer diagnosis?  I really have a bad feeling about the lump and have for a couple of months, and then now this...really gets me nervous.  Thank you in advanced for your time and responses!

I noticed a lump in my left breast in September 2012.  I am 36.  I had a mammo and ultrasound in December (4 mos ago).  The mammo showed an \"asymmetrical density\" in the left breast where the lump is.  The ultrasound did not show any abnormal breast tissue.  I was told to come back for another diagnostic mammo in 4-6 mos for the asymmetrical density issue. I had my second mammo and ultrasound on Monday, April 22.  The mammo (done in 3D this time) showed more asymmetrical density in the same area (repeat mammo suggested again in 4 mos) and showed a new group of calcifications (also recommended to come back in 4-6 months for that).  The lump still did not show on ultrasound. The radiologists even did the ultrasound himself and felt the lump and asked a lot of questions and was very thorough.  The lump is behind and to the side of my left nipple.  It was described by the radiologist in his reports as a palpable lump/linear ridge.  It is kind of long (not round), shaped like a large mike-n-ike candy, very hard, and it does move around somewhat. I was sort of given the option of a surgical biopsy or a breast MRI, but it was recommended to wait another 4-6 months and repeat the mammo/us.  I am trying to be reassured that it did not show on ultrasound, but still feel worried about it.  Especially because of the density in the same area and the new group of calcifications they found. What would be your recommended steps from here?  Surgical biopsy, MRI, or surveillance? Thank you for taking the time to read this! Log in to post a reply",

The Bi-Rads 3 was only for the new group of calcifications.  He did not give a Bi-Rads for the asymmetrical density issue (although 4 months ago he gave it a 3...that was my first mammo) nor did he give a number for the palpable lump. When reporting on the asymmetrical density issue, he wrote that once again there was an asymmetrical density on the left breast in the area of the palpable lump and after spot compression no visible lump was found and therefore was \"more likely\" benign.  He wants to recheck that AGAIN in 4 months.  That was why I had the second diagnostic mammogram to check that....so I'm thinking maybe he didn't like the way it looked or maybe it is something he will always want monitored?? The report also said that I have heterogenously dense breast, which I know means that they are 51-74 % dense.  The report the first time did not say anything about density besides the asymmetrical density issue.  I know that the fact that the lump does not show on ultrasound is a very good thing.  I know that asymmetrical density is probably nothing.  I know that a new group of calcifications is probably nothing.  I just still have the lump and these other issues are in the same spot as the lump so I'm not as reasured (sp?) as I would like to be.  These mammograms and ultrasounds cost me over $800 each time.  I don't want to have another one in 4 months and then they tell me we should do a biopsy or MRI and pay for that too.  But it seems a bit over the top to biopsy something that isnt' showing up on ultrasound? Wish the darn lump would go away!",

I have decided to go ahead and get a biopsy of the lump that doesn't show up and a biopsy on the microcalcifications.  I figure if I'm going to have one biopsy, I might as well have another just to make sure everything is ok.  I have read different stories of younger women (I'm 36) who have more advanced stages of the disease because it is harder to diagnose at younger ages and because doctors have the \"wait and see\" mentality with younger women.  I realize this is because the odds are definitely in my favor but I am not comfortable with the amount of \"issues\" that I have going on in the left breast.  Best to just be sure if you ask me. Thank you again for your reply and I am so glad for you that the turmors were found when they were stage 1!",

Quick history: palpable lump on left breast, I'm 36 years old, mammogram showed \"slight density\" and I have been advised to come back in 4-6 mos for a follow-up mammo, ultrasound showed nothing at all.  The radiologist did not try to feel for the lump and asked me if I found it or my dr. found the lump...not sure he really believed me that I had one. The lump has grown a bit in the last few weeks.  It's very odd shaped and seems to be growing longer (it's and odd long shape, smooth edges, very firm, and seems moveable a bit).  Anyway, a few days ago I found a very hard, small (about the size of a pea or slightly bigger) bump on my left collar bone.  It is about 1/2 - 1 inch from the inside end of the clavicle (close to the throat side).  It feels like it is attached to the bone in the hollow of the collar bone.  Everything I read makes this thing seem very scary. Anyone else notice this kind of thing?  I tried to make an appt on Friday with the doctor but the 31st was the earliest they had. I called back later and asked them to leave a msg w/ my doctor with my symptoms and they called right back and she magically fit me in for tomorrow afternoon.  Must have raised a red flag with her too.  I'm scared.  Log in to post a reply",

If only I didn't have the stupid breast lump that is so wierd shaped.  Or if only I didn't have the hard bone-like lump on the left collar bone.  Or if it were tender and soft like a lymph node is supossed to be.  If it were just one lump I had I would feel better. And your advice is good and needs to be taken....I google WAY TOO MUCH!  It's so hard not to!  Since there is nothing I can do about any of it today anyway, I will stay off of google today and go to my appointment tomorrow with a list of questions for an actual doctor!",

I had that mammogram, along with an ultrasound today.  The lump did not show up on either test. The radiologist did tell me that I have some \"assymetrical breast tissue\" and that he wants me to come back in 4-6 months for another mammogram due to the assymetrical breast tissue.  I am not sure he actually believes that I have a palpable lump as I am only 36.  Should I request further testing?  Or do mammograms and ultrasounds always show a cancerous lump?
