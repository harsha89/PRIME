Chemo and radiation went extremely well. I was able to work an continue doing my chores. Until April 2015. I was diagnosed with bone mets. I feel I have been living a lie: so positive thinking everything would be fine. Hoe do you cope with everyday life? I have a 5 year old son I watch everyday and can't imagine him losing his mom. In particular because my husband's mother and father passed away 2012 and 2013. And my dad 2014. It is just way too much. Any suggestions for the pain. It is not that intense but constant. I've just had enough of all this. It helps listening good stories. Hope you all are feeling better everyday Cyber hugs",
