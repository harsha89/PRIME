      "Content": "Momof6kds wrote: OK so here is the scoop and time line. In October 2016 I had my regular breast exam and nothing was found. Moving forward to early December I find a small hard deep lump in my right breast at the 11:00 location and nonpainful. My PCP sends me for a mammogram and nothing is seen (fibrous breasrs). Next an ultrasound where they see it but tell me it's a very small (3mm) hemangioma and to come back in 3 months. As soon as my PCP received the ultrasound report she insisted I see a surgeon. The surgeon ordered an MRI. Today I get the call from the nurse that I do in fact have a 2.8 cm mass and will need a punch biopsy. Needless to say I'm a little freaked out (OK a lot). With a mass that is 2.8 cm could it still be just a benign lump? I just need a little reassurance. I do have breast cancer on both sides of my family. Two aunts and a grandmother. This wait is killing me. Hilary Log in to post a reply",
