I found one I really liked at a store I had not been to before, and figured it might be a little overpriced, but later found out it was double the price of most other stores. This wasn't even a store that bills insurance for you. I called them & innocently asked if I may have been over charged. She looked it up & said no. I told them it was double what others charge, she said 'that's the price' ... I told her I won't be back. I feel I need to do more to prevent other more innocent people from getting ripped off. It particulary disturbs me because the breast center at the hosptial where I work has flyers there for their store. Any suggestions about how to handle this? Log in to post a reply",
