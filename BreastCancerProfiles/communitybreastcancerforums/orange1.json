[ES9-3] Balancing Risks of Deconditioning vs. Weight-Lifting for Breast Cancer Survivors. Schmitz KH, Cheville A, Ahmed RL, Troxel A. University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN Background Clinical guidelines for breast cancer survivors with and at-risk for lymphedema have advised against upper body exercise, preventing them from obtaining established health benefits of weight-lifting. The primary hypotheses of the Physical Activity and Lymphedema Trial were that lymphedema onset and worsening would not differ after a one-year weight-lifting intervention compared to no exercise among survivors at risk for and with breast cancer-related lymphedema. Methods We performed a randomized controlled trial of a twice- weekly progressive weight-lifting intervention involving 141 breast cancer survivors with stable arm lymphedema at study entry and 154 survivors at-risk for lymphedema at study entry. Treatment group participants were provided a gym membership and 13 weeks of supervised instruction; the remaining nine months were unsupervised. Control group participants were provided the intervention after study completion. The primary outcome was the change in arm swelling at one year, as measured by water volumetry of the affected and unaffected arms. Secondary outcomes included the clinician defined incidence of onset and exacerbations of lymphedema, lymphedema symptoms, and muscle strength. Participants with lymphedema were required to wear a well-fitted compression garment while weight-lifting. Results Among the women who entered the study with lymphedema, the proportion who experienced a 5% or greater increase in arm swelling (interlimb difference) was similar in the treatment and control groups (11 % versus 12%; cumulative incidence ratio [95% confidence interval], 1.00 (0.88 to 1.13) As compared with the control group, the women in the intervention group with lymphedema had greater improvements in self-reported lymphedema symptom severity (p=0.03), and a lower incidence of lymphedema exacerbations as assessed by a certified lymphedema specialist (14% versus 29% in the control group, p= 0.04). Among the women who entered the study without lymphedema, more control than treatment group women experienced lymphedema onset defined by 5% increase in interlimb difference (17 versus 11%, p = 0.35). Among higher risk women (5+ lymph nodes removed), this comparison was statistically significant (22 versus 7%, p=0.04). Clinician-defined BCRL onset occurred in 1 treatment and 3 control group women (p=0.62). Conclusions Slowly progressive weight-lifting had no significant impact on arm swelling among breast cancer survivors with lymphedema, and resulted in a reduced incidence of lymphedema flares and improvement in symptoms. In breast cancer survivors at risk for lymphedema, a program of slowly progressive weight-lifting, compared with no intervention, did not result in increased incidence of lymphedema. In secondary analyses, women with 5+ nodes removed who did weight-lifting were less likely to experience increases in arm swelling.

[P5-13-04] Use of Bisphosphonates in the Adjuvant Setting for Breast Cancer - A More Than 10 Years Single Centre Experience. Jakob A, Groh U, Schwoerer D, Schattenberg A, Siebers JW Background: Adjuvant therapies for early breast cancer are associated with substantial decrease in bone mineral density. Bisphosphonates are antiresorptive agents that have an established role in preventing skeletal morbitity in patients with bone metastases and in the treatment of osteoporosis. It has also been shown that these agents are active in preventing cancer treatment induced bone loss in women with early stage breast cancer. Recently, several trials have demonstrated that bisphosphonates may exert anticancer effects in the adjuvant setting. Patients and methods: Since 1997 we treated an increasing number of unselected patients with early breast cancer with bisphosphonates (up to 2009: 1144 out of 1876 patients). There was no significant difference in the two patient groups concerning tumour size, nodal status, hormone receptor (HR) expression, HER-2 expression and adjuvant treatment modalities. In most cases we used zoledronic acid, but also clodronate ibandronate or alendronate. Results: Disease-free survival (DFS) was significant better in patients treated with bisphosphonates (p = 0.009). This was also true in the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor positive disease (p=0.0011) and even more striking in patients with N+ disease (p=0.00003). There was no significant difference in DFS in patients with hormone receptor negative disease. In our analyses especially patients with N+ and ER/PR+ disease showed a significant advantage from treatment with bisphosphonates. Conclusion: This large single centre experience demonstrates a significant improvement of disease-free survival in patients with breast cancer treated with bisphosphonates in the adjuvant setting. The benefit was more pronounced in the subgroup of nodal positive and hormone receptor positive disease.",
