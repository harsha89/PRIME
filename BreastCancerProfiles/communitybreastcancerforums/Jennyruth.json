I have been so good at staying strong and positive -- I had only cried a couple of times -- Day of Diagnosis and maybe once or twice thereafter. However, today is an entirely different story. I have my first Chemo Session tomorrow and nothing seems to be going right today. The Oncology Center had called my RX's in to Caremark on 12/23 for Odansetron and Dexamethasone and the Port Cream. They have not arrived- so I will have to get another RX for each for enough to hold me over when I go tomorrow. Should have used local Pharmacy which I am doing for the Neulesta. Anyway, I really did not need this hassle on top of being so apprehensive about tomorrow. Even if I had not had to deal with the RX mixup, I suppose that something else would have set me off -- I am usually a very strong person and it is really out of character for me to be so weepy!! I have an appointment for Echocardiogram at 10:45 AM with Chemo Session following. Hopefully, once I experience the \"unknown\", I will regain that strong positive attitude.  I referred to the Forum on this Site regarding supplies and I followed her suggestions in setting up a little Chemo Bag with all the aids that I may need to help calm various side effects -- so let the battle begin!!!!!! Thanks to all for letting me vent. I will let you know how it goes.",

She put her arms around me and we cried together -- she said \"Mom, we will get through this together\". She is a Nurse and within days of the diagnosis she used all her skills to get me an appointment with the best surgeon and best oncologist that she could find. She made calls to my primary physician - to the American Cancer Society - found the Sarah House in Syracuse where Breast Cancer Patients and their families can stay at no charge. She made arrangements for a free wig and hats from the American Cancer Society, a wig from a Beauty Spa in Syracuse and she has me signed up for Feel Good Look Good Seminar. She is a very loving and caring lady -- she spends the majority of her time doing for others. She has such wisdom and can bring comfort to those who are in need of it. So, anyway -- with all that she has to offer, I told her that I felt she would be most welcome. So - let's hear it for my partner - Kim (I love you Kim)",

She is such an angel and always looking to help and comfort anyone in her radar. I had my Neulesta last evening at 6. I took the Claritin -- so just waiting and hoping for good results. No problem with foods so far. Feel a little tired at times but not fatigue. Thanks to everyone on the hair comments -- I am going to call today about the shorter cut -- and get accustommed to the wigs/hats. Hopefully this will not be a crisis for me. I would like to hear about -- avoiding crowds, etc. -- what about groc stores, church, restaurants -- what can we do safely. I understand there is a vulnerable period around 7 -10 days following a session. Please let me know your experience and opinion. Thanks so much to everyone.",

      "Content": "Jan 6, 2012 06:15AM Jennyruth wrote: My Echo Cardiogram Appointment was at 10:45 AM 1/5 in Syracuse but we headed out early in consideration of the weather. There were some rough spots near Mexico and Parish. However we still arrived at 9:00 AM. Once we registered, I figured I would go to the Heart Unit and see if they could fit me in early which they did. My good old heart passed the test for Chemo. My Onocologist/Chemo appointment was for Noon but I figured we would see if I could get in sooner -- no such luck. First of all, Dr. Lemke is booked solid -- and the morning chemo patients are still occupying the Fusion Rooms. So, we played the waiting game which heightened my anxiety and was a real challenge for Ed to retain his patience for my sake. However, once we were called it, it was like I was the only patient in the whole would. I have never seen so much skill, professionalism, caring and attention given in a Medical Facility. I first saw Shari (my Nurse Practitioner) who answered 11 of the 13 Questions I had typed out. She is the type that you bond with the first time you meet her. As we talked I mentioned that I am just one of many to her while, to me, she is part of single life experience --- so I asked how she manages to make me feel like her only patient. She said that she puts herself in the patient's place and makes every effort to individualize each one as if they were the only one.  Anyway it helped. Some of her answers: Tylenol preferred for discomfort. I told her that I heard that if you take Claritin before and after the Neulesta Shot, that it could help with the bone pain - she said that she has a chemo patient who did not take it for her first session and had bone pain and upon hearing about Claritin, she took it for her second session and NO bone pain. My plan is one the night of chemo, one the morning of the shot and 2 mornings thereafter.. She said that Biotene Mouth Wash & Dry Mouth Gum is okay. Soft Toothbrush - no Flossing - and Sensodyne Toothpaste is okay. No Dental work during Chemo. Orajel Antiseptic Rinse is okay for mouth sores but if I get them, she will order BMX for me. Lubricating eye drops for dry eye - NO Visine.  My prescription eye drops will not be affected but my eyes may be affected so I will follow up with my eye doctor thereafter. She said that Eucerin is a good choice for the dry skin that is coming my way. For the heartburn -- Tums, Zantac or OTC Prilosec. Shari is a very attractive professional lady -- but when she left the room, she took a moment to tell me that I was sweet and gave me a hug -- Now that helps!!!!!!! Next, I saw Dr. Lemke who has the reputation of the top Oncologist -- another attractive lady who is skilled and compassionate. She told me I can go back on my aspirin regimen but do not take the COQ10 supplement that I have taken with my other vitamins. No matter how busy Dr. Lemke is, when she is with you, you are the only person in the world for her and she gives you all the time you need. She also said kind words on her way out. Next was the Infusion Room - private, heated recliner, heated blanket, TV and chairs for guests. My infusion nurse was Jackie - absolutely devoted to educating her patients and making them comfortable. Of course, I had one more \"pick\" as they accessed my port. It was not bad since I did not have the numbing cream to use ahead of time. I have it for next time. I got 5 bags and 2 huge push syringes. During my infusion, Jackie spent over an hour explaining my chemo drugs (Adriamycin & Cyclophosphamide), Dehyadration, Cancer Fatigue, Fever (if temp goes over 100.4 - I am to call them because it is a sign that something is starting and we have to catch it before it gets into the blood stream due to low white blood count or I could be in REAL REAL trouble), taste changes, mouth sores, vomiting, etc. After my education, she made sure I was comfortable -- there is a little galley kitchen with Soups, Crackers, Snack Bars, Sodas, Coffee, Water, etc. Since we had not eaten, Ed went to the Cafeteria and got me a Turkey Sandwich which I ate while infusing -- no problem, no nausea then or after. I got done about 6 -- checked out -- and got home just before 8 PM -- and too tired to make any phone calls. I really pushed the water so that I could get flushed out -- of course I saw the pink that I was warned about. I am being careful to follow the rule: Toilet Seat Down & Flush Twice. Off to bed for a strange night - slept good at first then woke up suddenly staring at the ceiling. Back to the bathroom to keep the bladder drained - Back to bed -- could not sleep (probably the steroid) -- felt a little twinge of nausea so I took a Lorazepam which can also make you drowsy -- Perfect Combination!! - the nausea was gone and I slept until 6 AM. I was told that my low count days are 7 to 10 days after Chemo -- days where I should be on strict guard --less people contact- no stores, no church, etc. -- cannot be around anyone who might have had a recent live vaccination, etc. The bottom line is for me to be cautious and protect my health throughout Chemo. My hair will fall out in about 2 weeks -- she suggested getting short hair cut now to help the transition and it may hurt less. So those are the details of my first Chemo Session-- it helped me to hear of other people's experience so maybe this will help someone on their way. As most of you know, I was diagnoses with Breast Cancer when my husband was in the hospital with a broken back. He is coming along quite well - still in Brace for another month. Anyway, to add to my first night -- he fell out of bed!!! He is okay but You can bet that I reacted dramatically!!!!! lol ",

Meds controlled nausea. Took Claritin for bone pain. Appettite good. Slept good. Yesterday (4th day after chemo), I felt achy -- very tight pulling in surgical area which was uncomfortable. Had rough spot during night -- a need to cough but throat hurt when coughing (not a sore throat) -- achy -- stomach just a little queasy. Got up -- checked temp (ok)-  took pill for nauseau and Tylenol for discomfort -- and gargled with Oral Jel Antiseptic. Took a little while but things did settle down and I got back to sleep. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced the emphasis of achiness in the surgical area or the cough/throat thing? I have to wonder if the side effects present stronger with each chemo session. Sure wish time would fly the way it used to before I was diagnosed.",
