Eight weeks ago I had a routine mammogram, for which I was recalled for a detailed ultrasound.  The ultrasound showed clusters of cysts, particularly in one area, which they said they would take a sample of fluid from which they would be able to throw away immediately if clear.  Unfortunately the fluid was bloody, so they sent it away for tests which, thank goodness, were clear. I had an ENORMOUS bruise which was about 3 inches long and 2 inches wide and was extremely livid.  This took about a month to fade, but I am still left with what I call a \"shadow\" where the bruise was. Today, seven weeks after the test, that breast, and in particular where the bruise was has become extremely sore and very tender to touch - there is no visible change however.  It hurts to move that arm and to walk etc... Anyone have any ideas or should I be going back to the breast clinic?? Thanks a lot Log in to post a reply",
