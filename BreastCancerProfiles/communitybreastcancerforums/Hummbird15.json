So far I cried once, sitting alone waiting for my first surgical consultation for my BIRAD 5 calcifications in my right breast. The only reason I saw the paperwork was that I was transferring it on a CD from where I did my follow up mammo. I looked at the CD and I Googled it of course. Until then, no one explained the BIRAD class to me and I am wondering why the hell am I in a surgical consult? I am not having surgery. The doctor who reviewed my follow up mammo kept thanking me for coming in, he was just passionate about his job, right? Well, based on my search the odds were not good. Sitting there alone, I was thinking about how I would tell my friends, who I moved away from 2 1/2 years ago. I cracked! I pulled myself together before the surgeon came in, but I felt pretty panicked. She explained it all to me and confirmed the high probability of cancer. Since then my stereotactic biopsy was b9 (yay?) but as my my surgeon is relaying the results she tells me I'm still in the 80% likelihood it's cancer group and I'm like, what? She is clearly still concerned and next week is my lumpectomy to get this mass out. I have been on that \"what if it is\" and \"no it's not\" roller coaster for a month now. Final resolution is over a week out. My concentration is off at work and my patience is very thin at times. Monday is my pre-op, so I may see about some Xanax or something to help with pre-op jitters. I don't see anxiety getting better before then. Until this process I have only had wisdom teeth out, a mole removed and lasik, no real bodily incisions. Very nervous! Only a few select folks know what I am dealing with, no family members yet besides my hubby. I'm also glad to have found this place to mind purge and get more information from real people and not internet stories. To top off the waiting, I have to go back in about 4 months for a follow up mammo on the left breast due to some lesser calcifications. I'm starting to get worn out enough now due to poor sleep and stress that my interest in looking up more information is almost gone. I just hope I get my results before the holiday weekend otherwise I will be sitting and wondering that much longer. What a ride!",

      "Content": "Hummbird15 wrote: In mid March had a baseline mammogram at age 39 with a BIRAD 0 and notes about abnormalities in both breasts. After a follow up mammogram in early April the left breast showed small amounts of calcification with a 6 month re-scan recommended. The mass of calcifications in the right breast triggered a BIRAD 5 classification. Of course, after reading about that, my stress level sky rocketed. Have had some fibrous tissue in this part of breast forever and never had any doctor concerned. Did a stereotactic biopsy with a benign result, but longest days of my life! Surgeon is very strong on removing mass even as benign, but after some questioning said she would consider mammogram in 3 months as first step. I booked the removal procedure but it is 3 weeks away. Is this overkill? Based on biopsy needle size, she says the chance of missing diagnosis is like 5%, but they have unsampled parts of the mass that leave an unknown. I am torn between being stupid and taking chances and also going overboard. The mass is not hard. The number of calcifications is high, surely over 30. She said they stop counting at 10 for diagnosis. Mass is 2.2 cm at largest part. Report calls it florid (aka extensive) usual ductal hyperplasia. There are some other terms referenced also but this one is the one that seems to be the most important. I read it increaseschance of cancer 1.5 to 2 times normal. This is all a bit overwhelming to take in and still make good decisions. Has anyone had a BIRAD 5 1st biopsy be benign then later diagnosed as cancer? Any other experiences with benign BIRAD 5?

Most of you have confirmed my gut reaction to go for the lumpectomy. It is already scheduled, so nothing to change there. I am rather small, 36B so a bit concerned about the cosmetic effect. I'll just have to figure that out. A lady in my high school class is going through chemo now, so seeing her posts is bringing the reality piece into focus. The other consideration is that I would forever be plagued by the question mark and be stuck having the abnormal mammogram conversation over and over. I now feel more certain I am making the right choice. I hope the diagnosis doesn't change. For those of you where it has, thank you for telling me this. It helps put things in perspective. Now I wait for 5/21 to get here and then wait probably several days for results. Watching the clock go tick tock! I know you've all been there. Thank you so much for responding! I will come back to share what happened.",

Surgeon will remove all the mass around it and will verify with mammography that everything is gone and all calcifications are counted. It's been marked with a clip in the meantime. I'm pretty sure the Surgeon was very surprised the biopsycame back benign and not cancer. The main reason she did the biopsy, was to determine what kind of cancer so that we could decide on treatment options, and I could decide on mastectomy either way. She said often younger women in particular are forgoing the lumpectomy even with DCIS and going for the nipple and skin sparing mastectomy with implants. She wanted me to have that option up front and to narrow down treatment paths. She told me also up front that the mass needed to come out no matter the result, but I wanted to be sure what I was hearing was typical of what others experienced. When my husband and I asked about what would happen if I didn't do it, she gave me the motherly stink eye. I just got this, \"you are being ridiculous\" feeling, but she never said those words. She told me my other options and was very professional of course! I don't have to make the decision you are making (at least not yet), so I hope you can figure out the path for you. I was seriously considering the mastectomy rather than lumpectomy after I was told I had an 80% chance of having cancer. Then I was also considering just doing both because of the other breast being on a watch and see. I was thinking less cosmetic issues overall and preventing multiple surgeries down the road. I haven't had to make that decision for real yet, so I can't say for sure if I would.",

At my second appointment appt my doc said I was still in the 80% chance cancer group even after the benign biopsy. Is this because it's not ruled out yet? It didn't make sense to me",

I haven't seen the incision yet, so I can't say how it looks. The surgeon told my husband that the mass did not appear typical of cancer, but obviously we have to wait for the complete biopsy results to verify since that is the only real way to know. That will be early next week. The waiting and surgery anxiety got to me very badly by last Friday, my chest felt like it was is in a vice. In the days following I kept having anxiety like attacks of shallow breathing and chest tightness. I called the Dr. and they gave me Xanax to help me sleep up until the surgery and to get me through the waiting for results again. This has helped, I so needed sleep. I know there were probably ladies that did not have benign biopsies that needed to go before me, so I don't think the waiting is wrong. It is just hard. Anyone who is struggling severely with the waiting, talk to you doctor. I should have done it sooner but I didn't realize how badly the cumulative stress was affecting me. I will post back when I know for sure that this is benign! Thanks again to all of you for sharing your thoughts and experiences. You've all been through so much more, I don't take that lightly.",

I know others with a BIRAD 5 may come here looking for answers, so I wanted to close the loop on my situation. I don't know if it was trauma at some point in my life or what caused this area of concern, but it is not cancer. This is very good. I will point out that along the way I kept telling all who I encountered in this process that I have had some fibrous tissue in this exact spot for many years and no doctor has ever been concerned about it. I know that they have to do the most conservative thing, but still the last couple of months have been exhausting. I would love to say it is over, but I still have a follow up mammogram to do for some calcifications in the left breast. Those make we wonder since I don't know of any existing issues on that side. I hope those calcifications stay stable and I don't have to do this process all over again this year (although now I've met my deductible!). It has been an expensive and mentally draining process. Still, it is better than enduring treatment as so many here bravely face. Thanks again to all who responded and good luck to any newcomer who happens upon this topic. I go back to my healing now and hope for minimal scarring.",
