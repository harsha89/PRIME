It even hurts to take a deep breath! I came home and took a brisk 45 minute walk thinking this would be better than sitting and getting stiff. (Also took my tylenol, motrin and muscle relaxer!) What have you all done post fill that has worked best to alleviate the pain- rest or exercise? Maria, when you hit your painful fill and back pain, what helped the most to get thru it and get to your goal? Barbara - Hope the day in the chair goes well for you; you're getting through it! I know you had some TE pain too - any advice?  Scared that the next fills will really hurt and I am only at 300ccs now.  My PS said yes to a 400-450 high profile implant-hope I can make it far enough w/ the TEs. Looking at July or August exchange surgery. Still eating the Easter hard boiled eggs - Barbara, they do taste good along w/ a little hummus.  I also have cottage cheese w/ them.  I have made my own hummus before- pretty easy-you can look online for recipes and improvise with ingredients to avoid.  Too sore to do my ROM exercises, but will do a good walk either at the gym if it rains or outside. Have a great day, Ladies!! ",

Sue, Thanks for sharing on the pic forum. You are looking good and I'm sure you'll have a beautiful result! I'll work on posting my pics too. I think it is invaluable for us bc sisters to have a photo journey forum.   Maria, You are an inspiration to me with all of your energy, ideas and the ability you have to write the cooking blog and  teach exercise classes and all! My bc is not really incognito in my community- I think everyone has heard through the grapevine - even people I don't really know such as school families and neighbors and  DH's colleagues  and my co-workers have all heard about it. I was at a coffee gathering yesterday and a mom I'd met once last year knew about my bc! So far no one has commented on my size I think out of politeness. My DH thinks I am getting pretty big relative to where I was pre-bc.  He is just happy to have me alive and cancer free and the rest is gravy to him! Anyway, what are you all doing for exercise today? I may walk or go to the gym... Have a great day! ",

That is where you vary the intensity and work really hard for a bit 1-2 min. and then back down to an easy pace for maybe a minute to recover before hitting it hard again. I am doing this to increase my fitness level. It's much easier than working at a med./hard pace the whole time and it makes the workout go by faster!  Maria, How was your work dinner? Is your dh considering a move still? I am feeling better from my fill last Wed. Today I finally am feeling good. I go again next tuesday for pt and will have my ps look at me and see if I look ready for another fill. Hoping it will be my last one, but will take my time if I need to do more. I am concerned about my skin integrity. I am super tight across my incisions!  I wonder what the skin looks like after the implants are placed as I obviously want the skin to look good. Sue- I'll let you know when I do the pic forum. Have to do the photos while my kids are at school or something. They haven't seen any of this but have bumped into my rock hard TEs and are kind of amazed by them!  Renn- Thinking of you and hope you are enjoying your trip! 2nd opinions can be stressful when you have a couple of different views. Can you get a third or a tumor board?  I need to visit w/ my bs as I have questions as well that I kind of put off during recovery. I have bad news  My mom (also a bc survivor)was just diagnosed with a rare form of chronic leukemia and will do chemo very soon to treat it but it cannot be cured. I am hoping her body will respond well to the chemo! It brings back all of the awful feelings again about having  to deal with cancer :-(",

Renn, The fipple is a size small and is a light color- too light for my skin tone, but it gives me an idea about the size, placement, color and how the breast will look with a nipple on it. Right now the tes sit laterally, so the fipples when centered are more wide-apart looking. I can wear the fipples under my clothes for a more realistic look in the summertime.

My iron is low as well and I take iron supplements. My ps gave me \"the fipples\" which are Amoena adhesive nipple/aerola prosthetics. They come in a little plastic case and the kit includes a special cleaning product that restores the adhesive for long-term use. They are used as a prosthetic on the skin or for women w/prosthetic breasts. I tried them on under a black shirt on the pic forum and they do look realistic, very subtle. I suppose it's good to have something like this for summer clothes. I like having them! Maria-  Let us know how the tamoxifen works for you. My bs called it the wonder drug of the 20th century in his opinion and said most patients do not have se. Fill pain is ok not so bad today _ I haven't even taken advil yet this a.m, but will take that +tylenol before I workout. Need to start my stretches in a few minutes. I've gotten two massages and the therapist has found some very tight muscles and knots behind my armpits where various muscles attach. I wasn't even that aware of those problem areas! Several layers of muscles are tight she says and heat is helping loosen things up. I see the PT tomorrow and hope for some new exercises now that I've been on the same ones for a month- ready to move on.  Sue- So sorry to hear about your MIL's leukemia acting up. My mom is having her port put in tomorrow and begins chemo on Friday for her leukemia. Wish I could be in TX to sit with her on Friday! We don't know what to expect - I understand a little about the process of chemo after hearing some of you ladies describe it. ",

None of the halter styles worked for me. I think my te's are so small and round that they just project out and look silly! I also am very protective of the sensitive skin between the breasts and do not want to risk a sunburn there on the already tightly stretched skin . My kids will want to go swimming as school will be out on the 14th.  No more \"Mom-time\" for a while. I decided to lay low on the exercise until I am all healed post-exchange- only my pt exercises and walking or elliptical as I must've overdone it last weekend with the cycling and resistance exercises. I was in a world of pain all week and I have finally gotten things to settle down. I envy you all who can do everything right now with the TE's. Maybe the fact that mine are the \" 4-suture tab-type\" make movement extra painful. So, I'll just be conservative.7 weeks to go until e-day!",

So sorry... the stress of BC and all of the long medical processes along with career and upcoming move really piles on the stress. You can certainly vent here, it's ok! We feel you! As for family issues, mostly everyone seems to have them. I think I have a strange family... I wanted to go and sit w/ my mom during her leukemia chemo this summer (before my exchange surgery) and she has waved me off. She does not mind going by herself and wants me to visit in the Fall after she's done w/ chemo. I guess we all deal with disease differently. Maybe I stress her out too much! I like being surrounded by loved ones during a health crisis/surgery! I also have young children and need to feel that they are being taken care of in order to feel relaxed myself. I am afraid about my mom's prognosis and she is only 67. She is very upbeat though and seems to handle it ok.  To answer your question, my chest is ok now. I just feel some discomfort w/ the te's when I sleep and upon waking but not bad at all fortunately. Only 3-4 weeks to go until my e- surgery. I am scared! The week away hiking worked wonders for me mentally. I came home refreshed and more energetic and ready for the summer ahead. Maria, I bet your vacation will be a nice break too! Is it in August? A leisure walk sounds like a great plan too. I think it's so important for active people to get some movement in- it sure helps with our mental outlooks.  As far as exercise, I am limiting myself to the door stretches, supine stretches with the foam semi-circle thing-y and power-walking or elliptical. Biking will have to wait til next summer! I do not want to risk injuring those sensitive muscles again.",

She is quite a trooper so far. She sent me a pic of her self in her new cute wig as she lost her hair around her second session of chemo. I'll find out the name of her cancer center-  I know it's a new one. Maria, She did not go for cold caps, now she may regret it! Her worst SE was a blood clot in a superficial leg vein and has to give herself blood thinner injections- yuck! She gets pretty tired a couple of days after chemo for a few days and then bounces back some.  Sorry to hear about the hurtful friends and family interactions. I don't discuss w/ friends unless they ask and only one close friend really asks any details. She has been so kind thru all of this. I probably just rely on my family the most to talk.  It seems that most people have no frame of reference for the amount of time and challenge that this process involves.

You've had to endure itching for 2 months-yuck! Is it some kind of allergic reaction do you think?  With the Xanax discussion, what is Xanax- is it to help calm the nerves or is it given to help with sleep? I had to take ambien after my bmx to sleep but did not find it to be very effective for me.  Barbara, I bet your corgis are so darling swimming w/you! I wish my lab (my avatar) would hop in the pool. He will swim at the beach or lake, but he's scared to jump into the pool. I wore my new swimsuit today for the first time and my 10 yr old son said, \"Mom, you are bigger in the chest than you used to be!\" I asked if I looked silly and he said, \"No, you look good!\". I felt awkward in the swimsuit, but it felt good to get in the pool. Thank goodness my son, daughter, and I were alone in the privacy of my neighbor's pool. I didn't notice any differences as far as temperature of the TEs. I suppose once the silicone implants are placed, then they will feel cold.  Sue, Have a fun trip and please take it easy! Enjoy meeting up with Firedancer. That will be fun. It is encouraging to me to know that you and Maria have fit well into the implants of choice and you both are a bit smaller-framed than me. Maybe I have hope for the 400+'s too.  I have my pre-op appt. next week and I am starting to get the pre-surgery jitters. I hope I can be relaxed as I go in, but I doubt it.  I think I need a pep talk from my ps. Can't believe it is 3 weeks from tomorrow. ",

I want to hug him! Had a good nap earlier and I feel another one coming on. Just returned from my daughter's \"Project Funway\" show - the culmination of her camp this week. It was really good and the girls were very busy all week designing and sewing things and put together a little runway show. We have temps. in the triple digits + east coast humidity this week to move around in, so now I am beat!  It felt great to shower as I have itchiness on my skin around my surgical bra borders. I hand-washed and dryed the bra and put it back on and it is less itchy. It must be something applied to my skin while in surgery that is irritating me? Maybe electrode adhesive or something, betadine or who knows what. I checked out what the foob fairy brought me quickly this morning w/ DH before he left for work, and I am very happy with the outcome! Yeah!  Cancer side (lefty) is seeping a bit at the incision, so I still have gauze pads inside the bra. They foobs are definitely softer,fuller and wider/rounder than the te's so I have cleavage for the first time in my life! The projection seems pretty good too and I obviously have some swelling going on. As Sue and Maria report,I expect to see a progression of changes as everything settles in and heals. I slept comfortably in the recliner. My DPS said it is best to sleep propped on pillows on your back w/ arms at the sides. He said malformations can develop if you tend to sleep curled up on your side w/arms curled around the chest area. Yikes! I'll plan to sleep on my back while I heal up. Barbara, The same incision was used but only a shorter segment of it. The incisions are covered w/ streri-strips, so I can't see them yet.  When we have a peaceful moment, I'll have DH take some pics and I'll post on the forum either tonight or probably in the morning.  I feel really good and this surgery was so much easier than the bmx. The pain is minimal too! I am following Sue's advice resting and taking it super slow for a few days. Have a nice evening everyone- ",

Even had a hunger pang!  Also, I felt really thirsty so I drank a bit of ginger ale and ate a couple of saltines. Happy that I felt able to do that, I got up once again to get dressed in the bathroom and when I sat back down I knew what was coming. Too much ginger ale apparently! TMI! This usually happens to me BTW. After that the nurse gave me a Zofran (anti-nausea pill) and I was just fine.

Renn, I like DPS/GPS- this is so true! As far as physical therapy, my breast care center has a pt protocol for bc patients and there are a few pt's on staff at the ctr. I see a lovelty pt who is part of the team there. She evaluated me upon my bc dx to do some fancy arm measurements pre-surgery. This gives a baseline to detect lymphodema and address it immediately. Then she gave me literature and a plan for the follow-up visits. I typically would see her every 3-4 weeks. She is very knowledgeable about treating bc patients and does massage and prescribes exercises based on your needs. I have taken advantage of this resource as much as I can. I go back to see her in two weeks for a post-exchnage check up.  Yeah Melanie- 8 more to go- glad to hear that your hair is returning too. ",

I ventured out yesterday to the mall and between driving and trying on bras, I am sore- must've overdone it. I went to Nordstrom first to get a preliminary look at bras and ask about scheduling a fitting. I know it is early, but I just could not resist!  The sales lady began helping me and selected a bunch of bras to try on in 34 DD, instead of the D, in order to encapsulate my implants on the sides. I wanted to try the popular Freya Pollyanna, but no luck for Freyas in my size. I tried Chantelles with wire and the fit was not right for my breastbone- the wires put pressure there, so I think that brand is not right, at least until I \"drop\". The Wacoals feel good and fit very well.The sales lady said also to wait a while on the wire bras. I have to find a good supportive soft cup to wear according to my PS. The soft cup bras don't seem very supportive though, and I am concerned about lateral support- don't want my implants moving laterally. My PS is not a big fan of sports bras other than for exercise. I put a Wacoal soft cup sports bra on hold and then went to Macy's to check the selection. They carry the Warners Elements of Bliss no wire, but I couldn't find my size. I am finding it hard to locate 34 D and DD, so online shopping it will be. I did order an Under Armour D front zip sports bra. I also ordered a \"pretty bra\" -Freya Pollyana in 34 D is it seems so highly recommended -and will just have to try it on when it arrives from the UK.  I know I sound a little crazy, but I definitley need the sports bra for vacation next week.",

You all sound pretty energized at this point. I am a little behind all of you in the process, I think as my surgery didn't end up being done until mid-March. I am probably struggling with things that you all are now beyond- for me it's mainly the TE fills and having a good energy level on a regular basis. Also hoping to do more regular movements gradually-tried to vacuum and that did not feel good yet. Reaching up in cupboards is contraindicated for now, too. So, basically, I've been pretty regular about getting a 30-45 minute brisk walk in on a daily basis and do some of the PT exercises as well. Today I was tired and decided to nap before my kids got home from school rather than exercising. I knew it would be a busy evening with my son's first baseball game of the season, my daughter's running program, homework, and helping with a couple of fundraisers ( we are doing a JDRF 3 mile walk on sunday with a 9 yr old. friend who has diabetes). Also, this weekend spring break begins for my kids, so I will be doing quite a bit of \"family supervision time\" all day long for the next 10 days!  My DH has to work so I'll have the kids the whole time.   Tomorrow I visit the PS for another TE fill- #4. I am only having the bc side filled to try and catch it up to the prophy side. Then I may take a couple of weeks off to make sure my skin is not stretched too soon. I have a hard tme telling whether or not I am ready for another fill. So far I've only felt pressure, not pain, but have soreness all of the time pretty much.  Maria, What kind of things have you been doing with your PT? I have a home program and return to see my PT next week for massage and some light weights. I am trying to find a massage therapist familiar with mastectomy/reconstr. patients. Have you all found a resource for this? Keep up the great exercise everyone! ",

Last week she only filled the BC side to catch it up with the prophy side. I do feel the needle on the prophy side. I have only seen my PS once during a follow up per my request at 3 weeks post-op. I wanted the PS to check out the incisions and make sure all was ok. I think he doesn't routinely check in unless there is a problem or request. My main concern is getting to the size that I will be happy with. My TE's are pretty small ( around 300ccs) as I have a small chest area, but my goal is to be a C with the implants (I was an A before bc, maybe up to a C when breastfeeding).  Maria, Sorry to hear about the aerobics class. Finding a closer location would be great, but I know you'll miss the regulars who attended you class. Maybe they'll move with you!  What kind of swimsuit ended up working for you? I will be looking for one as well to contain the TE's without feeling self-conscious! As far as exercising goes, I am happy to out be walking every day for 45 minutes or so. My kids are on spring break this week and they are walking the dog with me while I do my walks. Also, I am noticing that the exercises my PT gave me are really helping with the TE discomfort. Either that, or I am starting to heal up -I am 6 weeks post op. I see the PT tomorrow and want to find out how soon I can bike ride, and do more strenuous exercise such as classes at the gym etc... and what restrictions remain while healing and going through tissue expansion. It sounds like many of you are doing lots of exercise now. How far out were you cleared to do strenuous exercise? Tonight is our last meal delivery believe it or not! Now my husband and I are starting a more healthy and thoughtful eating plan-  we like to grill chicken, fish, and some red meat a lot in the warm months and also grill veggies and do lots of salads. We both want to reshape some after the whole ordeal our family has been through with my bc! I feel like my legs and abs need work and I need to drop some body fat. For the past 6 months since bc diagnosis we have been in kind of a tail spin. Now it's time to focus on getting back into shape. I'd love to feel fit and lean along with the timing of the final implants. It will be nice to look good for a 48 yr. old!  Rennasus, What a pretty pic! Love your red hair color! Annie- Awesome news of your LAST chemo day. That is just great!! Do something nice for yourself.  About the bras, I love the coobie bras - they are so comfortable and have removable pads. The pad helps cover the TE shape. The bra is one size fits all and is made of a soft, stretchy material. It has straps that can be removed or criss-crossed to adjust for clothing. I got mine at a local lingere shop. I googled to find who carries them locally. You can also order online. ",

We love it here and hope to stay following retirement.  I am a Texan and he's from Michigan. We also loved living in California.  My ribcage is 29\"-30\" too. I do ask the PA lots of questions each time and she is great. It is time to check in w/ my PS about where we will be able to go with the fills and the implant sizes. I am larger now than I was pre-bc (I am at 250 and 300cc's), but smaller than what I hope to be with the implants. I tried on a 34C bra and it fits now; before I was a 34B or a 36A. I will soon be approaching over-expansion and I think the ps will need to be more involved in the progression.  I  hope that his technique will get me to a C. He overfills and said he could over fill to 500, but it would be like filling up a soccer ball with so much air that it would be pretty hard! Then I'll have to wait 6-8 weeks for my exchange. Whippetmom said based on my measurements I would be happy with at least a 425 implant. I am shooting for this and we'll see if my ps can make this happen. I still do very little housework as I can feel my chest hurting in a bad way when I try to vacuum or reach/pull too much. My poor DH is doing so much! My friends got a cleaning service to help us twice which was great! ",

Got a new kind of leash to walk my lab that has a stretchy bungee cord on it to reduce the tension and pulling. It works well. This morning I am hitting the gym for a heart-pumping workout on the elliptical. I have been doing multiple one minute intervals of higher intensity with a rest minute of lower intensity in between for a total of 30 min. to improve my fitness level.  I am still sore from my fill last wednesday but it's getting better. Maria, Sue and Melanie - Running/ jostling movements hurt the TE/ chest area- how do you guys do it-? I hope running/exercise class movements will feel better with the silicone implants. Way to go, Maria on teaching your exercise classes- did you get to teach your old favorite class after all? Sue- I, too feel like you are a BC sister. We have similarities to share w/ the military, our sizes and much more. When is your next/last fill? I hope my next one is my last. I found out that I have med. ht. TE's so the upper pole is not expanded like the lower pole. So,  I am hoping my ps can give me a larger implant without having to expand me much farther. My incision line and my skin look smooth  and tight from being stretched  and I am concerned about my skin becoming compromised with the TE expansion! I may email some photos to my ps before my next fill to see what he thinks. I am still sleeping in the recliner, believe it or not! I try the bed, but wake after a couple of hours stiff and sore, so move to the chair for better rest.  Renn- Glad your incision is doing better- slow and steady- take it easy! Your hikes sound so great. Barbara, Happy birthday wishes!! Hope the infection signs have subsided. Let us know- Also, Are you finished w/ your fills? ",

She massaged around and felt quite a few adhesions of scar tissue there and wow did she find the painful spots! She told me to back off all exercises except for the doorway stretches and the wall half-push-ups and she wants me to massage these adhesions for 2-3 minutes a day until my exchange surgery. Then, I follow up with her 2 weeks post exchange to make sure I stay free of these adhesions and tightness. According to her, I have very tight muscles and I am skinny with no cushion in my chest which makes things sore.  As far as the pain I am having with my DH hurting my feelings, I have been feeling low.

Lovely to hear  your ideas and plans for your life in your 40's. I am looking for my new passion as well.

I try to pass along chemo tips to her as she faces some of the same side effects. She's also in Dallas. I sat up last nite catching up on my fave threads here lots going on... always enjoy the commentary and updates from you all.  I had a nice vacation in the mountains and just loved being there- nice and cool and so beautiful- we (DH and 2 children)  did different hikes every day- waterfall ones and mountain-top hikes at Shenandoah Nat'l Park.  Definitely do recommend it if you are in the area. It wasn't even crowded and it was peaceful and relaxing  ",

Is it mainly where the alloderm work was done at the bottom, or are you sore all over?  Are you able to sleep in bed and are you required to sleep at an elevated angle? If you haven't tried miralax yet, do- it works wonders for constipation.  I imagine I will be pretty sore w/my exchange as my implants will have to be positioned higher and closer in than the TE's are now and the ps will have to do some more work there to open up the area. Hope to get my mojo back too... any hints? Sue, I agree, it helps to feel a positive body image for the mojo.I'm sure it will help to not be distracted with pain at every movement!",

I am in the kitchen a lot fixing food and snacks for multiple children and trying to fit in my errands with the kids-- in between shuttling them around to their activities. I haven't had much personal space lately and barely time to exercise! I have been reading your posts but do not have much to report. My exchange surgery is in 2 1/2 weeks. I have been pretty nervous about it all, but am beginning to feel more ready for the surgery, I go for my pre-op on wed. After seeing some pictures of myself with these darn te's I am ready to get rid of them- they look pretty unnatural! They are kind of wide-set. It will be nice to have something more natural-looking and soft. I am getting ready for the next step in recovering from all of this! This may sound odd, but my chest hurts around the time before my period starts, just like it used to pre bmx.  My tes are a lot sorer - anyone else experience this? I am also beginning to get more feeling back in my chest. I wonder if the nerves will have to start all over again after the exchange surgery? Marie, You are at a difficult and challenging point in your reconstruction and it will get better. Many of us here have been through this too and we can relate. I put my drains either in the pockets of the surgical bra or wore a shirt w/ pockets that held the drains. I had a pain ball too and had a pouch around my neck.  It will be nice when you can get rid of them and feel more unencumbered! I had to wear my drains for two weeks. I was allowed to pull the pain ball out myself rather than driving 1 1/2 hrs. to the PS, but I wasn't prepared for how looong the the little tubes were. I kept pulling and pulling and I must have pulled out over 12\" before the whole thing was out, then had to do the same on the other side! Gentle walks and small exercises helped me a lot at the beginning. I second the others in saying take it easy and focus on rest and healing. Renn- Thinking of you as your TE removal day approaches.   Shannon- I enjoy your humor! Everyone - have a happy 4th! ",

My questions mainly have to do with Allergan/vs Mentor dimensions and how he'll even out my slightly smaller cancer side. Also want to get his permission to take valium the night before surgery as that helped me last time. And, requesting to go early in the a.m.- if not,I am requesting to have the iv put in right away as last time I started getting sick and dehydrated with a long wait. It's a military hospital, so troop demands \"wounded warriors\" come ahead of cancer recon. patients, so sometimes there is a wait. Do I sound high-maintainence? He probably thinks I am a nervous Nellie!  I keep lubing up the foobs with cocoa butter and aquaphor and doing my pec doorway stretches hoping to keep everything malleable for the ps.  Tomorrow is the last day of antibiotics for my bladder infection- feeling good in that dept. too.  Enjoying some private time w/ both kiddos in camp this week- made it to the grocery, Home Depot, BB & Beyond, and gym this a.m. and did the precor elliptical with arms. Not sure how much good the exercise is doing right now, as I will be off strenuous activities for 4 weeks post-op, but it feels good to exercise and work off stress and calories. My aunt is flying out from TX to help out next week, so I am getting the house in order and making a list to shop/prep/freeze some meals to have on hand. I am curious if the doc will have me stay overnight after surgery- they've reserved a hospital bed for me. I hear most get to go home the day of exchange.  Have a nice evening Ladies. Maria, Hope your rib pain eases up. I had that pain and had to take painkillers and take it easy- I had done too much.  Did you overdo at the house? Take it easy!",

I guess my DPS told us the surgery would take 1 1/2 hrs and he was very accurate! 3 hours would seem kind of long for exchange. Also, I have the exact same implants as chill on the pic forum. It's funny because we had a few discussions prior to her May e-day about how our DPS's were going to handle the asymmetry issues we both had.

Hope it was nice enough outside to get a walk in over the weekend.  Marie, I feel your pain-so sorry you are going through this difficulty. One thing I think about or look back on my pos-tBLMX experience, is questioning the effect exercise has on pain in the te's. I was restless and just had to walk briskly and I wonder now if I might have brought on more pain and irritation by trying to be active. I am an \"exercise addict\", and love to just get out and do something.  Now that I am recovering from exchange surgery I am taking the R & R approach. As disciplined as I have to be to force myself to take it easy, I am trying to accomodate by being stocked up on several books-interesting easy reads and lots of movies. Naps too- yesterday I took 3! I just do the tiny ROM movements my DPS wants me to do and walk very slowly without jiggling myself. So far the pain is very light unless I try to push myself around by using my arms to get comfy reclining or if I lift a jug of water or milk. The PT exercise were a huge help in relieving pain and tightness.  I visited my physical therapist on a regular basis. I also went in for massages regularly with a medical massage therapist at the BC Center. They even offered a special rate for bc patients. OK all of this blabbing was probably tmi, but take it for what it's worth! HUGS",

I am realizing now how much work the bs and ps had to do there- getting all of the cancer with clear margins, alloderm, sutures, and the ps had to adjust my imf and try to make both sides even. The PT told me that I have very little cushioning in the chest area, so it is making the TE's more uncomfortable for me esp. when I try to sleep.  I am using a dynaband for some shoulder/back exercises, 1/2 wall push-ups and 2 position pec stretches in the doorway. My PS cleared me to get back to the gym and begin more strenuous exercise again. We are trying to avoid the hunched over look! With this news I must have been a little too ambitious and began vacuuming yesterday- reached too far and  strained/pulled  the area in front of my rt. TE  - ouch! There is so much I am tempted to do around the house and garden now and I have to try and hold back.  Melanie- hang in there with the arm. As fit and active as you are, I bet you will respond very well to treatment- if you follow your PT's advice closely, you'll get it under control.  Maria, I too did some holiday indulging, but I am back to healthful small meals again today.

Continuing w/ my daily brisk walking program. Sunday my kids, DH, my yellow lab,and I participated in a 3 mile dog walk for the SPCA with all kinds of furry friends in attendance. It was lots of fun!

I am wondering if the fill was worse this time due to pre-menstrual bloating and my usual breast soreness/pain prior to my period. I'm thinking it is possible that the circulating ER and PR still have the same effects and have to go somewhere, even if the breast tissue is taken away.  Anyone else notice this with your cycle? Just praying that the next fills aren't as bad! Got my exchange surgery date set for July. My ps waits 6 wks from the last fill to have the exchange.

I am having pain under my left TE and it feels like I've pulled a muscle or something. My ps said this pain is common in breast surgery -it is the nerves regenerating and the nerves sending pain signals are often the first to start firing. Ouch! No biking today, just stretching and a pain pill Maria, You are kind for asking about my mom's chemo. It went well last friday except she was in the chair 9 hrs-her blood pressure was so low in response to the first infusion they had to go very slowly. She's feeling fine now- she had no steriod \"extra energy\", and just has some weird changes to her taste buds and no nausea! Hope your start to work again is going smoothly for you. Barbara,Good to hear from you and hope you had fun at the horse show and golf tourn.  Renn, I think it is a good idea to take advantage of the PT. It has helped me feel better and less tight. Also it has helped with my posture.  I am hoping to stave off problems with tight chest and shoulder muscles and like getting the ok for exercises that won't harm the work that the PS did inside such as alloderm slings. Sounds like your incision is closing up a little every day!",

Maria, Glad you had such a nice weekend with your friend! You sound so happy today .  My te's are a new type that have suture tabs to hold them in place so they don't migrate up or down or sideways. They were sewn onto me in 4 spots around the te and there is some tenderness maybe from these sutures. They have kept my tes from drifting around I think.

It's great that you've been able to do all sorts of other exercises without trouble! For me, biking, and using elliptical arm handles really bother me as well as the dynaband exercises that a PT prescribed. I haven't even attempted exercise classes I am just sitting tight doing a lot of walking until after I recover from exchange surgery.  I think it is the serratus anterior that is so irritated (the muscles that extend in a fingerlike fashion around the ribs and under the TE. So by focusing on chest stretches I am feeling ok. Occasionally my shoulder and back hurt and I get massages from my DH or go to the medical massage therapist. I was also instructed to massage the sore adhesion at the lower edge of my left TE 3 min./day which helps. Let's hope all of our chest, shoulder, and arm aches and pains eventually subside over time. Our family is heading out on vacation in the mountains tomorrow to hike, relax and explore- no wifi, or tv for 4 days! We are all bringing some summer reading material and hope to see some wildlife.  We may go canoeing and horseback riding although not sure if I'll do that. Take care and have a nice week  ",

My pre-op appt. is next week and I will e-mail my ps and see if I get to visit with him then too, and discuss if the Allergan 45's are a good choice as they are narrower than the Mentor High Profiles. At my last fill in May, my ps and I confirmed the size of implants he will aim for (400-450), although he says width is a factor.  I just don't want to be disappointed with the size since my te's are only at 350, if we can get 400-450's \"stuffed in\" and centered closer together I will be thrilled.  ",

My R & R is going ok. Each day I have been napping w/ my pup, reading, watching some tv, and putzing around the house. I get my DH to take me out for a little bit, just for a change of scenery. One day, just to the grocery store, one day, to see my DD's little project funway fashion show at her camp, etc...Last night  the four of us (DH, DD, DS and me) ventured out for a little evening walk downtown for an ice cream. Actually I got a decaf mocha, my favorite treat. It was cool out and already dark, so a good time to walk. I probably went farther than I meant to as we were out for an hour, but kept it to a very slow stroll to keep the blood pressure down. (Apparently that is a big reason we are told not to exercise- to avoid a hematoma.)  Today I had to put my\"chest to the test\" as we just had a home appraisal and my DH needed my help quickly tidying up around the house. I actually feel ok, no pain... and now ready for a nap. Sue, Let us know when those new pictures are up and I'll go over to the forum. I keep peeking to see if I notice any changes so far going on under my surgical bra and everything looks about the same. Maybe a little less swelling, but that's it. My steri strips are still in place. Of course it's only been five days!",

The Bras 101 thread discusses wearing a snug underwire to help keep the implants in place while the healing occurs, which makes sense to me.  I also read that you want to avoid padding and linings for optimal healing.  My PS does not want a wire resting on skin that is still numb as it could ulcerate the skin at a pressure point -which would be bad!

Also waiting for the pretty Freya \"frilly european unmentionable\" which I will need to save for a while! Yesterday I tried on the nice Wacoal stretch lace underwire bra just to wear a bit, now that I am two weeks out, and my DH ' strongly  reminded me' to follow my DPS orders or e-mail him about his thoughts on the underwire. I decided to take it off and realized that it was hurting me! I am not ready for an underwire now. It was poking me in between the breasts, so I returned it! Back to the compression bras. Apparently the Marena compression bra is very \"hi tech\" and it's made w/ a special fabric. I am going to get another one from my DPS when I return to the hospital on tues. for my physical therapy follow-up. It is the most comfortable and holds me in place the best. Julie, I am healing well, thank you!  And pleased w/ the results so far! Still sleeping on my back, propped up with pillows which hurts my low back, but what am I going to do? At least I am ok to gradually get some exercise and stretching which helps w/ the back pain. Now I can take motrin again too which feels better. Sue - Enjoy your bra shopping day! Pamper yourself - you deserve the attention. It would be fun to go together. If you are not happy w/ Nordies service or selection in your size, you could also try a nice lingere shop. We have a place called A la Mode that has a great selection and helpful sales clerks. So happy for you Melanie. Have fun at home - Do some bra shopping and pamper yourself too! Shannon, Boys are so funny! Even my 10 (almost 11yr old) is pretty funny about the breasts. My DH says all of my 'dinner table bra and breast talk' is ruining the fun for him as he grows into the age where boys start thinking about breasts!  Maria- Happy travels :) ",

I am doing pretty well and my week is going so much better than the last one!   I am back to walking 30 min. per day at a more brisk pace and wish I could begin walking my dog (my walking buddy)- he's 86 lbs though and pulls very hard at times so it's too much of a risk right now. Rennasus, I am envious of the trail hikes you describe-I used to live in So CA and absolutely loved the beauty of the outdoors there. Also doing some of the range of motion exercises my PT prescribed. The supine (lying flat) exercises are painful for my chest muscles, so I will be easing into those gradually.  Tomorrow is my 4 week follow up and fill. I'll go for another 50ccs then, and will then be at 250ccs. (I do 50 ccs each week, and so far, so good). I still get super sore when I sleep and still have to use a recliner. Are any of you still having trouble with chest hurting and waking you up? I wish I could be comfortable in my bed w/DH... Sue Bee- we are similar in our TE size now. I already feel larger than I was pre BMX. (I was an A cup ) and hope to get to a C.  I am 5'5\", 125lbs and 30\" band. Maria, are you a similar size? I wonder if I will need to go to 450ccs as well? I got a couple of Coobie bras yesterday and they are so comfortable and have a light padding that helps obscure the weird TE shape. Thankfully, my tummy is back to normal and so is my appetite . Our family is receiving meals 3 nights a week though the month, and we have some wonderful cooks as friends-hoping I don't gain weight! Maria and Sue Bee, you both sound like wonderful cooks! The recipes and ideas sound delicious and you put such great energy into it. Maybe you will inspire me. I do special shopping/cooking for certain times and occasions, but I am not inspired on a daily basis. I tend to be more into gardening and active things than being in my kitchen. I am happy eating yogurt or a salad, and my family probably wishes I was a more inspired cook! I am looking forward to grilling season which is fast-approaching. We love to grill dinner and eat out on the deck regularly when the weather gets nice. Sending warm thoughts to those undergoing chemo and others who are fresh out of surgery and in more pain right now. Take good care of yourselves.",

All of your talk of cycling has inspired me to get out on my bike. Yesterday I took a short ride alone as a test ride and felt pretty good. This morning I got my family to go on a little longer ride over to a park near our house. I think we are ready now for some longer rides on different trails. I saw a new PT last thursday who gave me some new exercises. He said I must do them twice a day - I'd only been doing them once a day before.  I asked for some ab exercises that are safe to do right now and I have a couple of basic ones upper-isometric curls and lower isometric straight leg raises. My chest is still pretty sensitive to resistance and hurts underneath the left TE- not sure if it's rubbing against my ribs or it's a suture tab that pulls. Hope you all had a nice weekend! We saw the Memorial Day Concert at the National Capitol lawn in Wa DC last night and enjoyed it. ",

Sounds like it will add a fresh area of focus and structure to your schedule along with the zumba and cycling routines. I bet it feels good to get back to a sense of normalcy again with all of these things. Glad your chest is feeling better w/ the biking now. My kids both love playing\"only child\" when the other is away! They think it is their special time. Shannon- I feel your pain w/ the TEs. Mine have done the same thing from time to time- aching and additional pain for some unexplained reason. Part of my discomfort I believe is my monthly cycle/water retention. My breasts and now TEs get extra sore and sensitive during the pre-menstrual phase.  Sometimes overdoing it makes them sore, wearing things that compress too much, and if I sleep in certain positions that makes them hurt and then I can feel it the next day. Renn- Great that you started the new thread. Is your sis still visiting? I'm sure it was a wonderful treat to have her there with you and join you for hiking etc...  Have a good night everyone-",

My lower back has been hurting like crazy and I think sleeping propped on pillows on my back is irritating it even though I put a lumbar pillow on my low back and another one under my knees. I'll ask the PT what to do. I have had low back troubles for years now and wish this flare up would go away! Thankfully, my chest is feeling ok -I only have tiny twinges here and there.  Just recieved the Anita no wire bra today (the one Lilah on the bra thread recommended) in the mail and I love it! Very soft and supportive. My DPS gave me the go ahead today to begin using the Scar Away silicone sheets on my scars. I will wear these for up to three months for at least 12 hours a day, I believe. Then it will be time to do the nipple recon. surgery.  Hope to do some nice gentle hikes, relax, read at the lake and maybe go into town for a spa day while on vacation. Think I'll stay out of the water this time... no kayaking, swimming, or any of that stuff. I'll just watch my family from the shore. I will check in while I am away, wouldn't miss it!

Sometimes I get them and I think it is related to hormones in my monthly cycle that trigger the headaches. I try to take it easy, rest/nap, keep stress to a minimum, get a massage, drink lots of water (no alcohol!), and take meds to relieve the pain.  Maria, Were you given any specific post-exchange exercises? Anyone else? Sue, Getting excited about your upcoming bike ride. Wish I was able to do it this year w/you. Sounds like you have options as far as the distances to choose from. If you do the 50, you and DH can always enjoy it as a full day adventure, take breaks and hydrate/fuel up at the rest stops and go at a comfortable pace!

How about you Renn?  Suebee, I agree w/ Shannon- a 50 miler will take a week or two at least to recover. Your muscles have to rebuild their energy (glycogen) stores and recover from the hard work. The best way to recover is rest and gradually get back into easy workouts and keep up the carbs in your diet. So proud of ya! Excited for you that the nipple surgery is almost here! You'll have to report back when you can. I may be right behind you- end of October for me. I am wondering what type of bra to wear w/ the nipple shields? I guess baggy sweatshirts will be the attire unless we want the Madonna look! Maria, Glad to hear that the hair is holding steady for you now. Surely the vitamins help with hair growth -I notice my nails are stronger when I take my vitamins regularly. I went on my first post-exchange bike ride this afternoon w/ DD and her little friend. I felt great-no strain in the chest like with the TEs. (I am 8-9 weeks out). Also sleeping comfortably on my side every night. I am doing physical therapy 2x a week and daily exercises because my low back/SI joint was thrown out somehow post-exchange. The PT thinks it is surgury-related and we are gradually getting my back stronger on the hurt side.",

I hope this will begin to resolve speedily and your back will start feeling better soon.   My first fill is coming up on thursday. I had 75ccs put in during surgery on mar 11, so it's now nearing the 2 wk point. I get my last two drains taken out and then have the fill - 50ccs. Still have steri strips on the incisions so I haven't checked their condition yet.  My TEs  hurt! Get sharp pains, cramping and aching especially when I've been in one position sleeping or when riding in the car. I hope this will get better as my body adjusts. Trying to find the best ways to help with the pain - maybe muscle relaxers, massage, ice, PT? I'll find out more on thursday, but I am definitely apprehensive!  Walking (easy strolling) has been a positive part of the day- I do about 30 min. We've had some nice spring weather lately here in MD, so the fresh air and sunshine feels great.   Got good results from my BS/tumor board today. No more cancer treatment is needed for me, just 6 month follow-ups w/my BS for exams. There was widespread dcis throughout the breast, so it was a good thing I had the MX. The prophy side had no cancer. The BS told me my focus is now on reconstruction w/ the PS. Anniemomof3, I, too have been indulging in desserts- my friends have been bringing great meals over with desserts and I have a real sweet tooth. Hope the walking helps offset those calories!

The plan is to add 50 cc's weekly if all goes ok or we'll slow it down. My cancer side looks smaller as they had to remove more, but the plan is to catch up in volume towards the end. I may skip my outdoor walk today and just do my range of motion exercises gently.  It feels more wintry today in MD. We might even get some snowflakes in the next days.

I'd like to do a family bike ride on Mother's Day and enjoy the great weather. Then we are going out for Mexican food. (It's my pick!)",

Hope you had a lovely lunch today and you feel better soon.  Maria, Sounds like some changes may be on your horizon. You seem to handle things in stride-I'm sure all will work out! I started working last week and it has lifted my spirits to get into the swing of things again. I only do 10-15 hours each week. Melanie- Glad you are feeling better and please keep following your LE therapist's advice - you are already responding so well- I am happy for you! Sue, Had my fill today and went prepared...took motrin and a pain pill before and I've been doing doorway pec stretches and big ball stretching all day. 50 ccs on each side now at 300/350. Aiming for  400/450 high profile smooth round implants and my E-day is mid July. It's sore and tight, but this time I am not panicking- now I know how to handle this! Today is our anniversary and we took a 45 min. power walk together this afternoon in the gorgeous weather to our fave local coffee house. Too busy for a date tonite with all of the kids stuff, so we will go to dinner this weekend.  ",

Did you bump your chest with the airbag at all?  Sue- What a lovely family!  Hope the service brings peace and comfort to you all.  Shannon, Enjoy your trip. I sure found it wonderful to get away to the mountains for a change of scenery- nice and cool and beauty everywhere.  Maria, You sound pretty swamped to say the least! Hang in there  and congrats on the Chicago news- what a great city to relocate to and it's not too far from your hometown. Love it there! It's nice to have the decision set rather than being up in the air about it.  Should be a good spot for you to launch your new career plans later. Glad your PS follow up went well and you had your questions addressed.  Annie, I am thinking of you tomorrow with your surgery and wishing you all the best for a smooth-sailing day. I had my pre-op today but I did not get to see my ps, instead met with his partner along with two med students and two nurses! The other ps was very nice, informative, and answered questions fully as he works closely w/ my ps, so it was interesting to hear another perspective. But, I now have to follow up with my ps via email with my detailed questions. Today the nurse gave me my surgical bra to bring to surgery, took TE pictures, and I had some blood work done. I have a room reserved to stay overnight in the hospital if need be.  Boy, I was so nervous going into the appointment that I left my id at home and left my daytimer in the ladies room and had to walk way back to the other end of the hospital to get it! Good thing DH was with me! DH kept saying, \"Calm down. Remember, it is just admin. today.\" I am more relaxed now that I met with the doc, but I feel that my nerves will be spiking up again in anticipation as my e-day gets closer. It is exciting to get this show on the road finally! For the BMX, my bs gave me valium to take the day before to help take the edge off and hope ps will allow this time. Melanie and Julie- Keep us updated on your rads. We will count down with you. HUGS Marie- Glad to hear you are making healing progress- one day at a time. ",

Once you put some time in and find your go-to size/brands/styles it is not hard. In addition to the pro fittings, I think the bra forum is helpful as well as the 'post your bras' photo thread. It helps me to see others who are a similar size fitted in their bras with comments to see how to have a bra properly fit + recommendations/reviews on styles and where to find. You can even take pics and post to get advice on fit. Val 61, Lilah, Dawne hope and Cameron are a few ladies active on the bra stuff. Once you find a couple \"go-to styles\" that work well,  you can order special sizes online. Many sites offer free shipping. Many women order on ebay for great deals (once you know exactly your size and style #). ",

Haven't made it to the gym yet although I am cleared to begin some exercise, Mainly walking and stretching and treating my back. Hurricane Irene is supposed to arrive in a few days so I may be hitting the gym instead of outdoor walks.  Barbara, Exchange surgery is such a huge hurdle, yeah! :) Are you pleased with the softness and look of the implants? I am still getting the pre-menstrual soreness/swelling around the chest even though I had a BLMX- strange isn't it? Anyone else experience this?

It's been kinda shaky with these surgeries over the past year. Starting back, I'd suggest you try moderate intensity (where you can breathe comfortably) for let's say 15-30 minutes, or whatever you can comfortably do. Then, every week, increase your duration by 10%. So, for ex. 30 min-- 33 min. I try to target 40 minutes to an hour ideally for weight control. Then, you can begin playing around with intensity once you have a good fitness base. So do some hard/easy intervals (such as 5 min. warm-up, then 1 minute at 85% of max effort and 1-2 min. easy and repeat several times.Then do a 5 min. cool-down) on the bike/elliptical/swimming or whatever mode you are doing. The intervals will challenge your heart, lungs, and muscles and increase your fitness level  more rapidly. Right now my physical therapy exercises suffice for my strength training until my back is in good order. For strength 2-3 x week is good. This includes anything like weights, doing sit-ups/plank/dynabands etc... at home, to group strength classes, vinyasa yoga, pilates etc.. in my opinion! I record my workouts in a simple calendar book/daytimer that I use for my personal tracking such as dr. visits, menstrual cycle, aches and pains, illness, etc.. kind of a health-related journal. It is a motivational tool for me to be able to check off that I did my workout that day and x workouts/week and then look back at how I did. I also have done a food journal in the past-- again as a motivational tool for me because you just hate to write down food binges etc! Plus it is great for self-awareness (we often forget all of the little things we nibble on or drink) and making sure you get the targeted servings of vegs, fruits, grains, dairy, protein, etc...You can use apps like spark people and livestrong or whatever suits you. For me, simply jotting things down seems to help-I am \"old-school\" and prefer a paper daytimer to an electronic device.  Hope this helps! ",

Had a bilateral mastectomy with tissue expanders put in at the same time. Surgery took 5 hours plus 2 hrs in recovery.  Already looked at my chest and really feel good about it. I was so scared to look, but my PS lifted off the gauze to check everything and asked if I had looked yet. When I looked down I was pleasantly surprised to see that they look pretty normally shaped and there are small bandages over the incisions. Incisions are smaller than I expected. I have 3 drains and 2 will stay in for two weeks -these are the ones next to the alloderm that need to really grow together with the skin and not have a lot of fluid building up. All in all,a positive experience with excellent care. I am wondering what size I will end up with as I have a narrow chest-hoping for a C, but who knows! The doc put in 275 TE's and he can overfill to 500. I am sending encouraging thoughts and well-wishes to each of you; I had such difficulty waiting three months for this day and glad I can now move on to being in recovery mode. Love and hugs!!",

I slept in a comfy recliner last night that we put next to our bed - I wrapped up in a cozy comforter w/small pillows under my arms and felt great. Slept all night and didn't even stir until 6 a.m.   The only odd thing is the  bloody fluid leaking down from the tiny little catheters where my pain med ball is attached. My PS told me it happens frequently and to put a gauze pad over it. He said I can remove the catheters myself once all the medicine is gone and the pain ball looks like an apple core. Did any of you remove your own? I will probably have my nurse friend help me rather than making an hour+ trip to the hospital. I am taking percocet and tylenol and pain seems under control as long as I don't move too much! Trying not to agitate the drain sites as they will be with me two weeks! My discharge papers say I can take a shower, but nervous about the drain sites. Has anyone else showered gently around the chest area post op?

I was postponed in Jan, then in Feb, and I am hoping friday is a go! Between the original surgery date and now, several changes have taken place for me  - I had to get a new PS as the other had to go on a humanitarian mission, then my BS announced he'll be retiring in a couple weeks and I am his last patient so I will be meeting an entirely new doc for my future care. During this time as well,  I got a second opinion from another Breast Center and that BS does a sentinel node biopsy which differs from my current BS philosophy. This brought up worries for me, but my BS says the classic standard of care is not to do SNB in dcis. I just hope no invasive cells are found in my post-op path report - in that case they have to do a full axillary dissection which obviously brings greater pain and lymphedema risks with it. Today my 10 yr old woke up ill and I am home taking care of him. I have him staying in a completely different area of the house...praying I don't get yet another bug that prevents my surgery! 48 more hours to go... As you all can see, I am pretty anxious and it has built up over all of these months of waiting. It was wonderful that my BS prescribed valium for me a couple of days ago. it seems to be helping right now in this last week of waiting.  Would love to hear how all of you March gals are doing pre and post surgery.

I am anxious about the fill, wondering how my incisions are healing as they are still covered by steri-strips and I also can't tell if my skin is ready. My TE's were initially filled to 75-100 cc's at surgery and I can definitely feel that they are there and sore. They seem to be pretty close to my sternum and not too far into my armpits. I've had to stay on a regular schedule w/the pain meds and now have ambien to help sleep at night. Nights have been the worst for me as I tend to get really stiff and sore staying on one position for a long time (neck, back, and chest). Even my tailbone has been hurting due to constant pressure in the reclining position. I now sit on a pillow and find that this helps a bunch.

I am heading over to Bed Bath and Beyond for the tray and Sally Beauty Supply for the powder spray today. Apparently it may be a couple of weeks before you can shower and wash your hair normally.  She also recommended taking a warm bubble bath and have a loofah with a handle (for your spouse or friend to wash your back).

I wish you all the best in your recoveries.  Good luck to those who are going to surgery this week- it looks like about 7-8 of us. Hang in there!  Mine isn't until 1/31. ",

I have a list of things to do to be organized around the house and have my mother coming out from Dallas to help. Exercise has really helped to improve my state of mind and relieve stress. My husband has to field all of my concerns and worries-poor guy I've had too many words! I seem to come up with new worries every day from how I am going to react post-surgery when I see my chest with breasts gone, to how painful the TE's will be to tolerate, to my surgical pathology report... My daughter's 9th birthday falls right after surgery and I don't want her to feel forgotten; just lots of stuff. It will be a relief to have the surgery over and then to focus on the next step of treatment/recovery. Prayers and warm wishes to all of you. ",
