I just read that another member was diagnosed with the same thing. My mother is grade 3. My sister and I went with her to see the surgeon on Friday and an MRI is scheduled for the 27th. We will see the surgeon again on the 2nd of May. I know from what I have read that this is not very promising. She had (2) spots in her right breast and the biopsies that were taken came back cancerous. Can someone give me and my sister some information on this cancer and what we can expect? Thanks!",
