But scarier than that is that I had a PET in August that shows the met (I saw the scan at the pulmonologist office) but wasn't mentioned in the report. The CT mentioned 2 nodules with sizes and locations but the pulmonologist said that during the procedure the other day he looked all around both lungs and I actually have it in both. He didn't tell me how much or how many, but I'm hoping my oncologist will be able to tell me. Regarding symptoms - ever since the bronchoscopy I've been coughing, wheezing, and having shortness of breath, so the procedure basically gave me symptoms! Pulmonologist said it should clear up in a few days; let's hope so",

Lynne (50s), I thought I\u2019d wait on second opinion and or clinical trials when I got closer to the end of my current arsenal. Is that a bad idea? I\u2019m so lost, and honestly have been pretty useless the last year. My last biopsy was for this dx, so last May (2017). The two stubborn tumors were there then. And I\u2019ve had genetic testing but not foundation one. Again, I don\u2019t know much about that. I wish I had more energy or oomph so I could research and stuff, but I just don\u2019t. My support system is fantastic. If nothing else, I\u2019ve been blessed with that. There were times that I questioned the support of my husband and children, but once I opened the door to communication, all of that is sooo much better. So Tuesday after the new chemo I came home, had a little meltdown and went to sleep. Woke up and did it again. Of course I didn\u2019t sleep that night and it was an emotionally rough one. Wednesday I slept a lot. But when I was awake I felt pretty good. I managed to put the boo hoos behind me for a little while and physically I was better. Of course I woke up feeling like a freight train hit me yesterday. Those darn muscle aches come on hard and fast! Thankfully I was prepared with my meds and heating pad so it was okay. Today is good so far. Hope everyone else has a beautiful day... xo",
