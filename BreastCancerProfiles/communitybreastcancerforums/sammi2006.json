This week marks two weeks after my last taxol and I am just now starting to feel a little more like my old self. I have decided to take my radiation oncologists advice and return to work after rads are completed. She has told me that during this time I need to work on increasing my stamina so that I will be physically ready to go back. I am going to be doing hypofractionated radiation with 15 rads and 6 boosts. Carrie-I am so sorry about the nausea and fatigue you are having. I hope it gets better soon!",

I work 12 hour day shift from 6:45 am to 7:15pm as a RN on a busy unit. I have been off work since last July because of chemo, surgery, and being neutropenic. My radiologist and oncologist have said that radiation should cause some minor fatigue and that I should be able to work through it, but I am not sure about that. I am wondering if any of you that have gone through radiation can give some advice? Diagnosed with BC at 29, no family history.

When I asked her about going to work she said that if I really wanted to go back, she would fill out paperwork needed for me to work light duty while on radiation. Her worry is that I haven't been able to work through chemo, I have been too tired, anemic, and for the past two months despite getting neupogen-I am still neutropenic, so she is afraid of the risk for infection. She told me that she would prefer that I not go to work during rads, and that she wants me to use that time to get used to being on my feet for 12hrs at a time so that when the time comes, I will be ready. Unfortunatly the rads center is not in the hospital and is only open 8-4:30. Also my job wont let me come back part time, they want me back full time. Luckily with my leave of absence I have until July 31st. My last taxol is friday, yay! I am going to ask my MO tomorrow when I can be okay to get back to the gym, I think that will help. In the meantime, we have had gorgeous weather here, so I have been going out for walks on my good days!",
