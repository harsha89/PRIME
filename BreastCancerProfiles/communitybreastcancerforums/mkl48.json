There wasn't a significant difference in his outcomes from being 10 pounds overweight to being really obese.Many other obesity related illnesses show a ten to 15% weight lb loss is very helpful. He did a ten year study, but there is no info as to whether the women who started out overweight did  any better if they lost it or were they just\"doomed\" from the start. Do any of you researchers have data that weight loss really matters or does the cancer retain its aggressive nature even if there is weight loss.I do not know if he looked at Her status or ER +.But they were post men so probably ER+. Now the exercise data shows benefit for obese as well as best weight women. And isn't the diet info confusing that is posted on the home page. It does seem as though the whites are just not good for us even without added fat.Beth",

      "Content": "Jan 15, 2008 12:04AM - edited Jan 15, 2008 01:00AM by mkl48 Tender and others, Just what do we eat? I have been eating both peanut butter and almonds so that I had a high fat source to better absorb Aromasin per study.AT this point it seems no suger, wheat , lentils, chickpeas-HUMMUS- or red meat. Then too dairy seems suspect.Apples with peel have to shown to reduce cancer,but maybe only for er- women. I really am confused because my oncologist has never mentioned these food related sources of estrogen. Let's add eggs because of cholesterol. Breakfast is a whole new question- no toast, oatmeal ,most cereals or coffee. For the record what about the estrogenic properties of the phyto and Xeno estogenS you omitted?Beth  Just did a little more reading- add raisins and prunes to the no list. Even broccoli, citrus and tomato can be considered estrogenic foods.Those almonds may lower blood sugar which when high can increase risk. The apples lose their so called anti-cancer properties when peeled by the way. I wonder what Allyson has to add since her diet is based on daily consumption of many of these foods.  So the chemo we ER+ women took may have little value and the healthy diets may be increasing our estrogen while the AIs are adding belly fat,raising insulin and increasing testosterone so that androgen dependent tumors can have a field day. What then is the best diet-Is there any research in people-not mice??  COULD IT BE THAT THE NEGATIVE OUTCOME FROM THE 2 LARGE  DIETARY STUDIES WHICH DEMONSTARTED LITTLE BENEFIT FOR ER+ WOMEN EITHER ON A LOW FAT DIET OR 8+ SERVING VEGETABLE DIET WAS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUBSTITUTING OR ADDING ESTROGENIC FOODS?",

We have some on the boards who are supplementing with them. What about lavendar. I gave some expensive cream away when i learned it had lavendar. Now most of my creams should go if the paraben thesis holds up. I wonder about the bona fides of Quillen. Is he really a respected professional.

While studies have been done on soy and flax, there is probably even less consensus about the impact of the peanut butter toast, almond snack, coffee break and hummus  veggie sandwich, variations of which would make up a low fat high flavonoid diet  ABOVE PARAGRAPH WRITTEN SECOND Found and bookmarked the referenced article. Note my plea above about human clinical investigation, not mice, transgenic or otherwise. Even the chapter on Tamoxifin and soy-flax had contradictory outcomes. Maybe because i had lobular I am just as concerned about the less obvious, sneaky sources from almonds to parabens.I really like what the Olay Regenerist line has done for my aging complexion- just full of parabens!!!.   Beth",
