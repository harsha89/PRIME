I can get very discouraged at times thinking all of \"this\" is just in my head! But....my legs ACHE...especially at bedtime....I've been told it could be the Percocet....so I stopped taking it....I was only taking 1 10mg pill a day.....now I use Advil or Aleve....sometimes Excedrin Back & Body.....  I get frustrated because I don't have my energy back yet.....AUGH!!! I just can't seem to shake this feeling.....thank you, Tamoxifen...!!! hahahahaha.....Boy, does that stuff mess with my emotions!!!  All in all....I'm TRYING to keep an attitude of gratitude.....trust God for each day....and don't worry about tomorrow....  Thanks to you for giving me some peace of mind......God bless all of you.....  I love you......LOTS!!!
