Last week my wife had an mamagram and US done because she is now 40 and she also has had a benign mass (fibro fatty) biopsy/removed from right breast when she was younger. I don't understand these findings I toyed below and it will be 2 weeks before a surgeon can get us in for a consultation for biopsy. Radiology Doc couldn't tell us anything. They found 2 spots on her left breast. Currently, I'm freaking out more than my wife is. Is this report something I should be really worried about or am I just freaking myself out for no reason right now? Birads 4b sounds really concerning. Any help appreciated! Tissue density: The breast tissue is heterogeneously dense. Findings: Mammogram findings. The dense tissue may obscure some lesions mammograhically. Chronic biopsy changes of the right breast upper outer quadrant. In the left breast, there is a small but elongated mass medially, best shown on tomogram images partially obscured by overlying parenchyma tissues. This measures less than 2cm in length. Additional small circumscribed ovoid mass slightly further medial and prosterior. No suspicious Calcifications found in either side. Ultrasound In left breast, ultrasound reveals an irregular Hypoechoic mass in the 9:30 sector 6cm from nipple measuring 1.5 x 0.9 x0.5 cm. Internal echotexture favoring a solid lesion. Adjacent small Hypoechoic well-circumscribed lesion measuring 4 mm in the same coordinates with similar sonographic characteristics. Impression 1. Two adjacent masses in the left breast 9:30 are indeterminate. Correlation with biopsy is recommended 2. No suspicious findings in right breast Category Birads 4b suspicious (intermediate) Recommendation Needle biopsy left breast Log in to post a reply",
