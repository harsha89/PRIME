I am so scared...I am only 35 years old and have two little girls....just never thought I would have to deal with this so soon.  I just went in because my company was paying for it and it was free...I mean why not right?  I guess I'm glad I did.  Has anyone this age deal with this?  My head is pounding fro crying and just don't know where to go from here...I am so nervous and scared. Thanks in advance....Kim Log in to post a reply",

I can't thank you enough for your thoughts and prayers.",
