I am 45 and I have a strong family history of BC, my mother had it twice post menopause and 3 sister's have all had it in their early 40's. I also have an aunt and two cousins. We do not carry the BRAC gene. Due to my family history, I've been getting regular mammo's and US (as needed) for over a decade. I've always been told I have extremely dense breast >75% and many benign cysts. I recently had an MRI. The MRI report found two suspicious masses one on each breast. Left breast mass had irregular size and irregular margins BI RAD 4B. Right breast appears more like an oval cyst but had T2 Hyperintense signal BI RAD 4A. Recommended Core Biopsy. I went today for a US guided core biopsy and they could not do it, because of the amount of cysts I have, they were afraid of missing the mark and getting a false negative. I am now scheduled to have anMRI guided biopsy on June 17th. Is waiting 3 extra weeks to get a biopsy normal? My sister's who are all BC survivors are really freaking out, they believe it should be done sooner. I am of the mind set that they are benign, they were never spotted on either Mammo or US and I've heard/read a lot about false positive MRI results. Any thoughts or advice regarding this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for any and all info offered. Log in to post a reply",
