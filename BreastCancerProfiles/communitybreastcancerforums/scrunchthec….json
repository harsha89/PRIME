I won't be seeing any results until next week. I am also going out of town next week, and am thinking of not answering any phone calls from my ONCs office until I get back. I see him Oct 21 for my first round of H&P 4ever. Based on my tumor markers and the lack of \"lumpiness\" in my breast and lymph nodes, I am pretty sure that THP has knocked out a lot of tumor activity. It is possible that there is still some activity in my lymph nodes and liver, but I have no way of knowing until I get the results. I plan to drink a lot and eat the forbidden smoked salmon and raw veggies next week!",

And - it looks like I might have had a complete response to treatment! It's hard to say with absolute certainty (the test is written in a language that is nearly incomprehensible), but it seems that \"ONLY MILD RESIDUAL LOW LEVEL UPTAKE WITHIN THE RIGHT BREAST LESION\" is present, all of the lymph nodes are \"resolved\" and about my liver, which had a bunch of small lesions they said: \"PREVIOUS SMALL FOCI OF ABNORMAL UPTAKE WITHIN THE LIVER IS NO LONGER SEEN.\" I'll know for sure when I talk to my oncologist next Tuesday, but it looks good. \"IMPRESSION: OVERALL POSITIVE RESPONSE TO TREATMENT,\" the summation read. So I am happy and hopeful. For the record, I am one of those HER2+++ patients (no ER and almost no PR) who received the Cleopatra protocol. Here's hoping for good news for all of my fellow Stage IV sisters.",

Whey you take the radioactive glucose, cancerous cells react more - intensely - and \"light up\" on the PET-CT imaging. The brighter they light up, the higher the rate of metabolic activity, and potentially the more active the cancer area is. My oncologist told me that an area is considered cancerous if the SUV is greater than 3. Amazing what you can learn in the first 5 months of a cancer diagnoses.",

I have a tiny bit of what is probably neuropathy in my toes (they feel swollen and gushy). It's not too bad, tho - not bad enough to keep me from getting around or running. I also have an eye vibration - a variation on tired eyes where the lids pulsate a bit.I do feel better just on H&P than on THP. sj",

No terrible side effects so far (I get tired a week out). My blood counts seem to bounce back by the time I come in for the next dose. I lost my hair, of course, but invested in a decent synthetic wig ($275), a hat ($35) and some caps to wear underneath. Ah, I do get some, um, girly itching. Showers help, as does the monistat anti-itching cream. That part does not last too long, maybe 3 days right after chemo. So far, the chemo has been quite tolerable, and certainly far from the scary picture I had conjured in my imagination. sj",
