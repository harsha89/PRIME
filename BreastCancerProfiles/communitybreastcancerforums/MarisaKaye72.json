    "Content": "MarisaKaye72 wrote: I found a lump in my right breast.  My primary care doctor, husband and the surgeon feel it.  The surgeon said it is about 2 cm.  It didn't show on the mammogram or the ultrasound.  My mother, sister, a maternal and a paternal aunt all had breast cancer.  My sister died at 34 and my paternal aunt in her 60's. Mom mom passed away 7 weeks ago and they think that she had cancer in her other breast.  I saw the surgeon yesterday and he scheduled me for an excision biopsy but said it doesn't feel like cancer.  I am scared.  I asked for an MRI but was told with my family history that it would be best to do the biopsy.  I am 41.  Should I have requested the MRI first?
