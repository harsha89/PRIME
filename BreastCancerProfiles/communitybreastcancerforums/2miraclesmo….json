So, here it goes. lol I am so tired of waiting on my hair to grow back that I want to get extensions. My hair is long enough to get them, I just don't know what kind to get. I have had a few consultations and each hair stylist recommends a different kind. I want to get them before next weekend when we go on vacation. Any ideas or suggestions or information period?!? TIA!",

My hair started growing back around my 2nd taxol treatment in Feb. of this year. It was really weird. I lost my eyebrows and eyelashes, but my hair started growing. lol The sides and back are growing really fast, but the top is slow. Now if the top grew as fast as the rest then I would not have needed a trim. oh well. At least I have hair! lol",

It kind of feels like when I was losing my hair. I do know that know that it is long enough for me to lose some, I seem to freak out when I shower and see all the hair coming out. I know it is a normal amount, but after what I/we have been through, it freaks me out! lol Does anyone else do this?",

I'm not sure what good it would do since I do not sleep on the top of my head, but any excuse to buy a satin pillow case is a good one to me. Lol it also does not hurt all the time. It goes in stages. I have noticed it does it more if I miss my coconut oil hair treatment. Then as soon as I do it, it stops. There is no flaking so I know it isn't dry scalp.",

They requested I wear one. I didn't mind. They put me in the two year olds room and the assistant directors son pulled my wig off when I was in the floor playing. Lol he didn't know what to think until I started laughing. Then they all did and I just through it up on the shelves. I really didn't wear it after that. I was also lucky in that my hair started growing back during Taxol. I did lose my eyelashes and eyebrows then though. It was weird. Since then, it has grown pretty fast.",
