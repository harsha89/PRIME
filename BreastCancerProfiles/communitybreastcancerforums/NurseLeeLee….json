Trying to \"tough it out\" isn't working for me. My Dr. told me on my last visit, \"stop trying to be superwoman\".  I think I'm going to med-up next treatment.  I hate the general malaise feeling, yuk. ",

Taking my 3rd treatment on the 18th.  I have several questions: 1.  How long does each chemo tx keep you down? 2.  Do you receive Nuelasta after each treatment? 3.  Anyone have side effects such as reflux or other stomach issues? 4.  Did you change your diet once you began chemo?  If so, how?
