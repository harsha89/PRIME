I also chose demi-perm/temp coloring mostly because I have zero experience in this area. I opted to color it before I started going topless because my hair was all growing in white and I couldn't quite tell for sure how much was there!  It seems to be growing pretty fast right now, but maybe it just *seems* that way b/c it's so short. I'm glad I'm getting in the growth I am now b/c I start tamox next month and I hear 'round these here parts that it can slow the growth.  I think I'm due for an update on my coloring tonight, too. ",

Just throwing you an FYI -- I kept most of my eyelashes throughout treatment, but they all fell out about 6 weeks PFC. I lost most of my eyebrows some time between the 5th and 6th infusion.  The eyebrows are coming back in nicely now, and I have some signs of eyelash growth, but it is really weird to not have any eyelashes! Something I didn't expect 6 weeks PFC.  P.S. just read your tag line, and we had different chemo regimes. I had taxotere and cyclophosmide.  Good luck with the eyelashes! Cheers! Martha",

My hair grew back fast and furious after chemo, but I've noticed a considerable slow-down since I started Tamoxifen 12/2/11. And in the last week, I'm noticing some eyelash loss...hopefully that will taper.

I can share with you some what I've experienced: 1) When I was first diagnosed, my oncologist told me that there have been studies that linked alcohol to breast cancer incidence. While I was not what I would consider an problem drinker, I usually had about 2-3 drinks each evening, and sometimes more on the weekends with friends. While undergoing chemotherapy, I simply did not have the taste for it, and still don't now. I still have one chemo infusion to go, and now I may have 2-3 drinks a week, if any at all.  2) Your wife may need to take some pain pills while recovering from her surgery, and again when recovering from chemo treatments. Chemotherapy kills the bone marrow and can make you feel very achy. I can also cause neuropathy in finger tips/hands, toes/feet, and skin. Her medical oncologist will not prescribe more than she will need.  3) It occurs to me that your wife may be using the alcohol and pills to help her deal with her diagnosis. There is no way to describe the fear that you feel when you hear that you have breast cancer. It's beyond words. If you can, try to get her to talk about her diagnosis, and let her know that you will be there for her, no matter what. Then you be sure to follow through with that. It might be helpful if she got involved with a cancer support group to help her work through her feelings. I know this is a very difficult time for you, but take how you feel and muliply that 1000-fold, and that's an inkling of how your wife feels.  She needs all of your love, patience and support right now, and will for the long term. I would encourage you to seek out a support group for spouse and get the support you need so you can support her.  Hang in there. You are not alone. ",

You're probably not actually having a nose bleed per se, but rather your mucus membranes are dried out and cracking/bleeding because they are dry. I've had the same symptoms, too. I have found 2 things that have helped relieve this symptom -- 1) Nasal saline spray. However, my onc indicated that I should not use a nettie pot or tip my head back...just use it for the nasal passages.  2) Using a q-tip, I will dab a little triple antibiotic ointment in my nose, usually before bedtime. I use the same stuff you would use for cuts and scrapes.  I usually get a little bit of a scratchy throat and a craggy voice -- pretty much from the same thing...dried-out mucus membranes. I'm just glad I haven't had any mouth sores, also caused by the drying effects.  Definitely speak with your onc, though, so they are sure to note the issue. ",

You are a strong bunch...hang in there...it does come to an end and you WILL feel better. I feel a tiny bit better each day. (TC x6 every 3 wks, finished 9/9/11.) Chrys, I'm sorry you have having such a horrible time! I don't know about your other reactions/SE's, but I can say that the burning/tingling/numbness in your hands and feet is typical of TC -- peripheral neuropathy is what they call it. Chemo absolutely trashed my fingernails, but they'll come back, and there were days I couldn't go to work because both of my feet were numb up to my ankles, so I wasn't comfortable walking. I can confirm that this will get better when you finish the treatments. Has your MO prescribed any pain meds? This can lessen the perpherial neuropathy...it did for me, anyway.  Hugs to all of you!",

It's not only based on your staging, but it's also based on the type of BC you have, your race and ethnicity, your age, your genetics, etc., etc. etc. Additionally, the information, as it is formally measured by the feds, is relative to general population AND the data is a few years old. If you're really interested in this stuff, you can check out seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html.... Just don't get too wrapped around the axel by what you read. Remember, the data is dated, it's compared to the general population, and is very complicated by staging and exact diagnoses.  Every patient is different. There have been huge strides, as we all know, in treatment and survival rates in the past few years. We have strength. We have faith. We have science. All on our side.  ",

While I'm not a researcher, I work in academic research administration. I've been in this and similar roles for nearly 10 years. Because of this experience, I tend to take a single research study with a grain of salt. Correlation does not equal causation. Until a research study can unequivocally state why variable A causes outcome B, I merely take it under consideration.  How many times have we been told that coffee is good bad good bad bad good for us?",
