      "Content": "lisjo wrote: Hi all, One year ago after 17 years cancer free I had two lymph nodes and a small bone met on my pelvis. Did radiation and it took care of it. Then I was put on falsodex which did not work, then femera-did not work. I had a pet scan yesterday and found out today that I have multiple mets and some lymph nodes. I see my onc Tuesday, and he told me on the phone I will have to get chemo. I was ER+ but now I wonder if it has changed. He said something about a biopsy on a node that is by my esaphogus. I know that would be dangerous. It is not in my liver or lungs. My question-can this be managed or am I looking at the end of my life? What kind of chemos are out there? I had adrymiacin, taxol, cytocin years ago. It was horrible. Is there hope for quality of life? Lisa Log in to post a reply",

My pet scan showed 2 nodes that have lit up, and my MRI showed two small spots on my pelvis that are\"suspicious for developing mets\". I had radiation in late summer/fall on a small met in my pelvis. My tumor markers are 111. They slowly, but steadily rise. I am so beaten down. I take this to mean I have quick progression....so now I am back on femara which kept me cancer free. I can't imagine it will work if falsodex does not. Still in bed at 2:02 in the afternoon. I feel doomed.",
