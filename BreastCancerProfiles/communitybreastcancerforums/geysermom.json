I had PBM four weeks ago and my breast surgeon is well aware of my painkiller problem.  To tell you the truth, I have had a total of 4 surgeries in the past 18 months and have informed the surgeon each time that painkillers and I have a \"history\".  The two surgeons who have done my four surgeries have never withheld pain medication when I really needed it.  They both reassured me repeatedly when I had complications (from two of the surgeries) that warranted continued pain medication use long after what would have been customary.  I kept questioning it since I was worried about my history and they kept telling me that given what I was going through I really did need to continue with the pain medication. In my opinion, as an RN with 18 years experience, I can't see why the anesthesiologist needs to know unless you are worried that the preop medication dose may not be enough for you to realize any benefit.  Otherwise, the anesthesiologist specializes in making you sleep and the dosages for accomplishing that are tailored to the response of each patient and vary enough that they don't look at you, determine a dose and then forget about making any adjustments.  Remember also, if you do tell the anesthesiologist, you are probably not going to have a lot of contact with him (or her) in the future so it's not that big of deal. In my career I have run across a few surgeons who have been unreasonably stingy with pain medication so I encourage you to openly discuss this issue with your surgeon and ask how they feel about having to give you more medication because of your tolerance.  Their reaction to your \"revelation\" will tell you a lot.  I think being honest up front will save you from having your surgeon react badly and decide that he or she will not even consider prescribing the amount of medication you actually need. I am now very happily remarried to a very wonderful man who has been extraordinarily supportive during all of my surgeries and recoveries.  My DH is well aware of my history and helps me determine if I need a pain pill or if another intervention might help me just as much.  He also has assured me repeatedly that taking a pain pill was ok when I really needed it.  On a happier, life goes on note, my two children, now 22 and 24 just spent spring break with us and both sent me flowers and called on Mother's Day! You didn't say if your life was better now and if you have contact with your children.  I really hope so since going through this surgery is difficult and having a good support network (whatever that looks like) is so helpful. Good luck to you and I am sending postive thoughts and prayers your way. Julie P.S.  I didn't go to rehab since I didn't have insurance after losing my job and weaned myself off of narcotics completely on my own.  It was the most difficult thing I have ever done in my life and I ended up in the ED twice as well.",

My BS had me go for a breast MRI just in case to further the evidence for my insurance company but with that and the last mammo they approved it right away. I am 47, have had abnormal mammos and biopsies since age 31, and only a paternal grandmother with BC.  I opted not to have genetic testing so insurance can't say my developing BC was a \"pre-existing condition\" and deny me coverage in the future. I am very happy with my choice.  The PBM, TEs, and exchange were not easy but I think it is more than worth it to remove the worry and constant need for biopsies from my life.",

I am in good overall health and very active.  I did, however, have more than the usual amount of pain (from what I read here).  My husband was home with me the first two days after surgery (Saturday and Sunday) and then he returned to work.  The things that I needed help doing: 1.  Washing my back and washing my hair.  My DH took me to a salon twice (every other day) before I could wash my hair myself and I would arrange for him to wash my back by doing it before he went to work or after he got home.  *You could arrange to have a friend take you for a shampoo and then wash your back when they brought you home.  You will only be able to sponge bathe so you could have the rest of your body covered up if you are modest.  2.  I sometimes needed help getting dressed.  I could have done it without DH but it was less painful to have him help me with some items. Things I didn't need help doing: 1.  I never needed help getting in and out of the recliner I slept in for several days and when I started sleeping in a bed I was also able to get in and out by myself.  As I mentioned before, I am in reasonably good shape. 2.  I had lots of prepared food from friends and neighbors and I was able to microwave it and carry it to where I was sitting by thinking it through (I couldn't do it in the usual way) and figuring out a way that was not going to hurt or cause me injury. 3.  I managed my drains myself.  However, I have a friend who simply could not bear to look at her drains so she had to have help milking the tubes and emptying the drains.  You probably have some idea of how you will react to having semi-bloody fluid draining out of you and your ability to look at it and/or empty and measure the amount 2-3 times a day.

My parents visited after I went home and other than that only one close neighbor has been allowed to visit since my surgery.  Their visits, although brief, really wore me out. You really need to focus your energy on recovery from your surgery, not towards entertaining your family and friends.  If you feel up to it, you can always call and let them know how you are doing.  That way you can call when you are not loopy from the medication and are feeling relatively well. Good luck with your surgery and try to think postive thoughts, I really believe that makes a difference in making your experience a good one. Julie",
