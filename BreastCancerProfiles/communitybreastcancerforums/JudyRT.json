    "Content": "JudyRT wrote: My mammogram because of \"unusual thickening\" in both breast resulted in an ultra-sound which resulted in a MRI yesterday. Just got a call that I have increased blood flow in both breasts and need to have a needle biopsy. The nurse said it does not necessarily mean it is cancer but what else could it be? I am very scared and very worried. My biopsy is scheduled for next week. Thank you. Log in to post a reply",
