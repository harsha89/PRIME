Turns out the second mammogram was clear and not even a biopsy is needed. After my mother's experience I guess I assumed the worst. I'm still glad to have the information as the threat of breast cancer will always be there.",

My mother died of imflammatory breast cancer 14 years ago, so there is a family history. What are the best oncologists and cancer treatment facilities in the Galesburg, Illinois area. I have family in Hannibal and St. Louis Missouri and am a little familiar with the Missouri University hospital in Columbia. I'm also open to travelling to Chicago, Iowa City, Quad Cities or Peoria. Just want to make an informed decision if I'm told I need a biopsy and possible surgery, etc. Help!   Log in to post a reply",
