Well all my drains are out and I am still wearing the camisole. The hospital gave me a bra with no underwire and that hooks in the front, I tried to wear that a few times but my camisole is the most comfortable. I went to this store that my hospital told me to go to purchase this type of camisole the owner set me up with just one and she told me when my drains all come out to come back and she will fit me for a bra. In a few months I will have another surgery to even out my breast so I will go back to get fitted for my final bra then. I wish I got two of the same camisole but my insurance would only pay for one so I would wear it a few days and wash, they wash really nice. My camisole brand name is an Amoena style no. 2105 Best wishes and prayers for you on your upcoming surgery. Hugs Giselle",

Its has been 21 days. The ps said under 40cc for 24 hours they can come out. Mine is still between 50cc-60cc. My questions is what is the longest can you have drains for? What happens if I never get under 40cc and stay at 50cc. I am worried the longer i keep these drains in I can get an infection from that. I am drainng almost like a real clear pinkish liquid. Mentally I am ready to flip out over these drains!!! Any advice would be appreciated!!! Dx 10/12/2009, DCIS, <1cm, Stage 0, Grade 2, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",

After my MX with Diep, I never thought I would be able to get back in my bed agian. it took me about 6 - 7 weeks to finally be able to a good nights rest in my bed. I slept on a recliner before then. My doctor gave me sleeping pills to help me wherever I was. They did help some. Hang in there, this is not forever and believe me you will be back sleeping in your bed with your hubby.",

Has any one had this? My surgery is sceduled in a few weeks and the day before I have to drink this orange liquid so nothing will be in me. I am a little nervous. I am really thinking about just getting my tattoo and nipple and let my tummy stay buldged. This surgery is a 2 hour surgery and it is out patient but I cannot lift anything for 6 weeks.

      "Content": "Apr 12, 2010 10:22PM - edited Apr 12, 2010 10:23PM by Giselle4 Hi Joanie, I had a right MX with immediate DIep back in January. i did not have problems with anesthesia,  I had problems with the morphin. After they settled me into a room they put the morphin pump  on.  I then started to itch all over and my ears got blocked so bad that I could not hear. I started to panic. They took me off the pump and started pumping me with benadryl and thank God slowly my hearing came back.They then put me on percoset (sp) with motrin. It is now in my chart that I cannot have morphin due to that weird reaction with my hearing. I go for my stage 2 of my Diep at the end of May. I wish you a speedy recovery and hang in there with the drains. I had my in for a little over three weeks. I hope they can figure out what to do with the anesthesia before your next surgery. God Bless and Take Care Giselle",
