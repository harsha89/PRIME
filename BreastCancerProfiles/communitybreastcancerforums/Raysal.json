Biggest side effect is the rash even though ive been slathering with lotion, also muscle tightness similar pain to after snb, but thats because they radiated the muscle.. otherwise managing alright. For those who are starting this month, its less scary than it seems and the sessions are much faster than expected - at least thats how i found it",

Initially i was supposed to have 25 sessions, so i dunno whether the reduction has to do with revised guidelines or something else since when i first met my RO she saif because i was under 40 the protocol was at least five weeks. Had i been over 40 (or closer to 40) she could have considered the shorter schedule. So no idea. Not sure if its hypofraction? I know its IORT, not sure on the difference.",

I still don't know what my treatment plan holds but my dr thinks it will probably be rads and hormone therapy.. I guess at some point we just have to let go and hope for the best and try to live our life.. have faith in our doctors and medical system. no point in worrying about the uncontrollable and gravitating negative thoughts.. really hard to do so, but I'm trying to live the moment than worry about the unknown..",

      "Content": "Raysal wrote: I'm a 34 year old female with 3 young kids recently diagnosed with I believe early stage breast cancer. I had a biopsy done on the lump, as well as two axillary lymph nodes that appeared swollen during the ultrasound and they were soft during the biopsy. The results came back as IDC of no specific type, provisionally grade II. ER+ PR+ HER2- and ki67 5% and axillary nodes negative. I also had an MRI which measured the lump as 1.4cm and nothing on axillary nodes. I'm scheduled for a lumpectomy and a sentinal node biopsy. My first question is the sentinal node biopsy required? My other question is that my MRI report mentions \"multiple high T1 signal seen in the ducts seen extending from distal breast to subareolar region. They are starting below and anterior to the mass. They do not show significant enhancement in subtracted images represent inspissited materials probably from recent biopsy.\" What does this mean?! Diagnosed on 9/27/18 shortly after 34th birthday.
