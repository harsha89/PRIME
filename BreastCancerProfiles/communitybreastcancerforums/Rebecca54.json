I'm 6 months PFC and hair is still slow slow slow at growing back but I have enough so that I don't feel like I have to wear anything. I HATED my wig, favorite thing were chemo beanies which I didn't find until the end. They're pre tied so you just pop them on and some have ruffles so you get a little lift. http://chemobeanies.com/product-category/all-chemo... I had my 2nd \"hair cut\" last week and my hair lady said that it is really hard to color hair post chemo. Apparently it doesn't take color well at all. Did anyone else find that this is true? I love her and she's been through this with a lot of clients but I have found that everyone is so different. Hair's too short to color anyway.  1st photo with my fav chemo beanie, then October, Nov, Dec, Jan. Clearly I am obsessed with hair as I have felt the need to document! lol!!!!! May we all get the hair we want in the end!!!!! A_MEN!   ",
