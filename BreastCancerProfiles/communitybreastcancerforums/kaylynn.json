His wife left after she felt he wasnt there for her for breast cancer. She like i had no intentions of even telling him of the diagnosis.  You think he would have learned but i guess it is just the way people are and they cant be changed. We think they will change but they cant. I knew when i had to have double eye surgery and he never offered to take me or ask about it i was in trouble. So i guess i am not shocked he is reacting the same way this time. As for my family that is left i have said nothing to them and wont either i will not give them the chance to run again. Since they already have. You sure do find out who the real people are thru this. That may not be a bad thing. ",

I also am finding out that my boyfriend is not happy about me going for a biopsy and has pretty much put me on ignore and left Monday to go to work 140miles away.Has not contacted me since,has never asked if I have an appointment since I told him jan 4th I needed a biopsy. I have been thru cancer before and I remember the people disappearing from my life like they could catch it.It was so devastating at the time,but I can tell you it made me stronger to say fine I can do this alone.Now I don't really have the fear of I have to have people to get thru things,ok it does help to have one or two to talk to but they can be found even if it is this forum.You may feel week and alone right now,i know I do and I have been thru this before.But you will get so much stronger in mind and about life.You will learn that you are worth a lot and that it was just them tearing down your defenses.I have been thru the mother standing by the guy thing before to,and I agree to keep the distance from her for now to avoid anymore stress and anxiety. You are never alone.Reach out of your comfort zone to other people and you will be shocked who is will be there for you.It will be the least expected.Sadly not always family and best friends. As for me I don't know what I will do \"with him\". But I know I can manage just fine with out him if he cant stand by me through this.",

The dr did talk to me before surgery. They are still confused what it is and that a papilloma doesnt form that far back but the biopsies showed b9. She did discuss that there could be cancer that wasnt found on biopsy.she also said the biopsy showed them it had to be removed. So it is a guessing game what is growing. I will know more maybe thursday. Not in much pain. I did just take 2 regular tylenol. I didnt get the narco prescription filled. The pain is far back along the chest wall. ",

Rottiemom i am sorry the stereotactic biopsy is confusing them.I know I will get attacked in PM again for saying this but the core biopsy I had, USUALLY takes a larger sample (a cone shape)so they can at least rule out cancer type cells. Unless they are checking micocalcifications and them are so small and hard to get a good sample of.",

Riding in a car hurts like hell,,i guess the dd cup bounces to much.yes i have a support bra on 24 hrs a day. I didnt fill the pain med prescription just using tylenol. It is manageable but if you let the pain set in it takes a bit to get it under control. My mass was way back against the chest wall so the pain maybe be worse due to the depth. I thought i would be able to go to work by Wednesday but not going. I never got to sleep until 2:30am and was up early. Even took xanax. Hoping tonite is better but with the pain i think i will wake me up alot. Hope you all are doing well..",

My biopsy just came back B9 with a Birad of 4.They arent sure what it is a couple possibilities one a papilloma. Mine also is growing at an alarming rate they say.The alaming area is only 7mm but the whole area is 6cm.They want mine removed which they probably will with yours to Stacey.My surgery is Monday.I will be glad to have it removed and get an all clear on the total thing. Oh and I asked the dr is there a chance it can come back cancer after the whole thing is removed and she said no.We know that isn't always true.",
