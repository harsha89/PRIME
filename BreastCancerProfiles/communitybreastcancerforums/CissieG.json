      "Content": "CissieG wrote: I have bilateral breast cancer with two lumpectomies.  I am almost finished with radiation treatment for both breasts for 5 weeks and the 6th week of boosts to the surgery incisions. I have finished the 5 weeks of whole breast irradiation and 1 boost and now have just 4 more boosts left. I was ok until about a week or so ago. I am very fair and have large breasts, so now I have pretty bad skin burning and breaking down of tissue, especially under the breasts and on one SN incision so far. I know it will get worse before it gets better even when radiation treatments end. Does anyone have any ideas of the best products to use? Currently I alternate using 100% aloe (no alcohol), aquaphor (soooo greasy, yuck), silver sulfadiazine, triaminicinolone for itchy areas, and neosporin with pain relief on the open areas to prevent infection. I saw an ad for \"My Girl's Radiation Cream\". Has anyone tried that? Does it work? I am just looking for the best relief. Suggestions are appreciated.
