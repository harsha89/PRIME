When medical professionals ask me to wait 6 months \"to see\" I interpret that as them using me as a human petri dish. I have a 9mm & 1mm nodule in my left breast in which doctors deem as \"appears\" to be a lymph node & this is after two mammo's & ultrasound. They are wanting me to wait 6 months \"to see\" and be retested. I have found another doctor and insisting to be retested. I want to know for sure. I would go in for a biopsy.I am pushing for a biopsy myself.",
