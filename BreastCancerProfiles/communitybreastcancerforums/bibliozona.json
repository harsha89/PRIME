      "Content": "bibliozona wrote: Hi all, I've been lurking here and am finally to the point where I need to ask a few questions to those who might have some experience. The new puppy jumped on me and bruised my left breast in February. By August, there was a lump that would come and go with my cycles and felt like a bruise. I went and had a look-see with ultrasound, the doc said it was a suspicious mass of about 1cm; she recommend we biopsy it right away. I was already there, so I agreed. Came back as IDC, ER/PR neg, HER2 pos. My breast was sore and swollen for weeks after biopsy. By the time I had a mammo and MRI two weeks later, they said the tumor was 6cm. Because I did things \"out of order\" with US first - I suspected they were seeing inflammation caused by biopsy. I found a nearby treatment center and met with MO and BS. Had lymph node biopsied in left armpit, came back clear. PET scan came back clear - no mets. Because of the size of tumor, they recommended chemo first, then lumpectomy, followed by a year of Herceptin. Had port placed on Sept 8, 2016. Started on TCHP on Sept 15, 2016. Had an MRI just before my 4th round, last Wednesday. The MRI is clear. No malignancy, no sign of tumor. The side effects from this protocol have been rather severe for me. I could deal with hair loss and fatigue. It's the tummy effects and the fact that I believe I've developed an anal fissure - my whole undercarriage hurts, it hurts to breathe, it hurts to pee, it hurts to bend over to pick up a sock, and most of all, it hurts like hell to poop. It bleeds like crazy, I sit on ice packs and slather on Prep-H and Emla cream to numb it, but it's inside of me where I can't get to it. So, at this point, the tumor is gone and I'm suffering. I've got numbness up both arms, my face, lips and throat are numb, and my knees buckle when I stand for too long. My heart rate is all over the place. I went in to get fluids and electrolytes and the nurses had never seen a heart rate behave like mine. My MO is very stubborn and insists that I complete all 6 rounds. I am willing to continue with Herceptin and Perjeta, but at this point, I am feeling like the chemo drugs are not necessary any longer. I believe they are causing more harm than good. When the tumor is gone, it's not medicine anymore, it's poison, at least in my mind. I've looked for studies about the effectiveness of 4 vs. 6 rounds of TCHP and there isn't much out there. An old study using older drugs from 2010 seems to indicate that 4 is just as effective, and 6 just produces more long-term side effects. Can anyone give me their experiences/thoughts? Had good results with similar diagnosis? Walked away from chemo? Found a new MO? My next infusion is scheduled for Dec 8th. Thank you for your insights, whatever you can offer.

I guess it depends on if they find any node involvement in surgery. I am scheduled for another MRI and PET scan to make sure I'm all clear everywhere, then surgery will be scheduled soon after. Thank you for your kind wishes! I'm eating a few bites of real food, and feeling stronger every day.  AMO",

My favorite meal of the year, and I couldn't eat but a bite or two. My face is completely numb, as are my lips and tongue. It is tough to communicate clearly with my kids and husband. I can hardly open my mouth to swallow, let alone chew food. When I do get something down my throat, I end up choking half the time because I can't feel anything. The numbness in my feet is now into my thighs, both hands are numb, and my left arm is numb to the shoulder. I'm a writer, so having my hands not work correctly is a real bother. I have cuts all over my hands because I can't feel anything, and I still have to cook dinner for everyone. That sends me to bed for a three hour nap. Haven't had solid food in 5 days. And nosebleeds galore. A couple of times a day. The butt issue is still awful. Not bleeding as much, but still sore and hurts to move. The D seems completely immune to Immodium. Hydrocodone seems to be the thing that stops the pain and gives me a breather between episodes. The heart rate is still varying between 49-90 beats, all over the place. One minute fine, the next, I feel like passing out. And I just read up on the lawsuits against the maker of Taxotere regarding permanent hair loss. I never thought I was vain about it until I lost it - but my hair was magnificent. The thought of not being able to grow it out again really breaks my heart. More so than even losing a breast at this point. Not that I am going to, because, again, the tumor is GONE according to MRI. No mets. No nodes. That was the entire goal of the the treatment, to shrink the tumor for surgical excision. We have observable proof that the treatment worked after 3 rounds. I took a 4th. I'm willing to keep on with Herceptin and Perjeta. But the chemo drugs, I think at this point, are overkill. I am growing more comfortable with this as I continue to battle the effects of the chemo. Anyone else have any experience with a decision like this? I'm gearing up to contact the MO a week or so ahead of time to tell her how I'd like to proceed. Blessings to you. Thanks for your support. AMO ",

The timetable for my surgery has been stepped up a bit, and I'll continue on with Herceptin every 3 weeks - but the worst is over! Chemo is done! Thank you!",
