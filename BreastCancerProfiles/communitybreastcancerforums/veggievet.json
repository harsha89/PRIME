The key to finding out if there is a mutation in your family would be for one of your sisters who has had cancer to have genetic testing first.  That way they can tell if there is an identifiable mutation in your family. If your sister/s test positive for a BRCA mutation there is still a 50% chance that you didn't inherit it.  Your sisters should see a board-certified genetic counselor or genetics expert with similar expertise (as opposed to just talking with their oncologist), to make sure the appropriate test is ordered and that it is interpreted correctly. Even if none of your sisters tests positive for a mutation, there is likely to be some hereditary factor in your family. I also second Leaf's suggestion of visiting the FORCE website at: http://www.facingourrisk.org the site is devoted to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, and genetic counseling and testing issues.  Hereditary cancer is somewhat complex and it's important to see an expert in genetics to help you understand the risk and make sure that you are following appropriate risk management.

I personally carry a BRCA mutation and do advocacy for the high-risk community.  I would be happy to help you find an expert in your area.  Feel free to e-mail me at: suefriedman@facingourrisk.org .
