I wear the Amoena Essential Light silicon forms with an Amoena Marlena bra. I find it very comfortable, so much so that I forget I'm wearing them. I have a long day (work full time with a commute) and I go to the gym at lunch, and I have no issues whatsoever. I'm a size A (38A bra with size 5 form) so I don't know if that matters.Good luck!",
