I was told the results were in but the doctor had gone for the day. I expressed my anxiety but was told \"Sorry, Im not the doctor\"  I began to cry and told her to page her but she said NO. What the hell? After hanging up, office called back in a few minutes stating that they were mistaken, the results were still pending. Ohhh im so angry, how would that woman feel if it was her on the other end? GOD give me strength.",
