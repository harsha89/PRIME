He said the old pierced booby sounds like an infection but he said the discharge from the other didnt sound normal. However, he told me to take antibiotics for the infection and to call him in two weeks to let him know if its all ok or if the nipples are still having the discharge. If they are then he is going to refer me to a breast clinic. Has anyone had the discharge from nipples and it be anything serious? ",

      "Content": "Misscarla wrote: hi everyone, I just wondered if someone could give me some advice.. For a long time now, over 6months atleast, iv noticed that I have had discharge from the nipple. I cant exactly remember how i first noticed, i think it was on my bra. Anyway, if i squeeze the nipple a clear fluid came out. I didnt think much of it, only that it was abit gross, but after having two children (niether breastfed) im used to all things gross. As times gone on this discharge has got darker, it was milky, then yellowish and now its taken on a green tinge. Its not painful at all. It was both breasts. I think it's important now to explain that about 4 years ago i took out a nipple piercing in my right breast as it would just flare up from time to time n be pussy. Anyway after a year it healed. So in the meantime i can get this discharge from both nipples. Untill the other day my right nipple felt sore, i looked and felt and it felt like a ball in my nipple, i applied slight pressure and puss came out along with blood. This came out of ducts aswell as where the old piercing whole was (4years old) Its no longer sore or weeping but it feels like a little ball in my nipple, i would say hardend skin from the piercing, although it has never felt like this and the piercings been out for 4years. I oringinally thought it was just hormones playing up as i had the implant in. I had that removed about 3 months ago n im still getting this discharge and now the hardend bit. Im unsure of this is something to worry about? My boyfriend has told me to go to the doctor, which i know is the logical thing to do. But im 27 and other than the right nipple being pussy etc the discharge never caused me issues. Advice please? Log in to post a reply",
