When I first got thrown into this cancer world I thought \"there is no way I can do all this, get to the end of all this mess.\" However, with a little time, I realize that its not one big leap, its the small things accumulated together which will result in the big things :) This brings me peace as grace is only granted for today, tomorrows grace will come tomorrow! How are you doing with your surgeries? How was the lumpectomy vs mastectomy? Angyojo - What surgery did you go with and how are you doing so far with it? I am anxious for the tests after surgery, then so much more knowledge is available! Good luck to you! How did your lymph nodes look?  ",

BS says March will be the surgery month, although there are still big decisions to be made. I have the option of having a lumpectomy, though due to my age and anxiety (and desire to have children) I am leaning toward a mastectomy. I will have 2 new additional \"possible\" spots my BS will biopsy tomorrow to help determine if they are for 100% cancerous. Its so difficult with my young dense breast. Plus I have always been A cup and my smaller is the cancerous one. Im just ready to get on with the program. Most excited to make this decision, have the surgery, hopefully not need chemo or rads, and start the hormone drugs! I have already discussed pausing after 2 years for conceiving. Im ready to get a plan together, beat this, and move on to starting my family! Its been hard finding those who can relate to my situation especially being under 30 and not being predisposed to the cancer. God bless and good luck to you all. ",

I was dx in January (low grade cancer quite similar to yours, a little smaller) and 2 questionable spots appeared via MRI. They were biopsyed and both were not cancer! I haven't completely decided upon lumpectomy vs masectomy (that's another board haha) but I will be having surgery this month regardless. The ladies on here are really great and helpful! Don't be afraid of the pain, take care of it and move on with your life, the best you can. For TE, a lot of girls say the pain isnt too bad because you are still numb from mx. Keep us posted. God bless!",
