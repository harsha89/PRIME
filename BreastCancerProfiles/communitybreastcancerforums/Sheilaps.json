I am experiencing treatment induced menopause and am on effexor to lessen the intensity of the hot flashes.  Some of the flashes feel like a  million little pin pricks all over!  This  occured before I started the effexor.  None of my doctors have heard of this as a side effect. This can be sometimes annoying and sometimes pretty painful. Is this or has this happened to anyone else?  Oh good greif.

I am hoping it is more of a menopause effect than some creepy detox effect which is what i am kind of feeling like it is. The effexor has definately helped with the intensity of the flashes. Not the frequency. ",
