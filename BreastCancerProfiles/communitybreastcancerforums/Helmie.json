I welcome you to our ever growing group, and just want to jump in to underscore what others already have said here. Yes, you definitely NEED to be on Zometa, or Xgeva. You also NEED to be on Herceptin, because of your Her2 status. Zometa, or Xgeva is given in addition to whatever AI, or chemo you might be on, and so is Herceptin. That your onc has not put you these drugs, I think is irresponsible. I'm on Xgeva, which is only a once a month little shot in the arm. Xgeva is proven not to be hard on your kidneys, while Zometa sometimes can cause kidney problems. Both drugs save your bone strength. Herceptin is a must for you too, unless you have a serious heart issue. I think you need to see a different onc, even if it is just for a 2nd opinion. Maybe you look for an onc that specializes in BC. Your onc might not have that many BC patients. His expertise might be a totally different kind of cancer. I wish you good luck, and success with your upcoming appointments, and treatment plans. Please keep us posted. (((Hugs))) Helmie ",

The most disabling SE for me was arthritis pain in my hands. It got so bad, that my onc switched me to Femara. There are a lot of anti hormon drugs available to which her onc can switch her. I agree with Chickadee, your moms onc should put her on Zometa or Xgeva to strengthen her bones. Both drugs are given in the Dr. office.

Really did not have any SEs to speak off. My onc also added Zoladex for about 3 months, while I was on Faslodex. I had no SEs from the Zoladex either, but it didn't do any good either. I had some short runs with Halaven (Eribulin), and Navelbine. Both are fairly mild chemos when it comes to the SEs. However, both caused hair thinning. Afinitor, the chemo your onc recommends, is a very strong drug. Lot's of unpleasant SEs. There is an Afinitor 2012 thread here in the stage IV forum. The more I read about Afinitor, the less I like it. My onc also had told me about a clinical trial at MDA in Houston, with Afinitor and Arimidex. I made an appt there, but I don't think I will go on that particular trial. You have so many options. Your onc should be able to find something gentler, and not so very toxic. Good luck, and gentle hugs, Helmie",

However, you are the only person who can make the final decision on this. Maybe after some time living with no breast you have the option of just getting an implant? The option I personally least like is option 3, but that's just me. I had tram flap reconstruction done on my left breast as I was first dx almost 14 years ago. I had a recurrence in 2007 in the chest wall underneath the tram flap. The surgery to remove the tumor destroyed my reconstructed breast. So now I'm wearing a prosthesis. I was told, my plastic surgeon could maybe reconstruct the breast with an implant, but I have not done that yet. Whatever you decide, I wish you luck and success, and most of all \"no pain\".

Maybe my understanding of zometa is wrong, but if it's correct you should not have reason to worry about progression if you lower the zometa dosage, as long as you stay on the other cancer fighting meds.

As I got my first navelbine they gave me aloxi as a pre-med anti-nausea. I had a terrible head ache for 2 days after that. The next week I got zofran, and everything was fine. However, just a day before my scheduled 2nd treatment of the 2nd cycle the head ache was back, my onc cancelled the chemo, and sent me to have a brain MRI done right away, where they discovered the subdural hematoma. I had brain surgery on Dec 5th. My onc did not put me back on the navelbine, because I still show progression, but no brain mets. Yesterday I started a new chemo, Alimta. Hope this one will work. It is actually a lung cancer drug, but back in May last year we had sent a tissue sample to Caris Life Science in TX. Amongst a bunch of other recommendations they think that Alimta might be beneficial. I hope the Navelbine will work for you for a very long time.

The fluid drains into a bottle, and you can watch it, it does not hurt. However, there will be a time when you start to cough (that's normal), they keep draining until you tell them that it's starting to hurt. The first time, they drained 1500 cc, and the second time 1300 cc. You gonna be a couple pounds lighter after this. After the first time I did not have that much pain as I had after the second time.

The CA125 kept going down every month to about 79 in Aug 2010. Then it started going back up again to 302 in Dec 2010. I left the trial, because my cancer had progressed, and I had bone mets now too. I had all kinds of scans. I have no ovarian cancer. My onc told me the high CA125 is most likely a sign of metastatic disease. I'm stable now with the drugs I'm on since March. My CA125 still lingers around 175. That seems to be the new normal for me. However, with ovarian cancer the CA125 is usually very high, like in the thousands. Your mom seems to have the kind of mets that I have (lung and bones), and she is also ER/PR+ and Her2-, just like me. So hopefully the elevated TM is just an indicator of her metastatic disease, and her onc just needs to change her meds. What meds is she on right now? I'm on Faslodex, Zoladex, and Xgeva. You know, we have stage IV BC, so we all have to be on some kind of tmt for the rest of our life. Thus far there is no cure for stage IV BC. If you go to the doctor with your mom, maybe you want to make a list of questions to ask, incl, ask about the drugs I mentioned. It is wonderful of you that you are so close to your mom, and are concerned about her. It must be hard for you, but I'm sure, your mom appreciates it very much. Stay strong, and please come back here often with all your questions. We are always here for you. Lots of (((Hugs))) for you and your mom, Helmie",

It always started completely out of the blue. The pain was so intense, that it made me vomit. My whole thoracic area hurt like hell, like a leg cramp that does not go away. Twice, my DH took me to the ER - they never found an explanation. My onc could not figure it out either, because I never had an episode, when I was in his office. One time I was at a pulmonary docs office when I got the pain. It lasted for about 45 min that time. I was crying, crouching on the floor, and begging the doc to give me something for the pain, but he said he could not do that. He had no clue where this pain was coming from either. The last time I had a pain episode was in January. Nothing after that. It just never happened again (keep my fingers crossed). Nobody ever found out the cause of it. So I guess, it must have been a fluke. I had been on all kinds of diff chemo, and hormonal drugs during that one year period. It was a mystery. I wish you will be done with this, and it will not come back ever. The pain is almost too much to bare. I don't wish that on anybody. We all deal with the effects of this disease, and the SEs of the drugs already, we don't need any more mystery pains on top of that. sending you warm ((hugs)), Helmie ",

Not bad at first, I could still eat small amounts at a time. Anyway, my disease progressed, and I quit the trial in December. Have now bone mets too. By the end of January I was not able to eat anything at all anymore. My sphincter would not open anymore to let food into my stomach. I got a feeding tube in February, and have been in, and out of hospitals a few times since than. I'm only on Faslodex, and Xgeva right now. Was on Eribulin (Halaven) for about 2 cycles, which did not work. I have a tumor on the outside of my esophagus, but it's not obstructing. I had Radiation to that tumor for 3 weeks, and now have to wait until the area has calmed down for the new Ct-scan to show any results. Anyway, I still can't eat. My Onc is at the end of his wits. He has consulted with other Oncs, but nobody seems to have a good answer. My GI Doc proposed a dilation with a 30mm balloon, but there is a risk of perforation. I'm so tired of this feeding tube. I live in FL on the water, but I can't go in it because of the feeding tube. When we have guests, I never can go out for lunch or dinner. Traveling/vacation is a problem.

It gave me terrible head aches for about a week, but I guess it brought my white count back up. Red blood count was too low as well, so after the 3rd Abraxane dose I got a blood transfusion (2 units).

My onc checks them once every 3 to 4 weeks, depending on my tx cycles. Which marker are you talking about? Is it the 27/29, or 15.3? As far as I know these are the ones that specifically relate to BC. So if they are going up, then this might be reason for concern. My onc always checks the 15.3, the CEA, and CA 125. The CA 125 is supposed to be an indicator for ovarian cancer. My CA 125 used to be at over 300, but there was nothing wrong with my ovaries or uterus at all - figure? I was on Alimta (a chemo actually primarily designed for lung cancer) from Jan until May, and my onc added another chemo (VP16) in March. He stopped everything in May because my pet scan showed progression. However, my CA 125 TM was way down to 24, which is normal, but my 15.3 had been steadily creeping up to over 60. So I guess what I'm trying to say, TMs are not really all that reliable. Hope your PET scan will bring you good news. At least you will know for sure what's going on, because they, at least, are very reliable. Good luck and warm hugs, Helmie",

I'm on my 3rd port, got one in 1998 when I was first diagnosed. Had it taken out after one year. Got the 2nd one in 2007 when I had the recurrence. I kept the port for over 4 years. So now I'm on my 3rd one. I was on Abraxane since last year August. It was working very well for me. My tumor markers went way down. I stopped Abraxane in July this year because I was supposed to have repair surgery on my skull done. However, the whole prep time with seeing all the other doctors involved took too long and my tumor markers started climbing again, even thou I was taking Arimidex and got Faslodex shots. My PET/CT in September showed progression in the lung, bone and 2 lesions in the liver. The liver mets are a new thing for me, just like yours. I got off the Faslodex and Arimidex and are now back on Abraxane. Now I'm a little concerned hearing from you that your liver mets developed while you were on Abraxane. The next time when my tumor markers will be checked will be on Oct. 28. I hope they will start to go down again, if not I might have to switch to AC or just Adriamycin as well. This worries me a little, since I have a small heart murmur and Adriamycin is pretty hart on your heart. Have they told you anything about the heart risk? ((Hugs)) Helmie",

My onc put me on a low dose of coumadin, and after a couple of months my arm was a lot better. I never found out what actually caused my arm problem. It might also be something completely different than what you are experiencing with your legs.

I'm a little confused about Xgeva, and the way it works. I started getting monthly shots in January. Had a lesion on my T6 vertebrae. My onc told me that Xgeva is basically just keeping my bones strong, it does not actually heal, or reverse the growth of bone mets. By now I have a small lesion in my left hip bone, one in my #8, and #10 rip. In addition to the Xgeva I have been on Faslodex, Zoladex, Halaven, Estradiol, and Navelbine this year. Starting a new Chemo on Jan 5th - still getting my monthly Xgeva shots too. Since I have more bone mets now then I had when I started on Xgeva, you probably understand why I'm confused (but happy for all of you) when I hear that Xgeva has stabilized, or even healed your bone mets.

After the AC I took Tamoxifen for 2 years, which kept me in early menopause, but about 6 months after I stopped the Tamoxifen I got my period back. I would guess, if the Abraxane will put you into early menopause, you would come out of it after you're done with the chemo. But it probably depends on whatever drug you're gonna get after the Abraxane. Hugs, Helmie",

As long as scans do not show any progression, the current tx is working. However, I'm sure if the nodules in your lung grow larger your onc would immediately call for a biopsy, and change your tx plan. Please do not worry too much right now. Just make sure your onc follows up with new scans at least once every 3 months. Maybe you can talk him into having another scan in 8 weeks (that's usually the interval that pharma companies use when testing new drugs). Good luck, and lots of hugs, Helmie",

In Jan. 2011 I had progression to the bones, and even more lung nodules. I tried  Eribulin, and Navelbine, and also Faslodex, and Zoladex. Nothing seems to work for me. In March and April 2011 I had to have the fluid drained out of my right lung lining. Then I was fine for several months, and had the procedure done again last Nov. Now I have another appointment scheduled for next week. Lots of fluid again. I don't understand how you describe your moms pleural fluid building up in pockets in different areas inside the lung, and also you're talking about one, or two large tumors. I have fluid built up only in the lining. The more fluid builds up, the more my right lung gets squeezed together, and breathing becomes harder. It sounds like your mom's disease progression to her lung is completely different then mine. I started a new chemo this month, Alimta, which was designed to fight Mesothelioma. Hope that one will do the trick. Maybe something to think about for future treatments for your mom too. This drug is just an out-of-the-box approach for me. I hope your mom will feel relief after the tap, and the Eribulin will work for her for a long time. Hugs, Helmie ",

You write that your mom has lung cancer. Is that what her oncologist told her it is? If this is really lung cancer and not metastatic breast cancer which has spread to her lungs, her treatment should be different. If your mom has breast cancer which has spread to her bones and lungs the treatment with Aromasin for the cancer and Zometa for bone strengthening will hopefully help her. However, I would recommend to have her oncologist check her lungs and see if she might have fluid build up, since she is in pain and can't breath very well. I used to have a lot of fluid build up in my lung and needed frequent thoracentesis procedures. These help a lot, breathing is so much easier afterwards. How often does her oncologist check her blood and her tumor markers? If the markers do not go down from the Aromasin alone she probably needs to have a chemo drug added to her treatment. There are so many chemo drugs out there and some of them have very tolerable side effects.   Since August I'm on Abraxane ones a week and for the bones I get an Xgeva shot ones a month. So far so good, my tumor markers have gone down a lot, and I feel pretty good too.  Aromasin, which I took back in 2010, did not work for me. My cancer progressed. But that's how it goes once cancer becomes metastatic. Drugs work for a while, and then they stop working and the cancer progresses. So you have to move on to the next drug, and the next, and the next. Metastatic breast cancer is not curable. Your mom will have to be in some form of treatment for the rest of her life, which can be many years as you can see from the stories of so many here on this web site. Good luck to your mom. It's so wonderful that you are there for her during this tough time. Sending you both lots of warm (((Hugs))), Helmie    ",

As far as I know radiation treatment is used to shrink tumors and/or relieve bone pain. My lung mets caused me to have fluid build up in the lining of my lung. The more fluid build up - the more shortness of breath. I had to have several thoracentesis procedures done (which is the draining of the fluid). After each procedure my breathing improved immediately. do you know if your mom had a thoracentesis done? Zometa is for bone strengthening and Aromasin is an aromatase inhibitor which blocks estrogen. Since she is only on Aromasin for 4 days I doubt that it helped her breathing. I'm not on Zometa, I'm on ones a month shots of Xgeva, and yes, I have to stay on this drug for a very long time, maybe forever. It depends on the SEs, how severe they are, and how well your mom handles them, her medical oncologist might switch her from Zometa to Xgeva.  Hope this will help a little. Hugs and good luck to you and your mom, Helmie",

I had my right lung drained several times. The fluid always tested neg for mets. However I have cancer nodules inside the lining, where the fluid builds up, as well as all throughout my right lung. The tumors, or nodules in the lung are most likely the reason for the fluid build up. If it would be the drugs causing this build up, wouldn't we have fluid build up in both lungs? I don't know obviously, just thinking. ((Hugs)) Helmie",
