I think we can all empathize when it feels like one thing is piling on the next. That said, we have wonderful examples of how well everyone has done with chemo and radiation. It is not what you would choose, but it is going to get rid of any cancer cells that might have escaped your lymph nodes and you are going to be rid of this thing! I had a malignant melanoma last year that was staged as a IIB. That is the gray area between grim news and lifetime worry. I have to have the Pet Scans and the MRI's etc regularly related to that condition, so I understand how you feel about them sending you in to look for more problems. I have struggled with dealing with these appointments and it ruins two weeks of my life every time they come around, one week dreading the test and one week dreading the results. Since I received the breast cancer diagnosis in May I have worked really hard to view this whole cancer thing as an illness that can be managed just like diabetes or heart disease. I am now trying to look at the test as nothing more than an early warning just like my mammogram was so we can identify the problem and take care of it the best we can. Those tests are just tests. One more thing that you are going to do and get behind you. When the tests are done, you will no longer have to worry because you will know that you have beaten the cancer and you can enjoy the rest of your life. Shelley",

I feel so close to all of you and have laughed and cried with all of our worries and victories. I want to thank each and every one of you for sharing your experiences. I had a DMX without reconstruction on 06/16. You were the ones who gave me the courage to walk into that hospital and face this surgery that had me scared to death. I think because of the education and courage you all gave me, everything went very well and I have had an amazingly easy recovery. My pathology report was the best news possible. My cancer is gone and my lymph node was clear in my left breast. I had some \"pre-cancerous cells in my right breast, which confirmed my decision to have both breasts removed and be done with it. I chose to have a delayed reconstruction because I had a sense that my surgeon thought that was the best way. She mentioned the possibility of post-op radiation or infection as possible complications. The plastic surgeon I want to see is booked until September, so it will probably be October before I can have the TE process started. It is hard to be patient but I know I will get there. I meet with the oncologist tomorrow, but the BS doesn't think she will feel I need to have chemo or even Tamoxifen because I had the BMX. That brings me to the reason I am posting today. Joystars mentioned the breast form. I too received the horrible \"pillow\" form with my post-op camisole. I was not comfortable with that thing from the beginning. In reading other threads, I read a lot of posts on the reconstruction alternative site. The women there were talking about these wonderful \"beany boobies\". That sounded great to me. There are several sites that sell them. The least expensive ones are available at tlcdirect.org. This is a site affiliated with the American Cancer Society. The forms are $40 apiece, which is significantly less than other ones I found. I ordered a set the day before I went for surgery. The day I came home from the hospital they arrived like magic. These are sweet little forms that weigh absolutely nothing. They are soft and malleable. I am still pretty tender, but I have worn these out of the house for short periods of time tucked inside a camisole or a soft sports bra. I have found that I am less self-conscious \"going flat\" than I thought I would be, but these forms work very well in my regular bra for short periods of time. I had very large breasts, but I ordered a size smaller than the measurements indicated for me. At first I thought they were too small, but now that I am used to the big sisters being gone, I like the smaller size. For me these forms were a blessing and have made this process a little easier. I am sure insurance would pay for them, but since I will need them for such a short time I didn't want to deal with the process. Thank you all again for being there and for taking the time to share all of your ups and downs. It really did make a difference in my life. Shelley",

It is wonderful how we are faced with these hard terrible things but we all continue to find the good things and the humor in our situations. I have to say that my first cancer diagnosis was terrifying and overwhelming, but it somehow made my second BC diagnosis easier to deal with. One of the hardest things for me was getting an oncologist. I am 53 y/o, but I too consider myself to be young and active for my age. I can totally relate to how you felt in the Onc's office. I looked at all those people and I thought that this is somehow a mistake because this was not where I belonged. Everyone in my family lives to be healthy until they are in their 90's. I alway planned to follow the trend! When I met with the onc the second time, I couldn't stop crying. I am not one to cry in front of people and I was apologizing and explaining that I didn't know where this was coming from. She smiled kindly and said \"it is really hard to walk through a door that has cancer written on it.\" That hit me like a revelation. I did not understand that I was refusing to accept that this is a part of my life just like everything else that makes me, me. That is when I started working toward living in the present and letting the future take care of itself. I do not want to lose one good thing in my life because I am sad over the possibility that I may not live to be 80. One of my favorite things about myself is that I am a happy person who feels young and full of life. I am determined not to let either of these cancers take that away from me. There are times when I am overwhelmed and grieving because dealing with all of this is hard. Sometimes I give myself 15 minutes to wallow and feel sorry for myself and then I start trying to move toward the light. I have found that the normal activities in my life are what save me. There are times when I make myself do one thing, like make my bed, then I move on to another task and another task until I am feeling better. I do the same thing with my work. I make myself focus on the things unrelated to cancer and before I know it, I feel better. In regard to all of the tests with their icky preps and nervous wait time for results. It totally sucks. There is no way around it. But you have faced a cancer diagnosis and breast surgery and you have survived with your humor intact. You will survive chemo and radiation and all those tests and then they will be more notches on your belt. When this is all behind you, you may be 41, but you will still be very young and sexy with at least 40 years ahead of you. Those tests will be hard this year but next year they will be fewer and in a few years they will be a mild inconvenience just like your GYN check ups and mammograms have always been. I am not sure if or how the staging for breast cancer relates to staging for melanoma. I hope I did not worry you with what I said. Melanoma does not have any available treatment that will irradicate it, so I am always worried about it reappearing. Breast cancer is almost always cured now, even in advanced stages. When you are finished with the BC treatment IT will be finished and you will still be you.  Shelley",

My BS gave me the option of having a lumpectomy followed by radiation, but she was planning to take the front half of my breast and made it clear if she did not get clear margins we would be going back for a mastectomy. I had very large breasts (DDD) and she told me the PS would be unable to match my native side because I was so large. When we discussed the fact that I would need a reduction and lift of the native side, not to mention mammograms every six months with the accompanying worry, I opted to go ahead with a BMX to avoid the ongoing worry of reocccurance and possibly facing surgery again in the future. As it turned out, there were \"pre-cancerous\" cells found in my healthy breast biopsy, so I feel good about my decision. I have been told by every doctor and nurse since that time that they would do the same thing. Another factor in my decision was that I felt being unilateral would be more upsetting to me than having both breasts removed. This was a difficult decision but ultimately I think it was the best one for me.",
