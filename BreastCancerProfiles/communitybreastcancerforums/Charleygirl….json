Wish I would have found it a little sooner as my first round was quite excruciating due to the Neulasta. I just learned that the neulasta infusion is a one-size fits all! Which explains why i had so much difficulty and a friend who is larger than me had no issues. My Onc has now prescribed morphine for bone pain (I'm allergic to Tylenol and the Tramadol he first prescribed gave me headaches) and Ativan for sleep. This is day 4 after my second treatment and I woke up feeling surprisingly well! I'm planning to bundle up and get out (I'm in Michigan), and if it comes time where I need to take it easy, I'm allowing myself that freedom. I had a friend say that this is a club you never wanted to be part of, but I appreciate so much all the encouragement and truth that these support groups offer. Hope you all can take some deep breaths of fresh (maybe freezing fresh?) air today.",
