Do not despair but trust in God. The line \"Surely it is God who saves me. I will trust in Him and not be afraid.\" is from the refrain of The First Song of Isiah, Canticle 9. We sing the whole song in church most Sundays of the year. I find the four lines of the refrain give me great comfort in times of trouble. I frequently use the whole refrain for meditation as well. Here is the entire refrain: \"Surely it is God who saves me. I will trust in Him and not be afraid. He is my stronghold and my sure defense, and He will be my savior.\"",

      "Content": "Oct 10, 2018 04:13PM - edited Oct 10, 2018 04:14PM by SmallTownGal One of the things that's helping me right now is to remind myself that I am in control. The doctors can provide me with tests results, diagnosis, treatment options, and expected outcomes. BUT, in the end, I am the one who will decide what treatments I receive, what tests and procedures I consent to, and where I get my medical care. For example, it may be that my doctors eventually advise me to have chemotherapy. In that case, I most probably would decide to have the chemo. But, it would be my choice to do that--after all, no one is going to physically force me into an oncology center for chemo! Also, a friend of mine who is a breast cancer survivor decided to travel to another state for her treatment. She felt the cancer center there was one of the best in the world, so getting treatment there gave her extra confidence. Choosing where she got her care made her feel more in control and I think that helps a lot when you're facing such a scary disease. ",

It says benign recommend 1 year screening mammography. Yay!! I am living proof that good results do happen. One thing that helped me was to calculate my risk of having advanced cancer, because early stage disease is so very curable. According to the website, Moose & Doc Breast Cancer, there was a 17% risk of my ultrasound being cancer. Even if I had fallen into that 17% with cancer, there was a 65% chance it would be at stage 0 or 1, which have a survival rate close to 100%. So, after a little math, I figured there was a 94% chance I either had no cancer or a very early stage cancer. That reassuring stat reminded me that catching it early is why we go through the annual mammograms and the dreaded call-backs and ultrasounds, etc. It really is worth the anxiety if we can catch cancer while it is almost 100% curable.",
