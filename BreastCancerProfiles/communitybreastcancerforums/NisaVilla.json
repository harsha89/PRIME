I don't see a profile under your comment and I am always jealous of people who don't care for further testing.

I was initially thinking about bringing my older teens to my first treatment but maybe I will save that for the last treatment, not the first. You make a point about not knowing how I will react to the first infusion. I first thought if they could see the place, maybe they wil be less scared, but now Im thinking that it could upset other patients and themselves. The feedback here is immensely helpful - thanks all for great advice! Nisa",
