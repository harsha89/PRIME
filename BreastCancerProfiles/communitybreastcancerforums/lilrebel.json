The nurse said that my doctor wanted me to go their, but if I still want to see him on Monday I still could. I choose to go to straight to the Breast Surgeon, apparently the radiologist was a moron, I am looking at surgery somehow, it might not be breast cancer yet, but it also could be the beginning stages as well. I am nervous, can anyone give me some information before I go to my appointment next week, like questions to ask, terminology I should know. I just want to be aware of the options I might be given, I have several cysts, several small and medium lumps, my breasts are so dense they cannot get a clear picture but some of the area look worrisome.  Help, advise, experiences needed! Please dont just read and ignore, I am scared, the only people I have to talk to right now is my husband and one friend.",

Summing up about 7-8 sentences and this is what the radiologist wrote in his report. My Primary Care Doctor was a Radiologist  before he went into family medicine about 20 years ago, his clinic is apart of the Wise County Hospital System here in Decatur, TX. His office is attached to one of the Wise County Regional Imaging centers. So that is what makes me nervous, even if he is rusty at reading my results. He wanted to see me after the mammogram, and now he wants me to go straight the the Breast Surgeon. Just worried...thats all...",

I'm afraid that I will get tested, get negative results, but really be positive. I have several areas of interest, does that mean they will biopsy all of the areas? There are about 3 on my right, and at least 2 on my left (the left side ones are new, I just found those this weekend). All of these areas are shaped irregularly, are hard, and don't move. I sooooooo afraid of getting a false negative. I will just have to wait and see, and waiting is the longest part right now!!! Thank you everyone for your support through this, I need people who have been through it to talk to right now. If I talk to someone who has never gone through this they just give me the pitiful eyes and try to clam me down like you do a little kid who's fish just died.",

My husband took me on a 20 mile trail ride with our two gelding horses. He got a babysitter for the kids, we were gone from 1230 to 7pm. It was so nice and helped me to forget for the first time since I discovered the lumps. SarahJane7374 the weather is nice this weekend, but the past week has been icy, muddy, and cold. It is supposed to be that way this coming week as well. I'm wishing for nice weather to be consistent so I can ride our horses more.  I am ready to just know, treatment or no reason for treatment.  If I know then I can stop wondering and move on. ",

They say multiple concerning spots on the mammogram, the ultrasound found some cysts and a lump. The problem was that the technician was finding several areas of interest. When the radiologist came in to do further looking via ultrasound, he only looked at 3 areas, 2 were the cysts the technician found, and the 3rd area he couldn't find anything. The part that confuses me is that he felt lumps in certain areas, including toward my armpit, however he did a quick sweep of the area and said \"I see nothing\". Then he addressed the lump, which is not a cyst, it is 2cm at its widest point. He said he labeled me at a level 3 (something about a scale of 1-5, 1 means its nothing, 5 means its cancer). He told me he thinks I need to have a mammogram and ultrasound every 6 months for the next 2 years to see if it changes. I told him that that lump wasnt there 6 months ago, I believe it will grow bigger, all he said was \"women don't always feel the lumps, it could have been there for years and just now reached a size you can feel\". If it is nothing why would he want to monitor it every 6 months for the next 2 years????? I want a second opinion but I am afraid my insurance wont cover it. I was also labeled as having dense breasts, which the ultrasound tech said was making it difficult to get a clear picture of the areas. I need help decoding this whole thing, what is a level 3, why does he say its nothing but want to monitor it every 6 months for the next 2 years? So confused....help!!!!! Log in to post a reply",

I am really freaking out, I have unidentified lump and bumps, skin changes on my right breast, and now discharge!! I have only ever had discharge when I was breastfeeding, that was 5 1/2 years ago.

I am getting a copy of my radiology report and all of my mammogram and ultrasound images today.  The problem is I have multiple spots I am concerned about, and the radiologist said those lumps where palpable but he couldn't find them in the ultrasound. What does that mean? I have heard that if they do a biopsy of one area it could come back B9, while another area is malignant.  Should I ask for a biopsy as well as a 6 month follow up mammogram and ultrasound? Can I do that? Thank you all for your help during this time, I just don't want to miss anything, i am super scared. I cry when no one is around when I just barely think about it, when I get a pain that feels like milk is letting down but there is nothing there. I am not pregnant, I just took a pregnancy test 2 weeks ago, I have had my tubes tide, and my husband had his cut too.  My nipples are cracked, and have a yellowish tint to them, and my lymph nodes surrounding my left breast are getting bigger and harder slowly. I am so tired at work, and at home, I just want to sleep all day. I am on anti depressants and anxiety medicine because of the trauma I experienced with serving 6 years in the military. I was doing better then started to crash, then started getting shooting pains in my breast, then in my armpit area, then my lymph nodes started to swell slightly and I thought nothing of it. Then I started to feel a lump which was never there before....am I going crazy here....I just want to curl up in bed and read books to take my mind off of everything...",

I agree about the animals, I live in Texas with my 6 dogs (1 is pregnant), 5 horses (1 is pregnant), 4 chickens and a barn cat...my last birthday present was the 6th dog, he is a great prynesees (which is only 7 months old and HUGE compared to my bird dogs).  I am praying for B9, but now I have to find out.
