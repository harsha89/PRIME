First diagnosed Sept 2005, had chemo, right side mastectomy followed by radiation and a year of herceptin. All went along very well until Feb 2010, back in lymph node below collarbone, again another six months of chemotherapy and believe it or not they gave me radiation yet again this time twice a day with it being delivered at a minimum of six hours apart. They were very careful not to overlap the fields. This was followed by being put on herceptin again. Fast forward to 2012 again another lymph node in the same area, again chemo and this time told herceptin would be forever. Had to go off herceptin for six months as heart function was beginning to drastically decline. Feb 2014 yet again back in a couple of lymph node and yet again chemo with herceptin, continued chemo until sept and was cut off herceptin in November again due to heart function. After my second round of chemo I developed lymphedema and have continued with the pain and discomfort of it, having to wear a sling is horrible that on top of the fact that my shoulder is dislocate and nobody will fix it as the muscles will not hold it due to the weight of the arm. Also I have brachial plexopathy from radiation. Now shortly before Christmas I thought I had pulled something in my leg in the groin area, it got worse and worse to the point that i could not walk, so my husband called the ambulance and off I went to the hospital at which point I found out that I needed a new hip as well as a new pelvis had to be made from mesh and cement as the cancer had now taken over in these areas. I spent over two weeks in the hospital awaiting a surgery slot. Surgery went well, the recovery has been slow as I have lost a lot of weight and am weak. Last week I started having a lot of pain in my groin, bum cheek and it hurt horribly every time I sat down, felt like I was sitting on a knife. Every time I wiped after urinating something felt wrong. Turns out one of the rods used in the pelvic reconstruction had come loose and migrated away from the location it should have been in. I had to have it removed, it was pokin out below my skin half was between the anus opening. And the vagina. Now tomorrow I am going to see my oncologist and have no idea what she will want to do to me this time, I feel like I have fought so long and now that it has spread into the bones is not good. What do they usually give you for the mets in the bones. Sorry this is so long but I am very very upset and would just like to hear from others. Thanks for any ideas and your help.

Back on fentanyl 100's with hydromorphone 4's every hour for breakthrough pain. So far the pain has not changed, how long do I give it to work before I call them? Both dr's could not believe that a rod came loose from my hip surgery and worked its way out of my body, I am still pretty sore from that experience I feel like I am bruised badly in that area and it is making walking harder. I was doing so good coming back from the hip replacement surgery until this happened now I feel like I am starting at the beginning again. Dr. Explained no more herceptin or chemo for me as they both can have implications on heart function and I have had that problem a few times before. It is now just a waiting game and a matter of pain control. I really am having a hard time wrapping my head around everything, can't seem to accept it yet, how do you do that? I was looking forward to my sons wedding in Sept., now I won't be there and it devastates me. My husband is a basket case but trying to be so strong for me, he believes he can keep me at home and take care of me, now this is a precious thought but unrealistic, I need to fine someplace to go when I get too bad. I am totally overwhelmed by thoughts and feelings both mentally and physically. My oncologist was a little emotional, when I was leaving her office she gave me a big hug and reminded me that they are all there for me and I hugged her back and thanked her for giving me the ten extra years I got since diagnosis. I have said it before and I am sure I will say it again, I am scared and terrified.  Betsy",
