I'm a ball of nerves as I've never heard of a Partial Goldilocks Mastectomy until a couple of days ago. I was first told I was a candidate for either Lumpectomy or Mastectomy (I personally was leaning towards Bi-lateral to rid the problem area once and for all); however, now BS has informed me the PS has reccomended Partial Goldilocks Mastectomy. As you probably have figured by now, I'm feeling incredibly confused and uncertain of the decision which was supposed to be made like yesterday. Any extra detail would help me, and hopefully many others, immensely. Thank you",

This is the reccomended surgery for me and I'm wondering how it compares to a lumpectomy. I have already reached out to my doctore in hopes to get further clarification but the waiting causing anxiety to the max! If not Treesamia, can anyone else give me the real, stone-cold, hard facts on this procedure and recovery experience?? Purdy pleasssse",
