Other than that I can make it through the day. Each person is different and you have to figure out what works for you. Don't be afraid to make your Onc change your treatments days if they aren't working out for you. I changed my days from Wed to Thursday. They assured me I'd be able to work on Thursdays. Not a chance. Then I would drag myself to work on Fridays. That was just stupid as far as I was concerned. Now I go for treatment on Thursdays and don't have to go to work until the following Monday. Works much better for me.",
