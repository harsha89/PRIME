I just wondered whether anyone had any advice and their opinions on whether it should be something to worry about? I'm not sure i can just demand a biopsy. I live in South Wales in UK and they usually won't refer you unless good reason and I'm only 25 so i guess that's another factor",

I did up until my son was a year old but this has only recently developed in the last couple of months. That's why i can't understand why the doctor would say it's a breast infection and breast infections are mainly mastitus right? I am 10 weeks pregnant also but i feel it wouldn't be related to that as this started before i was pregnant too. I would highly doubt it is an allergic reaction to anything as it is only this breast i have this on and i haven't used any new things i haven't used before. Very worried though and hard to concentrate on anything else when your breast is distracting you so much. I put the pic up to give everyone who gives advice a clearer picture of what was going on with me, sometimes it's hard to explain and word things properly via text. xxx",
