I am so happy. I am now waiting on the oncotyping and BRAC gene tests to come back. On Tuesday when i went back to the surgeon who said he didn't get clear margins, and I will need another surgery, and that after this surgery I will need reconstruction. We can't do this now they want to wait for the other test results and let me heal before we do another surgery. I am a little overwhelmed! ",
