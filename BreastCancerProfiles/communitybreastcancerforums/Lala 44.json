All of which first off can't even see any redness or anything on my nipple, completely disregard the itch and tingling. They said it's definately 100% not pagets and not to worry. I had ultrasounds done etc with obviously nothing detected. Now because I went back yesterday freaking out, they will do an MRI but completely refuse to do a biopsy as they said there is nothing to even biopsy. When I mention that pagets can only be detected with a biopsy and that many have been missed otherwise the Surgeons tell me to stop googling!!!! My nipple look so pretty normal, no bleeding, no scaling, no scabs nothing except a tad red. I don't know what to do. : Log in to post a reply",

I went back to breast surgeon and he doesn\u2019t seem concerned and won\u2019t biopsy. The Dermo said it looks more like exzema of the nipple since I have eczema in other areas on my chest. The nipple is still itchy at times, it also flakes as if it seems dry. The flaking is super minimal and only in one spot. The breast surgeon also took samples of the breast discharge that I have from both breasts. It looks like milk that never dried up from when I had a baby 17 months ago, only happens when expressed.So that was put on a slide and sent to patholog to check for abnormal cells. Again , no one will biopsy the nipple ... the skin flaking is new so I\u2019ll see how this plays out and if it continues then I\u2019ll demand a biopsy.",

My fear is that's it's in a supe early stage hence the lack of ulcers. I can't explain the nipple itch that is driving me batshit :",

Once it starts it becomes progressively worse and worse.
