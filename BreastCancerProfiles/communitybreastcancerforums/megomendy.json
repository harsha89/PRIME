I also opted for 12 weeks, as the side effects are said to be more manageable.  Just noticed as I read your post that we are both triple negative, stage IIa.",

And once it actually happened, I was reluctant to do the mastectomy. Saying a prayer it doesnt come back. Even though I am triple negative, which is an aggressive cancer, lumpectomy is still an option.",

Last month, my younger sister (age 46) was also diagnosed with TN and also tested positive for BARD1. I saw a genetic counselor last week. I had the blood test and am waiting for results. The genetic counselor is at CINJ, which is a NCI affiliated cancer center and is not recommending that I have a PM or have my ovaries out. She said there is so much they dont know about it. My mother also had BC 32 years ago and did well. My sister will probably have a bilateral as she is having chemo now, she's young and her kids are young. I am meeting with my MO next week who is at MSK so I am curious about her take on all this. Will update when I know more.",
