I don't feel that the lump grew back in the space of hours, I think like you they found a cyst and aspirated it leaving the original lump in position!  I will phone today x Best of luck with your results, can you let me know please ",

I saw some fluid come out but he didn't seem to go over the breast with the ultrasound after he aspirated the cyst so it could still be there?  Pity the breast specialist didn't check my breast after the aspiration too! ",
