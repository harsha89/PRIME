For me, time has helped me realize that carrying bitterness around about what should have been will not help me to heal.  When your mortality is dangled precariously over a cliff,  like it has been for all of us, it's just a waste of precious time to consume your thoughts with anything but the journey forward.  My hope for you is that as space between diagnosis and recovery grows, you'll make peace with the fact that you can't change the past but you sure as hell can take control of your future.  Take good care of you!",

Thank you!  I started April 1st with Taxol for 12 weeks, then FEC for 4 treatments after that. Doesn't seem like that's a typical regimen, but I appear to have a more advanced stage than most of you.  Lost my hair by week 5. My head isn't as nicely shaped as yours Jaimieh, so wigs and scarfs are my only option.  Plus, my kids giggle too much when they see me bald\u20265 year olds do that!  Best to you all and thanks for all the good pointers.",
