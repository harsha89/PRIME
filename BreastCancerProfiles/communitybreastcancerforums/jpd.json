I just had my three month checkup yesterday and all the blood work was good. My onc uses markers to help monitor everything and doesn't really believe in scans unless something appears to be out of wack. I had a MRI a few months ago on my remaining breast and everything looked good. I wonder, however, how they can really check the chest wall where I had my mastectomy...I would think a chance for a reoccur would be greater there. Oh, well. I will have another bone density test in December, since I'm on Femara and will also have more blood work. Sleep is also and issue with me...but only because I have a year old dog who thinks it's breakfast time between 4:30 and 5 a.m.!!! lol!! Silly dog! Well, I need to grab a bite to eat and get back to work. I do feel a sense that I need to be doing more to help myself...diet and exercise wise...but it's hard! Talk soon. Janet",

This is really strange!  I'll have to show this to my son, who is my computer expert.   Well, I'm doing well.  A new semester started up at college, and I have a full load, plus taking care of my farm. I'm sad to say that I haven't been able to get as much work done as I would have liked over the past summer.  For one thing the heat has been unbearable...and we're in a terrible drought.  I so hope it rains soon.  On top of that my soon-to-be-ex is being a jerk about our settlement.  I've settled for a lot less than my 'half', just to get it over and done with.  I guess if it doesn't happen soon, we'll go to court.  I can't believe I stayed married to him for so long.  I had my two year checkup...and NED! Yeh!  However, it doesn't mean I don't worry.  It is always in the back of my mind.  Plus, my hot flashes have been worse...probably a combination of the heat and the stress.  I am, however, working very hard to get back down to a good weight for myself.  8 pounds lost, 22 more to go!!!  I hope you are all well and I think of you often.   Here's hoping we all can celebrate our third anniversay next year, NED!!!  Janet",

Liezel, glad your son is adjusting.  My daughter is much, much older...20...but this past summer she actually opened up to me.  During my treatment she didn't treat me that well, and it was her first year away from college.  I guess she had difficulty as the spotlight was no longer on her.  Well we had quite the heart to heart and a lot of tears and pretty much cleared the air.  Growing up is so hard, especially when someone you count on and hold dear has their life in limbo. Well, I can't stay but a few minutes and I need to post a question on the lymphedema thread.  Seems I've discovered that my swelling (and pain) flared up when I quit taking antihistamines.  Hmm...wonder if there is a correlation.  Take care everyone!  Think about you, pray for you all!  Janet",
