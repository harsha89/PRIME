She also said my history and BRCa are \"my crystal ball\" . I appreciate her frankness! Who has had a profalactic mastectomy? What type if recovert have you had? Any issues with insurance? If all my tests are ok I am really leaning towards this procedure for piece of mind. Log in to post a reply",

I think my boobs know what is going to happen (they actually hurt now!). Of course that makes me afraid they will find something when they perform the mastectomy. I'm letting sweet Ativan deal with that thought tonight. My mom is actually thrilled about the mastectomy; I know she has been petrified for years at my prospects. My mom & grandmother were both diagnosed before age 45 and I am 48; I think I can actually hear \"tick, tock, tick, tock\" while I wait for this cancer to make an appearance. Hopefully I am vigilant enough that it won't rear its ugly head. Question: Did any of you have a mastectomy without cancer....but then cancer was found when they did the surgery? Being very dense I have always feared they could not see everything and now when they open me up they will, hopefully, see everything. I'm not scared of the surgery (been through too many surgeries to count) I'm scared of what they may find. Again, thank you all for your kind words and great stories....!!!",

Update: had my cyst aspiration on Friday & they found something hard so they did a biopsy. I also met with my mothers oncologist last week who is not \"pushing\" me into PBMX but she referred me to a great surgeon, at least reputation wise she is great. \"We\" always want to know if we are going to get cancer and I asked the doctor about my test results (pre biopsy) and said I know you don't have a crystal ball but..........she said my BRCA & family history are my crystal ball. I just love her honesty! Part of me says geez I hope it is cancer as that would help me with decision (ok I know that is silly, but I think you all know what I mean). Hoping to have the results Tuesday or Wednesday; I am thinking Friday as Monday is a holiday (should never have these types of tests on a Friday!). Dawn PS: Do any of you picture BMX bicycles when you type PBMX just tring to lighting my mood a little.",

What you are going through with reconstruction is my fear....pain & discomfort. I'm prepared for the mastecomy pain but still squimish about the reconstruction.....just not convinced yet it is worth it. I wonder if grieving the loss of a breast(s) is common (I work in hospice so I of course think of grief). Anyway, thank you again for the link to your blog...I'll keep an eye on it. Dawn",

I too spend time figuring out how to manage any treatment I may need and nesting in my home & personal life should my life become a wirlwind! I think women by nature are worriers & trying to keep busy & not think of the cloud over our heads is near impossible. So I decided to embrace this cloud, get out my umbrella & slicker & spash around in the puddles. Clickchic, I guess what I am really saying is that everyone does things a little different & \"you\" have to do what makes you feel the least worried & distracted. Do what makes you sleep at night. Don't ever read anything into the faces of those providing tests, they may have eaten a bad burrito & that face they are making is gas pains!! Good Luck & hope all goes well.",

My mom had breast cancer with re-occurance and colon cancer (she passed away 4 years ago after fighting for years and taking chemo forever), my maternal grandmother had breast cancer and my paternal grandfather. I had double mastectomy with expanders and exchange 5 years ago. My right breast would not heal, sutures kept popping open. After many office procedures had the implant removed. Fast forward to July last year and I have surgery to get the implant in my right breast. Everything is good and it feels great! Then 2 months ago I get MRSA in my left breast, emergency surgery to remove left breast. Ugh! The last month or so I have noticed a dimple by my nipple that wasn't there before; and have had on & off pain. Nothing earth shattering just enough to catch your attention. Then Thursday my breast feels like it is on fire. When I get home it really looks swollen. Today it is not swollen. Anyone ever had this happen? The swelling worries me even though it went away.

My mom's oncologist (Dr. Mendonca) is with I think Desert Oncology (merged with Ironwood or visa versa). I faxed her my mammogram, CT & U/S records today and asked if she could make a suggestion if I needed something more specialized or was I over reacting. I had never met her so I wasn't sure if my request was out of line (but my Mom LOVES her!!!). She told her assistant to schedule me for an appointment.......my guess is out of courtesy:)....at least that's what I am going with! I am anxious for my Tuesday appointment with the surgeon; not sure if he will do the procedure right there or if I will have to schedule but the wait is agony! I can't image what everyone who is waiting for a real diagnosis goes through! I hI don't think it helps that I work for a hospice (have for about 20 years) and have seen it all. I have also been crazed with \"nesting\" just in case it becomes a wirlwind. Anyway, thank you again for the info and I wish you felt more confident about your team.
