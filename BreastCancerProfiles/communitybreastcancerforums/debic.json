So thinking this isn't bad I made an appointment for the following month.  They called the next day after biopsy said all was okay to have another mamo in 6 months an hour later they called back to say sorry we made a mistake you have breast cnacer --have a nice day!! I too felt like I was left to find my own way.  My suggestion to you is see more then one doctor.  You will know when you have found the right surgeon. You need t feel comfortable with the surgeon and be able to ask as many questions as you want.  Write them down so you remember to ask them all.  If you can take someone with you as a second set of ears.  The same goes with the oncologist. I saw two then both suggested the same treatment but I went with the one I felt more comfortable with because this is a long journey and you need someone who will be with you all the way.  The best of luck to you remember you can do this.

The dr in his office I saw I was not happy with.  I saw Dr. Nancy Taft, she was wonderful. It has been a year and a half and i still see her every three months.  You will know when you find the right dr. You should see more then one surgeon. I have a friend who works and MD Anderson and she also is a breast cancer patient there.  She loves the hospital and if you don't live close they do have a place for you and your family to stay during treatment.  Good Luck I finished my last treatment May 6th and welcomed my first grandchild into the world on May 9th----Life does go on.

He will be a year this month.  You are at the point you will be lossing your hair.  My hair is back looking better then before chemo, it is thicker I did not get the  curls alot of ladies did. It started growing when I was on Taxol. End of April through September was the wig time then just really short first cut in December. Your  group on this thread will get you though so much. Just remember  ask for meds if you don't feel well, ask for help if you are tired, take care of yourself. I wish you all the best. Debi",

The worse part was seeing the smoke come up when she catheterized the veins.  I asked her am I on fire?  I drove myself home and went on a 5 day cruise the next day.  I have to tell you the feeling a freedom with it out is wonderful.

Right before I was dx my daughter had a miscarriage at three months.  We asked why then I found out I had BC. I would have been in the middle of chemo when she had my first grandbaby. I will be done herceptin the first of May 08 , we just found out she will be having a baby the second week of May 08!! God has his own timing. In all my ways I acknowledge Him andHe directs my path.

LuAnn those little babies are so cute!!  I had my last herceptin May 7th and became a grandmother for the first time on May 9th.  I too plan to be around to watch my little grandson grow up.  Enjoy every moment they grow up so fast!! Joanie is Xeloda a pill? 4.5 years that is wonderful thank you for letting me know. Barb You sound like you are going strong that is great.  Maybe now that they know my friend has bone mets she will get the treatment she needs and feel better.  She has been having pain and problems for a year they kept telling her it was from rads.
