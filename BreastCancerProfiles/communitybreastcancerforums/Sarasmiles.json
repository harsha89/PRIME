      "Content": "Sarasmiles wrote: Hi again, The biopsy is over. I am thankful for that. But now I have a rather large lump about the size of a golf ball at the site with surrounding redness that is as large as a cookie. Of course it's 4 am and everything is closed except the ER and and I work in 3 hours. I think the lump is a hematoma ( which I've had before as a kid) although I can't remember if I should apply ice or heat? The redness though? Anyone else ever experience that? Any tips I can use until I can call the after care number this afternoon? Thanks in advance...

Took Tylenol and wore a bra continuously for days afterward. That also helped a lot. Maybe that would help ease the pain a little.  Yeah for benign results!!!! So happy for you!!!!!",

( I am) I looked that up and sure enough it looks exactly like a latex allergy rash. I told them I was allergic from the get go. So excited they listened. I'll take an antihistamine and try not to touch it. The hematoma should resolve on it's own. And for all this? I'm going shopping after work. I've had it! Retail therapy required. ",

I am almost laughing now because this is the good breast! The nurse is supposed to call. No results yet. My luck? I'm allergic to titanium and my body hates the little marker.... I had a dream that my body pushed it back out with a note that said no thank you. Now that is crazy!! ",
