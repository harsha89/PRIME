My hair grew back in curly and looked great for more than a year. Past tense. It stopped growing in curly & started looking thin. I could see pink scalp more & more. So I thought I should cut it. Now all the curl is gone & the hair at the front of my hair is OBVIOUSLY thin, thin, THIN. I tried searching this topic but most of the posts have to do with fallout during chemo or during hormone therapy. This is different; it's fallout more than a year after chemo. I take Biotin. The back of my head is OK. I have soft fair facial hair, but have no underarm hair, almost no leg hair, reasonable eyebrows & lashes. Has anyone else had their hair thin badly when their chemo curls stopped? Has anyone had their hair start falling again long after stopping all cancer treatment? Has anyone seen a dermatologist? Or \u2026suggestions? Thanks, Hap",

      "Content": "Aug 23, 2012 01:22PM - edited Aug 23, 2012 01:23PM by hap_k I am currently debating to reconstruct or not. I enjoyed your article! It's a conversation that needs more fresh air! But no one wants to know. The women who aren't diagnosed are scared of the topic. Most of the wormen who are diagnosed are subtly (or not so subtly) pushed toward reconstruction. It's a industry! Part of me feels like I would be turning down an opportunity if I don't chose reconstruction. Another part of me feels like I would be avoiding some horrible con job (you should reconstruct!) that is being that is being foisted on women. The truth is probably in the middle somewhere. My question: How much is getting an implant really like getting a prosthetic limb?  Breasts are part of us, so is an arm. I can live without breasts easier than I can live without an arm, but people do live quite well without both. However, if science is offering us a choice, shouldn't we take it? I just keep going in circles. Hap ",

Crescent5, Apparently our local BC guru is not the easiest guy to get along with. I could probably cope with that, but I have heard enough bad stories mixed with the good stories, that I think I will try him if I run out of other options. I am so glad you found a good local team. We did for my husband's Prostate Cancer, and we were very lucky! Great surgeon with great personality. I just hope I'm as lucky. Hap",

I am going to the Providence Cancer Center in Portland--2 hours away. Have an appoint Monday with the Co-Director of their Breast Center. I feel better about that than seeing someone locally--smallish town-- for all the reasons discussed. ",

There is no cancer center where I live, so I was thinking about going to the nearest large city to a regional cancer center for surgery (if my biopsy turns out as they think it will tomorrow). My friend thought that was a great idea to go to a good cancer center, but also pointed out that if I need radiation, I would have to be available for every week day for 6 weeks.  (That's a lot of commuting; she lives within 10 miles of her cancer center.) So while this question is not as important as many those being asked on here, nor as urgent, if anyone has any thoughts or experiences they wish to share, I would be grateful. It seems to me that there must be a lot of people who have to travel to get a good cancer care team. Is it worth the hassle?  Thanks a lot, Hap  Dx 8/6/2012, IDC, 1cm, Stage I, Grade 3, 0/4 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Surgery 8/31/2012 Lymph node removal: Right; Mastectomy: Right; Prophylactic mastectomy: Left; Prophylactic ovary removal; Reconstruction (left): Tissue expander placement; Reconstruction (right): Tissue expander placement Log in to post a reply",
