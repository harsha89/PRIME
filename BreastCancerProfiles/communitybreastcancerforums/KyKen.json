Now it's the size of a dime and my lymp node under arm pit same side is so sore I can't hardly put my deodorant on. And there is some tenderness under this Brest with small feeling lumps/bumps when I try to check myself. I do not want to go back to my pc dr since he blew me off so fast and just don't know what to do next? A surgeon or ??? Just don't know.Also my pc dr did do blood work that day and my Red blood cells were high what would cause that any ideals? Log in to post a reply",
