      "Content": "NewToCancer wrote: I've tried looking up the term sub centimeter with no success. Does it mean a mass smaller than one centimeter? They want me to return for supplemental images of the right breast and possible ultrasound. As soon as I hit the Save I realized that if I split into two words, I would get an answer. It is a mass smaller than one centimeter. Here I go again. It has been ten years since I had cancer in my left breast. The breasts were both reduced and I did radiation. I know things have changed in the last ten years, but if this is cancer, which I suspect, I still don't want the chemo. When I was in ten years ago, they did see a very small mass or whatever you want to call it in the right breast, but it was too small to mark or find. This may be the same one. For some reason I am not as upset as last time. Maybe because I know what to expect and I went through it once and plan on doing it again. Or maybe it is because I am 75 years old, kids are grown and on their own. This website helped me soooooo much through the first time. I am not telling my kids about it this time. I moved to Nashville, TN where my daughter is now living with the grandchildren. So it will be a new hospital and a new doctor in a location of which I am not familiar. I will think of it as an adventure. GDN Dx 8/11/2008, IDC, <1cm, Stage I, Grade 2, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
