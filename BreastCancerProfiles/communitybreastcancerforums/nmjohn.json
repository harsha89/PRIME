The only thing I have noticed is restless sleep.  I doze off regularly, but it's fitful - the only way I can describe it.  Last night I had sort of creepy crawly feelings in my legs.  I got up and moved around a bit and that seemed to help.  I've never had that before, so I'm just assuming it's related to the chemo.  So, all in all, things have been relatively uneventful.   I keep waiting for the ball to drop and I'm sure it will, but for now I'll thankfully take this. I'm wishing for minimal s/e's for all of us.  Sending prayers and good thoughts to each of you.",

I'm just so floored by all of this.  After 14 years, I really thought it was all behind me.  And the idea of chemo again - damn, it just sucks.  Like I have to tell all of you that, right?  So, enough complaining.  I got through it last time and I'll do it again.  I'm glad to have found this resource.  I hope we can help each other get through these next months (and well beyond!).   Thanks for being here.

Rock - thanks for the encouraging words.  My docs have mentioned BRCA testing after the chemo is over.  There is no family history, I'm the 1st, so I'm still on the fence about it . . . something I'll deal with later, I guess. Crafty - I'm so glad to see someone from the area (sorry for the circumstances).  I am at Gray, although going to the Avon office today due to scheduling issues.  I'm planning to head to Htfd for tx 2, 3 & 4.  You are approx 1 week ahead of me for everything - tx's and fills.  I have my 1st fill next week.  And, you won't believe this, a long anticipated, dear friend's wedding at the end of June!  Looking forward to sharing and supporting each other through all this. Well, must get ready to go - 1st tx this morning - wish me luck!  I'll be back over the weekend.  Thanks everyone and best wishes for a pleasant weekend. Nancy",

Kristy - this is my first cbc since 1st tx last Friday and nuelasta shot on Monday.  I'll ask how long it takes for the shot to kick in. Wishing everyone a peaceful and enjoyable long weekend. . . happy summer '08.  I'm planning to sleep for the 1st 3 days of it!  Kick s/e butt, Ladies!",

When my oldest son, now 23 and living in Chicago, was 16 and going through a particularly rebellious period, he came home one day with his hair cut in a large and very pointy mohawk.  I absolutely hated it.  I tried not to make a big deal about it but, of course, couldn't help but comment occasionally.  Those comments, I'm sure, made him more determined to keep it.  It wasn't bad when he wore it down, but most times he'd put gelatin - yes, the stuff you cook with - in it and it would harden into rocklike spikes that stood 7 or 8 inches high. Now, I'm a pretty liberal person and always liked my kids expressing their individuality, but this  was horrendous.  I took many deep breaths and chanted my maternal mantra often, \"This too shall pass\".  I have 2 boys 20 months apart, so I did a lot of chanting through their teenage years!  Then one day (after a year with this do), as unexpectedly as the mohawk appeared, it was gone.  \"It was a pain in the butt\", he said very casually.  I looked to the sky and whispered \"thank you, thank you, thank you\".  Kevin and I have since laughed together about that \"phase\". Back to this morning . . . I started buzzing the sides (you see where I'm going w/this?).  As I progressed I thought - wouldn't it be a hoot if  . . .  so I did, I gave myself a mohawk.  Not only did I cut a hawk, I took pictures.  Not only did I take pictures, I emailed a couple to Kev.  The email read, \"Either you'll find this hysterical or I will have, once again, scarred you for life.  Love, Mom\".  I'll let you know when I hear back from him.  My mohawk is now gone, along w/the rest of my hair, so it's done.  I tried on my wig - its fine I guess.  I keep reminding myself that this is temporary.  We all have to remember that. I'm back to my mantra - This too shall pass, just like the hawk. Wishing you a peaceful and s/e free weekend.",

Linda - What an amazing accomplishment.  Running 7 minute miles is something to be proud of under normal circumstances - while undergoing chemo treatments, just amazing.  I was a regular runner until about 3 years ago when my achilles popped.  It eventually healed, but I'm still very wary of running, plus I'm just way old!  I always ran the Hartford and NYC Race for the Cure and my best time was around 26 min.  You'd obviously leave me in the dust!  I don't think anyone can dispute that exercise, in whatever form is comfortable, is a huge benefit through this process.  You should be very proud of yourself . . .keep up the good work! Roxi - The woman in the chair next to me, also her 1st tx , told  the onc nurse she had a very important and pressing question.  She asked when she could have a glass of wine again.  Donna (the nurse) laughed and said she could have some wine the following day.  I always loved a glass of wine w/dinner.  I was at a friend's the other night, had a couple of sips and I agree w/you, it doesn't taste nearly as good as it used to.   I haven't had a real hankering for it anyway.  That first really great tasting sip, when it happens again, will be a nice surprise.  And if it helps you sleep, all the better. I'm venturing out of the house today - I stayed in all day yesterday which is very unusual.  After the buzz cut I didn't feel like facing anyone or anything.  I'm in a better frame of mind today.  My son, Sean, is on his way over.  We're headed to the nursery and he's giving me a hand w/some yard work - should be a fun afternoon.  He's a big help and always manages to make me laugh.    Tomorrow will be interesting, the 1st day at work w/the wig.",
