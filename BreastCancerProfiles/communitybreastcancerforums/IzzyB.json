I just got my last fill in my TE and final post-surgical follow up with the BS so no more appointments until Sept for my reconstruction and 6mth follow up with the BS. I've spent so much time the past 6mths researching every aspect of my care and now there's not much left to do. My husband told me to get a new hobby - LOL. So I think I will just turn my attention to enjoying the summer while the boys are home from school - and torture them with craft ideas from Pinterest. ;)",
