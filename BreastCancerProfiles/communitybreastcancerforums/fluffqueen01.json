Trying to focus on the mastectomy and take my mind off the fact that I am Her2+ and every time I cough I am wondering if it is in my lungs. If figure I have been on the wrong side of every odd so far...the only two left are lymph nodes and mets someplace. I figure I will be the one to go from stage 1 to stage IV overnight. So...here goes my little detail questions...how does one wipe after a bowel movement after a bilateral mastectomy? I really do not want assistance in this, but I can't figure out how it is going to work if I can't move my arms much? Any suggestions? Other than the worry above and drains, this is my beggest concern for the moment. I will move over to worrying about chemo and herceptin after surgery. Thanks for your advice in advance!
