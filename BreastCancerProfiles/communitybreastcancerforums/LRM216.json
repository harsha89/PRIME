Oh, forgot to add that this coming Thursday, I also get the pleasure of returning to the BS so that they may extract the small pool of fluid detected by US right above a portion of my scar via needle aspiration.

What is this crap - what does the damn radiologist who I don't even know have to do with this decision.  They made me feel like an idiot.  The john Hopkins site claims that a Needle core biopsy path report showing the receptors could and probably is accurate; however, if the samples were small, then the test might have hit a \"negative\" spot and that the triple neg could be wrong.  What is so hard about just running a new receptor test on the real stuff from the lumpectomy.  Am I wrong?  Someone please enlighten me.  If I am in error, then I can at least console myself with the fact that I should feel confident in the report on the biopsy and be able to put this to rest.  The last thing I want to be is a pest to my BS; however, this is my life - not hers.  I certainly wouldn't want to be treated from this point on as a triple neg if there was a possibility I wasn't.  Anyone have this happen to them or am I just paranoid as I am so unhappy since the triple neg diagnose.

Since my breast is clear of cellulitis but is still healing (could take 6 to 12 months to heal completely), they \"hope\" it doesn't happen again, but cannot guarantee me it won't.  Great, huh?  Onc said she will start me on a prophylactic antibiotic around day 3 after chemo to help in stopping any new infection.  I am frightened beyond belief at the prospect of next chemo.  I pray your sister does alright through all this.  I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.  Please keep me posted on her progress and let her know I am sending her lots of cyber hugs.  Good luck.

Keep the faith, put on your boxing gloves sister, and fight with all you have.  Keep us posted on your progress and final path report.  Should you be triple neg - most important that you choose an onc that is very familiar with treating triple neg, as it's a whole different ball game. Whatever path is chosen, know that I wish you nothing but complete success.  We are always here for you - 24/7.  God bless. Hugs, Linda",

Wishing you the best, and I sure hoping mine will be ok as well.  Next month will be my third anniversary since diagnose with TN, I'm hoping it continues.  Ugh, I hate this disease and what it does to us.
