It felt good to be in charge of something for a change! Good for you! I have heard that yoga is very helpful. I may have to find a group by me and try it myself. Although walking in the morning has been my mode of exercise for years, I need something else to center myself at this time. Sounds like a plan!",

I have been on the fast bus for the past month and aÂ half and haven't had a chance to look through all this wonderful information. I had my second treatment on July 25 and my hair trimmed with a No. 4 comb on a clipper that afternoon because we were leaving on vacation within days, and I didn't want bald spots. Well, I now have bald spots because the hair has started falling out in clumps. My nurse practitioner recommended not getting my head completely shaved because of scalp irritation. Does anyone have any recommendations on this? I would like to have it shaved ASAP so I quit looking more ridiculous than I will bald. Thanks for your help, everyone!",

I got sick on the second day after the first infusion, and also got sick on the second day after the second. I tried different things the second time, and it didn't matter. I've just told myself that one morning of nastiness is to be expected on the second day after chemo. I only have two more times with the A/C cocktail, so I'm hoping with Taxol the nausea will be a little better. I found sipping Sierra Mist worked OK for me as well as sucking on popsicles. Other than that, not much food neared my mouth on the second day. Hope you are feeling better soon!",
