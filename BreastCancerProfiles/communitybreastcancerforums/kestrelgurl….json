My large tumor appeared seemingly out of nowhere and I went to my ob/gyn who sent me for a mammo/ultrasound. Nothing showed despite a very palpable mass and I was told (still have the letter) that it was benign fibrous tissue and to come back for another check in 6 months. I lasted 4, went in and the by now visible mass still did not show up on screening. Luckily for me, the radiologist went with his gut and did biopsies where they found both ILC and CLL/SLL. I was told the ILC had probably been cooking for 8-10 years......during which I had gotten multiple screenings. Would catching it sooner have made a difference? Most likely. Does stressing over that do anything for me NOW? Not at all. The best thing I have learned from all of this is to stay in the here and now. It's really all that we are guaranteed.....cancer or not.....I don't want to waste it. Sending positive energy to TX. :-)",

      "Content": "Aug 29, 2012 10:41AM - edited Aug 29, 2012 10:42AM by kestrelgurl I had my first AFT procedure about a month ago and am planning for 1 or 2 more prior to getting TE's. I do seem to notice that the radiated area feels softer and more pliable. Not to mention there is a thin layer of fat covering my bony chest. PS harvested fat from a small incision in my bellybutton and injected into both sides of my chest - right side to deal with rads damage, left side to work on concavity as it was actually more sunken. I had been told by other PS's that a flap surgery was my only option - Lat or one of the PAP or TUG, which were not something I was willing to do. I was thrilled when my PS suggested AFT as an option as I found it much more palatable. Yes, it will be a long process and will involve numerous moderately invasive procedures, but I feel good about the whole thing. I was small breasted and want to be the same again, even though I am ok with going flat if it doesn't work. PS told me he expected the odds of a positive result to be 80-90%. I spoke to a friend's PS and he was aware of the AFT studies, but liked to stick to things he was familiar with and could count on a good result. He did say that I was a great candidate and that the biggest problem for PS's was finding people willing to take a risk on new procedures. I am excited to be on the cutting edge and would love to provide hope for others with a successful result. Will see PS to schedule AFT #2 in mid-September and will keep you posted.",

I have been \"taped\" by my LMT twice in an attempt to prepare the tissue for begining the reconstruction process (fat grafting --> TE's --> implants). She puts the tape on my scars, and then does LE taping on the right side where I had lymph nodes removed and radiation. While I hope the prep work pays off, I am amazed by the reduction in my nerve pain and skin hypersensitivity when I am taped. All of the burning disappears almost immediately.

With the start of Tamoxifen came the hot flashes (really bad in the AZ summer!) and even more disrupted sleep and fatigue. Then I got laid off and was really struggling. Was given Celexa which helped with the hot flashes and stopped the crying. I worry about taking multiple meds, so I worked up the courage and asked my RO about MMJ and she said it was certainly worth trying. She had done a lot of research on it and said that it could potentially help with sleep, hot flashes and thermoregulation issues. I did get my card, but haven't gotten to a compassion club yet. May just wait for the dispensaries that are supposed to open in the Fall. Even though I grew up in the 70's, I was never a pot smoker. I have no interest in that.
