      "Content": "souljourney wrote: Hi all! I'm nursing my little one to sleep as I type so pardon the typos. I have had what I thought was a plugged duct a couple of times on the underneath side of my left breast. It was always brought on after wearing an underwire bra and went away within a couple of days. Since then I only wear support camis. Recently (past couple of months) I can feel a mass in the same area but only part of the time. It gets rather large (walnut-ish size) but then will almost completely disappear within 24 hours. I can always feel *something* though. It really has me worried and from the reading I've done it really seems like it may be a cyst of some sort. Have any of you ever experienced something like this? Some nights it has me lying awake, very afraid. I want to make an appointment with a doctor but I also need to afford health insurance out of pocket first. Any ideas would be helpful, I'm a nervous wreck. Log in to post a reply",

Then I realized that I haven't wore a sports bra in a couple of days either. I am slowly noticing that it is aggrevated by the pressure of any type of bra. I can still feel a small smooth knot when it is not enlarged. I am trying to wait until my insurance kicks in (just enrolled) before having it checked out. Might be a couple of weeks. I appreciate your kindness in the meantime, though!",
