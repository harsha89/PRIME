I bet you were doing the happy dance. I sure was!! What did you think of the CT scan and bone scans? The bone scan was the weirdest, since I was radioactive for 24 hours after it. Creepy, with all we're hearing about Japan at the same time. I start 4 cycles of AC (Adriamycin and Cytoxane) next week, then because my tumor was HER2 positive, I get 4 cycles of Herceptin and Taxol. I have the option of doing a clinical trial for an experimental HER2 drug that shows a lot of promise and I signed up for that instead of the H/T regimen. Now to see if I get in. Like you, I also get 30 rads, and long term hormone control. Plus 17 additional herceptin treatments over a year's time. Anyone had their chemo port installed yet?",

My advice would be to get a referral to see your hospital physical therapist ASAP. My hospital has one who specializes in mastectomy patients, and she has helped me with mobility, tips to prevent lymphedema, mobilizing the fluid so you don't get a seroma, and more. I can't say enough good about meeting with her! She is even helping me keep the skin from adhering and the scar from tightening. I meet with her once a week. She wants to see me for 8 visits. As for the radiation, everything I've heard says that radiation actually dulls pain. I guest it sort of shorts out the nerve endings temporarily, which should help with what you're feeling.  Have you already had the chemotherapy? Did they do that first, as neo-adjuvant therapy? My thoughts and prayers are with you!",

The whole weird turn this thread took just got me to thinking that I really DON'T feel like I know my body. In fact, I'm feeling kind of betrayed by it, and wondering if its my fault or my body's. Or maybe it's the fault of both of us for not having a better relationship. I'm an \"in-my-head\" kind of gal, and sometimes this body of mine just feels like a gallumphing, needy prison, or a demanding fair-weather friend that could snuff me out if I don't continually appease it. I probably need to start thinking of my body as the temple of the Holy Spirit if I am ever going to overcome that. I totally get where you were coming from, and what you said made perfect common sense. I'm sorry people took offense, because it was clear none was intended.  I wonder if we big tumor gals are thin-skinned about \"Why didn't you find it?!?\" type questions because we have asked ourselves that same question so many times - and not always in a kind way. That's obviously not what you asked or said, Ana. But it might explain why everyone here feels a little bit jittery. I mean really, why the hell DIDN'T we find these nasty, killer tumors when they were tiny little lentils like everyone else? Then we could be the Good Prognosis stage 1 gals instead of the poster children for everyone's head shaking and chiding comments.  (\"You know, if you had detected that earlier...\") You just got caught in our own internal crossfire.  Warm hugs to you, Ana. And I'm glad your emu oil is fresh! I feel ripped off by mine, but think it still worked wonders.",

But today, instead of laughing, I spent at least an hour crying. I snapped at my husband. I shooed away my kids. And I still feel like crap. Just posting here now has me crying all over again. The silence here these last five hours is a complete and total bummer for all of us who had bonded over an important problem/challenge/opportunity regarding sex - an issue that we all share or we wouldn't be posting here. And given the topic, it's a bummer especially for our husbands. (Er, I suppose I should say our gender neutral \"partners.\" But give me a freaking break. This thread is about PENISES AND VAGINAS. Who's going to be able to avoid being \"sexist\" when discussing that??)

I only used Vicodin three days then ibuprofin yesterday morning, and today I am pain-free and pain-med-free. There's just a little burning around the incision site if I move too much. Since I did not do a reconstruction, things may be healing faster. One weird thing is I noticed my face had a scary greenish cast to it yesterday, and when I looked at my lower eyelids, they were very pale. My kind husband made me a hearty meal last night, and I ate red meat for the first time since my diagnosis six weeks ago. (I've been eating like an organic rabbit, with gallons of fresh, raw veggie juices, and only occasional wild caught salmon or organic chichen for protein.) I think it helped to get some iron back into my body. I feel much better today. My husband helped me with a sponge bath yesterday which made me feel like an invalid or a little kid, but I also felt loved. We tried to scrub my underarms (uggh), and when hit hit the MX side I screamed! Somehow since there's no incision there, I thought that part was intact. But duh, the surgeon took all my lymph nodes so obviously that was going to hurt. I guess they must take them from underneath, since there's no bandage on my underarm. The incision is way lower on my body, under all these tightly wrapped bandages, in the middle of where my breast used to be. Since I can't really get my underarm clean, and I have been told not to use powders or lotions or deodorant, I feel (and smell) like a construction worker who hasn't hit the shower in a few days. It will be a relief to get the drains out and take a real, hot, soapy shower. Did they also tell you gals no shaving with a razor? One more strange new change to come: Getting an electric shaver. Geocache Linda: I am so sorry to hear about your infection! Please let us know how it goes after Monday's visit. I know you and I are part of the small group here that did not opt for an immediate reconstruction. Considering the trouble with our lymph nodes, it was probably a wise decision for us both to delay the reconstruction. I hope you have no regrets. (I had quite a few second thoughts until after the surgery when I learned about the nodes.) I'll be praying for you and following your progress as you post here.  Much love to all the Feb 2011 gals as we mourn and celebrate the various ups and downs of this trial.

I guess it's easier to takeoff everything than delicately wield the scalpel trying to get only the cancer and leave the rest intact. I hope your insurance company gives you the green light, but if not, you may want to consider paying for it out of pocket. When I asked what my mastectomy would cost if I paid for it myself,  I was told between $3,000 and $7,500 if there's no reconstruction. That seems pretty cheap for a major surgery, anaesthesia, and two nights in the hospital. If your insurance won't pay it, you could practically put that on a credit card. Good luck!",

It really works, and best of all, it doesn't cause pain for those of us who had a lot of surgery on the lymph nodes. I'm passing it along for all the gals whose drains are still in. * Lie down with a hand towel under one armpit. (You may want to ask your husband or a friend to help, esp if you had a bilateral.) * Sprinkle baking soda liberally all over the underarm, going a few inches beyond where you would normally apply deodorant. Rub it around, then brush it gently off onto the towel. Repeat. There will still be odor - but don't worry. * You can remain lying down or you can sit up for this step. Take a flat, eyemakeup-remover-type cotton pad and wet it with hydrogen peroxide. Rub it across the underarm. Repeat until all smell is gone. Viola! That's all you have to do. It leaves you smelling clean and fresh without a trace of odor. I was amazed at how well this works.",

I thought it would be a depressing woe-fest, but it was just the opposite. They were welcoming and happy to answer all my questions like a warm cluck of happy hens. It helped to meet other women face to face who have gone through this and come out well and happy on the other side. The weird part was being the youngest woman in the room. At age 44 I've stopped thinking of myself as young, but in the breast cancer context the docs and specialists keep saying I am. (Hey, I'll take my consolation wherever I can find it.)  There were only two other women in their 40's, but everyone else was older. From what I've read elsewhere on this discussion board, this online crowd may be a bit younger. How old is everybody here? 20's, 30's, 40's, 50's, 60's,70's, beyond?

The chiropractor and massage therapist confirm the numbness and tingling are coming from the neck and spine (they call it \"compression\" and say there is a tight muscle mass squeezing the nerve), and the oncs say the confusion is \"just\" chemobrain plus the result of hormonal changes. My question is this - Could this be mets, and can a person get brain mets, spinal mets, or other CNS mets while they're in the thick of their first rounds of chemo treatments? \"He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge.\" -Psalm 91 . . . . . .

Assuming that both tumors are roughly spherical, a 6 cm tumor is actually 217 times bigger than a 1 cm tumor! Don't believe me? Try the math yourself here:  www.calculateme.com/cVolume/Vo...  That's a major mind blower. I couldn't find a chart on the 'net with spheres to compare, but I did find this childbirth dilation chart that gives a sense of just how huge a 6 or 7 cm tumor really is - at least in two dimensions. Six to seven centimeters is like a tennis ball. And you ladies with 10 cm tumors basically had grapefruit sized tumors (!) ",

I know BCO is planning changes to the site and that they are accepting suggestions. Would this be a good one? Or would you gals prefer to stay in the nebulous zone? My own tumor was a series of \"skip lesions\" that measured a horrific 13 cm (more than five inches) which was pretty much the entire lower half of my B-cup breast. But the largest single tumor I had was 5 cm, so that's what I put in my signature. (Haha, that's what I tell myself to stay calm, actually.)  I might put 13 cm if I had that option, if for no other reason than to stimulate discussion, since the things we large-tumor gals have to contribute are important to this community at large. I submitted some other suggestions to the mods, and have a contact if we want to ask for the size choices to expand upward. Opinions?",

By the time they were done, they had found twelve cancerous lymph nodes that were so cancer-ridden they no longer even resembled lymph nodes. My surgeon went on to remove all 28 lymph nodes, and was pretty freaked out when she got the pathology report. (I love her, btw - she's the greatest.)

I think when we Stage IV ladies engage with those of you who still have a chance to LIVE through this, we feel an urge to protect your hearts from the heaviness ours now must carry. We would all urge you to be fierce about protecting your hope-- and listening to our dark stories is not likely to help you keep your head in the light. Honestly, the only advice I have to give you is that I regret every single cotton-picking minute I ever spent at Stage I worrying about what was coming next. I wish to God now that I had every one of those minutes back. I would spend them playing with my kids, smiling at my husband, holding babies, and eating lots of pie on picnic blankets with all my best beloveds. I really am sorry if we Stage IV gals seem clique-ish at times. It's largely because we share a peculiar wisdom that we have gained while walking through the valley of the shadow of death. And that wisdom has made us abundantly compassionate and protective toward women who haven't had to join our clique. We hope you never do. We want you to LIVE. Peace to you-- ~lulubee",

This is going to be a battle for your mom, and she is blessed to have a daughter like you to support and care about her. The \"stage\" of a cancer depends on the size of the tumor, and how far it has spread. You can find details here: http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/diagnosis/staging.jsp As for a second opinion, I would strongly recommend getting a treatment plan from a research cancer center. Here is a list: http://cancercenters.cancer.gov/cancer_centers/cancer-centers-list2.html  These centers can offer your mom experimental, state-of-the-art treatments that will not be available at your local hospital.  Research has shown that people who travel more than 50 miles for their cancer treatment have a better outcome than those who don't, most likely because they are leaving the corner hospital for somewhere  more cutting edge. I hope this helps. Feel free to private message me with your phone number if you'd like to talk by phone. Warm hugs, Windlass",
