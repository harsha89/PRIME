I was trying to find the most appropriate forum to post in - I hope this is one is correct.  Well, to start things off, my mother was diagnosed with Stage II BC 17 years ago (I was 10 at the time). She had Chemo, Radiation, and a Surgery to remove several lymph nodes in her arm pit. She had been in remission since then, but recently developed kidney issues. Turns out, her kidneys were not the problem, per-se, but the blockage of her ureters. They did all types of tests and she just had a PET scan done last Thursday, but through Ultrasounds, CT, MRI's & biopsies, they have confirmed that the \"lesions\" on her liver are BC, the growths/blockages of her ureters are BC, and also, she has some BC \"lesions\" on her spine. They went back and did another mammogram, but there is no evidence of BC in her actual breast.  I am still trying to understand this - Is it common for BC to come back like this after almost 2 decades? Also what confuses me is - her ONC said that her biopsy puzzled them at first, as it was BC cells, but very stagnant for cancer cells. They want to start her on hormonal therapy, have said she's stage IV, but that the outlook is \"very treatable\" for her grade of cancer?? It just seems like there are a lot of contradictions and I ask tons of questions, but I feel like the ONC's aren't being straight with us. I am very scared and everyone in my family is as well, but I need to be the educated, strong son my mom has raised me to be. Has anyone dealt with a similiar situation?  God Bless.  Log in to post a reply",
