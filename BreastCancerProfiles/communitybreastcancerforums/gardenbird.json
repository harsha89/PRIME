Well this day 10 years ago I got the dreaded diagnosis.  The week beforehand I had the biopsy and I was requested to attend for the results on the 14th February.  I said \"but that's Valentine's day, the anniversary of my engagement\".  The (Dutch) surgeon responded \"you will be either drinking champagne or you won't\" (they are very direct, the Dutch).  Well I wasn't.  I was diagnosed with a tiny but vicious lump, it had spread to 25 lymph nodes.  I had TAC chemo, 7 weeks radiotherapy, 2 years tamoxifen and 5 years arimidex. I was terrified in the beginning.  My children were 6 and 10 and I thought I've got to live to see this pair grow up.  The treatment was tough but manageable, what was worse was the \"fear\" - fear of recurrence, fear of every slightest pain, ache, twinge.  The \"fear\" is still lurking (I have an ache in my right shoulder at this minute) but has retreated to a further place.  The last 10 years were great.  Got to see my daughter turn into a beautiful, kind and caring 21 year old, went off to University (is now on a year out, travelling in Asia, but that's another story!)   Got to see my son grow into a strapping, funny, lovely nearly 17 year old.  Got to see myself getting grey, wrinkled, sagging and bagging, got to see my 5 years younger husband without the loss of a single hair, not a grey hair on his head!  I used to read this site every day - especially the stories of survival, they were my lifeline.  I hoped and prayed I would be posting on the 10 years out forum and here I am!  I must say the stories are getting more frequent.  In those days there was no \"15 years out\" forum.  So today I'm really going to celebrate Valentine's day.  Preparing a roast chicken with rosemary, olive oil and garlic. There will be chocolate lava cake to follow.  A gin & tonic will be served (Bombay Sapphire & Fever Tree, to be specific), we will drink some wine and enjoy life - kickin' ass as you guys in the US say!! Hope to be back every year and I wish all my fellow travellers a safe journey and praying our destination is as far away as possible. Love to all on this day :)",

Would be grateful for your experiences.  Dx 2/14/2007, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIIC, Grade 2, 22/24 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
