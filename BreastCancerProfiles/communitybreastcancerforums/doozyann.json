Beyond frustrated... he said I cant drive til drain is out... I feel so trapped and needy and depressed.  Two teenagers and single mom with no man in my life.  Anyway... should be fun dating after this :(  My family is hosting a Christmas Party in a few hours and usually asks for donations for the local food bank.... They have changed the deal this year and have asked to help me with donations so I can pay my bills.   Been off work 7 weeks with no disability check as of today.  NYS likes to take its time.  Its a small fraction of my pay but its something.  So I guess I better go stand in front of my closet and figure out what I can wear to hide my lack of chest and my friend Jack :(  I'm blessed but I'm pissed.  Bad day for everyone to be looking at me...

I may decline it but still need some answers on the amount of drainage increase.  It warms my heart to get responses from people who are having similar experiences... should have logged on years ago :)  Have a great day ladies... I will update later.",
