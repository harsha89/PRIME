I am just curious--I know everyone is different and everyone has a different type of cancer and recovery period.  I am trying to do some pre planning (if necessary) and want to know other's experiences of how long it was before you could return to work (desk type job and does not have to be 8 hours a day) after a lumpectomy and\\or mastectomy.  I realize radiation and chemo will also interfer with working--I am the sole support in my family and do have some sick leave\\vacation time accummulated.  Last year (2006) I was off work for 9 weeks (not all at the same time--6 weeks for a total abdominal hysterectormy which got infected and had to have wound care) and then for 3 weeks to correct an incisional hernia that was caused by the above infection and poor healing on the inside of the incision (outside incision finally healed).  Second surgery went much better and I was back at work in less than three weeks.  I am not a person who can just sit at home--if I can go to work for 3 or 4 hours a day that would be just fine with me. Thanks for your suggestions. I'm also interested in chemo and radiation therapy insight too. Log in to post a reply",
