      "Content": "Feb 2, 2009 10:22PM - edited Feb 2, 2009 10:23PM by Sue-Ann Hello all.  Thanks for bringing up the issue of the shorter Canadian rad treatments vs. the US treatments.  I'm being treated in Berkeley, CA and my team informed me about the Canadian study, but recommended I follow the typical 5-6 week treatment.  I still haven't started treatment and am meeting with the rad group on Wednesday and will pose the question again.  Also, would love comments on the set up for the treatment.  They have me on my back with my breast basically under my armpit.  It just makes more sense to me to have me face down similar to the biopsy they did.  It just seems to me they would zap less lung tissue that way.?.   Lori, I watched the NBC segment and they seem to have justification for a shorter term plan and the video looked like it shows the woman laying face down for her treatment. Help me out girls, cause the way I'm getting set up seems a little strange to me.   Thanks,  Sue ",

Mandy, I have had several photos taken.  I tend to be on the private side as well.  What I've noticed is there are quite a few technicians that rotate through the set-up and treatments.  And today, my first day of radiation, I had two technicians that I hadn't seen before.  My file was open and I watched them refer to the photos (especially when they were checking the plaster cast template to see if I had any changes to my breast since the set up last week and yesterday). I actually found comfort in them being so precise and making sure everything was lining up.   I hope telling you about my experience may have helped.   I hope your treatment today goes easily. Sincerely,  Sue ",
