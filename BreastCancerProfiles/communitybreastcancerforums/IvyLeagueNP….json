This is my own understanding of it with some help from resources (medical journals) Most cancers tend to grow a blood supply to the tumor to feed it/help it grow. When you get an MRI of the breast they inject you with a dye that will help them see blood supply. If an area \"enhances\" rapidly it means there's a decent supply of blood vessels going to the area- making it easier to see. It is something that can be expected with a cancerous growth.  BI-Rads categories go from 0 to 6... 0 means they are not able to tell if there's cancer present or not. More testing needs done. They might order and ultrasound of the other area in question to see if they can get more information.  Hope this helps and answers your question",
