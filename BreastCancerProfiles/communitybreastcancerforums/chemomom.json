And I had to be careful to dress the area with non-stick gauze, since I tore the healed tissue off if I didn't.  It is gross-- for me, before it scabbed and healed, the area was either covered in a mucus-like stuff or even sometimes just bled at the touch (this lasted about 2 weeks).   It is horrible, but what they are saying is true-- it does heal quickly once you are done messing with that area.  I just finished today, but the week break helped A LOT.  And you're not alone.  Don't forget that.",

The scars in my situation are extensive (I have about a 1/4 inch in the center of my chest that didn't get a scar and both sides go almost all the way around my sides (again-- I was large).  But over time, the scars and swelling are lessening.  I also often wear an undershirt or cotton sport bra to help keep what I have left from showing thru.  And while I have felt fine being boobless, I am not \"proud\" of the scars and I am just now starting to feel \"comfortable\" letting my husband see me without a top. But it's coming along. So there are options out there and I am 100% happy with my no recon & no prosthetics decision.  It's totally a personal decision.  Good luck to all who come along having to face these choices like we did.   ",

      "Content": "Nov 19, 2007 03:38PM - edited Nov 19, 2007 03:41PM by chemomom Hi ladies.  I am 32, married, and have 2 young boys (5 & 2).  I had a bilateral mast on 10/25/07 (1 needed, 1 prophylactic).  I was very large chested before but I opted to go without recon.  Initially 2 reasons, really-- with 2 kids, I just wanted to get rid of the cancer and get on with healing.  Recon would only prolong recovery time.  Also, in my opinion, if I had gotten recon, it would have been entirely for other people.  Reconstructed boobs would look alien to me and most likely I wouldn't even be able to feel them.  So I didn't see the point.  For these same reasons, I don't bother with prostheses either.  At this point, closing in on a month after my surgery, I am very pleased with my decisions.  My boobs tried to kill me.  I am glad to be rid of them!  I may end up seeing a plastic surgeon to clean up the incision sometime in the future (we'll see as it continues to heal), but i do not see reconstruction or prosthetics in my future at all.  As an aside, I have found very little info on gals like me who opt to go without recon or prosthetics.  Even the NP's I see at the breast care center all assume everyone would want one or the other.  But for me, bra-free is the way to be.   ",
