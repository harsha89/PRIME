This timeÂ  the rash was on my breast, part of my back and upper arm. I went to my doctor who put me on kelfex for 10 days, but said if it gets worse to go to emerg. But in 2 days it did a get a lot better, but my breast and arm the skin is dry and peeling.The skin color is pink and blochy. Does anybody know how long does it take to clear up?

I said could it be scare tissue. He said it might but it was a concern to him. He wants me to have mammogram in December and see him a week later. Did anybody have a recurrence this soon? I had my surgery in February for a lumpectomy with no positive lymph nodes. My onc just saw me 3 weeks ago and said everything looks ok and I had the lump there already. Log in to post a reply",
