One strange thing though, I'm walking around my house today and as I'm walking I'm hearing a noise, sounded like water in a bottle or like that. Kept hearing it, thought maybe it was my stomach and I was hungry. Then I realized it was coming from my right breast. Talk about something weird, I go up to my husband and ask which ear he could hear better from then I shake my boob in his ear! LOL He could hear it too! Should I call my dr. and at least alert her to it? Thanks!!!   Log in to post a reply",

It doesn't seem inflamed, it's not overly sore, warm or red. I'm going to wait till tomorrow and call my dr. But I could seriously hear it when I was walking. I thought I was going crazy. LOL Thanks so much Artsee and Kicks for your replies.",

I've lost a son, dealt with a high risk pregnancy, premature births, infertility, job losses, life on welfare, no insurance, my husbands strokes and other health issues and hospitalizations, deep depression, bankruptcy, caring for ill parents and relatives, caring for a mother-in-law who lived with us until she died and her care was in my hands alone and many other issues. Over time I've learned I've got to laugh to stay sane. Laughter is the best medicine and keeps me linked to reality. I haven't been diagnosed and the waiting is driving me nuts, but I refuse to let it take any more days away from me than I already wasted worrying about other things in my life I couldn't control. My thoughts and prayers are with you.",
