It's been working for me from 2 months in to the treatment. It's the Cirg Tori 010 trial. I had tumors also above the neck, mediastinum, some in lungs, 1 in the liver and several others throughout my lymph nodes in my chest. I just got back my 2nd CT results after 4 cycles and 3 of the biggest tumors have actually disappeared, the rest are no longer measurable and appear as scar tissue now. I'm down to only 2 left and both are under 1 CM, the neck ones were the ones that disappeared first. I could feel them and 5 weeks in to treatment they were so small they could no longer be felt. My doctor has one other patient on this same trial and she had the same results. Her tumors were so bad at the beginning they were breaking through her skin.   The AMG 706 does cause high blood pressure, nose bleeds etc. But so far it is working. Just throwing this out as something that I know has worked for myself and the one other patient in the same doctors office that is on the trial. ",
