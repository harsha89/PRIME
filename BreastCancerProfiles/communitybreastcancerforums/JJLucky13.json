I have gotten them as well...some from before the breast cancer and treatment but was told it was because I have fair skin and that is what happens. I developed one under my eye  on my cheek bone since going to chemo so I wonder if it is drug related. I also wonder if it will be permanent or fade after treatment. Let me know if yours goes away. ",
