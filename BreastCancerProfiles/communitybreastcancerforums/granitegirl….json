I am just curious, is an older looking machine typical for Radiation.   Looking forward to hearing what all you informed, experienced and helpful ladies have to say. Log in to post a reply",

I have had 7 Treatments out of a total of 15 regular ones so far and have not had any problems.   The 15 Treatments are done in the prone (face down) position and then I have 5 scheduled boosts which will be done while on my back.   The Technician said that the boosts will be done with the other machine.  Maybe the \"older looking machine\" is better suited for the prone position... I will be glad when it is over and I am Cancer free, hopefully forever.",
