That is definitely a relief. :) I am still sleeping on my back and elevated almost a month out. Too much muscle spasm and tightness and pain to do otherwise.  I think everyone should be tested for Vit D quite honestly. Especially with a BC  diagnosis. My Onc routinely checks this for all her patients. I am super healthy (well except for BC :( ) Try to limit sugar-I use Stevia instead, no white flour, occassional cheat on those but for the most part not so much, drink green tea and matcha green tea almost every day, lots of green vegis, green smoothies, fresh juiced etc. Knew about importance of Vit D and tried to get my 10-20 min in the sun when I could. Guess not enough because my level was 17!! Very low. I'm now on prescribed mega dose to get it up where it should be. On a funny note,  just got new life insurance for hubby and I in Feb, my physical results and all, bloodwork, etc came back so good I got their best rate!LOL My husband's were a bit lower and he got a bit higher rate. So funny now I think. ha ...and here I am.;)",

As far as my surgeon discussing with me, it was done in a way of just discussing and he told me that all things are done through my Onc or PS, whichever the case may be. He is a family friend of sorts as well so I think that played into our discussion as well. :) Yes, apparently, once cancer has spread from primary location it is considered stage IV. Yep, I will be taking Tamoxifen. I hope I am able to tolerate it because it really is important in my kind of cancer. Thank you for the encouragement....just all so new to me right now and I think I've read too much on here of recurrence (as I mentioned on another thread....as we all know, most will be back posting with recurrences then those that don't have any, so not a fair % of real recurrence rates) I try to avoid threads or areas here that I know are not good for my mind. But sometimes by chance read something while researching other things.

      "Content": "Nov 20, 2010 01:39AM - edited Aug 20, 2013 12:13PM by EastCoastGrl Hi everyone. Lisamom- I just had that procedure done last Friday (some necrosis, just wouldn't heal properly). However my PS decided to put me under just in case there was infection once he got inside. If so, he could clean it out and do whatever he would need to do in that situation instead of having to come back for that and be put under anyway. It was quick and painless. And Versed is still my friend. ;) I was anxious and did not want general anesthesia again so soon but was truly not bad at all. Luckily I was not under too long as there was no infection inside. And I have to say, I was having alot of anxiety and anxiousness over how the left side was \"healing\"...and it looks 100% better. Healing up beautifully. Plus cutting out the bad skin took some of the dark scarring out of that side that had developed. :) Now I can move on to fills next week! Yay!! Well, I am having a dilemna. I am reaaallllly not wanting to take Tamox. Blood clots side effect is messing with my mind. So, I've had Onc test me for blood clotting disorder, all good except one portion that the range was 70-140 and i was 69. Not terribly off obviously but not sure. One of the tests she ordered, and I gave a tube of blood for, the lab didn't run. So, I gave more blood again today for that one, plus a couple others and also the CYP metabolizing test to see how my body would even metabolize Tamox. My Onc mentioned my anxiety over taking it and was quite understanding because she said that rightfully so, because blood clots are a real risk. :( SO, options are: 1- Tamox 5 yrs 2- Remove ovaries and do or don't take an AI (she said there are studies in Europe and even in US that question the full benefit of an AI if the ovaries are completely removed) 3-Suppress ovaries with Lupron shot and take and AI. BUT she is not a fan of this because ovaries estrogen production can break through on this course which would obviously not be a good thing. My doctor is a women, in my age range give or take, and she is very good but also very straight forward which I like. She said that my risk of recurrence with a onco score of 9 is 7% taking Tamox. Without Tamox she would say it would be around 15%. In her opinion she feels that is too high of a risk especially considering my age. (43)  I asked her many questions about removing ovaries etc and she could see my hesitation with all options. (don't want to do any of it...but what choice do I really have?? :(  )  I asked about this side effect, that side effect etc etc, and she basically said matter of fact, if your cancer comes back we cannot cure it. NOW is the time to treat it. Kind of stopped me flat the way she said it. I think she was trying to make a point, that I need to do one of these. Not truly an option but which one was up to me, but that I needed one of them if I want to live. (she didn't say that in those words but that is what I took from it)  Just to note, she said she has many women on Tamox and yes, has had blood clots complications but she personally has had no deaths. But by no means was it to be taken lightly. They were all very serious. She also said she has many women with the same concerns as me. :( Gosh. What to do??? Instant harsh menopause?? With no turning back. Once it's done it's done. I've heard horror stories of awful symptoms and I've heard stories of how it was no issue at all. ?????? Just one more of the many decisions I have to make. :( Janet-Also, I mentioned Zometa to my doctor and if she could give that to me. I thought she said it was not FDA approved yet but that she thought it would be standard of care in coming years. Is it approved already? or maybe it was something else she was talking about??",

      "Content": "Dec 9, 2010 03:53AM - edited Aug 20, 2013 12:21PM by EastCoastGrl Speaking of family history, have had alot of that in my life too. My dad is a HUGE history and family talker. He tells us all kinds of historical family things at every get together. I once gave him a book that was made to write down family history. It was probably about 15 yrs ago. I knew I would never remember all the details of what he told so wanted him to write it down for me. But, lol, he never got around to it. I tell him all the time, as he's telling another story, that I'll never be able to remember all that and I sure wish he'd use that book I gave him. ;)  Second fill today. Oh my. More painful then the first and I even took two extra strength tylenol before I went. It's been approx 6 hrs since the fill and I'm thinking of taking an oxycodone for the first time since about a week after BMX. He said my skin is thin (glad the BS got as much of the breast tissue out as possible but sorta bummed it might be too thin for the implants I want). The TE feel really hard on me. My body has created a capsule of scar tissue that the tissue expander is pushing against. Not a bad thing, just more to work against. And another reason he overfills by one or two. I am really wanting to get the smooth round silicone implants but he says my skin may be too thin. He has no problem putting those in but for me to keep in mind we may have to do another surgery to switch if I'm not happy with them. (to switch to the gummies which I really don't want after having these expanders, I want soft and squishy!!...gummies are more firm and shape stable which I find a bit odd, not as breastlike. Breasts move and squish and change shape with movement, etc)  Go back to my onc on Friday. Will get the rest of the blood clotting test results as well as the metabolizing test result for the Tamox. Guess I'll most likely be on my way with it soon. Oh! and took my daughter, who will be 18 in 2 wks, to the dr to have her Vit D levels checked. Her level was 19!! Just 2 points more then mine. Wow. She is on the 50,000 IU right now and recheck in 2 months. Taking my 12 yr old son for his reg check up in Jan and going to have his level tested also. Crazy.",

I have been tachycardic in the past and even on a heart montior for 24 hours once 10 yrs ago when my doc thought he \"heard\" something. Freaked me out. But all was completely normal. He was just proactive (and was a cardiologist who was practicing internal at the time so keyed in on it) I was very tachycardic at my biopsy and the nurse said, wow, your poor heart just racing....I was soo nervous and scared. I said oh yes, I tend to have tachycardia when I get nervous etc, sorry I guess I should of told you all that. Ha....she said oh yes, you def should. They ended up doing a different type of local for me because the regular one, w/ephinephrine I think it is?, tends to do that anyway. Well I hope you get in with your doctor for that soon. It is all so stressful isn't it?  BTW, I found out that I'm an extensive metabolizer for Tamox. Thats a good thing since I guess if I have to take it, at least I know it's doing it's job very well. Ugh. I had a bunch of blood clotting tests done, (about 5-6 total I think). All of them came back normal except one that came back funky. Bothers me. But they seem to think it is altered because of the IV trauma clotting I had/have on my hand from surgery throwing the test off. Who knows. But doesn't make me all warm and fuzzy to take it. (I was 64% out of a range of 74-150 , so on the low side) Onc said we can re-test when hand is fully healed. Haven't started yet. Trying to get in with my gyn to do a transvaginal ultrasound first. And my eye exam, since changes in eyes is yet another rare side effect. Getting my baselines. Hope everyone else is doing well!!",

It has smooth not irregular border and nothing vascular going through it...both she said were good. She said she was fairly certain it was an extruding follicle or something or other and probably wouldn't think twice about it but because of my cancer diag needs to be precautious. But still.....my heart was racing as I lay there with flashbacks to my mammogram and US that I went in thinking all would be fine and didn't turn out that way! :( My Dr. called me after he took a look at the pics on Friday and said he really thought it was nothing to worry about, thinks it is some sort of resolving cyst (don't remember what he called it) . So, now we wait 6 weeks and take another look. It should be smaller or gone by that time. If not, then we go in and remove that ovary. Gosh, with the recent anemia on my bloodwork and now the ovary, kinda tired of all this. But, this is the new \"normal\" that we all talk about. No more normal like before.

This has all been so fast since dx. Go, go, go. And all the time I'm thinking I'm getting chemo. Preparing myself for all that it would entail. My Oncologist presented my case at a breast cancer conference (before my oncotype score was known) and it was recommended that I take chemo because of my age alone. So I prepared and prepared....mentally, etc. Now with an oncotype score so low dr says not really benefit (she thought I'd be in intermediate range). I don't want to do chemo (especially if I would have to do Taxotere!!) but I am torn. My surgeon said yesterday (saw him also) that I have to do what I'm comfortable living with. Yes, I know haha. He said you need to make sure you won't look back and say wish I'd of done this or that. Make the decision and then move forward. He did also say, don't do more then you have to. More harm then good. If you believe the onocotype score, and he said he had no reason not to at this point altho it has not been around long in medical terms, then be happy and know that you are at 90some percent of it not returning. I just feel....strange. Almost like, what now? Okay so I can move on and focus on the exchange and getting on with life...which scares me I have to say. Feel like there is this thing just hanging over me, will never be the same. :( And having read some things that I did not realize before...and confirming with my onco yesterday well, just made me a bit depressed. If BC comes back it is automatically staged IV and it is treatable but not curable at that point. Wow, fun. I will be checked for the first 2 years every 3 months and every 6 mos after that. She said that they look deeply into any little thing that would of been something small in the past just to be sure. Glad to be proactive but it just is all so overwhelming to think about. :( I am thankful for having to do no chemo, so thankful but I'm just feeling uneasy. But I realize now I will feel like that even if I do have chemo. It will always be there ..... guess thats just how life goes now.Sorry I'm rambling......don't mean to bring anyone down. Hope I didn't...just needed to vent to those who I know understand. :) So glad to have that here.",

No scans for me at this time. I think that is different with different doctors and different diagnosis as well.  I also had some very small DCIS \"associated with my tumor\" whatever that means. Think I will ask my Onc on next visit exacty what that means. I am doing a bit better \"mentally\" today.

My skin is really thin and muscle etc, and the fact that I have no extra fat on my body is not helpful. (ha in this situation he said would be good to be a tad overweight because it helps that area also) Sooo, since I'm having such pain and the thin skin,etc he will fill one more time but wait 2 weeks out instead of 1. That will put me at 600 cc's. He said he will bring 550's, 600's and 650's implants into surgery and will be somewhere in that range. Sounds good to me! I don't even care at this point. Just ready for these things to go. Jealous of you that aren't having such a painful experience with these! ;)",

Started at 200 cc's each side at BMX. My rib cage is I think 30 inches when I measured.  (or it was 28 and you add 2 inches...ha cant remember!) Anyway, 5' 8\" tall, approx 126 lbs....and I was about a 34-36 large C, small D? before. I want to be smaller and he said I would be. But for my shape I think I really need at least what I am now, or the extra 50-100cc of the next fill, to look proportinate to me. Hope they don't end up too big. I worry about that. It will be nice to have one perk out of this....smaller and perkier boobs! (looking at me today I'm leaning towards the 550's). I think that will make me a small/med C cup depending on which he ends up using (550 or 600's) Wow I can't beleive you only have 275 and are a small C and I'm at 500 and look to be about a small C. Maybe you have more breast tissue?  And yes, the larger you go the more pain. That is one of the reasons he is not going to overfill me now.  Well, I'm hoping still goes with that and doesnt! Yes, I have pain that radiates all around my rib cage from these things. Hard to take a deep breath without pain....especially for a few days after a fill. I would not be surprised at all if the pain you are feeling is from these.",

I did get a punctered lung during the procedure  when the PS was placing the TE which was fine but did prolong my hospital time to 2 days instead of the 23 hours. All is fine from that. BUT wow, I was not aware before of how uncomfortable these expanders are. All of the descriptions I've read on this board are exact!.....iron bra, steel plates. I feel like I have steel plates bolted to my chest. But hopefully I won't have as long to expand. I should exchange in January but do have a bit of skin necrosis (I think that is what he called it) on my left, non cancerous side. Very small area and he said he thinks there is good skin behind it. Just have to wait for it to heal before we can fill anymore.So, few weeks set back. I had a lump that I felt that the mammogram did not pick up. I had fibrocystic breasts and had a hard time really feeling what was in there, the changes etc. I mentioned the lump at my mammo but nothing was done ( I didn't know ultrasound should of been recommended at the mention of a lump, found that out at my subsequent one when I mentioned my story to my new tech) . Anyway, got my \"all clear\" letter and thought  ok, all good. BUT, it still nagged me because I wasn't convinced it was a lump like the rest of my lumpiness so I mentioned it to my OB/GYN at my next visit. He recommended a ultrasound at next mammo to check it out. He seemed unconcerned so I'm thinking it's fine. Well, my world changed the very day of my mammo. It was apparent it wasn't good (worrisome was the word the radiologist used-it was a Friday and I had an entire weekend before biopsy on Monday to think of that word and what it may mean to my life) And here I am.Oh, and to note, the second mammo still did not show up my cancer (very dense breasts). Part of the reason I decided on BMX, mammos failed me (I'd been getting since I was 36 (I'm now 43) because of family history). Luckily, I am told it was still found early, no node involvment and wide clear margins. Diagnosis- IDC, 1.5cm, Stage 1, Grade 2, 0/3 nodes, PR+/PR+, HER2-, BRCA neg and Vit D level of 17!! Wow, had no idea I was that low.Apparently it can be dangerous to be low like that. And of course the breast cancer (among other things) risk with levels like that. I had no idea. Wish I had had that checked years ago.  My surgery was the first I'd ever had so was scared! It went well (except for the lung puncture of course!). They gave me something in my IV to help relax me while I was in the original waiting area. I don't even remember being wheeled to the OR waiting, which I am so thankful! ;) She put it in my IV and next thing I remember I was waking in recovery. Perfect! Recovery is going well. I hate the numbness under the arms but the left is almost back to normal. The right, cancer and SNB side, feels numb but prickly painful at the same time. Hate touching it and avoid it when I can. Hope feeling comes back there. Had NO idea my TE would be so tight to my chest and up under my arms. No need for a bra for the first time in my life since I was 13 I think!  Chemo, well I am on the fence for that. My Onc says I can go either way. I am awaiting a Oncotype test which I will have back Nov 2. But, if it comes in low risk recurrance I may still do chemo. I feel I need to hit it with all I have now. Don't want to look back and regret. Such a big decision! My Onc presented my case at a BC conference and the recommendation by the group was for me to do chemo, be agressive because of my young age, (43). I would do Taxotere/Cytoxan, 4 rounds every 3 wks. She said it would start fairly soon and the TE exchange surgery would have to be delayed. Well, the thought of having these in me any longer then necessary makes me cringe. Well, guess I'll see what the Onco score says and go from there. If the score is low then chemo would be up to me. In that case, I would in a way like to finish up with the TE and exchange and then do the chemo. So many decisions in such a short time! Chemo and losing hair....not excited about that but if the hair loss is temporary I could deal with that. Unfortunately, there is, from what I've read a 10% chance of PERMANENT hair loss with Taxotere. I would NOT be ok with that. I've been reading the thread on here about the cold caps and keeping your hair. It's amazing how these women have kept their hair! With the SE of chemo and just everything else that would be huge to my emotional well being. I have to say, as much of a pain it seems to be, I would go that route and keep my hair if I decide to do chemo.  Sorry so long! :)",

Though I'm not sure I would love the shape being constant though. However, they are supposed to help with capsular contracture because of that which can sometimes be a problem with reconstruction. Yes, the cold caps are quite involved to say the least. I read all 39 pages on another area of this site about them. I plan to have my husband stay with me anyway so that solves that one problem. I am actually considering asking my doctor about Taxol though. With or without the cold caps the Taxotere is scaring me. I know others have done well on it but I guess I've spent too much time reading which can sometimes not be a good thing.   I know all have SE's. Just weighing which ones are something I can live with. But since my doctor says I can go either way with having or not having chemo (unless for some reason the oncotype score comes in high...then thats a whole other story) I think I will maybe try another chemo drug. I will also be on Tamoxifen for 5 yrs since mine is PR+.",

And, true, there will be more of those who post with recurrences then those that are doing well years later. But still. Ok, debbie downer....enough for today. Sorry! LOL I have my moments and am then hard on myself and then realize, wow, it's only been a little over ONE month (41 days to be exact!) since I was even diagnosed!!! ALOT has happened since then and my world has changed. It's only natural to be up and down. My mind still has not wrapped around it fully I think. BUT, I do shake myself out of it and try to remember to live in the NOW. Most important thing to do I think. Just trying to keep focused on the present. Too much thought of the what ifs and future are stressful and not helpful. I am 3 weeks out yesterday for my BMX. I am awaiting my Oncotype score results. Will get those I assume next week at my Onc visit. I am doing much better on pain. Not taking anything at all for it now because it didn't seem to be doing much anymore anyway. I have discomfort but not too much pain as long as I don't move too too much. I do have more pain on the left side by my ribs. Think maybe some inflammation or something? Going to PS tomorrow so am going to mention it to him. I forgot to mention earlier that my PS nicked my lung during my TE procedure part of the BMX. He saw bubbles and had to bring in a lung doc during surgery. Nice huh? ha, my lung didn't collapse so no lasting issues with that I'm told and all was and is well. (was his first ever lung puncture he said but said that has something to do with the chest wall in thinner people with not alot of body fat it is easier to happen)  Well, I can't help but wonder if my pain on that side is related?",

I had a fever about a week or so after BMX, of about 101. Had it for a couple of days but it subsided and all was well. I hope yours subsides and you are feeling better soon. About the veins, I'm still dealing with phlebitis on the top of my hand where the IV was 4 weeks ago! I have a swolen area right behind where the IV entered and some small lumps just down the vein behind it. Was very sore but not so much anymore, just there still the same. I have been told that can sometimes take several months to resolve, but they don't worry too much about those as they are surface veins. Bugs the heck outta me though!!!!!! Hot compresses and aspirin is what I was told to do. Anyway, makes me wonder if I should take Tamoxifen if I clotted there from the IV and it has a risk of blood clots????  Gosh, so many things to think about....pills, side effects, etc, and I'm the type to take NOTHING instead of worry of side effects.

Waiting on it to heal. Well, it has healed well except right at the incision has been this thing...sortof roundish trying to heal. Right side looks great and the left side well....not so much. So, he said he didn't like the way it looked and that it wasn't healing so great because that small area was dead skin. Perfect. Right at the incision about the size of a dime or so. Anyway, he said he was going to cut and excise the skin and sew back together. Didn't realize as he said that, that he meant that it would be surgery type. :( He said he could do local but would rather do general just in case he got in there and needed to clean whole area out around TE, etc. Wants to stay on top of it to prevent infection. Sooooo, back to the operating room. UGH Almost cried sitting there with the nurse going over all the \"pre op\" stuff for this \"little\" procedure. Doesn't feel little when you go over all that stuff and you have to go under general ..... felt like I did going in for the masectomy. I know it's not the same but still. :( It is scheduled for Friday and I'm just so, well bummed, nervous I guess. Not excited about going under again so soon and not excited about another IV (considering I still have phlebitis, swollen vein from BMX ) Kind of just hit me by surprise today and was completely not expecting that! The most I was expecting was having to wait another 2 weeks to start fills, not another surgery.  He also mentioned I will need some physical therapy as well for my right arm after I am done with this procedure on Friday. I have a tight band/ligament there and can't raise my arm like a should be able to. He called it something but I was still in shell shock over the other so don't remember now.",

But think I will ask when I go in about the sedation with local. Good to hear about the physical therapy. I am glad my PS is having me do that also and I will definitely ask about a masectomy specialist. Sorry about your edema! Hope that clears up soon for you. myrrl: I hope mine goes as well as yours! He does not think mine is infected or any issues inside but he is cautious. He says can happen quite often and one of the reasons he wants me fully asleep so in case he finds something he can just clean and take care of it right then. And as far as your fever, I don't think I would worry just yet. I remember my surgeon telling me it was not unusual to have a fever up to about 101 for a week or so after surgery. And no you didn't just have that big type surgery but you did just have them open you up again so maybe that's it. As far as sleeping goes, I'm still elevated also. I do find I end up sliding down by the morning but mostly in the same-ish position. Still with two pillows under each arm for elevation. If I wake in the early part of the morning I will sometimes make a slight turn to my side and prop with pillows. My arms tend to fall asleep too. It's awkward trying to lay that way but sure feels great for the little time I'm able to! I'm not sure I could sleep flat just yet either.  ccpng: Sorry you are leaving the warm sunny weather. Hope you have a safe trip home. :) Hope everyone is doing ok :) Well, have to be there at 6:45 am so I'm off to relax some and get ready for bed.",

It is nice and somewhat of a comfort ( to me anyway! ;) )to be with others who are at the same stage as we are with each other, diagnosis, surgery, starting meds or chemo, etc. :) Glad everyone is coming along. My emotions are crazy. Not sure whats up but am feeling alot of depression and haven't even started Tamox yet. :( Feel like I'm alrdy feeling the effects of lowered estrogen just from having my breasts removed.

Sounds like some of the things Tamox causes us ladies who take it. Please try to not to worry, you'll be ok! Janet, glad you have your date for masectomy so you can get that past you. :) I totally understand the anxiousness about surgery again. I'm having it somewhat and I've been under general twice since DX.

I am excited and nervous but most definitely looking forward to getting these rocks out!! Not sure what to expect from it...you know afterwards. Just wondering what I'll look like and what size I'll end up! ;) Can't remember if I told you guys here but I had an US done before starting Tamox and they saw something on my ovary that is probably \"nothing to worry about\" but wanted to take another look in 6 weeks. That will actually be done on the 28th, the monday before my surgery. My Gyn said he thought it would be fine but if not, we'll just take it out! hahaha, yea ok. So, timing it worked out that 6 weeks was before my exchange, just in case something else needs done. I'll wait and do at same time. Gosh so much going on. Posted a big long whiny post about it last night on the Bottle o' Tamoxifen thread...won't bore you all here with it again. ;) Just feeling overwhelmed with all that's going on.",

I have not mentioned the cold caps to my dr yet so we will see how that goes. ;) YES, mornings are the worst for pain for me. It is unbeleivable that I can be fairly fine throughout the day (well, as fine as you can be in these) without pain meds at this point, but in so much pain and discomfort upon waking. I do still sleep elevated but have to sit up when waking to alleviate some of the pain. It gradually subsides and then I'm ok mostly.  What have the ones of you who did BMX decided to do for implants? Gummies or smooth round silicone?

Worked! I think I may be doing some more side sleeping. My favorite position to sleep. Felt great I have to say. :) As far as exercises, I've not been told to do any by my PS. My Surgeon did mention at my follow up to make sure I gently stretching my arms out to the side etc and getting some range of movement. He told me he'd let my PS tell me about moving my arms above my head. I did ask the nurse at my PS office this last visit what I should and shouldn't be doing as far as overhead and was told go gently, just don't do repetitive motions and if it hurts, stop. So, probably why I ended up having more pain was because I had 200cc's put in each side at the time of surgery. They were able to spare quite a bitof my skin because I had wide margins. Skin, no problem, but those muscles were probably screaming. l have not had any fills yet because I had a small area of necrosis on one side that has now healed quite nicely. Unfortunately tho at my last visit he said my skin was tighter then he'd like it to be. Something about fluid in there making it hard. He said when they remove all that breast tissue it removes much of the lymphatic pathways and the body has to adjust. Something like that anyway!  So, no fills until Nov 10. He did give me a prescription for Valium because he said that relaxes the muscles and helps sleep. I tried it a couple nights. Worked ok but I'm not big on taking stuff!  Anyway, I need to get out walking to help move that fluid along. I live in a nice neighborhood so walking is easy for me so no excuse !! ;) Your home sounds beautiful and peaceful. :) Enjoy your night! :) \"Begger's Night\", love that! Trick or Treating for us is tomorrow night. My daughter will be 18 in December so no trick or treating for her. Although I have been helping her get her costume together for a party she is going to tonight. She is going to be \"Snookie\" from Jersey Shore. LOL I have never watched the show but know who she is. Funny. My son is 12 and could go out but he wants to do what he did last year, which is dress up scary and scare the kids and hand out the candy. Cute. :) Miss when they were little but older is nice too!! ;) Hope everyone has a wonderful day! It is 60's and sunny here in Hampton Roads, VA!! (after being 80's earlier this week, crazy!) I'm off to watch my son's football game. Should be his last unless they win ....then playoffs. ",

I didn't realize how much of a fog I was in mentally until I was coming out of it. ;) I also had some blurry vision, diziness, etc. Don't even remember the first week or so home from the hospital all that clearly.  Angelisa- I also have one lower and one higher. I am a bit concerned about mine too but have read that pockets can be sutchered to move them to correct location, etc. Actually the right one of mine is placed more under my underarm then the one on the left is? Going to ask him about that also when I go bk. Guess that would fall under more sutchering to fix as well?  I have yet to have my first fill. (altho I do have 200ccs in each now so I look like a small (and verrry flat, smooshed,lol) B cup. First fill should be next week. Will have to see how my left scar is healing at that point. I am so excited (I think) to say I will not need chemo!  I got my onco score back this morning! It was 9!! Which means no chemo. My doctor said that the graph shows that I would actually be in the negative by doing chemo, meaning the risks would not outweigh the benefit. So, she said partly because of my strong ER+ that chemo would not benefit but the Tamoxifen is hugely important. My risk of cancer returning is 7% (taking Tamox). I was concerned a bit about the clotting I had (still have) from the IV site on my hand at surgery and the fact that Tamox side effect is possible clots so she is running some blood tests on me. She does not think that is an issue and the IV one is more of an injury related clot (from the IV and the way it was positioned possibly, etc) I will find out the results of that in 2 weeks. Seems I'm always waiting on some kind of result! :) Have fun in Cali Angelisa!! I wish I could take a vaca somewhere about now! :)",

I do think it is very helpful to talk with others who are going through the same thing ....its comforting in a way as we all understand completely what the other is going through. And, yes, you are not a statistic. No one, NO ONE, can predict the outcome of any cancer diagnosis. I have also read too much....had to stop because it was not helpful for me personally. BUT what I found is the same as what Angelisa said....some with a great \"prognosis\" had recurrance/mets and some with not so great prognosis with many years with no recurrance. So, please, please don't look too much at all of that, the numbers, the statistics, etc. We are here for you!!! Angelisa: So sorry that chemo has been recommended for you. But, yes, it is just a blip, 4 months! I am also 43 and worry about not having it. But with a score of 9 I'm told it will not benefit me. I am going to ask my oncologist about two things when I go next week though- I want to be tested to see how I will metabolize Tamox and want to ask about my vascular invasion on my report..its say indeterminite. I don't like that. Better then yes obviously, but not determined?? That seems important to me. I want to see if we can send my tumor to another pathology lab to see if it can be determined.  Hopefully it can, in a way, that would weigh in on my decision of chemo. Except for the fact that chemo typically kills fast growing cells (healthy and not) from my understanding and since my onc score was so low not sure the vascular invasion makes much of a difference in my case. ?? The thinking is the Tamox will take care of any stray cells if there are any.   Janet: Exactly why I want to be tested before I start a drug like Tamox! Whats the point if the body does not metabolize it?? May I ask if you are post menopausal? If for some reason I can't take it I'm not sure what I'll do as it is very important in ER+ cancers. I would have to chemically shut my ovaries down or have them out and take an AI. If you are not post are you having to do either of those to take the AI? And its crazy about the Vit D, huh? Mine was 17. I am taking 5000IU D3  (onc prescribed the 50,000iu D2 but I skipped the last one in favor of the D3 because from all I've read it's the best) I'm thinking I am going to up that to 7000 though because it takes a long time to get levels up and cancer patients especially need much higher levels. I read David Servan-Schreibers story on the web and yes, SO true...I totally believe those changes are necessary for all of us. I will look for the book also. :) myrrl: Glad you got out and found pants! :) I am with you on the exercising outdoors. I feel the exact same way. There is just something theraputic about the air, the squirrels, the birds, plants, etc, nature, life. It keeps me going and I can run, walk much longer. I have a treadmill and NEVER use it. I do however HATE cold weather and being cold so I don't go out to exercise from about Nov to Mar. I do inside things at that point. ( Not sure if any of you have heard of these but I love to do Turbo Jam and my hubby and I did P90X a couple years ago....I want to start back doing some of those again) I need a good meditation type thing also. I have not done much of that but feel it will be very important for me now and so if anyone has any suggestions please tell! :)",

And yes, I have decided it's just too much trouble to try to explain to others so I just don't even try anymore. I can see their eyes glaze over, it's just too much for them to understand. Janet, that is a great idea about giving the books for presents. I would love all my close family members to read it, to help themselves and to understand me a little bit more. Yes, he talks about all of that in his book. For quick reference, you can look at the colored, slick pages in the middle section of the book where he describes things to avoid as much as possible. Parabens, estrogenic things and phtalates are there. Forgot to mention that no fills for me as of yet. :( I went back post surgery this last week. Had been two weeks since he removed the bad skin. I was expecting a fill! He said he wanted to wait another week, maybe two because the skin was really thin there and he wanted to make sure it was good and healed before he started filling them. I was so disappointed and my dr said wow, I have never seen someone SO eager for fills!! (since they cause more discomfort) I told him, I'm ready to get on with it! Get these things outta me. (not to mention, to look a little more \"normal\", these are oddly shaped-need some projection!- and I have to watch what I wear) He said yes, he knows those are uncomfortable and hard to sleep with but the implants will be so much softer and will be much happier with them. Well yes I sure hope so!! ;)",

Seems there's always some other test results to be waiting for.But you are done with chemo (yay!) and yes, you can just focus on healing now. I totally understand how you feel about not knowing if it may or may not have spread. That was hard for me too, but  I really just realized it was out of my control and I would deal with whatever came. (easier said then done to some degree I know) They will be able to tell you some preliminary results directly after surgery. I had never had a surgery or been under anesthesia in my life so I was scared!!! Scared of the cancer and scared of the surgery...but wanted it OUT of me. But it was truly no where as bad as I imagined and for that I am thankful. We are here for you and I can totally relate to having wonderful family support but not quite the same as those who are going through it right now. :)",

Sort of sounds like some kind of allergic reaction to something though. happygirl45: So sorry you are sore with your fill. I won't get my first one til next week and I'm sure it will be tough for me too! I have 200 cc each since BMX and I've struggled with lingering pain and tightness and spasms.  alhaun: I am sad to hear that you are having such a rough time. I myself dont feel traumatized in that way. I do feel like I've been through a rough time though, emotionally draining and physically however. But I am getting better with that. Depression, yes, I have been feeling that some too. Part of that I think may be the drugs/anesthesia coming out of my system as well as just all that has gone on. I am sad that I didn't do the NSM at this point. I have to admit I am envious of those that have had it done. I was offered it by my surgeon but at that time, at the mention of the fact that there would be breast tissue that would still be there because they coudn't get it all out and keep the nipple, I said no way! ha, just wanted it all out of me. I was hasty and scared. Now I sort of wish I had \"something\" left of \"me\". :( But it is what it is... I didn't, and as with everything I have learned since I have to move on and not look back. So, just to say, I think we all have varying degrees of emotions and feelings concerning all of this and you are not alone! I think things hit us at different times thats all. HUGS to you.",

Yes, if it will alleviate fears, have the other removed also. I know for me, it was the right decision to just take them both. I could of gotten a lumpectomy, uni or bilateral. But I KNEW immediately I would not be comfortable with that. I said take them away! ;) Angelisa: So sorry you are having to go through that. I'm sure it's all just fine though! And good for you for having them look into it just to be sure all is well before chemo. That illness sounds awful. I have never heard of it. I have also considered going for some meditation and yoga I think will also be good for me. (once I am able to do it) I searched for \"yoga for masectomy patients\" but couldn't find anything. Was hoping there was something since I'm not sure I would be able to do all of the regular poses/stretches of typical yoga yet. You said it perfectly about the \"darkness\" that haunts for years....or forever. Yes. So true. And people don't get that. I'm sure I didn't as well before all this occurred to me! ( I actually had a well meaning friend/aquaintence the other night say \"oh, so they removed  them both and got it all? So that means your breast cancer risk is just like all of the rest of us now right??\"---- um no. Wasn't sure how to respond to that because she just wouldn't of \"got it\" anyway) But it is hard because I'm living with this and realize that that darkness, cloud, whatever is always there. I'm not having too difficult a time with it so far but I DO relate on the aches and pains and worry. I think, no I KNOW, lol, that even if I did have to do chemo I would still worry about those just the same. I've been reading the Anti Cancer book and it is great. I'm about halfway through. I have changed all my makeup to paraben (and everything else basically) free.(HARD to do but think I've got it now) Amazing how many things I had that I was putting on my skin daily with that junk in it!!! :( I've also stopped using perfumes (phthalates). I used to make some things with essential oils some years back and have mixed up a few natural ones recently. But have found, that even with that I have to be careful of estrogenic oils such as lavender, chamomile and tea tree (and actually quite a large list of others). The bad thing is most \"natural\" store items have one or more of those in them. I also got rid of all plastic storage containers. (BPA and the xenoestrogens) Got glass ones instead. And also have been saving spaghetti and salsa glass jars to use for future leftover storage as well.  I have been researching phytoestrogens and they are in SOOO many foods. Hard to avoid them. Seems if they are \"weak\" phytoestrogens then they act as Tamox (good) and if they are \"strong\" phytos then they stimulate the cancer cell (not good). Nice. So yes, maybe it all seems a little overboard. But I am doing what I can to help my body.  Still undecided on the Tamox. Possible side effects of that just really really bother me. But I'm a little freaked thinking there could be something and I'd really like to know I'm doing something to block the suckers if there are! (especially after reading so much about bad phytoestrogens!!) So I'm leaning towards trying it. If I can't tolerate then I suppose I'll consider removing my ovaries. How are we supposed to reduce stress to help our bodies when all of this is SO stressful?? :(",
