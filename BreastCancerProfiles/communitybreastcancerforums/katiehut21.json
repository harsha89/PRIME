It's been there for awhile but is now much larger and hurting.  My doctor ordered a mammogram and made an appointment with a breast specialist/general surgeon.  My lump is high up beside my breast bone . Every thing I have found has showed breast cancer lower or on the sides. Can you get breast cancer that high up? The office called me with an appointment to the specialist/surgeon after my appointment which I wasn't told was being refered there. Should I be worried that I am seeing them or is that the typical thing to do when they find a lump. My mom had one but only had the mammogram she didn't get refered to a specialist. And I keep reading most lumps are not cancer and I hope thats the case I just need to know if it is typical to be referred there already and is it possible to have breast cancer that far up?
