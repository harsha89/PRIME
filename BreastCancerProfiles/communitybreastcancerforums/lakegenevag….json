So, that choice seems to have been okay. That said, don't be afraid to push your doctors.  If you feel you've been waiting too long, get on the phone and don't be shy about asking for the treatment you feel you need on a timeline you are comfortable with.  You are your own greatest advocate.",

Prior to chemo, I did egg preservation and was put on a Letrozole.  That drug also had an effect on my tumor and I felt it get smaller during the weeks I was on it. ",
