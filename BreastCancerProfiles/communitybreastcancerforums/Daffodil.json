A couple of days before, DH drove me a recommended health boutique, where a very nice woman fitted me with a good bra (wide sides & back, built-up straps). I used to wear a 36 B; this one was 38 due to swelling I still had. It had a light foam liner for smoothness and soft pockets for the polyester pouffs. She chose \"small\" pouffs and took away stuffing until I had a nice \"presentation\"~~~I looked normal and nice in clothes! I didn't buy any special camisoles for drains, as I didn't have to go anywhere much except doctors' offices. When I did, I wore the bra, which was as comfortable as you could expect. In my case, as the fills increased, I removed more \"stuffing\" and continued to look pretty good! It cost about $50, which insurance should cover. Good luck to you!!",

I just sent it to my sister (thanks, Grandmother, for this legacy) with new pouffs. OneÂ can be adjusted to match the other side, and if there's weight gain or loss, you can add or subtract the polyfill stuffing. It's pretty comfortable and the styling makes for good coverage and support. You can see the difference when you try to wear a regular bra; you need the wider bands and straps to make up for swelling, etc. Insurance should cover. I bought mine at a \"health boutique\" with a very kind fitter, and walked a runway at my cancer luncheon 2 1/2 weeks after surgery~~which was one year ago today! Blessings and good luck!",

He believes that the needle may pierce cancer cells, sending them flying into your system. The surgery was performed in his office under anesthesia, and I came home and got on the computer!! I could have stopped there and had radiation, but he strongly urged a more aggressive surgery for my particular situation, ageÂ and family history. We will hope for aÂ benign outcome. If you need more info, there are incredibly knowledgeable women on this board. Good luck!",
