She was extremely knowledgeable concerning the breast and issues that can arise from it.  She gave me GREAT news! She said that based on the pathology report, she does not see the need to have a  second surgery. She said if the pathology report used the word \"Pleomorphic\" to describe the Atypical Lobular or Ductal Hyperplasia cells (meaning more spread out and more agressive) as oppose to the word \"Usual\" Atypical Lobular or Ductal Hyperplasia,  meaning the usual Atypical pattern and less aggressive Atypical cells, then there would be a need to further investigate and remove more tissue for biopsy. Since it is the usual Atypical pattern, she said it is not necessary. However, she said if I am worried, go ahead and have the surgeon do the second surgery. She said she herself would not do the surgery based on the  results of the pathology report. The surgeon who said I need to have it would have to do it. She said it would just be taking a lot more tissue out.... thus, reducing the size of the  breast with a strong probability of finding benign results. She also stated \"while Atypical cells put you at a slightly higher risk 2.5 % to go on to develop cancer later, please know that not all women with these Atypical cells ever even get cancer.\" She said to take Tamoxifen to lower my risk of getting cancer is up to me. She said you have to weigh the pros and the cons of taking it.  She also stated that the single most important thing that I can do is to continue being proactive in my breast care and make absolutely sure I get my screenings as scheduled and on time. She said I should  probably continue to have the sreenings every 6 months to be safe....Wow, I am so relieved and feel like a burden has been lifted. First and foremost, I thank my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for His mercy and His Grace.  Secondly, I thank my wonderful friends and family for they're continued prayers and support.  So I choose not to take Tamoxifen, but to trust God that I will not get cancer.  ",

I'm sure you went through a lot of mental stress as well. I am in Illiniois, and may take that leap soon. Since you seem happy with the team you used to do your surgery, please, if you wouldn't mind sharing, let me know who and where you had it done.  I am diagnosed as ALH. I had the first excision to remove an abscess and biopsy on 3/31/14 and scheduled for another surgery on May 9 to clear the left breast lateral margins which are positive (at this point, they haven't checked the right breast.)  I was thinking so they are positive, but I thought that is okay as long as I follow up.....She, the surgeon said that she would just remove the stitches at the next surgery. I'm going to call shortly and tell her that they are very bothersome and I want them removed. I am having to keep a bandage over them because they are like \" erect wires\" rubbing against my areola.  I have my consult with the oncologist this Thursday, April 17 to discuss meds, I guess. I have very dense fibrocystic breasts. I've had Mammogram and Ultrasound done every 6 months for the last 4 years. Last June, they downgraded me to having it done annually.  In 2000, I had a needle aspiration, benign.  I have had 3 MRI's done, 1 in 2009, 1 in 2011. I also had an MRI guided stereotactic done in 2012 at Knoxville Comprehensive Breast Center in TN. If anyone can tell me what questions I should ask the oncologist, I would be very grateful. Thanks so much!",

The only reason they moved to surgery is because 2 antibiotics did not get rid of the swelling on the areola and the redness of the skin just below the areola. The first ultrasound done showed what they referred to as \"inflammation\".  They waited to do a second ultrasound 1 month after both antibiotics (2 different types) were administered to see if the \"inflammation\" went away....it did not. I had my post op apt yesterday (April 9, 2014) with the Dr. who performed the surgery, who is a general surgeon with a special interest in women's breast. Before she even looked at the breast and stitches, she went over the pathology report in short, which said that I have \"Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia and Atypical Lobular Hyperplasia.\" She said that they have to go in and do the surgery again and try to get as much of the ADH and ALH tissue as possible and run some more biopsies. She said in the mean time, an oncologist office will call me to set up a consultation to discuss meds. Before revealing my left breast, I warned her that the redness had returned a couple of days ago. She said well let's get you on an antibiotic for precautionary measures. I am like great, another surgery. I just finished healing. I hope this is not a sign of things to come. Last June, I was downgraded to having mammo and ultrasound every 12 months. I had been having them every 6 mos for the last 4 years, along with MRI's. The only reason this came up early is because the pain and swelling that is ongoing with the left breast. I thought maybe the swelling was a hidden reason to find something that the tests didn't reveal and so far that has been accurate. I am thankful I had the swelling if it meant finding something that doesn't show on the tests.",

I had another oncologist look at my pathology report and he said I have both ADH and ALH. He said I have too many confusing areas that they are unsure of and want a closer look. Regarding the atypical cells, he said I am only at 2.5 percent higher risk than a woman with no atypical cells. At this point I am opting out on Tamoxifen. He said I absolutely need to proceed with a second surgery and biopsy to see if there is anything hiding in there. I finally had to call the surgeons office again because I wanted these stitiches out as they were really rubbing against my areola. Sadly, since I was fit into her busy schedule, she was in big rushed hurry. I could not even get questions answered. She had the same male intern with her again too. She has a very poor bedside manner. Some of the stitches are embedded in the incision because they waited to long. The incision is about 2 inches wide. Also since the surgeon had to leave an open drainage area for an abscess to drain when she closed me up, there is an indented/gap between the flesh and the areola. It is all black where the stitching is embedded and to me it looks like somebody sewed me up with black thread. I'm scheduled for the second surgery with her on May 9th and I'm thinking that she would have to cut all this ugly stitching area out and then pull it together when she stitches it, right.......because It is so unsightly and ugly. I have no idea because she is too busy for me to ask questions.  I have proactively scheduled a consult with another General surgeon about 70 miles away, who specializes in breast cancer, breast disease and various breast biopsies and other disorders of the breast. unfortunately, she didn't have an opening sooner than May 8th.  I am not going to allow the current surgeon to make another mark on me. I had basil cell cancer cut out of my face via MOHS surgery. The surgeon did a beautiful job. Why couldn't this surgeon do a job like that. ",
