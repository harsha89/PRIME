I think that what bothered me so much was no exam and then just jumping into taking the ducts out.  I don't know but I would have thought that an ultrasound would at least be in order.  Could it be ductal ectasia or a papilloma?  Absolutely!  I would just rather have some idea before she jumps in & removes the ducts. I am definitely going to request another BS. Blessings - you are so lucky that you had someone good;)  Not that you want CA but better to find it now rather than later. Wren - you are lucky too that they did the right testing.",
