A few have mentioned their \"Look Good, Feel Better\" program which is awesome, but they also offer wigs for free. I was so surprised when I made an appt with the ACS in my area. They were so incredibly nice, they had a room filled with wigs, all brand new. They were the same ones they sell on the TLC website. They are not super expensive wigs, but I found one that was cute and pretty close to my own hair. They also gave me a sleep cap and a nice scarf. Just an idea in case anyone is interested.",

I don't use anything to numb it beforehand. It just feels like a small poke, nothing like having an IV inserted. But I am sure you could easily get a script for the EMLA if you wanted it.",

I kept telling my husband that I just felt \"toxic\". I felt so filled with medications. I just kept trying to drink water to help flush it out of my system. I am glad you are feeling better now. I feel almost normal too. I have thought of trying accupuncture too. Would love to know if you find it helps you.",

So I guess that helps explain some of the issues. My onc was pretty positive she would be able to tweak the treatment and meds a little so that next time it will be a little easier. I learned that the neulasta dose is standard 6mg for everyone. Same for a 250 lb person or a 100 lb person. So it may have been a dose that was too much for my body to handle. Hope everyone else is doing well!",

I went back to work and was just happy to be there because it meant I was feeling better! My taste buds have come back in the past few days and so I have been eating and enjoying it for a change!  I am 19 days from last treatment, I go for my 2nd of 6 on Thursday morning. My hair is falling out in huge clumps now, and for someone who thought I wouldnt be bothered by it, I am kind of disturbed! Happy Anniversary Grimbol! Enjoy yourself tonight! Hope your taste buds are working! I am another one here w/ TCH chemo.   Madismommy and Taylor777, I hope you are both doing well after your 1st treatment! Michelle ",

Had the horrible neulasta shot on the 12th. I felt like I had the plague for about 3 days from the shot (I think). I still feel pretty bad, like regular flu now. I had constipation and now diarrhea. I am going to see my Onc this morning. I am just feeling very despondent and sad, crying a lot. Not my normal self. I have 4 kids ages 17-10, on top of feeling like garbage, I have all this maternal guilt on top of it. I have been in bed for a week. I work as an RN and have no idea how I will work during this process. I hate the way I sound, even to myself! I was sure I was going to be tough and have a much easier time than I am having. Just thought I would jump in and hopefully feel not as alone through this ordeal. BTW, my husband is amazing, completely supportive, but I feel like I have been dumping so much on him. Thanks for listening to my pathetic tale of woe!",

My next treatment is on Sept 1st and my daughter turns 16 on the 2nd, so I hope I feel somewhat human that day! Just curious, did you have the nuelasta shot? I was wondering if I felt worse from the shot or the chemo or a combination of the two... Hope you have a Happy Birthday!.",

It helps to eat small meals several times a day, even though nothing tastes like I hope it will! My onc prescribed ativan for nausea/sleep/anxiety. It helps. I also have zofran but only use that in the first few post chemo days because of the side effects of constipation. What are you taking for the nausea?",
