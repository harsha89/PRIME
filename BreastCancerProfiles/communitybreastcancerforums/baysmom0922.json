      "Content": "baysmom0922 wrote: Hi my name is Ashley. For a few months now I have experienced intense itching in my armpits, nipples (mainly right), neck and face. I am 42 years old and had a complete hysterectomy at 32. I do not take hormones. I was sent for a diagnostic mammogram. Mammogram was performed and was told to wait for ultrasound. Radiologist then came in and asked many questions like if I breast fed, which was no and my only child is 18. Then he asked if I had nipple discharge or scabbing which I replied no. He said my mammogram looked fine but thought I had mammory duct ectasia. Said if I had any other symptoms he would be concerned of Padgets Disease. Initially I told them I had some lumps in my armpit area but he didn't say anything about that. With all that being said, would a second opinion be a good idea? I know my body and this itching was sudden onset and now driving me crazy. I worked in Dermatology for 10 years so I am familiar with treatments for dermatitis etc. I did a complete body cleanse, cut out caffeine, sugar, did a series of coloning cleansing enemas and just juiced - recommended from a natrualpath. The itching continued during the cleanse and now has moved to my back. I have a very conservative PCP and almost afraid to say I would like a second opinion. My last blood work as in July 2017 and every thing on the CBC, Vit D, B Vit, and few hormone test were all normal. I have medicare due to disability so that is another concern as to what they will pay for. If anyone has some feedback I would appreciate it. Thanks for taking the time to read. Concerned, Ashley Log in to post a reply",
