The guy at Johns Hopkins said, the biggest battle you have now is mental.  He had lost 3 best friends in college in a car accident and said it is a daily battle to trust that his wife and kids will be around the next day.  I go from, hey, i'll be fine to Holy Crap, this is it!  Just finished treatment in Dec.  Last surgery soon to get expanders out.  I feel like i have tupperwear lids under my skin,LOL!!  Decided to skip implants due to back pain.  A great philisophical question came up at a support group: When you have no boobs, is it still indecent exposure to lift your top?  I have a bumper sticker that says, Don't Postpone Joy!!!!!!!!  So true. You guys are all an inspiration!! Thanks",

Recovering now from removing expanders, skipped implants due to fibromyalgia pain. It is such a help hearing that others hit the \"why bother\" feelings and overcame them. My husband keeps telling me, \"watch out for buses!\" He is so optimistic that this is over. I am sick of feeling terrified. I just want to be here for my 6 year old son. I keep trying to remember not to waste any time and to be in the moment. I loved the quote, \"you can get busy living or you can get busy dying.\" I admire the way you r all marching ahead!!",
