Then i had a lumpectomy and got clear margins. Once we seen the pathology report it appeared that the tumor actually only had a tiny response to chemo. The tumor was initially 3.3cm and after chemo it was 3cm but the nodes showed good response. I am on tamoxifen and zodalex and about to start rads. I am so scared this has made my prognosis worse than i imagined. Have you any information or advice from your experience ?",
