    "Content": "EmmaDuncan wrote: My elder sister is experiencing some sort of soreness in her nipples since last two weeks. As she felt the pain was constantly increasing, we ran to our family doctor and she told us this could be breast cancer. My sister has been practicing a fit lifestyle from a long time and we have no hereditary issues either. What possibly could be the reason? We're planning another appointment with the doctor and I'm confused and scared at the same time. If I can get to know what all questions to ask to the doctors that can cover the aspects like clarifying the precautions to take etc. it would become much easier to deal with this.  Thank you.  Log in to post a reply",
