It must have been very difficult watching your Mom battle BC for 16 years. I'm afraid my daughter is going to be a little nervous like you, because of my personal history with this disease. I wish I could take that fear from her. I hope this makes you feel a little better. Puddin' ",

Maybe they think BC is contagious. People can do some really cruel things. I think I am stronger for it. ",

I wasn't wearing a mastectomy bra because I haven't been fitted for one yet. I was wearing one of my Warner bras with very light weight foam stuffing in the cups. And I put on one of my favorite tight fitting turtlenecks. I was looking good when I started out, but by the time I headed home some 6 hours later, my bra was under my chin almost! I had to laugh at myself.  I guess on these boards you really don't have to be embarassed about anything. The American Cancer Society has a publication titled, Mastectomy: A Patient Guide. On page 18 there is an illustration of a bra with suspenders attached to the panties. This is considered a temporary fix. This is a liitle too much of an effort for me! But I should have read the guide before my wardrobe malfunction.:) Puddin' ",

I figure if anyone has a problem with it they don't have to look. I really don't have a problem being flat chested. I must be weird. Nordstrom doesn't have the selection I thought they would have, so I am going to the Wellness Boutique at a cancer center nearby. When I get ready. :) Blessings to you all. Puddin' ",

I have been DX'd three times (r,l,l). I said enough is enough, take them both. I really did want to wake up with breasts, but some of the techniques seem so barbaric to me. severing back muscles, dragging tunnels under the abdomen, pedicles. What compensates for the lost muscles, especially when I am middle-aged and starting to show signs of bone loss from the AI I am taking. Making that kind of decision so soon after a 3rd diagnosis  started causing me emotional distress. I chose to delay immediate recon and I want to make sure all the cancer is gone first. (I might have even posted this on another forum), but I am not sure how I will react when I see the scars. I will try and avoid looking at them for a while, but sooner or later I will come to realize that I am a breast cancer survivor, and this is my unique journey, my scars just becoming a part of it. If I am still NED at the end of this year, I will do a recon as a Xmas gift to myself. Also by then I will have loads of info from the several plastic surgeons I will consult with. I will make an educated decision about recon and not one based on fear of waking up without breasts. This site is truly a blessing. God Bless you for sharing in such detail.  Pudding ",

      "Content": "Mar 12, 2010 10:55PM - edited Mar 12, 2010 11:03PM by puddingirl84 Hi to all of you and thank you- I haven't visited the boards in a while. Doctors appts and such. Went to oncologist Monday the 8th. Onc told me chemo would start on the 25th. I think I am choosing weekly (carbo/taxol x12),because I am a diabetic and the steroids on the other regimen (carb/taxotere x6) were going to be stronger and make my glucose levels spike too high.  The last time I had chemo in 2007 (A/C X4), the steroids made my glucose levels go up as high as 300 or more at times. So I think that's why the decision was made to go weekly. Does that make sense? So it looks like carbo/taxol X12. Onc didn't mention 3 weeks on 1 week off x4. Should I ask onc about that? I have up till the morning of the 25th to change my mind regarding which regimen to do. Do you think there is a reason why I should? I have decided against the port-a-cath. It was supposed to be put in on the 16th. I love my scoop-neck tops. I just want a place on my torso that isn't scarred up. Is that silly? I am just done with cutting for now.  BTW- Why is taxol used weekly, and taxotere every three weeks? I guess that's a question for onc.  I loved all your replies.Looking forward to hearing from you.  Puddin' ",

I asked her about the two regimens I have been offered, Carbo/taxol x12 weekly and Carbo/taxotere x6 every three weeks. I told her I was concerned about the Neulasta shots and my glucose levels spiking on the 6 cycle regimen. She yelled at me. She said, \"you take take the regimen that is the best to kill that cancer! Let me worry about your glucose levels!\" She told me not to choose the easy way out, and she gave me a script for Humalog, an insulin pen, to be used when and if my blood sugars go over 200. I won't need it after chemo is finished. She is sending me to the Diabetes Center to learn how to use it.  So on the 25th of this month I start chemo and I have to sign that agreement first as to which regimen I choose, I will ask my onc which one is the best? And that's what I'll sign. It will probably be Carboplatin and Taxotere.  What do you think?  Puddin' ",
