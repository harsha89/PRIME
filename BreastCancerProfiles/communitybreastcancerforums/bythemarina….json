It is a shock and as already suggested, be kind to yourself and just take it slow ... one day at a time. My initial response was panic, especially when the surgeon suggested that he would have to remove my nipple and areola. In hind site, I don't regret having had the procedure done but I really wish that I had done better and more research before I started making decisions about the way forward. \"What may break you, may also make you\"",
