True confession: I \"almost\" let LE \"kick my butt\" while I was undergoing manual lymphatic drainage (mld) and had to wrap my arm 24/7. The therapy sessions were only supposed to last a few months, but when my arm/hand showed little to no improvement, they stretched into almost six months. The heavy and cumbersome bandages weighed down my energy and mood, let alone my right/cancer/irradiated/lymphedema side arm.  But Tina337 -- you're doing it. You're out there exercising. My challenge, at this time, is to get back to doing something regularly. Before cancer, I exercised, on average, 30 min to an hour every day and did some form of aerobic, strength and stretching exercise. I can do it again. If you don't mind, I'll check in here, too. My goal today is to: walk briskly for 15 minutes and stretch for 15 minutes. I also will try to find a physical therapist who deals w/ cording (axillary web syndrome) and make an appt w/ to see him/her. Let's have a great week! ",

      "Content": "Mar 14, 2012 08:42AM - edited Mar 15, 2012 05:40AM by 11BC Thanks for starting this conversation. I'd encourage all to consider taking yoga classes that are tailored for women who have/have had breast cancer. I did yoga before my cancer surgery and BMX. Afterwards, I slowly returned to it, but then stopped when I developed lymphedema in my right (cancer side) arm. I just recently started going to a yoga class for women w/ cancer. Here's the link: http://www.omyoga.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=179&Itemid=202 The teacher has had breast cancer. She speaks with each participant individually to determine that person's wants/needs. Here is the class description: \"These gentle classes at OM yoga Center in New York City offer inspiration and bonding for women with breast cancer and other cancers. Classes include breathing exercises, slow arm stretches, healing yoga sequences, restorative yoga and balancing work that is appropriate for women during and after treatment.\" I did an Internet search for \"yoga, breast cancer\" and found YogaBear, which \"arranges free yoga class passes for cancer patients and survivors at yoga studios nationwide:\" http://www.yogabear.org/ My advice: Be cautious. Possibly check w/ your doctor and/or physical therapist. Do talk w/ the yoga instructor. I also talked w/ others in the class to get their feedback. All said they felt they benefited from the regular (specialized) yoga practice.",

But the \"yoga for cancer\" teacher told me many of her students find their lymphedema improves when they do (specialized/tailored for BC) yoga. She focuses on doing yoga poses that increase lymph flow. I wore my all-in-one compression sleeve/glove when doing the yoga. I even did poses where I put some pressure on my arms/hands. Yet my arm/hand did not swell during or after the classes. Overall, I feel much better! Here are more yoga for women w/ cancer classes: In New York: http://www.sacredsoundsyoga.com/class_descriptions.html In Denver: http://www.thehealingchest.org/The_Healing_Chest/Home.html Check out The Healing Chest's Web site. It's very informative!",

Now, about four years later, I have capsular contracture of my right (cancer/irradiated side) breast. I also have lymphedema in my right arm. So I'm thinking I've removing my implants and not having any further reconstruction. I was flat chested before reconstruction, so can't imagine that being TOTALLY flat chested will make much of a difference. Have any of you who have had reconstruction and then had implants removed seen an improvement in your lymphedema? I'm told that removing the implant/scar tissue around implant could possibly ease the lymphedema in my right arm. OR -- have any of you developed lymphedema after having implants removed and not opting for further reconstruction? My lymphedema bothers me more than my capsular contracted breast. Thanks. ",

One told me recently that there really is no universal standard for treating lymphedema. I find I have to experiment and seek more help/feedback. Thanks for your post. Good luck! ",

      "Content": "Feb 28, 2012 07:36AM - edited Feb 28, 2012 11:36AM by 11BC I haven't showered in my sleeve, but I did ask my physical therapist (who specializes in lymphedema) if I could swim while wearing my sleeve and she said it was best to not get it wet while wearing it.  Lynn1: When you shower in the sleeve and then take off the sleeve and put on a new one, you're changing the pressure in your arm during the process of switching sleeves. So isn't that defeating the purpose? I suggest you ask your lymphedema specialist about this. Ask if they can give you options other than waiting an hour after exercising to shower and change the sleeve. I bet he/she will say: Wear the sleeve for exercise, take it off, take a shower, put on a new one for an hour. Seems simple enough. == My experience: I find if I take my sleeve off for a short period of time (five to 10 minutes) my hand/arm does not immediately swell. It happens slowly/gradually over an hour or more, depending on what I'm doing w/ my arm/hand during the time the sleeve is off. I wear an all in one glove/sleeve. The glove has fingers w/ open tips. My lymphedema mostly presents itself in my right (cancer side) hand, specifically in my thumb and forefinger. Bravo for you for exercising. My lymphedema medical team can't emphasize enough how important it is to do aerobic and weight bearing exercise in order to increase lymphatic flow and manage lymphedema. But they also say to work w/ them to learn which exercises to do, how much weight to lift, frequency, etc. (See Binney4's comments, posted after this).",
