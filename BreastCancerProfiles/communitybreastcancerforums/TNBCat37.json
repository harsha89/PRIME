I had 2.8 cm Triple Negative Cancer tumor, grade 3. Unfortunately, 5 months chemo didn't kill all my cancer cells. I didn't get pCR. There's 5 x 5 mm residual tumor burden at the time of surgery. The surgeon did the double mastectomy for me said I don't need radiation. My closest margin is to the chest wall. The margin is 8mm. Clear. Also luckily, I don't have LVI lymphovascular invasion), a term means the cancer cells haven't spread to my blood vessels and/or lymphatics yet. Usually if you have LVI, the radiation will be given. However, my radiologist argue to give me radiation because: 1. I'm young (38) 2. The tumor was abut chest wall, although the margin is very clear, there's chance that the cancer comes back to my chest wall 3. There's also 1.2 cm DCIS in the breast, which is close to the 2.8 IDC tumor, altogether they encompass 4 cm (actually altogether they are 5cm before I had chemo, chemo shrank the DCIS too). 4. the radiologist saw my skin got thickened and red when I first came to see him, but I could argue it's because of the biopsy. I'm allergic to adhesives. The stereo strips made my skin itchy, red and had blisters. I'm reluctant to get radiation because of the reconstruction plan will be totally changed if I have radiation. The skin will be burned. My Plastic Surgeon already said he does not do any implant based reconstruction after radiation because the failure rate is so high. There're only 2 choices for me left: 1. get DIEP flap from my abd to transfer the fat tissue to my breast. But I'm skinny, I don't have much fat at my stomach. Plus, I saw people show their DIEP scars on youtube, it's horrible! The long and ugly scar is from hip to hip. 2. I get a robot operated surgery that they harvest my muscle from my back to fill into my breast, plus they put a small implant in. The scar is smaller than the DIEP flap. But my back muscle won't grow back. I'm afraid that I won't be able to play tennis, badminton, golf, etc... all the things I enjoy before. I only left with 2 weeks to decide whether to do radiation or not. If I were you, had a pCR, clear margin, and didn't have LVI in the pathology report. I wouldn't do radiation. Radiation only prevents local recurrence. After a clear mastectomy and pCR, the cancer coming back locally is very low. Kristi",
