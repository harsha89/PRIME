Love it. its my calling. its hard not having that. thinking I might want to be a physical therapist. anger-I just had to let it go. I had abnormal mammo in 09 with US-doc said it was fine. then in nov '10-mammo just showed same fibroglandular tisuue in that right breast-exactly where my cancer was. didn't do US. should have done one. I'm feeling pretty good. have little goals for myself each day. yest I tried to do spring rolls. that's definatly something thats going to take practice. today I'm going to try making Tom Yum soup.",

I went through ONJ pretty much with not much medical intervention. Since there wasnt a protocol for the treatment of ONJ, there was little info out there. Doctors were hard to find. I am fortunate I was on Xgeva since its half life is 6 months i think. Here is about the best video I have found from the professor of oral surgery that wrote the text book on ONJ. It goes over possible reasons ONJ can start. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T154sGspn-M I started a FB group called Living with osteonecrosis of jaw- come join if you have it. people with Tori in the mouth are more prone to ONJ. I think mine was caused by the hard bite wings from dental xrays. Did you know they have padded ones? so much easier. we also theorize anything that breaks the mucous membrane of mouth can cause it. Like a sharp tortilla chip, or a hard candy, or even a fork. The ONJ was hard to get a diagnosis. I got 2 root canals before I figured it out. I had tiny bit of exposed bone on far left side of my jaw on the inside. there was mild nagging pain, with redness and swelling of tissues in back of jaw. It took 9 months for me to convince my oncologist I had to quit xgeva. And it took a little longer for me to find out about how important the prescription mouthwash chlorhexidine was. I was having painful cycles of infections every 6 weeks or so. In the video Dr Marx talks about the best antibiotics to treat this  It took me 16 months to sequester or grow the dead bone off. It was smooth on one side. after it lifted off one evening it had spikes on it. and 2 days after that I saw a dental oncology specialist and said it was all good. I am seeing a oral surgeon today. I have to have my last molar pulled because it left the root exposed. I am really good at my dental care. cleanings quarterly. I had a pretty bad jaw infection few weeks ago due to that exposed root. Its almost 2 years since the dead bone lifted off. I advanced to the stage 4 mbc group 10-2013  The rates of ONJ are found on there website. the rate is 3%. ",

Havnt read it I have to pull myself together again. My 20 yr old was a inch away from killing herself in car accident few months ago. She was speeding. Stupid, walked away from it. My 16 yr old still has type 1 diabetes. She has had it for years and does very well with it. She has boyfriend and started driving. And poor dh getting his mri next week. Rt arm been hurting bad since spring. ?rotator cuff? I have to stop listening to this country music. Its not helping. I have gotten myself into rut. I am going to do dishes, clean up-no wonder i am crying. Chores! I know what to do. Just venting. Pulling myself up.

I work in Interventional Radiology. I'm prn-I usually worked 3days a week. they technically can't fire me and havn't. they have actually been kind of slow so they havn't really needed me. (our area opened up 2 new hospitals right before the economy failed) my story: always had my mammo's yearly. in 09 they sent me back for repeat /c US. guy said it was fine. I switched to one of those new hosp  in '10 mammo normal-but later I'm looking at it and it says same fibroglandular pattern unchanged-it was the cancer. I felt lump in july....you know how rest goes. And now since I felt like someone should have bx'ed this thing-my family and I are now distrusful of local docs. they hauled my ass up to sloan kettering. Had oneof best sx probably in world. nursing care sucked though. I think I have PTSD from that horrible experience. woke up in OR when it was over. I said \"I need 1 mg ativan, I just lost my breast\" didn't get it. got out to recovery, I said where's my PCA? \"oh those are reserved for the bilaterals\" so they were giving me .2 and .4 of dilaudid-I knew I was screwed at that point. Had the throw ups after I got to my room-they gave me ?pepcid before they gave me the antinausea. I was basically on my own all night. I had to ask my nurse to put my SCD's on. I think I got out of sx at 4pm. it was midnight before they were put on. so many things were done wrong. I complained after I got home to the higher ups/sent in nasty  press gainey. at the end of night my nurse made comment-you know they say nurses make the worst patients. She'd only been nurse 2 years-right bitch-you just wait. But I didn't go there for the nursing care. my sx got great margins. Its funny though , both the breast sx and PS both talked to DH after. PS said to DH oh she'll get a PCA and she'll probably need to be in for 2 nights due to pain control. I don't believe he told the ordering pain care docs that he put in 300 mls in that TE. I got my ass out of there that next day. It pisses me off cause I'm that kind of nurse that allways goes the extra mile for my patients. They call me the patient whisperer. I love taking someone that is all worked up over there IR procedure. calming them/little bit of drugs and job well done.  ",

He gave me estimates of sx being from 12 + hrs for bilateral diep. they have intrerns there and I dont want them working on my breasts. I know they have to learn somewhere. not on me though. My sister asked him how many dieps he had done, he never would answer that question. I went with PRMA and was treated wonderful. wish I could say the same for MSK.",
