She was doing okay (gradual but accelerating decline, stage IV with metastases to her liver, bones, and brain, and she has started having severe, acute ascites) until yesterday, and has since entered a tailspin with an infection, completely altered and is now in the icu on a ventilator. I'm a paramedic, so I am familiar with the medicine, but what is about to happen scares the hell out of me and I need to do everything I can to help the family prepare. They haven't had any discussions or advance directives put together whatsoever, so this will be a frantic scramble for me while they are grieving to prepare for the next step.  After she passes, her husband will not be able to care for the one remaining child in the house, a 16 year old with mild autism. Dad has mental health problems and we're going to have to keep an eye on him for suicidal ideation, same for the teen. We're confident we can take over (he won't argue that we should take him) but we're not sure of all the nitty gritty required. We'll take over getting him to school and the doctor, fed, clothed and taken care of. But we are extremely poor (living in Seattle on basically minimum wage jobs,) and will need all the assistance we can get.  What resources are out there to help us, apart from the basics like food stamps and housing? Would talking to a custody lawyer be of any benefit for advice? Has anybody else dealt with this before? Her family is intensely disorganized, and I want to shoulder as much of this burden as possible for them, because despite being together for going on a decade, mom and younger sister never liked me, so my role in this will be one of pragmatism.  Thanks everyone for any advice.",

I would start with my GP, who is always an internal medicine doctor, for me, and good at solving puzzles. You mention your breasts are always lumpy and what you were feeling improved. Then you got the earaches and infection from hell. I would want my doc to rule out unresolved infection, including that chain of lymph nodes down your right side. You could have some fluid in your lungs which is causing discomfort. Once I had a plan with my regular doc and ruled out all of that, we would decide what\u2019s next and what specialist may be next.

I think some doctors order it automatically. Mine did not and I was glad. I didn't want it. I did get anemic but not to the point of needing anything for it. Maybe someone who has had nupogen can weigh in on the possibilility of that adding to your groin pain. I hear it causes terrible bone pain. Saw a tip that Claritin helps. I was able to work during my chemo. I think it helped me mentally and phsically. I had chemo on Fridays, so I took that day off. I had the weekend to recover a bit. Our bodies all seem to handle chemo so differently. I was able to work but the next person will say they couldnt get out of bed for a week. That doesn't make me tough...it just made me lucky. There seems to be no rhyme or reason on the side effects. I agree with Meadow. You are doing the right things. I drank lots of water (which I hate to do), ate a lot of protein and I exercised. A lady who had been through chemo before told me if she could give one piece of advice it would be to exercise. Go for walks, even if it is just around the block. It helps get it out of your system and releases some endorphins. Then again, hugging a dog or cat releases endorphins too! The other thing I did was to drink a homemadebroth my husband made for me. I think he found a recipe called \"bone broth.\" It was a broth made from vegetables and minerals. That really, really helped me to take in fluid. As I said, I hate water. I would warm it up in the microwave and sip on it. I wish I could offer more words of wisdom. You can do this! Be extra kind to yourself. Do nice things for youself. You are almost done! Please keep us updated on how you are doing.   ",
