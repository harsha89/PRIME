I liked having some hair stick out from under a hat, I still had bangs.  I just shaved the rest off about a week ago, and I had my 5th chemo on Friday.  I still left a little in the front, just seemed weird to shave it all off.  I've just started wearing a wig occasionally.  I feel more comfortable in hats, I have a few of the Cozy Caps from Headcovers.com and that's what I usually wear. ",

I have a picc line.  I started FEC chemo on Aug 22 and had the picc inserted a week before. The insertion wasn't bad.  The nurse froze the site then used an ultrasound to guide it through the vein, then did an x-ray to make sure it was in the right place.  It wasn't too uncomfortable, I think the worst part was the needle to freeze the site.  Mine took a while because they had problems getting the xray machine to turn on.  I did overdo it that day though!  I couldn't feel it because it was frozen and went shopping afterwards!  Carrying bags etc.  When I got home I noticed quite a bit of blood on the guaze around it.  Homecare nurse came the next morning to change the dressing.  Then the nurse changed it a week later when I went to get bloodwork for chemo.  Homecare nurse comes once a week when I'm not having chemo to flush it and change the dressing.  Mine is above my elbow.  I have been using a piece of a knee high stocking (cotton blend) to cover it so I don't get it caught on stuff, plus it's wrapped in gauze and taped to my arm.  The worst part is having a shower.  I have my husband help wrap it in saran wrap but it's a pain in the butt.  Have to keep it dry.  I've seen a couple of gadgets online to cover it with, maybe I'll order one.  I actually had my first bath with it in today, I covered it with one of my daughter's waterproof swim diaper covers!   I don't know what Bueller is, I just found this post by searching for picc. All the nurses have said it is the \"way to go\".  I just wanted to avoid repeated needle pricks. Also can't have blood pressure taken on that arm.  Can't have it on my other arm either because I had a mastectomy on that side.  I also bought some tops with longer sleeves to cover it. Best of luck with it! Deirdre",
