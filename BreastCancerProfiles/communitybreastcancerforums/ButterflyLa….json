I tend to do that too and it only hurts us.  You hide the fear and it hurts your ability to cope day by day.  Nobody is a rock.  Nobody.  My dear mother is 70 and has had her own major health issues (benign brain tumors) for 20 years.  If she can endure, so can I.  It wasn't cancer, but she has been put to hell and back.  Yes, I am a bit strong for her sometimes, but I try not to hide my fear.  She knows I am scared.   As far as working through treatment, like you I am unsure.  At this point, it sounds like surgery and radiation, no chemo, but I don't know if things will change.  Through treatments I plan to work,but I don't know how I will react.  I tend to be sensitive to medications and such, so I hope my body takes the radiation smoothly. I'm curious what others say about treatment side effects. You are so right, this site is a blessing indeed..",

Story which is sweet and a bit funny.  Went to Safeway yesterday with mom and saw co-worker who had not seen me since I left work.  She had been on vacation and when she got back I was gone.  She is quite a bit younger then me (by over 20 years), hugged me an hugged me AND hugged me, kissed my cheek and almost crying and I was starting to cry because I wasn't expecting the emotion from her.  BUT she hugged me so hard, my mom was gently pushing her away because he was hurting me (not meaning or knowing it).  She squeezed the stuffings out of me!  But Ouch!  Now today I feel a bit more sore, but the hug and caring from her was was worth it. :) Prayers and hugs to all the rest of the May surgeries.  To be on the other side of the surgery has been a huge weight off my shoulders.  Keep us posted and share what is happening!  We are all with you!  ",

I hope I don't have the itchiness from the morphine, I tend to be a bit sensitive to medication. Melissa119, it is wonderful to hear that your tumor is smaller then they thought and your stage changed for the better.  Wonderful, just wonderful! It's so true that a little good news goes a long way with all of this.  I'm stage 2 and my tumor is 4.3 cm, with no node involvement, I pray it stays that way.   It's funny I find right now I'm not as worried about the surgery, as all the meds they will have me on.  Two years ago I got CDIFF (bad intestinal bacteria from taking an antibiotic), so I'm scared to death of getting it again.  It was horrible.  It made me quite sick for several months.  I'm taking probiotics and boosting up my system to handle the antibiotics and pain meds they will have me on. Praying, praying and keeping my fingers crossed! My mother arrives Sunday (mother's day which I thought was perfect) to help out for a few weeks.  She will be a huge help to me.  My boyfriend is also taking off several days off to be with me. I feel very blessed to have the support that I do.  You sometimes don't realize what is important to you, what is truly important in life and how much you love people, until something like this happens.  Its good to hear all the positive recovery stories...makes me feel more positive about mine on the 16th.  Yes, I'm very nervous, but to hear everyone and how they are doing helps a lot.  ",

I was proud of myself, I think I did pretty well.  The doctor said that they are still leaning towards benign, fibrocystic she called it, but they said we are not Pathologists and we will only know then. I saw a zoom this morning of the 2011 Mammo and the one last week and you can really see the difference between the two.  Most of the clustered calc's were not there last year and now bamm a bunch in one area.  There are definitely several tightly clustered white spots.  Icoupontosavmoney - thank you for your comment about Googling, it is really easy to do these days and I have been doing a bit much, momzr - I am hoping for less dense breasts after menopause as well.  I hope this will prove bengin and I can simply go for regular screenings to keep on top of them, but not necessarily have to worry about them.  Thanks to all for the input - glad the first stage is over, now just waiting.  They say between 3-5 days to hear back.  I'm now going to drink my Starbucks and just relax, try not to worry about something I cannot control.  ",

I was trying to find a thread for Chemo, no Chemo decision.  I have battled this decision for over a week and finally made my decision this weekend.  No Chemo.  I am 43 and was Dx'd with ILC in April.  Stage 2, grade 2, 3 cm tumor, node negative, ER+,PR+, Her2neu. Right sided mastectomy in May and after more findings in right breast after Pathology looked at it, I will be having left breast removed in very near future as precaution.   My Oncotype score came back 14.  Oncologist said after hormone therapy we are looking at 9.  Chemo would have only reduce by 2%.  My Oncology team, as well as an expert at UCSF they went consulted with, felt very comfortable if I chose no Chemo.  If we were looking at even a 5% reduction, my Oncologist said he'd be pushing it more in my case, but it is not.  I battled with it for awhile and finally felt that this was the best decision for me overall and with the backing of my doctors.  Too low risk reduction for the Chemo SE's and problems that could happen.  My system tends to be sensitive to meds and reactions.  Even though I am still a bit nervous and know the risk is always there, I feel good about my decision.   My thoughts and prayers to all ladies here!  We don't want to be here, but we will get through this, taking it one step at a time!  ",

You sound like a tough lady and I know that I will make it through too and each day wake up to face Mardi Gras in all it's glory.  I think when I wake up and realize my breast is gone, I will process and feel and move on.  I know I will still be me in heart and mind.. I'm pretty tough I think, just scared out of my mind right now.  The doctor said I will pretty much wake up numb on both sides and then once initial pain meds wear off, we'll see what I need.  I'm kind a whimp with pain, but I know they will drug me up accordingly...I found out yesterday that I will not be able to keep my nipple, the doctor says it's too risky with Invasive Lobular you can't risk it. That's okay, rather not take the chance.  ",

I find I'm talking about it more to friends and such, because I know I am reaching out for someone to give words of support.  Or maybe the more I talk it won't seem so scary.  Again, I've been through it already, but I'm still losing another body part!  I am having preventative on the left side now.  I feel thankful every day though that I am not losing an arm, a leg....etc... Nikstar, hang in there!  For my first surgery I was a wreck, but I also got a meditation CD to help me relax a bit (It was recommende to me on this site).  I kept saying calming things to myself before surgery and when they were wheeling me in.  It did help a bit.  I even took some anti-anxiety meds at the time ( still do actually).  Don't be afraid to get all the help you can get and deserve!  This is a HUGE weight and you need help.  I hope you have support around you and hugs.  We are here for you.  Come say whatever you need to and we are with you!! Thinking of Keke today with her surgery today....healing thoughts her way!  Butterflylady (Sharon)",

This morning was 100, went down again.  So hopefully I'm almost at the end of fever.  Sore and bruised of course.  Walking slowly through out house, haven't ventured outside yet, especially since i had the fever.  Probably tomorrow! Resting between the bed propped up, or our lounge chair in the sofa.  Foreverchanged, so sorry to hear about the nausea.  Poor girl! I was so thankful no nausea this time either.  I told them give me exactly what you did last time, which was a combination of several drugs.  For pain I'm taking something called Norco which worked for me last time and is doing pretty well this time.  I hope you get out of the hospital today!! It's such a good feeling to be released!! Mamasix, I can't believe doing this with young kids.  So glad food is being brough to you and you have the support you need.  A dear friend of mine cookd for us too, so my mom and boyfriend wouldn't have to think about that as much.  I really want a shower too, but my mom just used a warm wash cloth on my back, ect...it felt so good.   Thinking of everyone recovering at home, or in the hospital still.  Know we are with you in spirit!  One step at a time.  Keep us posted on how you are doing.  I'm so happy I only had one day in hospital...last time it was two.  So glad!  Okay, now back to resting in my lounge...

Means so much. Foreverchanged, when you told us about your exuberant son running into you, I so felt for you - that made me think of my last surgery, when I met a co-worker at Safeway about a week after my procedure.  I was still pretty sore and moving slowly, but needed food.  She hugged me so hard, several times...she's was sweet, but didn't realize what she was doing.  She about took the wind outta me and it hurt!  3Mom, you will be in my thoughts and prayers Monday.  What time is your surgery? I hope you are doing alright and know we are all with you. I can't speak of having a bilateral all at once, but I know each surgery I recuperated faster then I thought I would.  Give yourself time to heal and don't push yourself.  Let us know from hospital, or when you are up to it at home.  Butterflylady(Sharon)",
