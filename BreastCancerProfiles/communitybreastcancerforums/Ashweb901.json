The next concern is what your final path report says your tumors consist of. Are they in the same quadrant of your breast? Since yours are slightly different quadrants if they ar the same content, that's multifocal. If they are of different content, then it's multicentric. When there are multiples, based on how the cells look, sometimes the pathology will say IDC \u201cwith lobular features.\" Lobular breast Ca has distinct features.See the link I posted on this thread. The staging and risk of recurrence algorithms are based on the size of the biggest of your tumors. However, some researchers are questioning if this is accurate since if it's lobular features or even lobular cancer, those have proven more sneaky and don't always respond to the same treatment as ductal. Right now the standards have stayed the same: treat IDC with lobular features as IDC. That's may change if more studies are done. Not a doctor or a Nurse but I've had to play one bc Cancer!",
