I've had a clear u/s (found a lump) and I am waiting on the results from a screening but also diagnostic (focal point paddles) mammogram - that are due in tomorrow. I've had a new black spot on the front of my thigh that I've been watching for 6 months and it's changing and has all of the characteristics for the warning signs to watch for melanoma. I'm very freckly and I was a sun baby in my teens followed by a tanning salon tanner all through my twenties (terrible I know) I'll be seeing my g/p soon and asking for a referral to see a dermatologist to get it looked at. My Aunt on the maternal side first had melanoma followed by breast cancer and a double m. then it spread many years later. I'm not sure if she was diagnosed with the genetic mutations in the gene (it's slipping my mind now which gene) Does anyone have any thoughts or stories to share about this connection in your own personal stories?

I told myself that I wouldn't join any of these boards unless I got diagnosed but it's counter intuitive to my nature, so here I am. I am awaiting for an u/s of the left breast on Wed. April 15th. and ofcourse my g/p is out of town on vacation until the 22nd making me have to wait much longer for results than would be the norm. How long did you all wait between u/s, mammo and results? Can I ask them for any info on what they see at the u/s given that I have to wait? Will they say, it's a cyst if it is? Who told you that you had cancer? Your g/p, radiologist? I went to my G/P after about 3 months of wondering if I was pregnant from such tender breasts (although impossible, husband got a vasectomy after the 7 yo was born) that would come and go making me even say to my husband, I wonder if I'm pregnant!? I had a really bad itchy spot on my left breast that I chalked up to a hair or something stuck in my bra since it seemed to happen when I was always wearing 'that' bra, I've also had random stabbing pains in the same spot as the itching and tenderness up to my arm pit. I found a lump, where I am getting the random shooting pains. When I went to see my gp I also mentioned a large cyst mass type thing I have on the back of my leg ( I rarely go to the g/p except for annual stuff and I don't bring up random aches and pains)....well he reassured the heck out of me that it was a lipoma and scheduled an appointment with a surgeon. When he did the breast exam he didn't have much to say but upon a very quick exam he found a second lump in the same area. I wish I hadn't gone for the 2 lump issues because now I'm left concerned with the lack of reassurance that it was nothing to worry about. But I do understand that lumps are nothing to joke with and I'm glad he's sending me (despite the having pain myth because I didn't go for months because of thinking the same thing) He said it's standard procedure with breast lumps but said nothing about it feeling like a cyst. I'm trying not to read into every little ache and pain right now and I'm trying my darndest to not let my head go to that 'what if' and morbid thoughts 'IF I were to ever die.....' place. But there are random moments that bring tears to my eyes such as my husband rubbing my butt in the morning the other day in bed (like he always does..lol) and getting this uncontrollable instant quick thought that just popped into my head 'I don't want him to touch anyone else's butt, if I died I would'nt want him to touch another butt, but that's selfish, he's young...' and I get teary eyed. I'm not afraid of dying because I'm a fighter, but I'm sure as hell scared of the potential fight. Nothing like a breast lump to make you think long and hard about legacy and life. You women are warriors, keep up the fight. Thanks, Jennifer Log in to post a reply",
