I was diagnosed in October 2017 (very funny universe for it to be breast cancer awareness month...), have had neo adjutant 6 rounds TCHP and have a bilateral BMX with direct implant scheduled 4/11. I hope you don't mind if I post here in March. My question is, I have been told to schedule a 'very helpful' mastectomy class through Honor Health. The problem is, it is very inconvenient to me (and far away) to attend. Has anyone else been to a class like this? Is it worth the time and effort, or did you get all the info you needed at the surgery center? Are there any comparable tutorials online?",

I didn\u2019t have it quite as bad as you skin-wise, but going topless at home some of the time sure helped!",
