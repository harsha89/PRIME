I am wondering if it's possible to do this for years or if I am just in a happy short stage. Thanks for your thoughts on this!",

There are pictures of tape on arms - please know that my arm taping is not elaborate. While my PT showed me how she cut the strips at the end to go in different angles on my hand, I found that the ends began to peel off very soon. So now I simply use one of the KT strips without cutting it. It's a whole strip of KT tape that runs from my elbow to near my knuckles. The part on my hand peels after a few days so I cut that off with scissors and then wear a glove while the rest of the KT tape is still on my forearm. This weekend, I will start over with a new KT tape strip. I bought beige colored KT tape online from Amazon. I am looking forward to wearing it this summer with my sleeveless tops to work. It's much less noticeable than the sleeve (and the bright blue KT tape leftover from my daughter's knee taping for sports) If the above website doesn't answer all of your questions, there are quite a few more resources online.
