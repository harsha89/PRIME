SE's, heart monitors, ports, injections etc. Fortunately my treatment is over. My skin has healed and since I am ER/PR negative I do not have to take tamox. My energy has returned and is back to normal. My last rad treatment was 8 weeks ago. I did develop a frozen shoulder that I am getting PT for. I am an Occupational Therapist so I am not sure how I let this happen. I stretched everyday but it got ahead of me and finally saw an Ortho who injected cortisone and recomended PT. It is quite painful but I have regained some ROM in the shoulder. I have a long way to go. I have no follow up with my rad onc. He was a jerk and said \"don't need to see you anymore\". My oncologist is wonderful and will follow me every 3 months for a couple years. I am having the BRCA genetic testing done next month since I am the 3rd generation of BC. I Just found out my 30 year old cousin was diagnosed with BC last month.I have recommended this web site for support as you all have given me much support over the past 5 months. Even though I don't write much, I continue to read daily and hope you all are doing better. Quinnie",

But my breast surgeon made it quite clear to wait 6 months after radiation before having a mamo. I am sure there are multiple things to consider when making the decision as to when to have the first mamo after radiation such as diagnosis, size, treatment, grade etc.It is interesting to see what others are doing. I am already a little nervous about the first mamo as I am still sore from the lumpectomy and radiation and was glad to hear yours wasn't too bad. When I do have the mamo I have an appointment with my breast surgeon immediately following and carry the film over to her office, so no wiating.I was very relieved to see that they routinely do this for those who have history of BC. Hopefully yours will be good. Take care, Quinnie",

I have never had to wait and they are so friendly and respectful. Have never had any blood work but the RAD ONC did say I will need a bone density test once this is over. I am 51 and have never had one so is probably a good thing to have anyway.  I did find aloe at Wallgreens and use it along with cortisone for the itching and it really has helped.  My Rad journey is almost over and I actually have mixed feelings.

You can purchase it at any pharmacy like Wallgreens or Rite Aid. \"Tom's of Maine\" is a herbal deodorant they said we can use.
