Kate, I agree, I was so sick of the Aquaphor....I ordered another tube of Miaderm because it really helps me heal so much faster...and no wet tee shirts .and sloppy towels ( had to add oxiclean) to the laundry to get it out of the shirts and towels...just messy stuff and the Miaderm has so many good healing qualities in it....for me it is much better using 3 times a day and what a difference... Marijen, Im ready for the body transplant ! I laughed out loud when I read it.... So as JerseyGirl2 says \"Warrior On\" this has been stuck in my head from the first time I read it...the song \"I am the Warrior\" came on the radio the other day in my car and I sang it at the top of my lungs...
