I have a pretty high tolerance for pain and pray that it will kick in high gear once all is said and done. The scariest part are the drugs, I hate any type of drug, when I had my c-sections i refused the pain meds and asked for tylenol/ibuprophen. I hope I can do that this time but i don't know..... I will keep praying and hoping for the best. My faith will see me through and this too shall pass. Wishing you all a speedy recovery and many many blessings to all :-) StayStrong1",

Well, my bilatteral mastectomy is schedued for Saturday, Sept. 29 and I must admit I am strating to get nervous! I'm nervous about the actual surgery, being under general anesthesia, waking up???? I've had 2 c-sections but that is local and just thinking about my body being lifeless on a table is insanely scary. Then comes the part of testing the lymph nodes..... Can anyone tell me what to expect once I wake up in recovery? Will I know about my lymph nodes immediately? I know they still will send them to pathology regardless of the outcome. Im stage 1 and my Dr. said that on the MRI my nodes look fine and clinically they seem fine but he says that we cannot be 100% sure untill the surgery. That is what is so crazy about all of this, it's constantly changing and nothing is in stone! I have been very strong since my diagnosis on July 31 but since it's around the corner i am getting scared...... Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated. I wish everyone who reads this post nothing but the best on your journey in life. God Bless you, StayStrong1 Log in to post a reply",

People from across the country and the world fly to come  see my Oncologist, he is a true humanitarian and the gentlest, most compassionate man :-) I am very lucky!! Thank you for your words. It sounds like you had a pretty good experience considering. Like I've mentioned before, I DO NOT like pain meds. I dislike the feeling of being \"high\" or loopy, LOL..... I am hanging on to my faith in the Lord and praying almost all day for that strength and peace that only He can give me. I see this as a test, a test of my faith and I will def. be a different person because of this. There is a plan for my life and i am going to fulfill it. I am going to see my boys turn into growm men and much, much more! Thank you so much for answering back, I will pray for your speedy recovery and for your health to be restored!!!

I am facing a double mastectomy in the very near future; I am guessing around Sept. and at first I was in total shock and disbelief. As the weeks have passed and reading such positive words from women such as yourself, my decision is firm. I want to and HAVE to live for my two boys (5 and 2), my husband and for ME!!! May God bless you throughout your life and may you always be an inspiration and continuosly touch the lives of others (as you've touched mine) wherever you may go. Many Blessings StayStrong1",

God sends Angels to us in many ways and you are def. one of them. Even if it is through a computer ;-) We never know how or when we are going to be a blessing to another person and sometimes it happens in the most unexpected ways. I will update you on my surgery date as I am still in the testing process. My MRI lit up another area in the same breast and I am having a targeted ultrasound this coming Thursday. My Dr. said it lit up slightly and not the way an actual tumor lights up so he thinks it just may be my busy boobies (as they call them) but he wants to be 100% sure. I wish you a fast and successful recovery although you sound like you are doing fantastic!!!! Yay, I am so happy that everything is progressing positively. Speaking of positivity, stay positive. That is what will get us ALL through this and hang on to your faith, whatever it may be cause faith can move mountains and I know we are going to be just fine!!!

I am 19years old, My mother is 56years old, she was diagnosed with Breast Cancer in May 2010 of the left breast, they couldn't tell her a stage (and I'm still not sure why), with her they did things a little different. They said they were going to try and shrink the tumor as much as possible before removing it. They did 12 weeks of chemotherapy (not sure which one they only used the word most aggressive every time we were there), she then did 6 weeks of radiation, with the time in between and the wait on surgery they operated and successfully removed the whole tumor through a Full Mastectomy including removal of lymph nodes from under the left arm in Mid December 2010. They then did tests and confirmed they had got the tumor, this was suppose to be the day where everything would get better and go back to normal, not the case, the doctor added the bad news on Christmas Eve may I add, the cancer had spread to her bones. The doctor now classified the cancer as Stage IV Metastatic Breast Cancer.He said her expectancy is 12months to 36months. She has been on Zometa once a month through a port they have placed in her chest, they say this will not help with the cancer but will reduce breakages and pain. Now it is 20months later and she has been well up until now, working, eating, sleeping. The family have been supportive and positive. However, last month when she went for her Zometa they said they are worried about her weight loss (8Kg in a month) she says its from eating well and going to the gym, she weighs 65kg, from there for the past two weeks she has been having sharp pain in her right hand side near the rib cage at the back (very bad, she won't ever mention pain unless it's absolutely terrible) she has been crying it's so bad, she has days where she doesn't feel like eating, she physically can't hide the pain its obvious she is hurting and it's getting worse, she gets very frazzled, she is very tired and lethargic and says she doesn't feel right, she also has these fits of laughter out of nowhere (I'm happy if she is just being happy but this is very random and worries me). But, she won't go to the hospital, she says there is nothing they can do anyway and she doesn't want people prodding anymore, she wants to be at home. She has a CT scan at the end of the month as she does every three months, I'm worried this has something to do with her liver ( I really hope not but the doctor warned us about this). My questions are: Does this sound like her liver? If it does what would that mean? Is her downward progression alarming as it is happening so quick? Any other advise would be great, thank-you in advance. Sorry for the long passage, I needed to vent I will worry about this all month and I can't worry to her she says I am her rock (she is divorced)so she needs me to be strong, It is so sad this happens to people with no reason why, I pray for each and every person going through this battle, so strong and couragious. P.s.I am not intending to be negative I hope this has a positive outcome but the worry isstrong. I send her positive rainbows everyday. Thank-you again, My heart goes out to you, Love and respect. Rainbows of strength to all",
