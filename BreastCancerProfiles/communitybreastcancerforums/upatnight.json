I have a recent clinical Shingles diagnosis and am awaiting confirmation via blood test, but I am confident in the diagnosis because I also have a small rash area on my spine and am experiencing significant spine pain in addition to the rash on my breast. I am desperate to know if those having had the Shingles rash on the breast before might have experienced: - breast:  slightly swollen, itches in random places other than area of Shingles rash - nipple:  sore, I-want-to-rip-it-off itchy, & needle sticks - slight chicken skin (not dimples of any type) near the breast rash As you know, many of these are symptoms of breast cancer.  Viral meds and Antibiotics are not clearing these 'other' symptoms that are a stretch for Shingles. I know the Shingles covers the rash and the rash itch.  But could it also be the cause for the swollen breast, itching on other parts of the breast, and very unahppy nipple?  My primary care says \"yes\" and I don't see my breast care specialist again for 3 days.  I saw her 4 days ago with normal mammo, normal ultra-s, she said it looked like \"hives\" because it was a fresh rash at that point, not like IBC but could not rule it out, acknowledged the breast looked like \"something was definitely up\", and we started antibiotics.  I long to find someone who can tell me YES Shingles can cause itching other than the area of the rash, swelling of the breast, and the nipple issues (I guess due to the way the nerves work.)  Worrying about an underlying breast cancer that may have triggered the Shingles is absorbing me. Order of symptons; itchy breast and nipple first; then slightly swollen, heavy breast; a few days later bug bites appeared which turned into a Shingles rash that never had blisters. Again, I am desperate to know if anyone can confirm that the Shingles rash can cause: Itching away from the rash (both breast and nipple), swollen breast, chicken skin near rash site Thank you from the bottom of my heart!  I have been unable to find a Shingles blog like this one which is so wonderful!!!  Log in to post a reply",
