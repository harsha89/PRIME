Before she started chemo a significant reductin in size in the mediastinal lymph nodes was clear in ct scan. I asked the DR he said it could be prayer. After 3 cycles of chemo and Avastin the cat scan also showed no evidance of metastatic breast cancer. What does this mean? My wife really thinks there was a mistake in the pathology biobsy which is rare. She had pnumonia for more than a month and she thinks that is the cause for the size growth. kindly also I do not know weather I should tell her how serious his case is or let her keep her positive thinking.
