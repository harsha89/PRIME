It was a long night finally telling my family the news and what I've been going through and having to say \"I have breast cancer\" to my children. I did all I could to reassure them how early it was caught and I'll be just fine blah blah blah but my 14 yr old son took the news badly - as I knew he would - and shortly after I told him I found him sitting alone in the backyard in the dark crying.",

I was originally scheduled for sentinel node biopsy also but I cancelled that portion of the surgery. Initially I'd insisted on the SNB being done along with the LX even though my surgeon actually said it wasn't necessary. With the amazing information from this site and my own research I realized I wanted the SNB simply because I was afraid and didn't have all the facts needed to make the right decision. I'm so grateful now to not have to endure an unnecessary surgery with possible life long side effects to say the least. If it turns out I NEED the SNB next month or next year or 10 years from now well so be it.",
