      "Content": "chessiegirl wrote: I completed my radiation treatments two weeks ago.  I now seem to have an infection that my oncologist has never seen before!!  It started as a large (size of a 50-cent piece) red, hard spot under my left arm.  Then, smaller spots (filled with blood and pus) started forming under that arm, spread across my stomach, and under the other arm (which was not treated).  The oncologist thinks it may be a secondary effect of the rads, or it might be an infection of the lymphatic system.  For now, I am on antibiotics; if they don't help, I'll see a dermatologist and maybe my surgeon. Have any of you ever experienced such a side effect?  Log in to post a reply",

This is very scary to me, as I don't know what symptoms are side effects and which ones are not.",
