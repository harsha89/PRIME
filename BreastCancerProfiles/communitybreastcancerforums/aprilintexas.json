But in the last couple of weeks I've noticed a pad of skin near the top of my arm that feels sort of... tough? leathery? thick? almost hard? It's not a very big area, maybe one or two inches square, and it's hard to describe what I even feel there, except that it feels different from the surrounding areas somehow. It is pretty much right where the top of my sleeve hits. I remember skin hardening as being one of the bad things that can happen with LE... does it sound like that is what's happening here? if so, what can be done about it?  In other news, I spent last week battling a cellulitis occurence right in the middle of my back. Luckily the meds seem to have taken care of it and I'm on the mend. But the combination of these events has me feeling less confident about how well I'm managing my LE after all.  April in Texas Log in to post a reply",

Maybe I haven't been so consistent lately? Anyway, there is a spot on my back that is pink and painful. I have lost about five pounds: could my garments need to be adjusted already? I assumed I would have to lose more before that became an issue. The weird thing is, I have all these appliances and garments and still don't know who to turn to for help in this situation: is my FlexiTouch not getting the right spots, and if so, do I call the person who trained me? Do I call my PT? Do I go see the fitter and see what she says? Do I just buy a Swell Spot and stick it on there and see what happens? do other people have spots that come and go? Do you have to give extra attention for awhile, or is there something you do that causes the flare-ups? I hate it when I think I have something under control and then it slips away from me!

      "Content": "aprilintexas wrote: So I got my custom made compression vest today and it certainly is a sturdy, well-made garment. I have been wearing \"support\" camisoles (my favorite is the Flexees), which have been helping a lot, but I could tell from just a few hours in the vest that it offers better compression and will really keep the swelling under control.   The problem is that it's hideous! I got the lowest cut neckline available, but it is still high-necked (probably a bit lower than a crew neck t-shirt, which I don't wear) with a very heavy duty zipper right up the front. It looks like something that would have been made of wool and worn by professional football players 100 years ago. I think I look like the inmate of a sanitarium with it on, and I don't own ANY clothes that it will not be visible under. Since my bilateral mastectomy with no reconstruction, I have spent a lot of time trying to get comfortable with my new body and finding clothes that I can wear flat-chested and not feel totally defeminized. This vest challenges that at a whole new level and I'm just not sure how to cope. I spent some time this evening crying about it but know that I want to feel my best and not have the swelling, pain, and worry of the truncal LE. I just wonder how others cope... is anyone else wearing a contraption like this everyday?  Also, I am stumped by how to care for this thing and what to do about the heat this summer. I wash my sleeve/gauntlet/bandages/camisoles by hand in the bathroom sink and hang them to try in the shower. I don't think the bathroom sink is going to be big enough to wash the vest, so that complicates things. Obviously I need at least two of these things, since the heavy fabric feels like it will take more than overnight to dry. Do I need a third one to wear to the gym? The fitter at the shop thought insurance would cover two, but I can't imagine they would cover three. Is it possible to wear a silk undershirt or something underneath the vest so I could wash the vest less often? I live in Texas and have a young child so I spend a good deal of time outside in hot weather. What am I going to do? Anybody else in this situation? I would love to know how you cope with it. Right now I feel like hiding at home but it's not a realistic option. I am mortified by the thought of wearing this thing out in public but obviously my health is more important than my pride.  Does anyone know if I can decorate it in any way? What would I use that would be safe for the fabric? Fabric paint? Sharpie markers? I'm guessing I can't do any embroidery or sew on any trims or anything....  Thanks for any advice, sympathy, or whatever.  April in Texas Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "aprilintexas wrote: I got my flexitouch las week but didn't even take it out of the box until the therapist/trainer came this evening to set me up. Did my first treatment tonight though I have been changing my schedule around so that I now get up early in the morning to have time to do the flexitouch before my family gets up and starts needing things from me. I am grateful to have this machine and so glad that insurance paid for it, but I am a bit intimidated! How do you all manage this stuff? I mean, how do you manage the actual stuff? The trainer said a lot of people get a cart to keep the pump and garments on; they can't be bent so they take up a lot of room. I thought I would do it in my recliner, so that I could be very reclined though not fully reclined, and still watch a movie... I tried that but it's challenging and not that comfortable. Also, my right side is the affected side but the handle that controls the recliner is also on the right side, so that doesn't really work.... Maybe the couch would be a better choice?  I have also been sleeping in my new Tribute/Solaris vest and sleeve combo... they seem to be hot flash magnets but other than that they are pretty great! Wrapping my arm took at least 20 minutes every night so just slipping on the sleeve is so much better, and I can move my arm more.... the night vest is making it less necessary for me to wear the other vest during the day... I am now wearing it only once or twice a week instead of every second or third day. I am hoping the flexitouch will allow me more freedom during the daytime as well...  I'm sure it will take me some time to figure out how to manage all this. Any helpful tips would be greatly appreciated.  Hope all are well, April in Texas  Log in to post a reply",
