I've been on estrogen, not AI's anymore, for one week today. I haven't noticed anything except 2 days ago I was dizzy, sat down and was fine, and some nausia and very tired. Fine the next day. Called the dr and she said none of that was due to estrogen, but I did see that as se's on the paper that came with the pills. I also asked if estrogen was to make it so AI's would work again and she said no. They are looking for the estrogen to shrink the tumors. If the tumors don't shrink on the estrogen, then to chemo. My cancer is lobular and I think somewhere I read years ago that chemo doesn't work too well on lobular. I don't know how true this is. Anyhow, thanks for listening. Love and Prayers, Marsha",

We called 911 and went to our local emergency room who was in direct communication with mom's oncologist in Indianapolis, who was miraculously on call for the weekend. We took an ambulance to the IU Simon Cancer Center where Mom was under her oncologist's direct care. Ultimately the liver was failing - after 10 years it could not take any more. On July 6 the doctor told Mom she would be going home to hospice. We left the hospital on July 7. Mom was surrounded by family and friends for the 10 days we had at home, and remained strong and independent until the end. I know all the ladies I am writing to here meant so much to my Mom. You gave her strength. You were a refuge, a place she shared fears she did not share with us. She would tell me about how strong and positive everyone was. She loved reading the posts, especially in the middle of the night - you kept her company. Thank you for being there for my mom. Keep fighting! We all have an extra angel looking out for us now!

A rare condition that creates scar tissue from the dead tumors from the chemo being successful. The chemo was over aggressive in my case thus, (thus?! I never say thus) producing more scars and causing more side effects. So she put me on half the adryamicin and every 2 weeks. I can't beileve this happened. SHe thinks it might work. It sounds far from \"out of options\" but she did say we could be back in the same place in two weeks. Thank you so much for you info, and caring. Love and prayers. Marsha I'm not sure i understand all this but but I did get chemo today: )",

I have been on adriomicin for almost a year and only just now getting the mouth sores and they hit hard. None of the usual remidies worked. I have a friend who is a nurse and she told me to try this borax. Three tiny pills under the tongue. I'm telling you I think it's working. I'm very surprised and want to say it is something else, like my week off. I haven't told my onc which is probably dumb so I have no idea what she would think. Hmmm, get rid of mouth sores and remove stains from your clothes in one fell swoop. Don't know what I think of all that! Love and prayers, marsha",
