I am so lucky to have doctors that listen to my fears, and have worked with me.   I have a tissue expander in also.  It's currently nicely expanded and everything on that is on hold until the chemo part is over.",

My nausea is worse this time also, taking Emend, Compazine and one other med for it..... ::sigh::   I've been working on trying to stay upbeat.  Thank you to our thread for helping!   ",

      "Content": "Apr 11, 2008 07:23AM - edited Apr 11, 2008 07:28AM by Di53 My third adriamycin was rough coming out of... felt better Tuesday this week and good on Wednesday and Thursday was round 4 of adriamycin... (my last chemo day I figured out will be September 18th) 2 more rounds to go.  This round I had a backache, the abdominal cramps and the need for sleep! I also had watched Diane Sawyer on Wednesday night with Randy Pausch.  What a show! Made me appreciate all the good that I have in my life, including you all.  Invisible faces we may be, we all have concern and care about everyone in our thread.  If you have 106 minutes, do a google search for \"The Last Lecture\" and watch it, he has cancer, and his outlook on life is amazing! The google version of his speech is the whole one including introductions.  The YouTube one is only missing those. Happy Friday!!  Hopefully we all will have a great weekend, and a touch of sunshine  somehow!  (I'm getting rain/snow.. so my sunshine will be in some other special way!)   Prayers and caring from me come your way!  ",
