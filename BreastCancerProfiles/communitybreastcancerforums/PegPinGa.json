I drove myself to the biopsy and I had a Birad 4 pleomorphic cluster of calcifications that were benign. Put the ice pack they give you in your bra and if you have pain, take some Tylenol. It really is more scary sounding than it actually is. So glad that you were able to get in so soon instead of having to wait. The waiting is the hardest part. Hugs to you and keep us posted on your results, we're all here to support you!",
