They must have really blasted those nodes though.  Are your lumps lymph nodes? Mine were also in the soft tissue.  I had Caelyx chemo last year (a targeted form of Adriamycn) and it shrank them down though.  Now, I have no visible lumps, my skin is not prickly and hot and red anymore, and I have less plural effusion.

I had AC when initially dx 10 yrs ago, and now they have improved the Adriamycin to be more targeted with less side effects. I had Caelyx 2 yrs ago and kept my hair, didnt feel very nauseus and was only moderately tired. It's still red, btw. and it might give you better results. good luck! I also had horrible se's on Paclitaxel (heart effusions). ps: I've been on the Xeloda now for 6 months and it might be starting to fail. Test results on Tuesday. since I've already done Caelyx, I have no idea what's next. maybe Navelbine ?  hugs & hope for you.",

I feel that and I get pretty emotional too.  Is that depression?  I seem to hone in on the commercials on tv about depression lately.  Is my subconsious telling me something? Anyway, why not schedule a nice massage on your 3 day off Xeloda each cycle - it will give you something to look forward to and settle your nerves. I do reiki/healing touch every week.

I've been on chemo more or less straight for 2.5 yrs now. Before that I was very fortunate that hormonals kept things fairly stable. now i wonder, how fast do they develop new drugs? and am i progressing at the same rate, or faster? I feel like I will never stop taking chemo and that's probably my reality. I know eventually my body will not be able to handle all the se's, as well as manage to keep fighting the cancer. But I will not give up on myself. My body may fail, but my spirit will keep soaring. ",

It is so much better when we can think clearly, right?! I must tell you that when I was dx as stage IV, at 31, I too wanted to have children still. Most days even now, I wish I had kids. I was never given the opportunity to gather eggs or have them frozen, or whatever the procedure is. The dr's just wanted to rush and get going on new tx. And becoz the cancer is ER+, that means hormone tx for sure. They put me into medical menopause, and it would be impossible now to get any eggs becoz I'd have to come off the drugs to do so. (and chance advancing the cancer, no way!) Basically, I'm saying, that 10 yrs down the road I sure wish I had done that. So really search your heart and think about what a full happy life means to you. Adoption can be very difficult, maybe impossible, when you are dx as stage IV. There are other threads here that address that. And know that the possibility of living another 5, 10, 15, 20 yrs is very real. Long enough to raise happy, healthy kids? Besides, another 10 yrs will bring many more tx for BC for sure! My doc's said, we're not worried about a future life, we're concentrating on saving yours. Well...that scared the crap out of me. But now, in hindsight, my advice would be to make them give you ALL of your options. good luck with everything, hugs & hope",
