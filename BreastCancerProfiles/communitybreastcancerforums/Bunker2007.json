Fortunately, I think they docs will be taking it out soon. We have not had to drain her in a week and the last time we did it was not enough to measure. I really think it is the Havalen that is helping with the lungs mets and reducing the swelling and inflammation. Here's hoping anyway!",

As along as we are the book ideas: there is a book about Alzheimer's patience and their travels through each stage of dementia. It is called \"Moments of Joy\" by Jolene Brackley. This is the best book ever and I feel that it is a good book for any caregiver and puts things in perspective. It is an incredibly easy read! I about read the whole thing in an evening.

In my line of work (I'm an Occupational Therapist), resting is a part of energy conservation. I would recommend it for all of us whether you are a cancer surviver or a caregiver.

The fortunate thing for women who have stage IV breast cancer is that there are many drugs and or coctails the onc's can put together to put the disease in remission, put the disease in check, make the disease tolerable.  Some statistics are claiming that breast cancer is well on its way of being a disease that is manageable like diabetes and heart disease.  So what I am saying in a nutshell is that if one thing fails, there is another one to try.  Research and the FDA are finding and approving chemo drugs more now than 10 even 15 years ago.  This is exciting because the quality of life may become better. I want to stress something to you guys, I am a caregiver.  I do not have cancer. I have no idea what it is like to face the challenges you women face on a daily basis.  But I have found that stage IV women are the strongest women I have ever been around. The mental and physical anguish you experience is humbliing to people like me. My best advice is not to read everything in the world on the internet.  It is a valuable resource, but by no means is it the end all be all on servival rates.",

There are so many things to do and I had no idea how difficult this was going to be. Robin passed away yesterday morning at about 11:40 in the morning. The lungs mets were more severe than either one of us imagined and her body was just too weak to take the treatment. She had treatment on Tuesday and on Wednesday she was in the hospital and on a ventilator. Thursday it became obvious that Robin's fight with cancer was not a winning one and I called in Hospice Thursday night. We took her off the vent Friday morning at 11:30 and she was gone in about 10 minutes. Her body was ready... My heart aches...the tears have fallen for days...sleep is rare...and eating is nearly impossible. I had no idea how painful this was going to be. I am not sure what I thought this was going to be, but I'm struggling none the same. Those of you at are in the Austin Texas area there will be an obituary in tomorrows paper telling of the services. I will post agin soon. Love to all, Donese",

It just what needed to happen and the radiation did work for the areas that were rediated. Please remember that Robin had a particularly aggressive cancer and it was diagnosed fairly late (3b) and it just took over her body.  She nor the docs could get ahead of the curve, but that in no way says that is what will happen for you. This disease affects people differently.  Keep in mind that my Robin was African American and most African American's don't fair well with cancer or its treatment.  It is a genetic thing.  I might have said too much and now have scared the hell out of you, and if I have I am sorry, just know that you are doing well and things will work out for you with treatment.",

She went to a pulmonologist yesterday and the doc thinks that Robin's breathing issues are both allergy and asthma induced.  Robin had both really bad when she was a child and the pulmonologist feels that because Robin's compromised due to the chemo, her body can't fight the crud off. The doc gave Robin some inhalers and a nose spray to help with the breathing. Although she has only been on the medication 24 hours, she is feeling some relief and does not feel as winded. We are both happy that it is not the cancer settling in again. The Halaven so far is working and the lung mets are down.  She has a MRI in April to see what the status is...we are both praying...I really think the Halaven is doing the trick.",

I am not sure if you have access to a pool but it is easy on the joints but also helps with tone, flexibility, and heart rate. It does help with movment in general.  Even just 10-20 minutes is worth it.  But what every form you choose, listen to your body and if it hurts stop...if it feel good continue.  Pretty simple Donese",
