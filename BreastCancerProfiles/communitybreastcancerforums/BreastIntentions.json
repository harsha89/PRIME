    "Content": "BreastIntentions wrote: Hi, I have had a swollen lymph node (right subclavicular) for about three months. When it hadn't dissapeared after the first two months I went to the breast clinic and they referred me for a mammogram. At the breast clinic and before the mammogram no other lumps were detected in the breast. The doctor decided best to have a mammogram, sonar and biopsy of the lymph as a precaution since both my paternal gran and aunt have had breast cancer. The mammogram was clear except for the subclaviclar swollen lymph. The sonar however showed a second lymph in the axilla, both measuring about 1.7cm x 0.9 cm. A third smaller lesion measuring 0.5 x 0.4cm was identified in the right upper outer quadrant. Left side clear. Was given Birads 4AB. So I guess nothing else to do except wait for the biopsy results (expect those in 2 weeks time, state hospital South Africa, these things take a while). I have found over the last two weeks that I have increased upper back pain and a feeling of \"pressure\" around my ribs, sometimes they feel bruised....also seem to be getting a bout of thrush, not sure if any of this is related. I have found this site to be very informative, thank you all for sharing your experiences. Surgery 2/13/2018 Lumpectomy: Right Log in to post a reply",
