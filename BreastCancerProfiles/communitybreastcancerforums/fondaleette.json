Right now our father is in the hospital, I think he is nearing the end to his fight with lung cancer. About a year before Moms diagnosis of ibc my sister was diagnosed with the traditional bc with metastasis to the bones. She had masectomy, chemo and radiation...then treatment with Zometa and Arimidex. we fear she is having a recurrence but fear even more that is back in the form of ibc. There is a mass on her neck just above the collarbone and lump in the armpit. Biopsies are scheduled for May 2nd...in the meantime we await results from biopsies on two 'suspicious' areas in her stomach. Along with her neck and armpit areas she said her remaining breast has decreased in size, a rare symptom to ibc but a symptom nonetheless. We were just wondering...has anyone ever heard of or experienced a recurrence from bc to ibc? Log in to post a reply",
