I have a call into a MLD therapist to make an app't., probably talk w/tomorrow. However, are there some safe things I can do before my med treatments starts?? I know to elevate, stop certain drinks/foods, etc. But, any advice would help. In July 07 I will have been dx one year. Had chemo, mastectomy, radiation (last in march), and phys. therapy to regain movement in arm. Now, whether it's coincidental or not, I just came back from short 4 day trip to Salt Lake City (mile hi city, too) via to/from airflight, from Alabama. I am not sure that \"caused\" it since I have other risk factors, but won't go without a sleeve on planes from now on, although there are conflicting stories about usage before you have symptoms.?? Couldn't get sleeve in time for impromptu flight. Ok, thanks for listening, I appreciate your first hand knowledge!! Love, debbie Log in to post a reply",

Hate \"wasting\" time and they didn't call me back yet. Probably they are booked pretty much and may take time to get in. I'm more positive now that I've had a few days to think about it. It's odd, I feel like I have beaten cancer, but lymphedema has no cure. And a hassle since I live in Fla where it's hot, I love to garden,etc. But, I'm very blessed that I can get treatment, have ins. and it's my non-dominate arm. Just got to be positive and seek solutions. THANKS for the help and wishes. All the best to you and yours as well ! deb in fla.",
