She had been diagnosed with breast cancer (ER+/PR+, HER2-) four and half years back. She had an NED status until September when this disease reoccurred at the worst possible place in her body. Surgery is not possible and her doctors think chemotherapy is a better option than WBRT(Radiation). She has floating cancer cells - no tumors. Her tumor markers (CA 15-3) were on border when the relapse of the disease was diagnosed. MRI scan and Lumbar puncture confirmed the presence of cancerous cells in the Leptomeninges. Symptoms like Veritgo/Migraine like headaches have been there since April this year. Body balancing issues have been there since one year. She also had cataract operation of both her eyes last year - dunno if the cataract had any connection with the disease? She had been treated with Intrathecal Methotraxate (MTX) alone initially and later on Xeloda was added to her treatment. She has completed 12 doses of MTX and two cycles of Xeloda till now. Initially, MTX took a tool on her body. She had to be hospitalized after her first MTX dose because of seizure like instances and dehydration due frequent vomiting and loose motion. The seizure like events were very frightening for us to deal with. I had never seen my mom in such a state! Seizures and other side effects(vomiting and loose motion) of MTX were brought under control through medication. After her sixth dose of MTX, Xeloda (Two weeks On and One week Off) was added to her treatment. Xeloda has caused a lot of water retention in her body, minor hair loss, frequent urination, anxiety, sleepiness, few black patches on her skin and loads of cough. Other than that she hasn't had adverse side effects of Xeloda like the hand-foot syndrome till now. During her one week break she has recovered well and she feels good as well as she is good spirit. She has started her third cycle of Xeloda today- 1500 mg twice a day. Recently she has started complaining of double vision. Also, she feels weak and tired after doing any activity. She also sometimes complains of feeling of emptiness in her head - as if nothing is there inside her brain and also complains of cramps which start from her brain and go down to her hand and spine. She also complains having trouble with concentration and focus. She is unable to meditate. She does her yoga exercises though. Other than that she has been doing fairly well. Her body balancing issues are gone, her Veritgo/Migraine like headaches have gone, vomiting has stopped completely...all the initial symptoms seem to have been brought under control. Overall she feels good and is in good spirits. Does this also mean that the disease is under control and it has not progressed? We have done three more lumbar puncture tests or the CSF Cytology tests in the last two and half months, unfortunately the cancer cells are still there in her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Are there any tests through which we can do a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of the treatment given to her - like a before & after study??? Is there any way to find out the exact number of floating cancer cells in her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). What kind of tests does your doctors ask you to do? Is anyone getting medication to reduce the long term toxicity of Intrathecal Methotraxate (MTX) or Xeloda?? Is anyone using Cannabis to treat their brain mets? Is it effective? Apologies for the long post:)",

      "Content": "Jun 6, 2018 10:54AM - edited Jun 6, 2018 10:58AM by Priyank123 Hi guys, I would like to inform you that my mom has completed almost 3 yrs since she first experienced migraine type of headaches and later on was diagnosed with the crazy leptomeningeal Mets. I was totally clueless and super afraid at tht time but posts by Mandymoo and Agness were a real source of inspiration for me as well as I came to know about xeloda from here and it has worked miraculous well along with intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX) for my mom. She is completely living a normal life but with the usual side effects of the medicines. Also she has almost lost eye sight in one of her eyes coz drying of some nerves but it's not gone completely. She is doing fine and she is scheduled to undergo her yearly brain scan this month. She is disease free in rest of the body. Seeing her nobody would ever know that she has these deadly Mets in her body. She gets one injection of IT MTX a month and is on Xeloda two weeks on and two weeks off. We try to give her more time to recover if the side effects are severe before starting the next dose of Xeloda and IT MTX",
