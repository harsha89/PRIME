      "Content": "mcdds wrote: My husband and I are taking a trip to Hawaii in December for our 25th anniversary. It will be about an 8 or 9 hour flight. I haven't had any problems with lymphedema so far but I don't want to either. Surgery was in Feb 05 and I had 5 lymph nodes removed. When I asked my oncologist about it, he said he didn't think it would be necessary but I could wrap my arm in an ace bandage if I wanted too. I plan to ask my surgeon when I see him next month to see what he says. Guess my question is - what do you girls think? Should I insist on a sleeve or just ace bandage it? How do you wrap it?
