I have learned a lot from reading on here. I am at 13 of 33 rads. The 33 rads do include 8 boosts. I am doing good overall. No skin issues yet. I am nervous for treatment over the next few weeks. It will start including 2 boost a week. I have had 1 boost so far. And I had no energy left after that one. I hope the rest goes better than the 1st.",
