    "Content": "DCMomof2 wrote: Hi all, I'm 42 and got called back for additional views after my second ever mammogram. New \"faint loosely grouped calcifications that are benign in appearance\" in my \"extremely dense breast\" was reported in my left breast. BIRADS 3A and six month repeat to \"document stability\" was ordered. Unrelated, 20 years ago I was diagnosed with a right fibroadenoma by ultrasound and about 4 years later another doctor recommended biopsy which I had and it was confirmed. My question is since these calcifications are new (and presumably evolving), even if benign, aren't they likely to change in six months and cause some more anxiety? How often do new calcifications not change after six months? Is a second opinion from a breast surgeon overkill? I have no known family history of BC. Any insight appreciated! Thank you!
