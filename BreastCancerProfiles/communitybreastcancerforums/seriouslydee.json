    "Content": "seriouslydee wrote: Hi all, I had a mammo in February, followed by ultrasound, followed by more 3d mammo pics, then finally cyst aspiration and another mammo. Apparently my cyst was hiding microcalcifications. The radiologist gave it a BIRADS 4b and tried to call my doctor that night to discuss. She gave it about a 40% chance of being cancer, likely DCIS. I finally got a call for the biopsy and it is not until April 12th (which is apparently a fast track appointment from the radiology centre). My doc tried other hospitals but because I already have a referral, they won't take me. ðŸ˜• My worry is -- how fast can this grow if it's DCIS or something else? I already feel changes in that breast sincethe mammo (but I am kinda cysty) and I am alternating between calm anticipation and freaking out! I can Google no more. I need people on this one. Anyone have a similar story? Thoughts? Impressions? Advice? Thanks, Dee Dx 4/9/2018, DCIS, Right, 1cm, Stage 0, Grade 2 Log in to post a reply",
