I tried chemo had adverse reactions so then decided to do radiation only. Well now I am wondering is the skin problems I am having normal or is it feeding skin cancer. Under my breast I have a lot of moisture that started itchy and raw. Now the skin is starting to pill and blistered. I have an area of pink fleshy skin, not big but burns like hell and itches. The doctor said it will heal because I am getting booster radiation at the tumor site and not that area. The doctor also gave me a crème to put on to try to heal it but it burns worse. Is this normal ladies, I am scared to think that this is skin cancer starting. Any advice would be so appreciated. I have been on this journey since December and my nerves are getting thin don't know how much more I can tolerate.

There is no extreme redness or dryness. I have been using cocoa butter with vitamin e but I think I saw a post that you aren't suppose to use Vitamin E. Someone help and is this normal or did I cause problems with using the cocoa butter. I have had such a journey with my breast cancer. I couldn't tolerate the chemo and was allergic to Herceptin.

I was given a ton of steroids, Benadryl, Pepcid and God knows what else. The next day I was given the same premeds and was tried the Herceptin, well after a six hour infusion I had a reaction of breathing problems from that treatment. I then the next day went to the er and was given steroids, Benadryl and Pepcid again. I am still having anxiety to the point I can function with upper back muscle spasms, shakes, hands and feet dripping sweat and waking up with panic attacks and can't even shower and get a panic attack. I had panic attack years ago but never had them lately until the last week's immense cocktail. I am beyond frustrated, mad and really want to say I quit. I am can't function if this is the beginning I don't think I will make it to the end of this treatment process. I will be dead.

I am beyond scared, worried, upset, angry, etc.... My mother had breast cancer when she was 5 thank God, she beat the disease she is now 81. I am 50 and have my mind set to the fact that I too have breast cancer. The sonogram showed 2 spots in my left breast and the tech was far to ease me mind. When he did the ultrasound he kept going back over the spot that has the masses and then went under my arm guess looking for lymph nodes. I was so worried and nervous, but the tech acted so coldly. I don't know what else to do or think. I keep feeling like this is it and I am doing to die. How does one deal with this. I am sorry but I don't know what to do. Thank you.
