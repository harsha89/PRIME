He felt the bacteria in my gastrointestinal system had become unbalanced due to all the antibiotics I took post surgery. He prescribed an antibiotic for the gut; xifaxan; then started me on a daily over the counter yeast pill. The results are amazing. No more multiple bathroom stops. I urge you to give it a try. I only wish I had gone to him sooner. I had tried all sorts of diet changes and yogurt but they didn't help the problem.",
