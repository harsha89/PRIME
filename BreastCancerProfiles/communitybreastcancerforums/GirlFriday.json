I had a sore throat too and asked my awesome rads NP about it and he said that the sore throat is lower...and is called esophogitis...so if your rads area is over your sternum and your throat hurts lower than just at the back where you swallow, it probably is a SE...if not it's probably something illness related...mine turned out to be illness related....not rads related. ",

I finished Rads in April...On the March group, we discussed all kinds of things, so perusing that might help answer questions too.  Here's the list that summarizes our group experience in terms of helpful hints!  Hope you don't mind me posting, but I compiled this list as I went through the process, and learned from what others were doing too!  I probably won't lurk on this group long, so if you have a question you can always PM me! Radiation Suggestions Soap: Basis, Dove:  Go for free of perfumes and dyes.  Do not use wash cloth and pat dry Lotions:  Look for no dyes, no parabens, as pure as possible 100% Aloe:  Fruit of the Earth, RO Suggested: Aquaphor for later weeks of treatment. Other Suggestions: Glaxal, Baby Aveeno, Miaderm (purchase on Internet) Boiron's Calendula (lotion, cream, gel) Always go in clean and lube when you go out.  Lube 3-5 times a day Treat  your skin delicately. It's being assaulted! Tank tops, Camisole's with shelf bra, Fruit of the Loom front hook athletic bras, Everything Cotton and loose that you can stand. Buy a yard of white fleece, and cut to fit inside \"bras\" so something soft is next to rads area. If you are larger breasted, be concerned about underneath your breast and treat with care. Absolutely NO lanolin or oil prior to treatment.  Avoid Lanolin during treatment Do not wear deodorant or shave the rads underarm.    Breathe through the process: Consider counting the timing of the treatments, visualize the \"healing\" beam.  Ask for music to be played and a warm sheet/towel if available.  Consider naming the machine:  Bubba, Sparky, The Accelerator, Trilogy If the position you are in for radiation hurts your arms or back consider taking ibuprofen or something prior to your appointment...ask your RO about this for recommendations. Enjoy your tattoos if you get them. They little blue dots to add to the constellation of your body! Fatigue is real.  Plan for it.  Some can take naps and be better, other's can't.  Try to plan your days so you don't wear yourself out.  Drink Lots of Water Eat Plenty of Protein to help health skin heal Do not take extra anti-oxidants Always ask the question that is on your mind.  Do not be pushed or bullied into anything.  This is your cancer, your treatment, your crazy to own and to take care of.  Research when you need to leave no stone unturned, and never feel shy about posting here!",

I have Xrays the 25th, than start my 33 sessions 28th.  At least I think it's 33...I asked her twice, and when I left it really hadn't stuck in my head.  I was just so happy to get it over with.  I took some ibuprofen before I went in because I knew my shoulder would not like my arm being over my head so long. It seemed to work.  The tat under my arm is a pinched bruise looking thing.  It doesn't really hurt, but it's really bruised about the size of a dime.  It looks kind of funny next to a mole I have there.  Just one more thing to add to the constellation on my body!",

I'm kind of bummed that the schedule that was available was not in the same facility as my RO.  She's been incredible.  Much better than my Med Onc! Do you remember the brand name of the Aloe?",

I had them form 12 hours after surgery and then went to ibuprofen and lived with an ice pack for two days. I bought Fruit of the Loom athletic bras at Walmart (2 for $12)...they are cotton with a racer back, and have eye hook front closure. I bought them one size larger too, to limit any squeeze that may cause discomfort.  I didn't feel comfortable going bra-less for at least a week after, but my pain was minimal.  I liked the front hook because of less stretching as I also had a sentinel node biopsy and the sutures in my arm pit were very sore.  My sisters sent me front button pj's...very helpful and comfortable too! I was almost brainless from the stress, and honestly, it turned out pretty well. I think waiting was more painful than my surgery.  You're at the right place for support!  I send you the calm I wish I had while waiting, and speedy healing energy!",

For those of you that are struggling with other issues. I'm right there with you! I had an ultra sound today...what was previously a 15 minute deal turned into 45 minutes. the tech recorded the sound of the blood flow to my ovaries...although the tech can't say anything, I know that's not good.  Does anyone remember the days prior to the \"anxious waiting\" time period?  I have to admit, This whole BC process only started in Dec, and those days seem way, way off!",
