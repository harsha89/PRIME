There are several others but it's hard to know just what to read about for you just now. A friend of mine who is dealing with a fairly recent cancer diagnosis stated the other day that he has quit reading about his type of cancer and treatment for it because he has gotten to information overload. Try not to stress yourself with too much information which may or may not apply to you. Hoping you get your appointment at the cancer center the soonest and can begin developing a treatment plan.

I've had 10/24--16 hypofractionated treatments and 8 boosts planned. 3 \"extra\" boosts because previously unidentified DCIS was found in surgical specimen and the RO felt the margins were not adequate. At this point I think extra boosts are preferable to more surgery. Using aloe gel right after tx and aquaphor 3 or 4 times the rest of the day, including at bedtime. Washing the entire area with Dove soap and tepid water before going for tx. Have not found a cotton bra that works for me(too lopsided) so no bra (had to do this when I had shingles a few years ago) and wearing pima cotton shirts. So far only some light tanning. However, some breast pain. RO says likely inflammation from rads and to take anti inflammatory such as ibuprofen or celebrex. Yes, the aquaphor is greasy but it washes off of me and out of my clothing. It may be in my head but I feel my skin is better protected by the aquaphor. The aloe gel is great after tx because it absorbs so quickly that I don't have greasy fingers for putting on my clothing.I Wishing a great weekend for all.",

You have a huge amount going on just now so no wonder your head is spinning! Both taking a list of questions you want to ask to each visit and making notes during each visit are really good ideas. Even if you are hearing and understanding what is being said during a visit, I can almost guarantee that you won't remember all of it without some notes. I learned that as a young mother when one of the boys was sick -- the doctor's instructions were perfectly clear until I got home and tried to remember the details. Your ob-gyn has already given you some questions to ask the MO; perhaps you could check with him or her if you should be finding out anything else? Of course you feel like you are in limbo because you are waiting on lots of information. Generally once a treatment plan is established and is in progress that feeling gets better. Your situation is complicated by your autoimmune disorder but it looks like that is being taken into consideration in developing your plan of treatment.

My treatments are at a freestanding oncology center, don't know if that makes any difference in the billing process. Wishing everyone a great weekend. Those two day breaks are wonderful.",

I literally had no skin problems with rads--followed the R0's directions re showering with an unscented, mild soap (I used Dove), warm not hot water, pat dry, and use moisturizer (I used Aloe gel from Wal-Mart after a treatment because it was less messy on my hands for driving home and Aquaphor 3 to 4 times a day. Had a good piece of advice from a staff member to wash any of that off before a treatment so it doesn't act like the baby oil some used to use to get a suntan). Also, since BC surgery I pay more attention to my diet with emphasis on protein (no beef, pork, or processed meats), vegetables and fruits. In addition I am doing better at exercising--for now just walking. I found during radiation that when I felt most \"draggy\" was when I really needed to get up and walk around--thought I was going to wear a groove in the floors but they have survived intact!😊 You asked about a bone density test. That may be to help with decisions re hormone blockers. For example, I am well past menopause and based on that would likely take an AI. However, I was diagnosed with osteopenia over ten years ago and, since AIs have a reputation of leeching bone, I am on Tamoxifen even though the general rule of thumb is that Tamoxifen is used with premenopausal women. Good luck with your upcoming treatments. Feel free to ask questions here--lots of information and opinions available! This entire site has been very helpful for me.",

      "Content": "Jan 1, 2019 12:11AM Beaverntx wrote: Happy New Year to all. Just found this thread. My story is that I was diagnosed at age 77 (I could be the \"poster child\" for continuing mammograms after age 75). When I was called back for a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound I wasn't too concerned as that had happened before with final diagnoses of cysts. When the stereoscopic biopsy was ordered, still not too concerned until the radiologist who was doing the biopsy remarked that the suspicious area had irregular edges. The tumor was near the chest wall behind the nipple. Even when I knew it was there I could not feel it. DH and I met in our college band--he was in engineering and I was in nursing. We both enjoyed practicing our chosen professions until taking early retirement in 2000. We celebrated our 56th wedding anniversary in 2018. This Christmas, we've had both of our sons and their families (8 grandchildren aged 21 down to 9 year old twins!) with us. Cooking for 14 is really different than for 2! I had only the two pregnancies and breast fed both boys. Also, took H R T for about five years since when I entered menopause the thinking at that time was that H R T was cardio protective. It took three different physicians to convince me I should do that. Five years later the research indicated no heart protection activity and I stopped immediately. It is highly likely that the H R T contributed to my B C. Once I retired from university teaching I began to develop my interest in two areas, each of which could be full time: quilting and genealogy. Haven't done a lot of either in 2018, what with 2 major and 4 minor surgeries plus radiation. I've been focused on healing, eating healthier, increasing my exercise and taking off some of the pounds that may also have contributed to the BC.I Here in Texas it isn't quite 2019 yet but we just watched the ball drop in Times Square--that counts doesn't it? My eyelids are starting to droop so I'll sign off for now. As we say in Texas, Happy New Year to all y'all! ",
