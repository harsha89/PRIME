No radiation needed as I am 67, newest studies have shown that women 65 and over who have had no  radiation with similar diagnoses fare almost no different than women who have had radiation . I will start on anastrozole 1mg daily for 5 years. I have done research and all seems to point out that oncotype is not needed. Part of me wonders what it would have showed, but do not want chemo anyway.  Thought of going to Dana Farber Hospital in Boston for a second opinion but am quite comfortable with my doctors opinions as I am in the neighboring state and my  docs all trained in the Boston area and are highly regarded.  The test is expensive, about $4000 but insurance does pay for it. Sounds as though you need to have a good conversation with your doctor or if you can, try a second opinion. Good luck.",
