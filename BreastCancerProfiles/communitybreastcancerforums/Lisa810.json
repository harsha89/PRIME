I agree, I know it's hard, but try to let the acupuncture do it's thing. I bet you'll see happier results in a few weeks. Sue, mega-congrats on the FOD & FOW! I couldn't be any happier for or prouder of you! Maggie, maybe if you do make it to the salon (maybe next week?), they'll be able to give you a trim that will help camouflage the thinning you have on top. But I completely hear you on not wanting ANYTHING cut. i think you look supercute as is! I have about another half inch than in my avatar picture. And it's so soft and silky and NOY GREY and not really mousey brown, either. Who woulda thought? (I've been highlighting my hair since I was 25, so I had no clue what my true color was.) I'm nearly to the baseball hat stage. and i've been whipping The Wig off and showing more friends/fam what the real me looks like. Very bummed about my still-receding brows and still-disappearing lashes. I'm 6 weeks out, dammit. So unfair. Very NOT bummed about my implant exchange surgery next weds - whoo hoo!

You and I seem to have the same regrowth rate, I'm about 8 weeks behind you (gotta change my avatar). I actually made hubby measure my hair the other day. One inch exactly. It's just starting to go past my ears. *happy hairgrowth dance* Chelev, kudos to you for going topless, albeit accidentally, lol! too funny, since for the past week I nearly forgot my wig too! You look adorable! You have a face that's very well suited to short hair. And are those your brows or do you enhance them? gorgeous! i too am going topless in public more and more. (ok, well, just when I walk the dog. And once when I dropped the boy off at band practice.) This weekend will be the first time I'll go sans wig and makeup in front of the inlaws. I'm a bit nervous, I don't know why. They love me to pieces. I'm having great results with Biotin B-Complex Thickening Shampoo from Avalon Organics. Although I guess it could also be the biotin in my multivitamin (tho my legs and underarm hair is coming back reeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaalllllllyyyyyyy slowly, not that i'm complaining). i shampoo every day, and leave it on my scalp while i wash. My eyelashes are still short and stubby and practically nonexistent. I've been experimenting with Talika & Ardell, but I think I'm going to try sticking with Mavala Eye-Lite Double Lash for a month and see what happens. I'm too nervous to try revitalash. i really really want my hair back, but i also really really want my lashes back too. FYI: seems like my hair's coming in pretty straight (normally it's wavy). And still very little grey. Yay! \"I'm thinking these doctors need to read some of these threads.\" Amen to that, Titan! Magnola, congrats on the soft foobs! I had my exchange july 8th - and even tho I had lipo on the sides, I'm amazed at the fast recovery. (although when I flex, I still fell like the expanders are there. i'm hoping in time it'll feel more natural. tryin' not to worry.)",

A couple of people had no idea I had cancer or wore a wig, so there's sort of a newness to deal with on my part. Like I'm reliving the dx again. I spent an hour googling and printing out pictures of short \u2018do's yesterday to take to my stylist. Even tho I'm not planning on getting a trim for many weeks yet. I just want her to know where I'm headed. No pun intended, hee!",

She's checking with him and will get back to me. I'm going to make my final decision by Monday. They've scheduled me for Dec. 30th surgery. Happy freaking New Year to me. Can a double tram be done in one surgery? As it is, my surgeon said a bilateral mastectomy and a single tram flap will take 6 hours. Ugh. Just thinking about it makes me queasy.",

      "Content": "Lisa810 wrote: Hello all. Please forgive me, as I'm a newbie and haven't figured out how to navigate this wonderful forum yet. I'm sure my questions have been answered elsewhere, but I just don't have it in me to search. I'm 48, a 36DDD, recently been diagnosed with IDC left breast, at least 4 lymph nodes affected. ER positive. Met with my breast cancer surgeon on Tuesday, and we both ruled out a partial mastectomy, based on the size and shape of the tumor. I will definately at least have a mastectomy. When I brought up bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction, she said she would fully support that decision. (My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer at 58 and then battled colon cancer several years later; she's 72 and very healthy these days.) Today I met with the plastic surgeon, who I instinctively like and trust. He said I'm an excellent candidate for a tram flap if I opt for the single mastectomy. But he was vague when I asked how I'd \"balance\" life with a DDD on one side and a \"growing bump\" on the other until after my chemo is done - which is when he'd do my right side breast reduction. Meanwhile, the MRI report mentions \"stippled foci\" in my right breast, which I understand is \"nothing\" but in reality, could be something brewing and will bear close observation. My breast cancer surgeon said I'd be having MRI's every 6 months for the rest of my life, implying they'd find anything else early on but still ... I have huge, dense, always-lumpy-feeling breasts. I didn't even find the lump in my left breast until my breast started dimpling and changing shape. My GP said, if it was her, she'd go for the bilateral, for peace of mind and aesthetics (ie: matching). The plastic surgeon said if it was his wife or mother or daughter, he'd recommend bilateral also. The breast cancer surgeon didn't commit, but I plan on asking her the same question. But ultimately, no matter how many opinions I gather, this is on me and me only. And even a bilateral doesn't guarantee 100% that any small tiny cells of remaining breast tissue won't develop breast cancer. If I only have the one breast removed,  a prosthesis to match my remaining DDD is not an option. The thing would weigh a ton. If I have both removed, going flat chested is also not for me. I still want at least a semblance of my hour-glass figure. I've never liked lugging these boobs around. I've always wanted breast reduction surgery, but was too chicken and afraid of scarring. (Heh.) But now that I know what it's going to take and how long it'll be to look & feel \"normal\" again ... ugh. My brain is reeling. I'm so confused, I almost feel like going eeny meeny miney mo to make this decision.  I've been really strong & brave these past three weeks. Today I feel like I could crumble to the ground and never get up again. Gah.  Thanks for listening. I hope I can be of help to some of you when I get my brain back on straight.  \"just keep swimming, just keep swimming ...\" Dx 11/20/2008, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIB, 2/15 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
