See the dr on Thursday the 22nd to get the appt for the ultrasound and full details of mammo. Question is, a month after I found the lump, I started to get pain in my sternum. It's a pulling feeling. only happens when I move a certain way. Otherwise it never hurts. Could this be from the lump I found? Which has gooten larger since I found it November. I know its a silly question but just trying to eliminate all what it could be. Thank you inadvance for any answers or suggestions. Log in to post a reply",

My dr is refering me to a breat surgeon, so that during my u/s if the need to do a biopsy they can go ahead and do it. Should I be concerned about seeing a breat surgeon or feel ok? I am more nervous than before. The dr said the lump I found in my right breat was fib. cysts and thickening of the ducts. He ordered a u/s of both breasts to be sure. He also wants me to come back to him in 6 weeks to make sure everything is ok. Have to wait for the appt for the u/s. Ill post as I found out. Thank you for your support.",
