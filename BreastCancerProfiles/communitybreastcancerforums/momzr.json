Anyhow . . . she shared with me that when she went back to breast center she had her original digial mammogram at that they had her lay on the stereotactic table and tried a number of times to view the calcifications but were not having a lot of luck and said rather than attempt it they would wait six months and re-evaluate.  She decided to get a second opinion at another local hospital and is rescheduled for a stereotactic this coming Friday at the second hospital.  The interesting thing is that at this SECOND hospital that they told her they also had troubles with their stereotactic equipment once they went to digital mammograms and the stereotactic (which is essentially also a mammogram I guess - just done in a different manner) equipment they originally had wasn't one that could 'keep up' with the new digital mammography and made it difficult to spot calcifications, etc., so they have a NEW stereotactic biopsy table that I guess is more 'up-to-date' with the digital technology.  Just an FYI that women having stereotactic biopsies suggested after digital mamm's might want to ask how 'current' the stereotactic equipment is at the breast center, because I guess this can be a problem. I am personally glad she went for that second opinion and will go ahead and have it looked at before another six months just to set her mind at ease. Log in to post a reply",
