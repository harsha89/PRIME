Waiting is the hardest part sometimes.  As CanDsMom said, statistics are really on your side, so that's something to feel good about.  Just try to stay busy for the next few days and try to have some fun.   When you're busy, it keeps your mind off the waiting. I'll be praying for you!   (your parents are so fortunate to have such a caring daughter!) Elizabeth Anne",

Maybe it's my fault for downplaying it to everyone I talk to at first.  It was ME that kept trying to reassure people that everything was going to be okay and that I caught it early. Ho Hum.....",

Victoryismine:  I had the same questions as you at first.  I didn't know which doctor to see first and I didn't get much guidance.  I ended up seeing surgeon, then MO, then RO.  It turned out fine and afterwards they told me it would not have mattered who I saw first because they coordinate treatment. Raincitygirl:  My diagnosis looks identical to yours.  I'm now 1/2 way through radiation. Denial?  I'm really trying to figure out my non-reaction to all of this.  I've strolled through the last 3 months in a fog and I can't seem to summon up any emotion.  Tears occasionally erupt at all the wrong times, but there is no rhyme or reason for it. The few times tears have come, they are close to the surface and pretty irrational.   I'm waiting for some sort of emotion to hit me, but it hasn't.  Sometimes I wonder if my mind is avoiding thinking about it because it's easier to accept that way.    I just can't figure it out. ",
