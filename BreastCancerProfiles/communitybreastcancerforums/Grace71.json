I don't think I would wait to have it done.  If it were me, I'd go and ask them to bill me, and continue fighting the insurace company.  If you have to pay it, work something out with the company where you send $50 a month or whatever you can afford.  As long as you're making an effort to pay they can't do anything about it.  For my own piece of mind I'd have to take this route if the insurance company denied it, particularly if you keep having these abnormal results and the radiologist sees and feels the lump too.  I'm so mad for you!  (On another note my insurace company keeps denying medication for another condition that my doctor prescribed. I'm not taking medication that hasn't been approved for my condition to prove that it won't work so we can say we tried other things.  How ridiculous is that?) When I saw my doctor last he did tell me that Ultrasound wasn't the best way to diagnose breast cancer.  He said Ultrasound was great for diagnosing cysts but the other methods were much better for breast cancer.  Have your doctor's office fight this, too.  I'm sure they have experience with these things. Best of luck to you!",
