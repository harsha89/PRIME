I had a bilateral mastectomy on Feb 22nd.  Had reconstructive surgery on both breasts but due to a hematoma the PS took the expander out of that breast until it healed.  It is now over one month since the operation and I have a really swollen upper abdomen.  Has anyone else had this problem.  I haven't gained any weight but my abdomen after standing alot hurts and feels and looks swollen.  I am going in on April 26th to get the other expander put back in.  Hopefully I am not the only one to have this problem and how long before my stomach will go down?
