The woman who counseled me about prothesis said that if I don't wear them I'll get a concave chest. Anyone know about that? And why can't I just wear a padded bra? Also, how long do you have underarm swelling? What about shaving your armpits? They said I should use an electric razor, but they cost a lot of money! As it is now, I'm shaving the side where there were no lymph nodes removed. The other side is a furry mess. Any suggestions? Thanks! ",

      "Content": "lynliz wrote: Hi everyone, I had a double masectomy about a month ago. All the hoopla has died down; the get well cards have stopped coming & no one is bringing food anymore. So now it's time to move forward and process what just happened. I was diagnosed with breast cancer Oct. 12th of 2011 and my breasts were amputated Dec. 1st. Its a lot to digest. I'm not healed enough to wear prothesis, so I'm forced to look at the new, flat-chested me. I had 36-I breasts, so I had no idea I had such a round pot belly. It is hard adjusting to this me. I have a post-surgery camisole, but it irritates my underarms & causes swelling. Any comments/suggestions/hugs? Love, Lyn   Log in to post a reply",
