I've had a lot of tests done in a short period of time which has helped me. I've had a negative pet scan result ðŸ˜Š and my right breast U/S just confirmed a few fibroadenomas, which were suspicious for malignant involvement. I am Er/Pr + and HER2-. Ki.67 is high @ 28%. Surgeon says I have complex dense, breast. Should I be offended LOL!! I've decided to have a dbl MX. US guided core biopsy of left axillary node is scheduled for the 10th ðŸ˜£. I guess it's a low lying level 1node that measures 20mm? Doc says there's some thickening there, however, I am negative for LVI. There's just so much info and so many uncertainities. I hate this. Surgeon and MO are still on the fence.about.chemo/treatment until.after surgery. Left breast is a hot mess. Several satellite masses and largest mass is 3.2 cm. I just dont know if a.dbl MX is the right decision? I'm so confused. I'm sad and I'm rambling now. What would you do in thos situation? Someone help me please ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜£",
