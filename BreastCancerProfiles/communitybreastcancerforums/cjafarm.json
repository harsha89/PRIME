It is spring loaded and can make a startling noise. Ask your radiologist to demonstrate it for you so you know what the sound is. I have had numerous biopsies and don't recall any of them being painful. But I do bruise easily and always have an ugly bruise for about a week. My last biopsy was on a Friday and I received my call on Tuesday that it was cancerous. She didn't have the details but when I met with the breast surgeon the next day he had the full pathology report for me. Having your procedure on a Monday may help get your results that week.  Good luck. ",

My bs told me today that I am breast cancer free. I will do hormone therapy and hope to stay cancer free. This reassured me that the bilateral mastectomy w/out reconstruction was right for me. My thoughts are with everyone and their families facing not only breast cancer but all cancers (Lost my mom and dad to cancer.) We must continue to encourage others to have those mammograms and follow their instincts and to catch this ugly beast early",

My injection did sting a little and was put in at what I would call the 11:00 area. I have learned to close my eyes and encourage myself to relax and breath before any type of procedure. It helps me immensely I went from that room directly to surgery because of a change in schedule. In fact my surgeon pushed my wheel chair to the OR and talked football with me the whole way. I was very lucky in that no cancer had moved to the lymph nodes.  Best wishes to both of you.  ",
