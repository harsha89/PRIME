I also find I prefer sometimes to kind of retreat into myself when I'm dealing with something difficult and I try to balance that with not isolating myself.  I think sometimes it's healthy to pull back a little and it definitely helps to avoid those awkward conversations.  I have found that trying to find ways to be around people where there is some kind of organized activity going on helps.  That way, the focus is on what we are DOING and I feel less alone or self-conscious.  I also knit and bringing a project with me can be a good distraction.  Above all, though, I find if I can make myself get outdoors and spend some time even just walking by myself, I feel so much better than if I give in to my instinct to hole up in my house. I'm sure you'll find what works best for you.  As far as the kids go, I think it is important that they not feel too isolated.  I remember being the \"kid from the cancer family\" and mostly, I just wanted to feel normal and doing \"normal\" things that I usually did helped with that.  If you don't feel up to it, you might consider seeing if someone else can take them to the things they would normally go to.  I also felt better when I knew what was going on, but that can depend a lot on the age of the kids.  There are groups now for kids with family members with cancer that might help them also find friends that will understand what they are going through.",

People are \"weird\" about cancer.  I learned this pretty quickly growing up as a sibling of someone with cancer and with many relatives with cancer.  Perfectly normal, kind, sane people often act in completely bizarre ways when you or someone you are close to get a cancer diagnosis.  You really can't predict who will step up and become your biggest support (and often it's someone you never would have thought you'd be close to!) and who simply won't be able to handle it. The way I've come to handle it is by maybe being a little bit selfish in some ways.  When it happens, I focus my energy on the people who are there and can be there and I prioritize spending time with them because I need that support.  Those who simply aren't comfortable or can't really grasp what I'm going through...I let them drift off as they need to or simply prioritize time with them lower for now.  I try to understand that their reaction to what's going on usually is a lot more about where they are.  Maybe the diagnosis has sparked fear in them.  Maybe they just don't know how to respond and are doing their best.  There are all kinds of reasons people say or do stupid or hurtful things when cancer is involved and almost all of them have to do with how that person handles these things and nothing at all to do with the patient or their family or how that person feels about them. After things have calmed down, some of those relationships have come back and some haven't.  Sometimes they evolve into a different kind of friendship and the friendships that I gained during the \"crisis\" time have grown in other directions.  I even have some friends who seem to only want to be there when there is a crisis.  I find if I'm just open to letting those things change as they will, it's a lot easier. Sorry for droning on!  You also might want to look into local support groups where you could make new friends who would better understand exactly what you're going through.  Your bf may also benefit from a group where he could talk with other family and partners of people since he has a lot to adjust to and may also feel like his current friends might not understand. Again, big hugs to you!",

I also think that having high profile celebrities dealing with BC and BC risk publicly does help others.  Years ago, when my OB/GYN casually brought up BRCA testing, I didn't know much about it and opted not to test.  Hearing about AJ's testing and surgery was one of several things that prompted me to research genetic testing more and that researching eventually led me to where I am now, waiting on my own genetic testing results.  All this and I'm not even a huge AJ fan.  Who knows how many other people became more informed about genetic testing for cancer risk from hearing about her surgeries?  I know my primary care doctor was even more aware of BRCA testing because of it...and that's a medical professional.

It could very well be something simple like a benign cyst, which would fit well with your symptoms, but as others have said, only a doctor will be able to diagnose you for sure.  If it is a cyst, they can even remove fluid from it to give you some relief of the pain you are experiencing with your cycles.  Cysts are very common and don't increase your risk of cancer.  There are other completely benign possibilities, but any time you see a change in your body, it's a good idea to bring it up with your doctor rather than waiting years.

I grew up in a family full of breast and ovarian cancers and was surprised at how low my risk even was, when you run everything through a computer model.  It still was high enough that we are going through genetic testing to get more information, but if I test negative, it isn't high enough to suggest surgeries or anything further. When you are going through the process of diagnosing a breast condition, it is scary and it seems like breast cancer is all around you and EVERYONE is getting it.  It's also scary thinking about growing older and having screenings regularly.  However, surgery has its own risks and it's important to have all the information to weight those risks against your realistic cancer risk.  That is where a genetic counselor can be a big help. Big hugs to you and I hope everything goes well for you and you're back to focusing on life, rather than breasts!  :)",

I have dense breasts and for me, ultrasound and breast MRI's are far more useful.  Breast MRI's can be tough to get in some cases because the facilities are limited and they do often generate false positives.  An ultrasound can really help them get a look at your lymph nodes, see if they have fluid in them or something solid, and assist with a biopsy if needed.  I will also say that my axillary lymph node, when they measured it at my US, was pretty big, but they said it was perfectly normal.  Bottom line, it sounds like you need the pros to take a look rather than have us guess and an ultrasound sounds like a good next step.  :) Whatever it is, I hope you get answers soon!",

One thing that's helped me is keeping in mind how RARE BRCA mutations really are.  Even among breast cancer patients, they only account for something like 10-20% of all breast cancers.  Then, let's say you do have a BRCA mutation in your family (you don't say if anyone else has been tested), that STILL does not mean you have one.  Even if one of your parents has a BRCA mutation, you still would only have a 50-50 chance of having inherited it.  So...the odds are strongly in your favor to NOT have a BRCA mutation.  Worst case, if you do test positive, you will have time to consider all your options and some women only opt for increased screenings, particularly while they are still trying to have children and, even with a BRCA mutation, your children would only have a 50-50 chance of inheriting that mutation AND treatment and prevention options would have many years to evolve before they were of the age to be tested. I know it's very tough, but try not to go down the worst case road until you get to it.  The waiting can be pretty tough.  Also check out the FORCE (facing our risk) website.  They have a forum specifically for younger women who test positive for BRCA and you may be able to find some more support there as well.",

Most cysts are benign and you actually may find some relief from the pain after the biopsy since it will remove some of the fluid that causes pressure.  As others have said, dense, fibrocystic breasts are very common and healthy. When it comes to genetic testing, it's never a bad idea to talk with a genetic counselor, but it's not likely that your insurance is going to cover genetic testing unless you have very close family relatives who have either tested positive for a mutation or you have enough close family members with breast cancer to suggest a mutation.  Very few genetic mutations associated with increased risk of breast cancer are also connected with gastric or esophogeal cancer.  I had a difficult time getting my genetic testing covered and needed a genetic counselor to talk to my insurance company on my behalf to get it covered.  (The breast and ovarian cancer is all on my father's side of the family and he is an only child and none of those women are alive now.) I can definitely relate to your anxiety, though, having had parents with different cancers.  A genetic counselor may be able to help you feel more comfortable with your situation or help you find the appropriate genetic testing and twist the insurance company's arm to cover it. Try not to worry and avoid Dr. Google.  Here's hoping for an easy biospy, a relief of your pain, AND benign results quickly!  :)",

For me, I scheduled the biopsy right after the ultrasound.  The radiologist was pretty sure it was a fibroadenoma, but wanted to be absolutely sure, so they set the appointment up for the next week.  The biopsy was pretty easy using just a large needle to take a core biopsy.  They numbed me completely before doing it and all you can see from it now (about a month after) is a tiny little nick of a scar.  Then, I had to wait about 4 days for my results.  With mine, we're just going to keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't grow too much.  They generally only remove them now if they cause pain or keep growing.  Mine was marked with a titanium clip so that they can see it on future breast images. I was really anxious through the process, thinking through the whatif's, but beyond that, it wasn't painful and my imaging center was really good and making sure I understood each procedure.  I'm hoping yours will be just as simple!",

It sounds like your doctors are doing everything right and sending you for an ultrasound.  The ultrasound will help them make sure it's not a cyst since cysts look different than fibroadenomas on imaging.  Then, if they can't completely rule anything out or just want to be really thorough, they can do a biopsy, using the ultrasound to guide it, if needed.  For me, the biopsy was another appointment and more waiting between.  :P  A fibroadenoma will look round or oval on the ultrasound screen, usually with nice, smooth edges. Good luck at your appointment and I hope you get benign results and quickly!",
