Mine was ductal invasive. Doctor reported margins were clean but close. I am thinking she may want to do another surgery but will find out on Wed. My cells were grade 3 but I am unaware of my stage is. Has anyone else had close margins? What happened? Does anyone know about chemo and what kind or how long since I am negative and it is grade 3 but small. Are they usually agressive with this? Help! I am new to all of this and bombarded with info.
