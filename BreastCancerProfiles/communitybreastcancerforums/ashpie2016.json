I have always had \"lumpy\" large breast but 3 months ago I found a lump that at first did not hurt! I chalked it up to something to do with being a new mom! I have not used my milk supply for almost 6 months mind you! I couldn't get a good supply so I stopped! I thought it would just go away or get smaller but no its gotten larger! I've also had itching, arm pain and a shaking/ numb here and there hand on same side! I've been super tired but hey that could just be the new baby and I also have had heartburn almost everyday for months! I've just started having sharp pains in my breast along with sensitivity when its bumped! I haven't had it examined yet and I'm so scared! Log in to post a reply",
