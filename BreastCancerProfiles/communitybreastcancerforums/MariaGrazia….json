They don't see any cancer, but another doctor will be looking at the tests to confirm. I have to go back in 6 months for a follow up to make sure it does not get larger. So PHEW! But I will NOT skip my mammo's any more and will be there in 6 months with smiles on my face.",

I went for a routine mammo last week (bad me, haven't gone regularly) and they called me the next day and told me I had to come back as soon as possible for diagnostic mammo (found out in the letter I received a few days later it included an ultrasound). So I check the breast, and no I didn't do regular exams either because I never could figure out what I was looking for, and find a grape size lump. Now I know I shouldn't be nervous as most of the time these things are just cysts. BUT, my grandmother had breast cancer and last year I had to have 1/2 my thyroid removed for an inconclusive lump that just happens to be the same side as the breast in question. I go tomorrow and I know they'll give me results immediately, but I'm concerned. I haven't really told anyone cause I don't want to panic them, my husband knows and 2 friends. Hoping it's nothing.
