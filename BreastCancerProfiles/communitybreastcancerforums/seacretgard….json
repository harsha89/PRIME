I began my first treatment on Dec 8 and post mostly on that thread, but wanted to say hello and wish all of you just beginning all the best as you progress through your journey. These boards have been so important and supportive to me in a way that family and friends couldn't possibly understand. PCBarbie I am always taken aback by the \"did they get it all\", or those that ask my stage. I don't need their diagnosis. I will only share such detail with other women who have been or are going through their own journey. Btw I'm in Passaic county too. CJRT I'm sorry you had to stop tx for surgery but you sound like you're doing well after surgery. I hope you breeze through the remainder of your treatments. I agree with the hydration being so important. My last tx I asked for an additional bag of saline and wasn't hit as hard and fast as my first tx. Right now I'm struggling with a sore mouth and I know I'm not drinking enough. Do you mind if I ask how often you go for fluid infusions? Hugs to all.",

I just finished 4 AC txs and after the last one my onc felt I had almost an allergic reaction and ended up in ER with fever, rashes. I had to delay a week to begin next treatment. It was explained ti me in the beginning that these things sometimes happen with chemo and not to worry too much. ( easier said than done). Prayers that your mom recovers quickly and will be ready to resume treatment. She's blessed to have a wonderful daughter like yourself. Waitress, keep rinsing with salt and baking soda in water and let your onc know, you may need magic mouthwash. Try not to eat spicy or rough foods. It will just irritate your mouth. When my mouth was sore, I had lots of protein shakes, and yogurt. I hope you feel better. take good care, jumped in from the December chemo thread, Laura",

Sorry to unload again, but I can't help feeling like there is something I'm doing wrong. Day 11 and although the initial first days were certainly the worst w nausea, fatigue and bone pain, this burning mouth nose stomach has me really worried about my next tx. The red spots in my throat are now connected, open sore still not healed, no amount of antacid touches the stomach. Dr just called in script for the mouthwash. Doesn't heal it just may help numb it. It hurts to speak. My ears still ringing, pupils like pin pricks, I have the look of someone very drugged. The only meds I took since tx are antacid and the prescribed decadrone. I still can't help feeling that my being heavier than avg weight and having a higher dose contributes. In the past, I've always been drug sensitive, one benedryl would knock me out for hours. Im sorry, thank you for listening.",

For those of you ahead of me, I don't think most had a drastic difference between 1 and 2? Ok now this is weird but I really think I have a very slight period. Had period like cramps last couple days. I've only had one period in the last year, so I guess it's possible. I think Rachel mentioned heavy bleeding ( Rachel I hope you are home resting). Markat you're right about the one day at a time. Sorry about missing your party. Hoping your SEs will be milder. Gator sorry it was difficult. I'm still waiting for some shedding to buzz mine completely. It feels like straw on my head so I know it's any day. Got the hat/wig yesterday, which is so much easier than the wig. Feels more secure too. Dreary and raining on this first day of winter in NJ, but at least its pretty warm. Hoping for a good day for all.",

Peacock, hi, yes after last winter in NJ the weather has weighed heavily on my mind. I get my txs on Thursdays in Ridgewood, (not at Valley Hospital) and asked what would happen in the case of snow. They remain open unless there is a state of emergency. They are not open on the weekend. I was told that happened only once in many years. To ease your mind you might want to discuss things with your onc. The chemo class was given by a nurse at St Barnabus. Very in-depth about side effects and self care but you are correct, the ladies here do have more to offer. I have to say though the new onc office gave me a print out of possible SEs, I get more info from Rite Aid with an antibiotic! Mardibra glad to hear your're regaining strength. Was it mostly terrible fatigue? Today was day two and period was frighteningly heavy. (seems I am one of the unusual menopausal woman who chemo brings it back for, lucky me) I was told by the nurse I would have to go to the ER if soaking through hourly. I was probably making things worse by being on my feet all day and finally hit the couch in hopes of slowing things down. Better now. I don't know anything about banking blood, or the possibility of having a relative donate blood but I think I may look into that. Rachel glad to hear you feeling better too. I hate the dry winter fingertips. I used to use heavy creams,etc, but what I find the best is to use a gentle emery board and \"sand them down\" when they're dry before they crack. Don't do this if they've already opened though. I was also going to inquire about the \"liquid bandaid\". As careful as I try to be, I always seem to have some little nick on my hands. And washing them every 5 minutes makes bandaids impractical. And the same for feet too! On a good note I'm so happy my daughter is home from college! My living room was filled with her stuff but the house felt normal for the first time in months. This was her first semester away and I missed her presence here so much! Even the dog was celebrating. Ok, maybe some tea will help me to sleep, hope so. Laura",

I do have a little padding however! So many of you have mentioned watering eyes and nose, i have the opposite. I have had such extremely dry eyes even prior to starting treatment, now it is worse than ever. Going through bottles of natural tears. Anyone else? Or anyone who uses restatis? Between the blurriness and the dryness, it's tough to read or work on the computer. I'm sure hoping the Taxol doesn't have the same issues but I think I've read about blurriness. Gracie I'm sorry your night ended like it did but you're right, it was part of a good night and we have to hold onto those moments. I know what you mean about needing women around. I don't have any sisters but do have my oldest daughter who lives upstairs from me, and has been so dear. My ex DH, I know that sounds odd and it is, but he has been my strength through this, is here for the moment helping with some washer dryer issues. While I miss having someone to sleep next to at night, especially those really lonely nights, he has been so wonderful and caring and I know I am blessed. Sorry to be rambling, I think this winter and being housebound is getting me a bit restless. In trying to be careful, I think I've gone overboard and succeeded in isolating myself too much. I'm hoping the taxol is a little milder, and allows for me to at least return to work part time. Find out in a few weeks! Hoping for a peaceful Sunday for all, feel well. Laura",

I am pretty bruised after the last tx and just so conscious of that area now, the accessed vein is protruding a little and I just have this sense of pressure going up my neck. The fact that I've had to be very quiet this weekend has most likely given me too much time to think perhaps. Looks like this is the day to buzz my hair too. Coming out like crazy. Sorry to be such a downer.",

If I just rushed into something out of fear. I guess now is no time for regrets. Just move forward. Now I can barely make a decision on what's ok to eat. The chia seed I found so helpful does have a lot of antioxidants, so maybe I should cut it out. Just so many unknowns and lack of control on our end. Still haven't buzzed the hair. Maybe tonight.

Chills and sweats that soaked me head to toe, temp was down to 97.1! Called her today, temp has been in the 99's but she needs to know the source since all my cultures have shown nothing. So I will be admitted in the morning. Gator I am so sorry you have suffered so on taxol. I feel your pain. My last AC was Jan 19th and I am still having mouth and throat SEs and rashes. The onc thinks my fever may be related to the SEs. And the severe inflamation. Ive already missed my first taxol. I have lost 30 pounds since my surgery. It is difficult to eat and drink when your mouth feels so bad. I'm trying not to look too far ahead, 12 weeks of another chemo. She won't let me do DD, not after my AC nightmare. Jenilee, I'm so sorry you have additional txs added, but sounds like you have a doctor with your best interest in mind. Gator I sure hope the reduced dose results in less side effects for you.

And cheers to silver linings. I wish they could bottle your attitude and strength, and am grateful that you share it with all of us. I have to admit, I'm having a tough time even thinking about work, but you give me great hope that it can be managed, and with humor and grace. Capinva, I'm sorry you had to join this December group, but know you will find great comfort and acceptance here. You have already been through your first 4 AC txs, so you will offer great insight to many of us. I just had my first of 4 AC, to be followed by 12 taxol. Do you mind if I ask what reaction you had to the taxotere? To all the rest I hope you are getting some rest, my sleep all over the place lately, I find the couch more comforting, but not necessarily for sleeping. Night all.",

And you can't get enough hugs. We all understand and are here for you. Letsgogirls, I'm sorry you have to be here but welcome. I'm sorry about your delay. I was delayed a week too and frustrated but remembered at the chemo class the nurse said sometimes things may interfere with treatment, but don't panic. Just a couple things that I think are helping (whether they are or it's a placebo effect I don't care). This infusion I asked for more saline at the end. I was not as out of it yesterday. Felt less dehydrated too. I have been making chia seed a daily part of my diet. Worked up to 3 tsps a day and I think it helps with the dread constipation and it's high in omega 3. Had to give up the flax seed. Chia can be added to all kinds of foods. Laura",

Hope you all don't mind while I reflect a bit here. During the first 14 years of marriage, Christmas Eve was spent w my husbands large Italian family, great food, great fun. When my marriage ended 16 years ago, I took it pretty hard. First couple years while my young kids went w their dad, I went to various relatives, but always felt like out of place, so made it my own tradition to spend this night as I wished, church service, wrapping gifts, or just time to reflect. This Christmas Eve was a little different, 3 days post tx, not feeling well, and spent most of the day very quiet, in hopes of stopping this very heavy period, no! I did not want to include an ER visit as part of my Christmas Eve memories. So my oldest daughter opted to stay home. She baked cookies, the first sweets I've eaten in almost two months, haven't wanted any. And we had the most amazing, conversations. Conversations that 3 months ago, weren't even remotely touched upon. Now, surreal, but so real. Seeing this level of depth, maturity and grace that my daughter possesses, has given me a gift of such peace, and I am grateful. My younger daughter came home later w the traditional \"bag o gifts\" from their grandmother and we laughed at the silly, albeit, wasteful gifts that their dear grandmother indulges on them. (21 and she still gets a yearly barbie). She then modeled her sherbet-colored sweatsuit. Even cleaned up after her sisters baking extravaganza. I want to thank God for this Christmas Eve, and thank you ladies who are a tremendous support. Many blessings to all this day, Laura",

Onc doesn't want me to even try to exercise, just do regular things. Esp after last week. So I will just monitor for SEs now. FLislander my enzymes are also elevated. Onc said chemo will often do so. Rachel yes, pink eyelids for me with my spiky lashes. I have to use drops so many times a day I can't wear any makeup. Bottom lashes are just about gone. I used to have pink cheeks from rosacea, now I'm so pale I could wear blush if I owned any. Kelly, for years i had hives and no relief. The allergist said they're not sure why it works but to try Zantac, which I've taken now for years, (until bc it was my only my only med, and I complained about that, ugh) but it worked. Mardibra, I hope the dilauidid helps, better yet, that you don't even need it! What did they say about your feet? Blessings to all tonight, Laura",

Kelly, Sno (welcome back! sorry about the ribs!).  I hope you all heal quickly from any SE's as you move forward in your journey.  I'm right behind you, just had #11 taxol today (yay!).  I have to say though, as I slowly re-enter life, and see and feel glimpses of \"normalcy\", I am sometimes suddenly almost bowled over with \"what happened\"?  Counseling anyone? I think I'll sign up.  I have also been deeply hurt by someone, heart broken, and it has made things that much more difficult.  Didn't see it coming.  Was just a little preoccupied with all else that was happening in my life.  But I didn't fight this hard to give up now.  Mardi, I know how difficult it is to quit smoking so good for you!  It gets easier and hopefully you will come to detest it.  My daughter quit in January and she hates the smell now.  Rachel so sorry about the fatigue, swelling and pain.  You never stopped this whole time.  I hope it subsides quickly.  Kelly I will keep your SIL in prayer.  Hope you're doing well.  And Dougieswife, I hope that rash  heals quickly for you.  And I agree with you, more time to process things.  I am still deciding on reconstruction or not.  Onc talked to me today about not having the expanders removed before radiation.  I hate how they feel, but she says the implants will be much easier to deal with.  I look like a fuzzy-haired monk.  My once blonde hair is coming in really dark.  Someone at the docs office mentioned she used nioxin shampoo and conditioner, still does, and she had a beautiful head of hair.  I may give it a try.  Ok, I think and pray for all of you, can't believe what we've faced, but gotten through.  Will check in again soon, Love, Laura",

Kenyon I am very new here but these amazing ladies with their willingness to share experiences knowledge and emotions has been helping tremendously with just getting through each day. Since my bmx on Nov. 1st my anxiety and racing thoughts had left me sleeping so little that I couldn't imagine having the strength to begin chemo. So many decisions dr appointments range of emotion. Reading of others experiences, of the ladies who shared their first chemo experience this week when I go next Thursday will arm me with strength that mine will be doable as well.

I've had bouts of interstitial cystitis for years and have to avoid all triggers, coffee, most teas, sodas ESP diet, o j, alcohol, (I do break for the occasional margarita or sangria!)

I'm sorry you had so much trouble, but happy you are comfortable with your decision and I wish up you the best with your upcoming surgery. Yesterday I met with the plastic surgeon and discussed the option of eventual removal. Obviously, I will have to tolerate them through treatment. Second AC tomorrow, just when I'm feeling almost human again. I'm sure you all know. I asked her to remove a bit more saline, I think I have apron 120 ccs on each side, and it did take some of the sharp feeling away. I am also healed well enough to be able to resume many of my previous activities. Also, having them immediately done means I don't know what the comfort level may or may not have been without any reconstruction. I slept better last night than I have in months. One more question, once they were removed, did it also rid you of the tight band like feeling like when your bra is too tight? I am concerned about my skin not holding up after radiation, it's already so thin on that side, and don't look forward to endless corrective surgeries. Thank you all for sharing. Whatever I decide, your insights and experiences have and continue to support, inform and guide myself and so many others. Thank you and hugs to all.",

I think the steroids really do me in but am afraid to reduce them since they are supposed to help prevent nausea. I don't know how any of you drive, I get blurry while still in the chair. I think I had nurse Rachet today. When she said she doesn't usually work on Thursdays all I can say is good! Not fresh but sloppy. Sloppy can be dangerous. When she was getting ready to do the adriamycin injection, she got special purple gloves, as she walked towards me, I saw the gloves graze the top of the infectious disease disposal. She threw them on the uncovered table and walked away. I \"accidentally knocked them on the floor so she would have to get a new pair, and be ready to use them. Didn't feel a thing last time they accessed my port. Did this time. When she pulled it out blood was coming out pretty quickly and she grabbed an alcohol wipe and a wad of gauze. I said what if this doesn't stop. Her reply \" it should\"', and handed me another wad of unwrapped gauze. Great. I'm already seeing a bruise too. I'm wondering if can make a request for an onc nurse next time. To add insult to injury, my period has made an appearance. I'm 53, spotted in Sep but otherwise was done for a year. Cramps like I don't remember having since I was a kid. Mardibra, terrible that the nausea lasted so long. I haven't had the SEs you are experiencing, but I already have very dry eyes, and that has gotten worse. I feel dehydrated all the time. The onc wants me to take an anti anxiety med. Says I am the one causing my quickened heart rate from worrying. While that sounds reasonable, I don't want to deal with yet another drug and it's side effects. Does anyone have any advice on what they take to sleep in spite of the steroids? Finally I hope any one else who went today or is going tomorrow has minimal SEs! Hugs, Laura",

Hoping you recover quickly to move onto the next phase. I've been reading the taxol thread trying to prepare. One more AC on Thursday and I'm nervous. Day 10 now after tx 3 and I still feel like crap. Extreme fatigue, sometimes breathless and 3 numb toes. Didn't even know that would happen on AC. I still insist it's a dosing issue. Curious, does anyone know what their mg dose of AC is? I know the risks increase with higher doses. Mardi 20 mgs of steroids on taxol? That's 2x what I get now. Hope you feel well. Gator, hope you were able to rest and feel well too. My youngest daughter went back to school yesterday, miss her! House is too quiet. Too cold outside. I wish you all a good mild se weekend. Laura",

Was a nerve wracking day. I hope you get some rest tonight and tomorrow goes smoothly. Naan, like you, sometimes the side effects bother me more than the symptoms. Esp the anxiousness and jitteriness you describe. Sleep is already at a minimum. I guess I have to see what happens. I wouldn't wish any of this on anyone... To those of you who've been sharing your recent experiences, thank you again, it really feels less scary and less lonely. L",

I was told by the onc to avoid antioxidant supplements and herbals, however, not food sources. I was also told to eat only fruits and vegetables washed and prepared properly, avoid salad bars, etc. Naan, you mentioned that since you were found to be neutropenic (low white cell count) that your onc cautioned you not to eat any fruits or vegetables, even cooked. I hope that changes for you very soon. I have to say, I was surprised that even cooked were off limits. Were you able to eat canned veggies? Whatashocker, no one said no to the berries or yogurt, my only concern with the berries is I was using frozen, and I can't really account for how they are washed. Etherize, I'm sorry for what must be a very difficult decision for you. I wish you much success and minimal SEs with your treatment. Yes, I got the same reaction when I asked about IC, drink lots of water, which I always do. Not much else offered in the way of prevention. I only hope I bounce back between txs. Blessings and a good week to all, Laura",

Feeling housebound and miserable with these sores in mouth and throat. Hurts to eat drink swallow and talk. Does anyone know how long they last? I'm already on day 9 since tx. Praying they're gone before the next tx. Markat, so glad you're happy with your wig. Was sad tonight. My 27 yo daughter, who is pretty tough, broke down and cried. She said since all this started, she really sees the physical changes, and the reality has hit hard. I feel like I look like my gg, and that's still with my hair.

People used to be surprised at my age (53), now they'll be surprised to find that I'm only 53. Your adriamycin injection took 20 minutes? I think mine was no more than 5. I wonder if that makes a difference. Anyone know? I don't care if I sit there all day if it makes a difference in SEs. ESP if the effects worsen. I hope not for all of us.",
