Age 71  Tumor size 3 cm , stage IIb , grade 3 , 1/16 nodes , ER+/PR+ , HER2+++.  The onc claims that TCH is the most effective way but it might over kill the cells. Then he suggests weekly taxol + cyclophosphmaide (every 3 weeks) + herceptin without AC before.       I can't find any info about weekly taxol without AC , Is there anyone taking such treatment? Thanks for sharing. lamplam Log in to post a reply",
