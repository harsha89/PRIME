    "Content": "lovelynurse81 wrote: Ok here I go..... About 2 months or so ago I noticed a dull ache in my left breast. Never really painful just a dull ache with occasional sharp pains and burning. The ache felt as though it were coming from the outter part, near armpit. I didn't think anything of it b/c I couldn't feel a lump or anything. Since it was pretty constant I decided to call my Gyn and she wanted me to come in to assess the area. She felt \"thickening\" in the area and felt a mammogram was warranted. So I have the 3D mammo last week. Afterward the tech tells me not get dressed in case the radiologist wants more pics. She comes back and says I have to have an ultrasound. Initial freak out starts! I have the ultrasound that day. Next day I call and I'm told by my Gyn that the 2 breast specialists say I need a biopsy and I am then forwarded to the breast center. My biopsy is scheduled for Jan 6 which seems like a yr away! I'm 33, I have 4 kids that I breast fed, I didn't expect this. I'm scared and hate the unknowing has consumed me...it's the holidays, I should b happy. Thanks for reading, I know it was long Log in to post a reply",
