You made so many great points and I appreciate your kindness. Tomorrow she will have it done. After reading your post, I called and confirmed that someone would be there by her side and they assured me there would be. That means a lot. ((Hugs)) back to you. Thank you again",

Now my stressed-out college daughter has had 3 masses ultrasounded and now needs 3 core needle biopsies. I have had one before. They are not horrible but not pleasant either. My heart is breaking that she has to endure 3! They will not give her anything else besides the local. How can you get laughing gas when you visit the dentist, but there is nothing we can give to people in this extreme situation? Has anyone else had multiple biopsies in one visit? I am wondering if she should just get them surgically removed so she doesn't have to endure all the biopsies. Also, best case scenario, even if they turn out benign, she still has 3 breast lumps to now follow up with/watch. I'm just struggling since this is my child. I feel like I have enough biopsy history where she should get a pass. :(. Thanks in advance for any help/ insight you can provide Log in to post a reply",

One on each side. The left side has 2 supposedly fibroadenomas inthe same quadrant so that\u2019s why that dr said 3 wasn\u2019t necessary. Thoughts or experience on this? I want to be viligant for my daughter\u2019s sake but also 3 core needles sound awful. I am also disappointed no one responded to my first writing.
