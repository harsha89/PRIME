If at any time your instinct tells you otherwise please go back and get the fibroadenoma biopsied. I also want to share more of my story with you but I want you to understand my intentions are only to bring awareness, not to scare you.I also don't like to overstep boundaries, but I do feel like one of the reason why I am here to day is to share my story with other women and make drs start taking note that young women are being misdiagnosed. The day of my first mammogram and ultrasound the radiologist came into the room to read the results to me. He swept in with confidence and told me I had nothing to worry about that this little lump was just a fibroadenoma. True to my assertive nature, I started asking questions like \"why does he think that its benign\" and \"how can he tell from a little image\". I think he was insulted, but he indulged me with the same checklist that all drs go by. He said first of all you have no family history of bc ( I have a big family with lots of women and none have had it). He said taking in to account my age (36), my health, and the way the lump appears on both the mammo and ultrasound (he showed mehow smooth the shape was and something about the shadow it cast), that this lump has all the characteristics of a benign fibroadenoma. He also added that I could leave it in and it would dissolve in 5 years. I asked to have it cut out. He could see that it worred me. He casually said \"well we could biopsy it to be 100%\". Please note, he had no sense of urgency at all. I still wanted it cut out. So he said for me to make an appointment with a surgeon. A week later I met with a breast surgeon and she (going on the mammo and ultra results) said the same exact thing (she is one of the best in the state). She acknowledged that I was worried and if it made me feel better that she would remove it. She said no rush on the surgery. Again, no sense of urgency. A month later I had a simple outpatient procedure to remove it. I was back to work 4 days later.  Thats when i got the dreaded call from my surgeon telling me I have invasive ductal carcinoma. Her exact words were that she was dumbfounded that this was bc. She praised my tenacity and instinct. She said she had no idea this was cancer. She also said, I will survive this because I caught it in time. I went through a second surgery to get clear margins and a node biopsy. I was at stage 1 and the tumor was very small. I had 33 rounds of rad and now I am on tamoxifen.  I was my surgeons second patient in a year was young, no history, mammo and ultra checked out ok and she was told it was a cyst and to keep an eye on it. It turned out to be cancer as well. I guess my point in telling you all of this is that you are your own advocate and follow your instinct. Ask a ton of questions and demand answers. I do hope and pray it is nothing at all to worry about and that you take from all of this a sense of self-awareness and enpowerment when dealing with drs. Again, hope I am not overstepping boundaries and I know you will take all of our advice on the forum and pave your own way. Take care of yourself.",

I know you are nervous, scared, shocked, etc..I still am. I have to remind myself every morning that I HAD bc. Still hard to swallow. I did a lumpectomy, radiation and now on Tamoxifen. My radiation was not bad at all. Made me a little tired, but all in all nothing major. I had two surgeries and they went very well. The tamoxifen therapy is not wonderful, but I am adjusting to the SE's gradually. Someone on this board (can't remember cause tamox makes me forget) said that if you have SE's from Tamox, then its doing its job. That is comforting I guess . I did not have to do chemo because my Oncotype Dx was a 2. Although, I had resigned to do chemo before I knew the Oncotype results.  Remember, all of the information you get on this board, good or bad, you know what is best for you. Follow your instinct and you will know the right choices to make regarding your treatment. I wish there was something I could say to make you feel better about what you are going through. You are not alone. Hang in there. Carmen",
