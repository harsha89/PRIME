I noticed recently while being driven to various follow-up appointments that my vision for distance is fairly fuzzy. I had no issues before. My surgeon today said that general anesthesia can cause this for several weeks, though I can't find confirmation of this online. Has anyone else experienced this and did your vision return to normal? Secondly, I notice I have some sort of spasm - not painful - in what may be my urinary tract...perhaps vagina. Kinda hard to tell, I'm embarrassed to day. But I was told a catheter during surgery can cause bladder spasms and again, it should go away on its own. However after researching online it appears bladder spasms cause an immediate need to urinate and I don't have that issue. Wondering once again, if anyone has experienced something similar? I especially notice it at night when I'm trying to relax to go to sleep...basically whenever I'm very still. Thank you!
