I was originally diagnosed with one area and like you, I said the BRCA would make the decision for me. It ended up coming back negative. But an MRI biopsy ended up showing yet another area of DCIS, so the mastectomy decision was made for me. I decided to do bilateral, because I wanted symmetry, but my main reason was that couldn't go through the stress every 6 months of scans and biopsies wondering if I'm going to get cancer on the other side. I had my surgery 2 weeks ago and I have no regrets. I can't speak to yhe implants because I had DIEP reconstruction.",

I was told by a doctor that does DIEP but he prefers implants that I did not have enough stomach tissue to even make one Breast. Well I left him and went to a skilled microsurgeon and he was able to give me not 1, but 2 small C breasts.",

I have already had some atypical cells on the other side so I'm just counting on the fact that there's a good chance that will turn into something and just have a feeling that the pathology may show that there is already something there. 2. I just want both sides to be the same 3. Even though I know there is reoccurrence risk even with mastectomy, I'm so tired of scans every 6 months, and I've had 7 biopsies in the last year. So I know if I keep my \"good\" Breast, the constant 6 month stress will continue. Before I found out that it was in multiple areas I was all ready to just do a lumpectomy, but after I found out it had to be mastectomy, I immediately had a double in mind.",

When I first diagnosed, I thought I would do lumpectomy with radiation but decided that if my BRCA testing came back positive that I would do a mastectomy. Well the BRCA testing came back negative but I found out from further testing that I had multiple areas of DCIS in one Breast and is was high grade, so I ended up with mastectomy and reconstruction. Meeting with the surgeon will definitely help give you a lot more information and guidance in the options available. It is a very scary time, but you will feel a little better once a game plan is in place. I'm here if you need to talk!",
