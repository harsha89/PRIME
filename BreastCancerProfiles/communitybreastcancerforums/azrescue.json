I really haven't been comfortable with the thought of having two additional (both of which would be ultrasound guided) biopsies all on the basis \"well wer're here might as well do them too\". The new dr. is not a breast only surgeon. I live in AR now (lived in AZ for many years) and we do not have a major medical center in our local area. I had talked to my husband about the fact that I'd really want us to have a good plan ready to go in case the biopsy did come back malignant. We are contacting MD Anderson in Houston, TX. There is a dr here in the area that is suppose to be the \"best around here\" for breast surgery. Also, considering making an appointment with him for a second opinion. I really just want to get to the bottom of all of this & get on with life. I agree with the other posters on that and that there is a chance I am going to just have to do it anyway. So, currently waiting on call from Houston, making appt with local dr here for another opinion & saying lots of prayers.  Thank you everyone!!!! Stephanie",

      "Content": "azrescue wrote: Hello all, I am new here. I as many have looked all over the internet for answers, and advice. I realize that all that does is make me that much more anxious. The good is I came across this forum. So, here is some background on how I got here: I was breastfeeding my 2 year old. And decided it was time to wean. Right at the end of nursing she began not latching on well to the lt breast, so I began nursing her only on the right side. I weaned her totally about 6-7 weeks ago now. I do not remember the exact timing but I did notice a lump on the right side. I thought it was probably related to nursing so I just waited, but it remained. So back on Nov 27th, I had a diagnositic mammogram & an ultrasound. They said they saw nothing on the mammogram (I have since found out from a different physician that the reason is due to very dense breast). The ultrasound seemed to be going well; then the technician stepped out to get the radiologist. The radiologist didn't like what she saw. She said, \"this might very well be cancer. We need an mri & biopsy as soon as possible\". Ok so know I am TOTALLY freaked out!!!! Well, due to some issues at this particular dr's office, I have switched to a new physician. Much more compassion & care. I have had the mri w/contrast done; as well as, a repeat ultrasound. The mri does show something. The radiologist gave it a birad 4. However, on the latest ultrasound they were unable to find the same size abnormality as the original ultrasound. I have mentioned to all the dr's that myself and husband both feel as if it has gotten smaller. In fact, they asked me at the ultrasound if I could help them locate the area. And, I had a harder time finding it. In the past week, it has the feel of less \"bulky\" feeling and more like a bunch of small lumps. It isn't painful except around the time of my period. Which is pretty typical for me. Soooo ... the recommendation is: 1) go ahead with an MRI guided biopsy & two ultrasound guided biopsies (for two small round spots in the left breast, both of which the radiologist said he is confident they are not cancerous but just said we should biopsy since we are already doing the right). OR 2) wait 3 months and redo the MRI and see if the there are changes. The dr is okay with either decision. She said that because of the fact that I am just coming off breastfeeding and your breast go through so many changes during that time she is okay with waiting the 3 months. Of course, the downside to waiting is the not knowing & if it is cancer then treatment is being delayed by 3 months. I just don't know what to do. One day I am okay with waiting the 3 months because I do feel like it has gotten smaller & why go through a biopsy if I don't need to (have read so much on the internet how about how bad biopsies are & the possible spreading of the cancer cells). The next day, I am wreck wondering if I have cancer. I have two small children (6 and 2 1/2), I lost my dad to testicular cancer when I was 15. I can't imagine my children enduring the same. Any advice, comments, etc would be so greatly appreciated. I am scared! Thank You ....  Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "azrescue wrote: I am so frustrated & depressed over the unknown. All of this began for me back in Nov 2012. I found a lump in my right breast. However, I was in the process of weaning my daughter at the time. I went to a breast center. There they did a diagnostic mammo, which showed nothing. Apparently, I have very dense breast. So, they did an ultrasound. The dr came in & said \"oh! I don't like the look of that. There is to much very active blood flow. We need you in for a biopsy asap. This looks like cancer\" ... I was of course in a state of shock. And very not impressed with this dr & her complete lack of care & concern. They scheduled the mri & biopsy. However, they called me back before I even got home & said there was an issue with my insurance not wanting to allow the mri. Needless to say this issue went on & on. In the process, I changed to another dr., a surgeon. She came highly recommended. She was able to get me in for an mri & ultrasound. But didn't want to worry about a biopsy till we took a closer look. So, the mri did show an area of concern. And that ultrasound they said there is something different but it is difficult to see it on u/s. My dr's recommendation at that time was either 1) go ahead with a biopsy or 2) wait 3 months ... Let my breast settle some from the weaning & at that point repeat the mri & see if it changes. My husband & I asked repeatedly what she felt was best & if we did wait was there an issue with getting the second mri. The dr (the surgeon) said she really felt like it is a b9 issue due to just weaning. And that she was confident in my waiting the 3 months & that absolutely would be no issue with having another mri. WELL ... My 3 month mark came. And my insurance denied my pre auth for the mri. We appealed it., the dr called the ins for a peer review and still denied! So, she said the next best thing was another ultrasound. I did do that & they said they saw no changes. It all looked the same. So, I am suppose to repeat an ultrasound & diagnostic mammo in Sept. But, I just can't get over this \"what if?\" what if the ultrasound just isn't accurate enough? Oh yeah and the mri picked up two VERY small round nodules in my left breast. But they are much to small for ultrasound. I do have pain in and around my right breast off and on. However, it does seem to be somewhat cyclical. Usually, just before or during my period or while ovulating. It has been six months now since I weaned my daughter. The dr said it can take up to a year for your breast to really normalize. Could it be just that? It is hard at times for me to stay positive ... In the same time frame that I have been dealing with this I have had 3 family members dx'd with various cancers (aunt - lung cancer passed away last week; a 27 yr old male cousin rare stomach cancer - life expect 2-5 years; and a 35 yr old female cousin breast cancer stage 3). Another aunt had a stroke. And in Nov my inlaws came for the holidays, the 1st week of Dec my father in law suffered a stroke. They have been living with us since. He is not doing well & has other medical conditions. So ... I just REALLY hope & pray that I am ok. Should I wait till Sept for another ultrasound? So I push for one sooner? Should I see yet another dr? What about thermography? Is it worth it? Or should I just take a deep breath & trust that it is really is ok? Is the breast pain normal with cancer? So sorry for going on and on but I just really need some support. Feel so overwhelmed. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",

But my family & I are willing to do so if we feel that means better care. I do not want to go through this again. So the RO at my treating facility is recommending 6 weeks of radiation (5 weeks with 1 week boost). They would be using the breath hold technique & would incl the intermammary lymph nodes. She said they are particularly aggressive with me being triple negative. Today we met with a ro here at home. He is recommending 4 weeks (3 weeks with 1 week boost), no breath hold, & the intermammary would only be what just does fall into the field. He said he's been using this for several years now. Based off the Canadian studies. And it is what he uses on most of his patients. My cancer was on the right side so the breath hold may not be as important. My dx was idc stage 3 with positive lymph nodes. The original tumor was 5.8 cm. I have already done my chemo. And I am 3 weeks post surgery (bilateral mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection). I did have pCr !!! :). And I am triple negative. I have read through a couple articles in regard to the Canadian study & it seems like there is something to the 4 week treatment. But ... I didn't see anywhere that it said anything about triple negative. Big decision. Interested in your thoughts. Thank you.",
