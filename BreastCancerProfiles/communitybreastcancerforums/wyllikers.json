I hope you all have a wonderful week! Wyllikers",

I had my port placed today and I am pretty sore tonight.  I think I'm having a reaction to the Steri Strips because there is a red ring around both incision sites.  Hopefully, the strips can be removed in a couple of days. I am participating in a clinical trial for chemo.  Tomorrow I will find out if I will be on AC-T or TC and should begin treatment on Thursday.  20 weeks vs. 18 weeks, mustard gas derivative vs tree bark derivative.  If I didn't take part in the study, the default chemo would be AC-T, so my only chance to have TC was participation.  Wish me luck! Good vibes and wishes for no SEs for everyone!",

We are all sisters.  We will support each other with love, kindness, and understanding.  I'm so grateful for BCO and all the ladies here who have made me feel not so alone.  Bless us all! Wyllikers",
