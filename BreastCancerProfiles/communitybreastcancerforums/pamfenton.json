      "Content": "pamfenton wrote: I recently had a C/T scan to rule out mets and was told all was okay.  A week later onc called and said there was \"air in the bladder\".  After doing tons of research on this, and asking all the docs I know (I am a baby/OB nurse so they are not oncs or radiologists) it seems there are really only two reasons for this finding.  One is a fulminating, life threatening UTI, which I clearly don't have and U/A confirmed I do not.  I feel absolutely fine. The other is a fistula or tracking/tunneling, usually from the colon, secondary to colon cancer.  I talked to my onc yesterday and he said all he could get out of the rad, was that it was a \"curious\" finding.  I am thnking that I am not comfortable with \"curious\".  I think they should reach out to all their radiology friends and find out if this finding is ever benign(btw, when first dx'ed all MDs thought I had colon cancer as well as breast because so many hot spots showed up on PET scan.  Post polyp removal they seemed okay at last PET which was two years ago.)   I had a 5 cm tumor that was missed by these same radiologists for several years worth of mammograms. I think they owe me (and it is their medical duty) to find out more about this. Am I wrong? What should I do? What do you think?  This is all I am thinking of and need input.

My 22 yr old daughter broke her elbow snowboarding last week and had surgery yesterday.  5 hrs for what they thought would take 2 1/2.  Major joint fractures, really awful.Two 6 in steel plates and 3 screws she will have the rest of her life.  I am giving her so many pain pills I am up there watching her respirations constantly. It is her last semester of college( mech engineering and exercise physiology)  Forgive me but I am so proud of her, she has already been accepted to a PhD program where she will be designing implants and prosthetics for Iraqi vets. So it is so ironic she has this trama now. Sorry to ramble and brag.  I have two other kids who took the 7 yr route to finishing college...BUt, Sunshine, I am so proud of you!",
