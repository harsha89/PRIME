My pathology report from my core biopsy shows ER/PR positive, HeR2 1+ negative. I have been suffering from Endometriosis, uterine fibroids since Im 34 and most recently told I have a 7cm hemorrhagic ovarian cyst. My dr was actually going to remove it but my BC was discovered and my uterus treatment came to screeching halt. I am wondering if my uterus problems are the reason I have cancer now and or what are the chances that cyst turns out to be more? Will the BS check if I have cancer anywhere else? This is so scary and Im trying so hard to stay strong for my family. I am so happy I found this forum and read so many stories of such brave woman.

I never had a port and Im guessing the chemo was too much on my veins. They would get inflammed and with each treatment it was harder for the chemo nurse to find a good vein. My oncologist is confident that 7 treatments have done its job. So Im celebrating this morning at brunch with my closest Girl Friends! On to the next chapter (radiation) of this Journey!

The side effects were worse towards the end. I opted out of the port and received my treatments through IV, I ended up with deep vein blot clots... that being said, I\u2019d do it again. My MO explained that our bodies recover from chemo better when we are younger and if there was the tinyiest cell left, she would rather hit now than wait for recurrence. Im being treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering in NY and from what I read on these boards... they are the only ones that offer CMF (the chemo I was on)t I have not done anyrhing to prepare for rads . Ill pick up the creams they suggested this week. Good luck and healing vibes to you :)",

I dont know why, but changing into the gown, walking into the Cancer Center daily, having the affected breast handled... just made me feel like a patient. I just wanted my old pre cancer life back and I thought I would feel like myself after chemo... but I don't. I met with my RO and she said I may feel side effects by the end of next week. She emphasized the breast may feel heavy. I will be sure to report any if they arise! Hope you all have a great day!",

(My infusions were through IV not a port) please listen to your husband and go to ER for bloodwork and check your arms/legs for warm red areas. Good luck",

While I was getting CMF, I used a silk pillow at night, scrungies or clips to pull my hair back (instead of elastic hair ties) I only washed it 1 maybe 2x a week with baby shampoo. Absolutely no styling (dryer or flat iron) I lost about 30% (I had 7 rounds of CMF) I also had a big shed about a month after my last treatment. I started taking bition after radiation around Nov \u201818. Hang in there, your hair will get fuller again ((hugs))",
