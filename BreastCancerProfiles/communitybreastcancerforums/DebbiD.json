The fluid in my breast is still \"drainable\".  Maybe I should have it aspirated again and see if it will stop accumulating. I'll call my surgeon today and see what he thinks.   Thanks again. Debbi",

Treatment begins next week.   Is anyone else in this trial? Do you know someone who is?  My husband and I have done a lot of research and know Avastin is controversial. We would like to hear from someone's personal experience, if possible, about how things have gone for you.  Thanks much! Debbi ...Standing on the Rock!
