I didn't start taking any supplements or eating foods known to impact the effectiveness of chemo until I was finished with treatment. I figured if I had to go through chemo, why take any chances that it wouldn't work as well as it was supposed to?! There's a website that lists foods and supplements that can impact the effectiveness of chemo. I'm sorry I don't have it as an attachment but, you can Google it or do a web search. All the best to you!",

I'm fortunate to work with medical professionals in a research hospital, thus, I have many resources available to me. I was diagnosed a yr ago w/TNBC; had lumpectomy; six rounds of chemo (TAC every third week); then, a procedure called \"direct-to-implant\". The procedure is a mastectomy and placement of implants all in one surgery. It has been a great decision that I will never regret, as I didn't have to go through multiple surgeries, with expanders, etc, which is the most common mastectomy procedure. My oncologist is a nationally known researcher, specializing in TNBC. A higher percentage of TNBC patients carry one of the two BC genes, BCRA-1 or BCRA-2, compared to other BC diagnoses. My gene tests were negative. However, my oncologist said she would remove my ovaries, if the gene test results had been positive, as there would be a significantly higher risk of developing ovarian cancer. Chemo is a known killer of TNBC cells and research continues, to determine regimines and subtyping of cells, to tailor chemo accordingly. Personally, I didn't want to worry about a recurrence in my other breast, as my cancer was grade III (most aggressive). It gave me peace of mind, to have a double mastectomy and, being 51, I'll never have saggy breasts and I don't have to wear a bra!!! There's gotta be something good about this, right?! As far as chemo goes, take your anti-nausea meds and let people help you. Take good care. You will get through this! We are all sisters and we're here for you!",
