Because of the intense pain from the lump after three months... Like flashes everytime i exercice, they decided to remove the lump and analyse it again. (Excisional biopsy). The results take forever to come since i am in the caribbeans. Waiting for an appointement, my breast today does NOT hurt. First time in three months. Maybe i won't need the surgery. ??? I will let you know",

The pain was kinda gone after 10 days and came back. Just like if someone keeps pressing on a bruise. I am not seeing many comments on : After great biopsy",

I went to the doctor who said I had breast abcsess and gave me antibiotics for 7 days. Redness was gone but still had pain and a big hard lump. I went back to the doctor who did an ultra sound. Results: milk duct plugged with debris (I am not breastfeeding nor pregnant). Ultrasound also state that the mass has angular margin. Homogeneous in apperance, no vascular flow within. No lymph node. Biopsy was done a week ago (its been almost 2 months now that i have the symptoms and the lump). Results take 2 to 3 weeks..... I have NO idea what to think or what to do...I start my day happy and then cry ... then laugh..and can't focus.... Anyone with the same breast condition diagnosed with any type of breast cancer who wants to share their story?",
