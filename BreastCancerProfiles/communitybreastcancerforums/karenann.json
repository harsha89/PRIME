Did you experience pressure change on your trip?  An increase or decrease in altitude?  If so, maybe you are experiencing what I had. I hope you feel better soon. Karen ",

The question about Her2... the best place to get that question answered is the Her2 Support Group board.  I know that most DCIS is Her2+++ but 1mm of invasive cancer, I am not sure about that.  I was under the impression that the Her2 status is always tested, however, I don't know if size is an issue.

There is a site for Her2+ bc, the website is www.Her2support.org.  Christine and Joe started the site after Christine's cancer metastisized to her brain and lungs, I think about 9 years ago.  There are many women on that site living with cancer and have been for a long time. It also helps to see what other women who are Her2+ with mets are receiving for treatment. Hope this helps. Karen ",
