I think she is extremely knowledgeable and originally, when I was misdiagnosed as having DCIS (biopsy done at Mt Sinai) she spent over an hour with my husband and me, explaining everything and outlining options. She even arranged a consult with a top notch PS on the same day! Don't know anything about MSK's pgm, but I truly trust Dr Schnabel, who really knows her stuff. Additionally, the nurse she works with, Deirdre, is always available by email when questions pop up and is very responsive. Only downside with NYU, I think, is that it feels somewhat like a factory, but maybe that is inevitable in any large medical facility?",

Afterwards, I underwent an excisional biopsy (lumpectomy), which I understand is usually standard procedure. The rationale for this is to make sure that the ADH is not obscuring something more serious-- usually DCIS. This occurs in about 20% of cases. So yes, while the ADH itself is benign, it's important to remove it to make sure that nothing more ominous lurking. As others have pointed out, the \"chemo prevention\" your doctor mentioned refers to preventive meds for women at high risk-- tamoxifen, or, evista or aromatase inhibitors for those who are post-menopausal. This is NOT the usual \"chemo\" we hear about women with BC getting. These meds are usually then for 5 years Fwiw, when I received my dx, my breast surgeon, who is the head of the department at a prominent NYC hospital, said quite adamantly that mastectomy was not indicated at all. Perhaps this would be different if you had a strong family hx and/or were BRCA +, but that's not your situation. I do think that the excisional biopsy is completely appropriate, however. After that, if hopefully all you are dealing with is the ADH (which is the most likely outcome), then meeting with an oncologist can help you to better understand your personal risk and what your prevention/monitoring options are.",

So, in the event you do have it removed, you will most likely be put on a 6 month high risk rotation of mammos, ultrasound, and MRI's.

Most likely because the level of Ki67+ cells reflects hormone-induced proliferation of breast cells and after menopause there is much less of this. But, may be testing a larger cohort and more sensitive assays can change this, although knowing your risk at younger age could help with setting up more personalized screening strategies. Ideally we would like to eliminate these proliferating cells, so then we could decrease breast cancer incidence. I really hope that some of the strategies we are trying out now will work.

Now, this morning, I get a call from the hospital confirming the MRI appt, but apparently I was misinformed-- MRI results take 24 hrs to come back-- thus, there is no point in meeting with BS that same afternoon to discuss results we do not have. Had to reschedule her for Monday. This means 3 more days in the vacuum of no results and imagining the worst. It's little details like this that can send me over the edge, even when I know logically that so many women gave so much more to deal with.

It's not the reports you want read elsewhere, it's the slides with the actual tissue samples. I wonder, though, if it would make sense to wait until you have the excisional, as perhaps it may reveal something more conclusive? Regardless of whether the conclusion of the needle biopsy is ADH, DCIS, or something \"borderline\", the next step would be the excisional procedure anyway. In the beginning, I was very caught up in nailing down exactly what I had in there-- cancer or not cancer? Over time (6.5 years) it bothers me less. Keep in mind that the whole DCIS/ADH diagnostic process is along a continuum, not a clear cut dichotomy. Whatever I had catapulted me into the high risk category, unfortunately. And yes, I would agree that your family hx has to be factored in. Has anyone suggested genetic testing? Hang in there and press for the answers you want. One thing I definitely learned throughout this experience is that you have to advocate for yourself!

After a stereotactic biopsy 2 years ago, the initial dx was DCIS. However, when I chose a breast surgeon to consult with who was from a different hospital from the first where my slides were initially analyzed, she wanted them looked at again by the pathologists at hospital #2-- dx was downgraded to borderline DCIS/ADH. When I chose an oncologist from yet a third hospital, he insisted my slides be looked at a third time(!) by hospital #3-- dx was now pure ADH. So, you see, there can be considerable disagreement, and this was at 3 major highly respected facilities in NYC. Bottom line: don't be afraid to get a second (or even a third) opinion.

I know that the very notion of seeing an oncologist can be disturbing, but he/she should be able to give you a more accurate picture of your overall risk, in addition to discussing prevention strategies. The ADH finding does put you on a high risk category and it's likely you will be monitored on a 6 month rotation. Because you have dense breasts, regular ultrasounds and MRI's can see more than mammos. Remember that the majority of women with ADH are ultimately never dx'ed with breast cancer. Feel free to PM me if you have more questions. Unfortunately, I have learned a lot about this.",

I was also initially concerned about my monitoring protocol, since it seemed like the standard was mammo + us together, and then MRI 6 months later.  When I asked my BC why she was not using this schedule, she said that she tailors the follow up to each individual pt and that in my case, she did not feel that an annual MRI was warranted. ",

It\u2019s possible that the needle biopsy did not remove the entire area, and in addition, the excisional biopsy (essentially lumpectomy) is wise because in about 20% of cases, DCIS or IDC is found. So the needle biopsy results may possibly not be the whole story (although the odds are definitely in your favor), and in that sense your pathology results are not yet final. In terms of future treatment, there will usually be increased screenings (every six months), with some combo of mammograms, MRIs and perhaps ultrasounds. There are also preventive med options that can increase your chances of remaining cancer free: tamoxifen, raloxifene , or an aromatase inhibitor (the latter 2 if you are post-menopausal). After you get your excisional biopsy results, a consult with an oncologist can be helpful. Feel free to PM me if you have more questions- I\u2019ve been dealing with this for over 7 years.  ",

ADH and DCIS run along a continuum and distinguishing between them can be tricky and often rather subjective, so a focally severe ADH lesion would be one that borders on meeting the criteria of DCIS. (I am pretty sure of this-- perhaps someone can chime in and confirm this?). If you had more than one focus of ADH, that would be multi focal. FWIW, when I was dx'ed I got 3 opinions from 3 different hospitals on my pathology from the needle biopsy: the first said dcis, the second classified it as ADH bordering on DCIS (in other words, severe ADH) and the third said just ADH. Both the oncologist and the breast surgeon I saw (and continue to see) said it didn't make a difference from a prognostic point of view. It was only one tiny focus",

Two years ago I felt totally blindsided when a routine mammogram found micro -calcifications that required a biopsy. I felt like I was Alice falling down the rabbit hole. I was over 20 years older than you are and, as many others here have said, your age definitely counts in your favor. And btw, in my case, the result was not cancer, but pre -malignant tissue, which was removed. But, more importantly, although I can certainly understand that you are overwhelmed and terrified now, I would urge you to put your phone back together again! My rationale is this: so long as the phone is dismantled, you cannot receive information that has an approx 80% chance of offering you relief-- so, as long as you prevent yourself from getting those results, you leave yourself in a painful limbo where you can only imagine catastrophic results. It is an awful situation to be in, to be sure, but you need to hear the facts so that you can breathe a huge sigh of relief and end your torture, or, in the unlikely (20%) case of the news you don't want, you can move forward.

I had my first mammogram 6 months after the surgery to get a new baseline. Anyway, I think that if you had a substantial reduction, it is fair to assume that some if the ducts were removed?  Ask your PS for clarification.  How much tissue was removed?  I went from a 34D to a 34B.  Both my PS and onc believe that this reduces my risk somewhere in the neighborhood of 50%-- sure hope they're right! (Btw, I also developed a small hole about 3 weeks post op at the junction where the IMF met the vertical incision.  I was told this is quite common.  I kept it covered with gauze and Neosporin and it healed completely after a week or so.)",

Now that I have told close friends and family about the likely diagnostic change, everyone is congratulating me and telling me to celebrate, but I feel quite the opposite.  While it is unquestionably good that I do not have cancer now, I feel like now I must be watched and monitored in a way that will make me crazy and anxious, and that if I do end up with a BC Dx, there is of course the chance that it could be invasive (which, at least, the DCIS was not.)  My doctor is now planning a lumpectomy on 3/8, and while I am relieved at not having to face massive surgery so soon, she says she would refuse to do the BMX if the current diagnosis of ADH is confirmed by the lumpectomy results.  Of course, I respect her medical opinion, but the \"solution\" that I had found for myself, as imperfect as it was, is now off the table... Just feeling very confused about what all this will mean for my future and feel that if BC is in my future (some studies I have read put it as an increased risk of about 400%), I would much prefer to get it all over with now, rather than be paralyzed with fear every 6 months.  We'll see what the breast surgeon has to say when I meet with her this Wednesday, but for the present, while everyone is happy and congratulating me, I feel oddly worse. ",
