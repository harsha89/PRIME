But when I went to bed my skin started itching like crazy at the edge of the humongous dressing from Friday's simple mx. Tried to just loosen it, but was getting too near my one drain. The plan was to remove the dressing and pain ball at home during the BS office hours tomorrow. Could not stand to haul that big dressing around anymore and couldn't get rid of the itch. So I peeled the whole thing off, pulled out the 2 pain ball catheters, and changed the drain dressing. There are very helpful directions for removing the pain ball catheters at askyoursurgeon.com (they sell ONQ pain balls). And then I applied leftover rad lotion to the itchy spots, washed all the betadine (that orange stuff) off my chest, put on an XL tee shirt, took a pain pill and sat down to write this! Ahh, that is comfort. I'm very happy that I did this simple mx with no node dissection. My shoulder and armÂ  are completely uninvolved. Of course my new incision is more than a foot long and is ugly as sin. I would never make the scar project. But back, shoulders and both arms work more naturally now. I think BS must have freed up some scar tissue from previous mx. Her incision begins right at the edge of the old one. She seems to have left more chest tissue so the incision is not so tight as the old one. Of course the previous BS had to be sure to take out all the tumor without actually seeing it (sneaky lobular tumor masquerading as normal tissue) -- that's how I imagine it anyway. Icing on the cake would be to have some small LCIS foci in the pathology report to make this medically worthwhile. But the comfort is so much improved I'm glad I went for it anyway. You all having recon have a much longer road to travel. So maybe you need to protect the site but I can't imagine sending you to a store for a bra so soon after surgery. I always have more trouble with swelling where the node dissection was done 2 years ago if I wear even the lightest bra.",

My BS insisted on an SNB if I did not have the MRI. She is willing to go with no SNB given the clear MRI. I have a feeling she wouldn't mind doing the SNB, but at this point I am going to skip it. Recovery from the first mx was a year-long horror show (because of other cancers to treat) so right now my main concern is keeping the arm and shoulder as good as possible. I'm sure at the last minute before the OR the BS could get me to sign a permit for mx and SNB and probably it would not make much difference in recovery.",

I don't know her stage or any other info, but the good part is this was 12+ years ago and she is still OK and working. She brought it to the attention of her BS and MO and rather resented the fact that they didn't thank her for doing so. Instead silly remarks were made about how her cancer was thriving on the drugs. I cannot believe how horrible these doctors can be. It is not as if they have a great track record of diagnosis and treatment to brag about. I read somewhere that when one large tumor is shrunk or removed, the nutrients it had been using are then available to make a very small tumor to suddenly start growing faster. Sorry I don't remember where I read that. Let us know what happens, OK?",

It was rather dramatic -- PT worked on it for three months, then one day after the warmup (arm-cycling for 5 min on low resistance) I did a stretch for a few seconds, then suddenly there was no resistance. I held the stretch for a few minutes and skipped the other exercises that day. It felt great. That was one year ago and one year after surgery. I still have something pulling between the incision and the armpit but some of that is probably due to radiation and I don't really want to open up the \"cancer side\" again for a minimal benefit. Nearly full ROM is back, though I have little arm strength at full extension. My reach exeeds my grasp! Because PT helped, I'm taking a chance and having a simple prophylactic mx on the other side this month. I have a clear MRI so there will be no SNB, no lymph node touching allowed. I have found it very difficult to live with one large breast. I feel off balance and it can't good for trunk muscles. I consider myself too old for reconstruction and my best chance for a somewhat normal life is to go flat at home and have a couple of foobs for going out. Thanks for this wonderful site, and for this thread, which describes perfectly my experience/concerns so far. I don't post a lot, but I read a little nearly every day. Best of luck to all of you trying to find QOL after treatment. It is elusive.",
