What a coincidence that I finally shared with my hubby at dinner earlier that I have been sad more now than before and I was going to ask my mo for some meds to help control it. So if it makes you feel better we all go to the place we shouldn't but we are human. I also have a 10 year old that did not want me to wear my bald head out so anytime I went out and we were together I wore that hot azz wig and many days I felt like taking it off before getting home. As far as the guilt goes I think thats just being a mom. We want to take care of our family but feel bad when they have to take care of us. I still struggle with the fact that I'm not the same person I was 6 months ago and my boys for literally the first time in their lives see me sick. Many times i fake how i feel so that they dont see me hurting. If u can't get your emotions under control I would ask for some meds to help. Feeling sad is normal for many stage IVers. ",
