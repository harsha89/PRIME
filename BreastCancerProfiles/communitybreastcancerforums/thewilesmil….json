Just reading through everyones posting is taking the mumbo out of the jumbo talk. I'm calling to make my apointment with the surgion today.  I imagine he/she will be the one who will go over the mamogram/ultrasound results and explain what will happen next, if anything. As I said before, I already have experience with cancer. When I was 20 I had a rare cervical carcinoma, not just for type and stage but my age. Early diagnosis saved my life there and I hope if something is going on again it is found in treatable time.",

If it does, I'm good to go. If it doesn't, I call on moday and I have to go back to see her and schedule surgery for whatever. She didn't say what. :) Is it normal that Dr's don't openly communicate?  I was told I felt a lymph node, but when I looked on file when Dr was out of room(yes, I'm an anoying that way:D) it said that I felt fatty nodules, the biggest 8mm across. I do know these more than likely aren't cancer, but why wouldn't they tell me that?! Shouldn't these be biopsied just to be safe? Has anyone else had an experience with Dr's not fully explaining or leaving out details? Another thing, the one thing I felt didn't feel like a lypoma, I have one of those in my back and it is squishy. The fatty nodules aren't, their hard, but they can move around in the breast tissue. Thanks for listening.",
