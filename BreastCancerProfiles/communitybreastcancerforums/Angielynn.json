It's just that I feel I'm being given one statistic but seeing a different statistic on the web. I would really like to know what's the reality in this case.

I've been told that 80% of microcalcifications are benign, but I keep reading about linear branches being much more frequently cancer. Does anyone know the real percentage with this type of formation? I've seen some conflicting stuff on the web and I just want to know the truth. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
