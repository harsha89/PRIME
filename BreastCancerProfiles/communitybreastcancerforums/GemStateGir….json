It's sort of like having a port except the doctor uses it to put in the pain meds and then they're released over time. You can get more pain medication into your system this way than you can orally and you have less side effects. Here's a link to the Medtronic website and their discussion of their pain pump: http://www.medtronic.com/patients/chronic-pain/dev.... It's not something I need now but I'm glad to know it's out there in case I do need it some day. I hope you can find some relief soon. Once my pain was under control I felt like I had my life back.",

My doctor won't change treatment without a scan and always wants to see a trend in rising TMs before ordering one. During this time, I start to have pain and by the time a scan confirms my progression, the pain has gotten much worse. I usually can't wait to get on a new treatment by the time the doctor is ready to start me on it. It sounds like you can have rising TMs for quite awhile before you have any symptoms and therefore want to keep on your current treatment as long as possible before switching. So far that hasn't happened to me. But I'm glad you raised the issue because that is a problem for me--managing the switch to a new treatment. The first time I had significant progression (on Xeloda), I ended up with 4 or 5 fractures while I waited to change treatments and that's something I'd like to avoid in the future.",

I took it initially when I had ACT in 2011-2012 and never had any problems with neuropathy. I also took it with Xeloda last year and now with Halaven and again no neuropathy at all. Since I can't go back and do it all over again without taking L-Glutamine, it's hard to tell if that's the reason why I never got neuropathy but my oncologist said a lot of their patients are on it to deal with chemo side effects and it's an easy enough supplement to take. I use a heaping tsp of the powder mixed with a class of water twice a day. If you google \"l-glutamine for chemo side effects\" you'll get a bunch of articles to read on it. The other things it's supposed to help with is certain side effects of the GI system like mouth sores and diarrhea. I'm very susceptible to mouth sores and I haven't had that problem with any of the chemos I've done. At this point, L-Glutamine is like a security blanket for me because overall I've done very well with not having much in the way of troublesome chemo side effects. I would say it's worth a try because I don't think there's a downside to taking it. I also just found out the Halaven is working for me. I had a CT scan on Monday that showed my liver tumors decreasing or remaining stable. My tumor markers dropped from 1071 in February to 416 now and from my doctor's reading of the scan, my bones are healing. I'm also feeling much better (I had been having bad back pain) so things are looking up. And this is all just after a little over a month on Halaven. SyrMom--I also had recent swelling of my lower legs and my doctor also said it was a side effect of the Halaven and put me on a diuretic which worked. Unfortunately, despite taking it early in the day, it worked overnight but it is good not to have my legs feeling so heavy. Here's hoping we all get a long side effect-free run on Halaven! Pat",

I suspect that having very low white blood cells (i.e. the neutropenia) is the biggest culprit. I'm so sorry you're going through this.

I did develop low levels of potassium from taking Halaven and now take a daily supplement to keep it in normal ranges. I really hope you discuss this with your doctor. Hoping this is an easy fix for you. Eribulin may cause a condition that affects the heart rhythm (QT prolongation). QT prolongation can infrequently result in serious (rarely fatal) fast/irregular heartbeat and other symptoms (such as severe dizziness, fainting) that need medical attention right away. The risk of QT prolongation may be increased if you have certain medical conditions or are taking other drugs that may cause QT prolongation. Before using eribulin, tell your doctor or pharmacist of all the drugs you take and if you have any of the following conditions: certain heart problems (heart failure, slow heartbeat, QT prolongation in the EKG), family history of certain heart problems (QT prolongation in the EKG, sudden cardiac death). Low levels of potassium or magnesium in the blood may also increase your risk of QT prolongation. This risk may increase if you use certain drugs (such as diuretics/\"water pills\") or if you have conditions such as severe sweating, diarrhea, or vomiting. Talk to your doctor about using eribulin safely.",

Like you said, I get a good amount of shedding but it's not like it was with ACT. The nurse at my cancer center said she had someone on Halaven for almost a year and she never needed to wear a wig even though her hair kept thinning. I take biotin as part of my multi-vitamin and use shampoos with it but it's hard for me to tell if it makes a difference. I read on some other BCO thread that some oncologists don't want their patients using monoxidil. Not sure why but it might be a good thing to ask your doctor about first. I recently went wig shopping and just wanted to recommend the Jon Renau O'Solite collection. When I had ACT and lost all my hair I bought a wig I loved but it was uncomfortable and I couldn't wait to get it off my head after about 2 hours. The Jon Renau O'Solite wig I got is super comfortable and I can wear it all day. It really changed my attitude knowing that I can look good and not worry about what my thinning hair is going to look like because I can always pop on the wig. I also tried on hairpieces and may consider one of those for the summer because with those you don't feel them at all. I hope you enjoy wig shopping. I found it a lot fun--sort of like trying on shoes. Other companies make lightweight wigs too--what you want is something called \"capless construction\".

Coopdizzle--I'm hoping Halaven works for you and you don't have too many side effects on it. Have a great time on your Disney family trip. Eshinall--So far Halaven seems to be working well for me. It will be four months that I've been on it on Tuesday June 9th. The only side effect I have is some neuropathy which right now is controlled well with Neurontin. I'm also taking L-Glutamine powder twice a day for the neuropathy but it's harder to tell how much good that is doing. My doctor also has recommended acupuncture to me for the neuropathy and I will probably try that at some point to see if it helps. When I started Halaven back in February I was having a lot of pain--ribs, hips, spine (all places where I had mets). At the same time as starting chemo, I was starting on pain meds. It took me about 6 weeks to finally feel better and be able to taper off the pain meds. Around that time I also had a CT scan which showed regression in my liver and healing in my bones. So while the difference between how I felt in early February and mid-March was dramatic, it was not immediate. In my experience, at least, I think you have to give Halaven a month or more to see if it works. I'm very happy with the way I feel now. I'm on the lowest dose of extended release morphine and a small amount of a muscle relaxant that doesn't interfere with my life--I can drive, I'm not drowsy and I can do most of my old activities. I do have a compression fracture at L3 so I have to be careful but I'm not in any pain just a little stiffness sometimes. I ditched the walker and cane I needed in February and March and for the most part can pass as \"normal\". I'm not exactly sure how to answer your question about taking the anti-nausea medicine before your treatment tomorrow. I take one Zofran immediately before my infusion and it's given to me by the nurse. I haven't experienced any nausea on Halaven (and maybe that one Zofran is why) but I don't take any after my infusion at all. I guess if I were you, I'd take my nausea medicine with me to the appointment and ask your doctor or nurse about taking it. From my experience, taking Zofran 2 minutes before I get the infusion seems to work. I hope you find a way to keep your pain levels manageable while you're waiting for the Halaven to do its job. I know my oncologist was surprised it took 6 weeks for me to feel better so I got the impression for most people it works sooner than that. Hope that's the case for you! Pat",

I hope you find that happens with the gamma knife. Sometimes I think the most painful thing about this process is how it affects my DH and friends. Have you had any luck with doing a form of meditation--just focusing on your breathing and let it gradually get as deep as comfortably possible? My yoga teacher has been teaching us that if we focus on making the out breath as long as we comfortably can it will eventually kick in a relaxation response. I've actually done this in a doctor's office when I was stressed and it lowered my blood pressure dramatically. I will be thinking of you this afternoon and will be checking back for updates.

Mine mostly fell out in the shower and it got so I dreaded taking one. After about 5 days of that, I got the rest shaved off. Like most things I fear, it wasn't as bad as I expected. I was lucky to go through chemo in the winter so it seemed normal to always have something on my head. I think it would have been harder in the summer. The thing that was hardest for me was losing my eyelashes and most of my eyebrows. It was very difficult to adjust to how I looked without them. Because most people are so afraid of cancer, I hated going out in public when I didn't have hair and being \"the sick person\" but it's such a long time that you just have to make the best of it. Having cancer, in general, is hard for me because I don't like to be pitied and when you don't have hair there is no way to hide the fact of your disease. I had mixed feelings about my wig. I actually liked the way it looked and how easy it was to take care of. I've never been good at styling my own hair so it was kinda neat to be able to just plop the wig on and have it look good. But after about 2 hours of wearing it, I would develop a headache and couldn't wait to take it off. I don't know if anyone else wore Turban Plus's abbey cap when they didn't have hair (http://www.turbanpluswholesale.com/Merchant5/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Store_Code=TPW&Category_Code=ABY) but of all the things I tried that was the one I liked the best. It's kind of a combination of a scarf and a hat that stays on very well, is extremely comfortable, and can be arranged to give more volume to your head (if that makes sense). They're available on Amazon but I found them at my local cancer shop for much less.",

I was very scared and anxious about chemo beforehand.  Two things that helped me with the anxiety were listening to relaxation tapes and having a prescription for Xanax on hand in case I needed it.  The relaxation tapes I liked were by Belleruth Naparstek.  Here's a link to them online: https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/health/care/!ut/p/c4/FcpBCsMgEEDRs-QAwyAkOnYXor1Ca3eDGVIhahCbXr8Nf_f4-MJ_hc-0cU-18I5PDFFKl3bjz5oqnGmVio_rOxpvmTGUCpHjWy7j1lPcBYPz1iyT86Ct1qCUVzDb0QERTUYZM95pwSNn-s7D8AN76O4U/.  I found it really helpful to listen to one of them at the end of the day.  It would break the cycle of anxious thoughts for me and let me have a good night's sleep. I hope you have an easy time with the chemo.  I know it's possible from my own experience.  If you have any problems, I would advise mentioning them to your doctor right away.  If I hadn't mentioned feeling worse my 2nd AC cycle, I would never have had the conversation with my doctor about the water which turned out to be a simple solution to my problem. Good luck and keep us posted on how you're doing!",

I think I tried at least 3 others (including Wellbutrin) before I tried Cymbalta. It's worth perservering because if you find one that works it can help tremendously with dealing with this cancer crap. I hope you're successful in finding something that helps you.",

I got my Stage IV diagnosis in December last year and don't have a great feeling about my upcoming scans (either the end of this month or the beginning of January) because I also have pain in my back and (maybe) my ribs (I'm not really sure what rib pain feels like). It's hard to have the juxtaposition of all the holiday cheer when you're worried about your health. I hope it helps to know that there are people pulling for you. Keep us posted!",

You don't have to have a lot of node involvement to get it and it can appear at any time.  You could also search for breast, chest or truncal lymphedema on this site.  The other site to check out for information is http://www.stepup-speakout.org/.  I believe that the same women who provide advice on BCO's lymphedema forum also are involved in that site. I hope you get relief soon and it turns out to be an easy fix.",
