I'm 40 years old and Last October (2007) I found a lump in my right breast right above my nipple.  Needless to say that I was quite worried and immidiately made an appointment with my doctor who scheduled me for a mammogram and ultra-sound.  Both results came back ok...what a relief!  However since then the lump has gotten bigger (almost tripple in size) and is quite bothersome.  It's hard and I can move it around somewhat and the skin feels a little warm over the lump.  Anyways, I did go back to see my doctor last week and she seemed a little concerned. She was able to get me an appointment with a breast specialist for tomorrow morning.  I'm not sure what to expect and I'm very worried.  I'm trying to think positive but my mind is not cooperating very much.  I've spent all weekend on the internet googling lumps, breast cancer, cysts and I finally found this discussion forum...so here I am. Any advice?  Dx 8/20/2008, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IV, Grade 3, 10/13 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
