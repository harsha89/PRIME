Isonce my initial post my spontaneous bleeding became more frequent and so my Gyn called the surgeons office and the surgeon saw me the next day which was last Thursday. After examination they scheduled me for surgery which was today. The excision went well, 1 duct was the culprit now just waiting to get the path back",

My Dr. Ordered a Mammogram and Ultrasound and nothing was found on those. Currently I am having to wait 4 long weeks to see the General Surgeon who will deal with the Breasts but I am so worried to wait this long. So far the bleeding is the only issue/symptom I am having. I think because of the possibility of a benign papilloma in the duct it scares me more that they couldn't see anything on the Mammogram or ultrasound and the bleeding is getting worse everyday. Now I am having to put tissues in my bra so it doesn't leak onto my shirt. Has anyone else had bleeding like this and had something other than Breast Cancer? Log in to post a reply",

I asked the Dr if he saw any papillomas and he said he didn't but that the ducts are very small but I found that odd since he injected it with dye. He said he knows nothing until the pathology is back. I just have a strange feeling about the way he was answering my questions and he said he himself would call me and not the nurses from the office. Maybe I am just reading too much into it all, but from the start I have just had a strange feeling about it all! Only time and pathology will tell! I'll check back in with the results. I just want the answers, good or bad I can deal with it the hard part is not knowing.",
