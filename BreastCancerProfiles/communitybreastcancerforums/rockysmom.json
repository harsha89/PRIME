I'll suddenly find myself moving my arm akwardly like to try and unstick something. Don't know if that makes any sense. It's just an odd feeling I get and my bra gets uncomfortable. My back area I notice when I sit and lean back. It seems that if I can catch it in the \"uncomfortable underarm\" stage I can keep it pretty well controlled. If I don't notice that, I end up in some real pain trying to sleep.",

The Doctor is YOUR \"employee\", you have every right to insist on a biopsy if that is what you want. If he doesn't want to or gives you a hard time, by all means get a second opinion. I had my first \"lump\" over 20 years ago. Had a needle biopsy done and was told it was nothing. Doctor said they could remove it to make absolutely sure, but he was very confident is was just fibroid. I decided against surgery. However, after several months I was still worrying. Called the Doctor back and said I'd decided to have it removed. He said no problem and we got it out. Turned out to be just fibroid- so they were right. As for the amount of time passing- I cound my cancer mass in October. Didn't get the diagnosis until January, and surgery in Feb. A few extra months usually won't change the diagnosis. I hope you are able to enjoy the weekend without stressing too  much. (((hugs)))",
