It was ca 2cm, on the right side of the right breast, not hurting. We went to our GP and she said that it's probably just a blocked milk. We went to do some check and scan showed that it's not a liquid. Small sample was taken with long needle. After few days specialist told us that they don't know what it is but it should not be there. He mentioned something about dislocated tissue, infection or \"something else\" that they will have to cut. He also said that they have only found \"inflated cells\" (or inflamed). I tried to ask him what the first test should do but I didn't get any answer, just information that basing on her age, breastfeeding and that it grows quickly it \"might\" be just an infection. They did a core biopsy same day and now we have to wait another week for any answers. My wife is very calm and not showing that she's worried, but I have a darkest thoughts. It looks like milk is not causing this problem, but I thought that first sample is to confirm that it's a fat deposit or anything related to normal breast work which is not worrying. Â Now I also think that biopsy is to show what cancer it is. I don't have any experience with cancers, tumors, test etc. Can you please let me know if it's possible that scan and find needle sample will not show that it's an infection or just a lump related to breastfeeding? Apologies for not checking but it is a big shock for us to be in this situation, especially that she's not in the cancer related group (too young, no relatives with cancer etc). All I can find is information that core biopsy does not hurt and it's to take a sample of tissue, but can find anything why it has to be done even is first one was conducted. I am worried that first sample can show that it's something natural (fat, milk deposit etc) and if it's not found, it means there's a cancer there and core biopsy is conducted to find out what kind of cancer it is. If you could explain what's the difference between these two and if after core biopsy, something that doesn't require any surgery can be found? Thanks Log in to post a reply",
