My oncologist says that Femara doesn't depress the immune system, but it sure seems that I am healing more slowly and catch everything that comes around...  BTW, to answer your question, if taking the shot could prevent that illness, I'd take it in a heartbeat - that was the worst sickness I've ever had (and I'm 61 years old). I had both regular and H1N1 vaccines with no problem.",
