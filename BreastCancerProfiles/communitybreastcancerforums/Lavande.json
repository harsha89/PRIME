There seems to be a slightly seedy feel in the area beneath the dimple, but it's very subtle. There is an area near my L armpit which feels slightly denser to me. I called my OB-GYN yesterday and have an appointment in two days. I want to be sure that I ask the questions I need to ask. I had a normal mammogram in October 2016. Thank you for your thoughts.

Unfortunately in this case, one of my surgeons told me to \"run the other way as fast as possible\" if anyone \"tried to give you an MRI.\" Here I am, won't see my OB-GYN about this until Thursday and already concerned that not being able to get an MRI will interfere in my diagnosis.",

I don't want to bore the forum with all of them but the short list includes digestive issues that led to a hemicolectomy in 2000 and permanent neurological and neuromuscular problems from an electrical shock in 2017. My PCP diagnosed mild asthma last year. That said, what I meant by my signature is that I am waiting for a diagnosis of the breast issue. I was shocked when I saw the dimple. That breast has had an \"area of asymmetrical density\" show up on mammogram for years but no dimple. Now I am wondering if the increased pain low between my shoulders and the sometime breathing difficulty could be related to breast. Also, I have always bruised easily and have been through so many tests without a diagnosis for that but the problem comes and goes. For the past several months, I have had so many spontaneous bruises on my arms and legs. Now I am concerned about this too. Sorry for the lengthy response. Kind of started and couldn't stop. I expect a diagnostic mammogram, an ultrasound. I can't have an MRI because of metal in my body. I am adopted and don't know my family medical background. I'm sorry, I just don't want to leave the doctor having forgotten to ask something important. I have done it before.",
