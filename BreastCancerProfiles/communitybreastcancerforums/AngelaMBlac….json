I have been very depressed lately....the weight loss and finally for the first time reality of cancer.  Im scared, nervous and wondering what is next?  So, I started dealing with it.  I started acupunture yesterday, it went well.  Today I stayed home from work, to have some time for \"me\".  I plan to pick up yoga, I think it will help my anxiousness.  I am meditating when I can, rather its five minutes or more.  I have realized things \"could be worse\" somehow....because somewhere they are worse for someone at this very moment.  I am focusing on my son and the things that make me happy...more so than ever.  If crying helps, its okay.  Make sure you laugh once a day.  Think once a day.  Do something for you once a day, or even once a week, but do that for you.  The main thing to understand is \"it is what it is\".  We did not choose cancer....but since we do not have a choice pray we have many years left.  I have traveled this past year.  I go to atleast one breast cancer conference a year to learn more.  I think it is important to know all you can about your cancer...so you can fight the beast!  I recently went on ambien to sleep at night because I was getting no sleep, that is part of coping, your rest!  I guess there are many coping mechanisms and there are woman on here that are all in the same or similar situation that will chime in.  I hope I have helped a little.  I try to keep myself very busy so the cancer doesn't take over my mind....although sometimes it does, just as long as it doesn't forever.  I just cut my hours at work but it is the first time since my dx....I realized I need more rest and more time to heal.  I hope you can find ways to cope, I know how hard it is and I wish none of us had to go through cancer....but since we do we have to fight back!  Good luck and feel free to PM me if you need to...Hugs from Maine....",
