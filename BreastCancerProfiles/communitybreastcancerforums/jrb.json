After my 2nd implant (the first was too high...my boob was at my collarbone) I developed either a \"clear infection\" or cellulitis.  Implant removed and area was packed 2xday with gauze to let it heal from inside-out for almost 2 mths.  My chest looks like a battleground, but is finally clear of infection and healed. Frustrating to think I did reconstruction to avoid wearing a prosthesis (which I hate).  If your problem isn't resolved yet, keep lobbying for yourself, if we don't do it no one else will' Judy",
