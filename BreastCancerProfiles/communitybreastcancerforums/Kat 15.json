I will have 8 treatments every two weeks until done. My mom passed away from ovarian cancer last year, she kept her hair all through chemo, I hope I get that lucky, but I doubt it. Chemo combo is four treatment of ac and then 4 of t, 40 rounds of radiation plus 10 years of an estrogen blocker. Good luck and my prayers will be with all of you. Your fellow June sister Kat",
