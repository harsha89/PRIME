I know its hard, man do I know it, but this is more of a mental and emotional stamina issue now..

Cannabis oil really helped with chemo, my appetite was ferocious and I was completely unaware of the burning sensations that others spoke of. Only fatigue, but that was no big deal all things considering. Here in South Africa we use a traditional herb called Sutherlandia for liver problems, it comes in tea or drop form. I have been taking it since diagnosis a year ago, just to strengthen my liver ... you can find it online I think. This sounds cheesy I know but you will be okay.

This is such a hard road, yet your \"courage under fire\" is so inspiring. I had an interesting week... My CT scan a few weeks ago looked good for the liver, but they did pick up a swollen lymph node under the right arm, which was biopsied, and found free from cancer because I had reconstructive surgery done 6 weeks ago. What was weird during the biopsy was the comment made by the radiologist, she had a look at my liver scan and expressed her own doubts on whether that spot was malignant...sigh. Here in Cape Town I have a panel of about 20 specialists that look at my case every so often, and at the moment my RO feels that I can benefit tremendously from resection because it is only a single small met, whereas my breast surgeon is not comfortable with it possibly because of his own doubts whether it is malignant at all. They feel the spot is too small for a biopsy. They will do another MRI of the liver, and the panel will discuss it again. If they decide a resection is appropriate, then a liver surgeon will operate on me in a month or so I guess. Just wanted to update anyone that might be interested.",

To be honest, it just did not make sense to me...Okay fast forward to this past Monday..Doctor orders ultrasound of liver to find tumour big enough to biopsy to send to Belgium for OncoDeep genomic testing, and whole body MRI for possible bone mets... Radiologist only sees cysts on my liver, and after I tell her about all the things that just do not add up, she decides to go through ALL my scans and spots, spends a good hour on my file, and lo and behold runs back, hugs me and proclaims \"They are all cysts! You did have malignant tumour on liver last year Feb, but that disappeared long ago already and nobody noticed!\" She revised the previous CT report to no visible mets, and the MRI scan revealed no cancer.I do have sinusitis that can explain the small lung infection, and spleen showed up clear. So I am actually NED, which is great, and I am extremely thankful, but I feel exhausted, mentally that is.

All the best as you navigate through this time of deciding treatment and adjusting to the \"new normal\"..I also think those measurements suggest that the tumors did not exist when your rashes started, but that is just my unprofessional mathematical opinion lol I had a routine CT scan on Monday, and my liver is still clear after almost two and a half years! I am very grateful and happy for real!",

Even though we are loved by those around us, this particular experience is something only a person with mets can understand. For me the hardest part is the knowledge..sometimes I wish I just didn't know so much.. it is a daily struggle to balance the knowing with the living, and most of the time life is good, but when time comes for the bloodtest or the scan or some weird twitch somewhere, the thoughts tend to spiral out of control. You know the drill... But I love this site and all you brave brave women who are living with this disease xx",

It is truly heartbreaking how vicious some humans can be :( I had a routine check up today, and am very grateful that my CA15-3 is still under 10 - it's been like that since the end of chemo last year August, and for me tumor markers correspond with my scans..

Today I had another CT scan, and doctor is very pleased because the tumor, which has shrunk from 2cm to 9mms during chemo, is unchanged. My markers CA 15-3 have dropped from 74 (when chemo started) to 7.5 now. My question is, how can we know whether cancer is active or not? Sorry if this seems too obvious. I see my Onc on Monday for follow up, but just wanted to ask you knowledgeable ladies first... God bless xx",

I live in six weeks intervals lol, as my blood gets tested every six weeks. With this disease, I am learning the value of one magical day at a time. Yesterday I played soccer with my youngest who is 9, knowing that today my muscles would most likely ache a lot, and yes, it is so, but so what anyways. We have to LIVE no matter what, even if it just to crack a smile at someone we love.  Leftfootforward, I am sorry you feel down. I would too. But you have come this far, the options will follow you, not the other way around.. Just keep going xx",

I have been wondering about the same thing for the last week or so... I get into bed at about 10pm, fall asleep by 10h30, and unless a kid or a dog disturbs my sleeping I open my eyes at about 7am, but will sleep until 8h30 (I homeschool, so our days are later and slower anyways), which means I sleep about ten hours a night. Before cancer and treatments I would average about 7-8 hours, so it seems my body definitely needs more rest, even though I don't have active cancer at the moment. I think listen to your body, and enjoy the goodness of sleep!",

As part of my conventional treatment, I also use a traditional herb called Sutherlandia, or Cancerbush. This herb is indigenous to my country, and has been used for centuries by indigenous peoples to treat various illnesses including cancer. What is interesting is that our universities have been doing research in the interaction between this herb and cancer cells , HIV/Aids and the boosting of the immunity system in general, with interesting results so far. My question is whether anyone in other countries have heard of this herb? I can only speak for myself, but at the very least it has contributed a huge amount to my body's ability to cope extremely well during chemo (which is finished now).
