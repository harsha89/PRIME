I just had my prophylactic bilateral mastectomy this past friday.  I watched both my mom and my gradmother suffer and pass away from this terrible disease. For me, I didn't make the decision to have surgery until this year. I had yearly mris (I'm canadian, so I had to go to the states and pay for them before age 25) as well as physicals, ultrasounds and mammograms. Thankfully nothing was every found.  I decided to have the surgery this year beacuse I now have a son, and I do not want him to lose me. Personally, I wish I would have done it sooner.  I think it's great that you have made this decision. I have not felt upset about the loss of my breasts at all since the surgery, just a huge sense of releif! Also, I am having reconstruction with tissue expanders, so I will have my breasts back soon enough.  I'm sorry for not being more informative, the pain pills are really affecting my brain a bit, but send me a PM and I would be happy to chat with you via email if you'd like. ",
