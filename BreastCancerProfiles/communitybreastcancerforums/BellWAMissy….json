I wasn't comfortable feeling that way so asked myself what would make it better. I realized I needed that more personal connection with the techs because they were getting VERY personal with me. The next session, I told them that I needed to have information about them so I didn't feel like a piece of meat on the butcher's table with all the lines drawn on it. They were horrified that's how I was feeling and have been willingly answering my questions. I think I was expecting them to make me feel comfortable, but I needed to know in MY head first what that would be and then I need to advocate for myself to make sure I got it. One thing I've realized reading about everyone's story is that while our journey is the same or similar, everyone is different. Someone else probably copes with radiation better if everything is kept impersonal. I imagine working with people who can have such differing needs from one patient to the next is hard and they probably start using the perceived \"falseness\" until they have a road map on how to handle us. One of my techs also made the comment that they were intense because they are focusing on millimeters and wanted to make sure they got everything right to minimize exposure. Perspective is such as funny thing- all depends which side of the camera you are on",
