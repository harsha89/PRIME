Having cancer does increase your risk for blood clots.  Chemo increases the risk a bit more.  However, now that she will be on blood thinners, she should be ok.  I took a short break from my chemo, and have since resumed treatments. If you have any questions feel free to pm me.  I have done a lot of research over the last week, since the doctors couldn't answer a lot of my questions about my PE.  I know how scared she must be right now, I know I was.

They did not end up taking any muscle as they thought they would, but had to take some extra skin, due to fact that tumor was high up on breast and very close to both muscle and skin.  That makes me nervous, as I have no other info on what that could mean.  She took 6 lymph nodes instead of just the 2, and told my DH that she had to remove extras in order to get to the ones that were targeted during the SNB. Anyway, chest is sore, tight, drains doing ok.  I can walk around a bit.  The dry mouth was the pits, but that is getting better this morning.  I have asthma, and the pain killers/tightness are contributing to a shortness of breath, so I have only slept in short bursts of a couple of hours at a time.  I hope to get off the narcotics and switch to regular tylenol within a few days; drugs that make me feel dopey also mess with my breathing, and that is an extra stress I do not need right now.  They gave me something called Norco, which basically looks to be Vicadin from what I've read. All in all, I am doing ok, glad to be home.  I know there were others having surgery this week, and I hope you all are doing well.  Judy B.",

I am very nervous about how my chest will feel after all of this; I have asthma, and any tightness (like tight tops or bras) make me really uncomfortable (kinda claustrophobic).  So I am worried about that aspect.  I can't even wear t-shirts that go to the neck because it feels suffocating to me.   I had DCIS in 2004, so I have done alot of research over the years, and understand most of the terminology (although there are some new ones, like 'Oncotype', that I don't remember from 2004). One thing I plan to get that isn't on the list--at least not that I've noticed--is one of those grabber things, so I can grab things that are overhead when no one is around to help me out.  Has anyone used those?  My MIL suggested it.

I told my son on Friday afternoon, \"mommy has breast cancer\".  I discussed how I don't know much yet, which I don't, but that I would have surgery, and that I may need chemo.  He didn't know what that was, so I explained it a bit.  He did ok, actually, no tears, no questions.  I am still worried about what he is thinking, but told him he really needs to come to me any time to talk or cry or share his feelings.  He gave me a really long hug, and I thought for a moment that the tears were going to come, but they didn't.  I really hope he will eventually talk about his fears, I don't want him to keep it all inside. So this weekend, we rented movies and video games, and put up our Christmas tree, and had a really nice weekend in spite of it all.   I think that trying to keep things as normal as possible is important right now, although I don't know how long that will be possible. Being a substitute teacher in our district, I had already let his teacher know that I was getting the biopsy (my son was already a bit moody in class as his sister is also very ill, and in and out of the hospital often).  So since I had to explain that to his teacher, I also told her about myself.  I sent a note to her on Friday letting her know my diagnosis, asking her to call me anytime to let me know how he is doing in school. Thank you for your help and for sharing your experiences.  It was very helpful to me.  Judy B.",

I had my last chemo on June 2, so I am now 8 weeks out. This was my head in 6/15, 2 weeks PFC: Then on 7/8/09, 5 weeks PFC, had now lost eyebrows/lashes:  Then today, 7/28/09, 8 weeks PFC, after coloring it yesterday (couldn't stand the white hair) I just used my regular permanent color, *note eyebrows/lashes are back, yay!:  The gray hair didn't all cover with the color.....will try something darker next time, this color is a mix of light and medium blonde I always used.  It now looks kind of tan in color. Oh well, at least it's basically one color now instead of 2!  sorry the pics are so big Hugs Judy",

I haven't posted here in a bit, so thought I'd post a pic of my hair, now 15 wks PFC.  It seems to get thicker, but not much longer, most of it looks to be about 3/4 inches now, some is longer, some is shorter.  It appears that it may start curling.  when I was younger, right up until the last 5 years or so, I had pin straight, thick hair.  Once it started graying, it started waving....so I may just be seeing that wave, I hope. for those of you trying to avoid the Gerber baby thing, the way I deal with it is this:  when it is wet, comb it all straight forward, pressing it down to your head.  After it dries a bit (not totally), add some gel and move it where you want it.  I also use John Frita's Sheer Blonde hair pomade (sp)?, it adds some blonde shimmer to it (but it's sticky stuff) You all look wonderful, by the way, and I can't wait for my hair to grow longer.....I go back to work subbing this week, and am nervous about how the students will react to my hair.  But I really have no desire to stick a wig on my head again, I'm past that! One more thing to add, I found the easiest way to post a pic is after you upload it to photobucket, click on the pic (so it comes up full size), then right click on that pic, copy and paste right into your message on bc.org.

I had rads last time in 2004, and remember that I would start out ok at the beginning of the week, but was exhausted by the end of each week, usually napping often over the weekends.  The fatigue was really my only symptom from rads.  I've never had chemo before. I haven't had an actual offer yet, so maybe they won't call me after all.  Which would probably be for the best, because I don't think I could accept the long-term subbing position now that I know more about the recovery time for surgery.",
