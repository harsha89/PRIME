She had routine PET scan to follow up on a different primary cancer (brain lymphoma).  One single lesion to the hip bone. Biopsy determined that is was a recurrence of the breast cancer.   She had mild shooting pain down the leg and thought it was a sciatica nerve.  She is currently on Femera and doing very well.  The tumor has shrunk, and she has no progression.  What you are describing could very well just be nerve problem.  That is a common problem after all. Whatever it is should be checked out so that you can start to feel better! Take care, Amy",
