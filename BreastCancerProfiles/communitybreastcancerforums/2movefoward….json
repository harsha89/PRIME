I am HER2+ also, mastectomy on right Jan 4, getting port next Wed., and 1st chemo next Friday (same as you Taxol & Herceptin for 12 weeks) how are you handling it? The list of side effects is overwhelming. Hoping to slide through it",

Gosh everyone's post is so different as far as SE's. Just goes to show we are all different, this cancer has no limits!  Can you tell me how I can be added to this group? I don't see my name, and it's gonna be a long 12 weeks, and I need you gals. Best wishes for all and keep the faith, God is the healer.",

Bless my daughter, she sat there and did work on her laptop the whole time.  The only SE I found were gas/bloting, head ache, controllable but uncomfortable.  The port is still a bit sore and then they added fluid to my expander boob. My daughter was watching and said Mom I literaly watched your boob deflate (when they took the air out) then inflate.   You gotta laugh at what our bodies are willing to handle!! Bless you all and God get us through.",
