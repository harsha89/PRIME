I am about 15-16 months out from radiation and I still have tenderness where my two sentinal nodes were removed as well as in the area where radiation is concentrated. I still feel discomfort on one side that could be a slight lymphodema.I asked my radiation oncologist and he says that it's normal. (I have a friend who's a couple of years out who says she's still tender.)Still,I think,as the ever-wise shirlann suggested, if you are very uncomfortable, check with your doctor to make sure it isn't costochondritis or lymphodema (which a compression sleeve might help.) You lost a number of lymph glands and a pretty large mass of breast tissue in surgery. I find eating too much salt or being dehydrated can aggravate discomfort. I hope you have a physician who will listen to your complaints and try to help you. Best wishes, Liz in KS",

Turns out I had low potassium, causing me not only fatigue but dizziness and nausea. I think that happened mostly due to a miserably hot and muggy July, drying medications, and eating less than my normal diet following the stress of diagnosis and surgery. Potassium-rich foods and keeping hydrated helped solved the symptoms. I had 33 treatments, including eight boosts. The boosts made my breast and surrounding area very sore and swollen. Like some others above,I didn't really feel tired until after the treatments ended. Part of that fatigue was the emotional letdown that follows treatment. The last treatment was Aug. 25,2008. Six months later,my energy level is back to normal. My effected breast is a \"new normal\", but thanks goodness,cancer-free. You're in my thoughts and prayers. There really is an end to this. Plan something special to celebrate the end. In the meantime,pamper yourself and eat healthy and drink plenty of liquids!",

I am now nearing three years out from completing my rads in late August 2008 while living in Lawrence,KS - another great university town with icky,sticky summers. I'm not sure whether it was the rads or not, but I found I would often feel weak and nauseous getting out in the heat following a treatment. I found it did help to drink juices that had potassium in them - V-8 was the best - or eating a banana or citrus fruit. Just make sure you're well-hydrated - always, but especially when your body is under stress during radiation. Hope you are blessed with as great a radiation oncologist as I had. Know you will be in my thoughts. Just take it one day at a time, and make sure you do something enjoyable for yourself every day - no matter how small - a good book or movie or fun TV show. Hugs, Liz",

I did not have it, but it's not uncommon. It could also be caused by allergies this time of year or even a respiratory infection. Be sure to mention to your radiation oncologist!!! If the cough gets too bad, the doc could give you prescription with a cough suppressant. But do be sure it isn't an infection other than radiation pneumonia.",

They will also remove two sentinal lymph nodes, which will be sent to the hospital's pathology lab while you are still on the operating table. The surgeon will be able to tell you a lot about your cancer right after surgery. There will be a second,final pathology report that will give you complete information. The good news is if the sentinal nodes - the first nodes that a cancer might travel to - are benign, there is a statistical chance of 95 percent that all the other axilliary (underarm) nodes are also clear of cancer. This is quite an improvement from 50 years ago when removing all nodes plus the whole breast was standard treatmemt. I found I had quite a bit more post-surgical pain from the removal of my two sentinal nodes than the lumpectomy area of my breast. Another tip is to have a second person with you on visits to the various physicians involved in your care - particularly at the beginning.That way, you will have a second set of ears hearing what the doctors have to say. Keeping you in my thoughts and prayers! I am four years out and remain cancer-free.",

They will help get you through. Plus you will find out that more people in your circle of friends and acquaintances than you ever imagined are themselves cancer survivors or relatives of survivors! Support of friends and family kept my husband and me going.  Just take this journey a day at a time, a week at a time and know life really will return to normal before too long.Do something you like each day during this journey and plan a reward when this journey through cancer treatment is complete. I bought tickets for a fall Tina Turner (the ultimate survivor) concert four days before my surgery last May 30. She was fierce and wonderful!  We are rooting for you!",

I was 61 at the time. I had clean margins, was ER/PR+,HER2-negative and two clear sentinal  nodes. Upon my first visit, my oncologist, spoke about the Oncotype DX test to determine my chance for distant recurrence. I was scared to death when I heard about this, as I thought my pathology would indicate chemo was not necessary.My onc explained that chemo would involve two rounds of four treatments - about eight weeks of time,  and that the chemo would be a preventative measure.. The Oncotype score came back within 10 days and it was 30, just one point below being in the high range! A score of 30 meant that I would have a 20% chance of recurrence (plus or minus five percent). Prophylactic chemo would bring the percentage down to 8-12 %.  I chose not to do the chemo, considering my age and the potential for damage done by chemo drugs. Also, my husband, a physicist, and I thought there still is no explanation of other factors beyond genetic markers that would explain why recurrence happens in 20% of women and not in the other 80%. Age and tumor size were parameters that were not factors that affected a woman's chances of recurrence. It appears at the present stage of research, genetic markers are consistantly more predictive. However, were the patients who had recurrence overweight, alcoholic, did thery smoke,of a certain race,etc? These and other factors have yet to be included in the research. Just seems like a crap shot. Also,chemo can sometimes cause blood cancers,heart damage,and neuropathy, and more. Were I 31 years old instead of 61, I quite likely would have done chemo. It was such a hard decision, but the right one for me. I completed 33 radiation treamentw in late August 2008. I began Arimidex in early Sept. 2008. With the Arimidex, I have only a little extra stiffness beyond my usual osteoarthritis in the morning..I remain cancer-free almost 2 1 /2 years later. I have made improvements in my eating habits and exercise and hope I will continue to do well.Cancer is a complicated,frightening disease. I am just grateful that miy very deep-seated tumor was found by mammogram as neither my gp or I found any lumps with breast exams. Hope further research will make the decision easier and the genomic testing more definitive.  Best wishes to all of you facing this decision whether or not to do preventative chemo.You are in my prayers.",
