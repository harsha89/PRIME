They immediately wanted to do a biopsy so now I\u2019m waiting for the results. I\u2019m new to all of this so I\u2019m going to leave a bit of my ultrasound results below. I was given BIRAD of 5, so I\u2019m expecting cancer, but what has me really worried is my lymph node and the word \u201cmetastatic\u201d in my test results. Can anyone calm my nerves? I have 2 young children 3 and 5 and I am terrified about what this all could mean. In the right breast upper, inner quadrant, there are extensive pleomorphic microcalcifications which involve the breast from the subareolar region to the posterior depth over approximately 7 x 4.6 x 5 cm. The appearance is highly suspicious for malignancy and biopsy is recommended. In the left breast at approximately 11 o'clock, mid depth, there is a small group of heterogeneously coarse microcalcifications. Stereotactic biopsy (x1) is recommended. A few scattered punctate calcifications are seen in the left breast, medially. ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: Targeted right breast ultrasound was performed and gray scale/color flow images were reviewed. In the upper, inner quadrant of the right breast, in the region of palpable lump, there is heterogeneously echogenic breast tissue with scattered small cysts. Multiple clustered echogenic foci are seen in the region of the palpable lump around 2 o'clock consistent with suspicious microcalcifications seen in the mammogram. A slightly dilated duct with low level internal echoes is seen in the subareolar region. No definite suspicious mass is demonstrated. In the right axilla, there is a slightly enlarged lymph node with thickened cortex which measures 1.7 x 1.6 x 0.9 cm. The appearance is non specific however, metastatic involvement cannot be excluded. Ultrasound biopsy is recommended.

They found it in a lymph node that they biopsied, and it has thrown me into a panic. I was told it's pretty extensive in the breast, but still no mass is detected. What does that mean!? I've asked every medical professional that I've come into contact, and no one can tell me much. I'm freaking out that I've had this for a long time and that it's spread. Parts of my body I never noticed before have started to ache or tingle. The back of my head. My shoulder. My knee. Is this the cancer? Is it my brain freaking out? I have no desire to eat or drink. I'm panicked at the thought of leaving my 2 young children without a mother. How will my husband cope? I've noticed that I have ridges on my fingernails. Is this a sign that it's spread? I don't know how I'll make it until Monday, and then through the various tests I'll be put through to determine whether or not it's spread past the lymph node(s).",

Playing a game of cards is frustrating for everyone involved. I can't keep track of who's turn it is, what trump was called, what card was lead, etc. I played a game of euchre over the holidays with my sister, who went through chemo for thyroid cancer 13 years ago... our partners were about to quit because between the two of us, we couldn't keep track of anything which made the game drag on forever. I have to concentrate intently to conversations, and even then, I have a hard time following along or coming up with meaningful responses. I'm an introvert by nature, so chemo brain makes it even more difficult for me to socialize.",

I don\u2019t think the mutation has any effect on whether a cancer is more or less likely to spread. The mutation creates the cancer cells. It has no effect on how the cells then grow and spread. You honestly don\u2019t need all that much after surgery. A wedge pillow is great to have, and they sell them at Walmart for like $20. You don\u2019t need a shirt with drain pockets. Most of the time I had my drains safety pinned to my surgical bra, and then put socks over the bulbs so the plastic didn\u2019t touch my skin. If you feel like you need something else, go to Home Depot and get a cheap canvas tool belt that has 2 pockets you can wear around your waist. All those things you see on Etsy for after surgery are pretty, but unnecessary. As long as you have shirts that button or zip in front, you should be fine for the 2 weeks you\u2019ll have drains and not able to move much. Lean on the support you do have. Try to focus on yourself during this time, as difficult as it may be. You\u2019re in the hardest time of a cancer diagnosis. One step at a time. ((Hugs))",
