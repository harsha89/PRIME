They gave her a high survival rate just doing the Tamoxifen and radiation back then.  It came back in 1998, 5 years and 6 months later. She did chemo because thats what they recommended and she elected not to have her breast removed. All the onocology counseling in the world could not convince her to have the breast removed. She said she would have it removed if the chemo did not work. She went into remission again after chemo and was doing great. 2 years and 3 months after chemo it was back again and now in both breasts. She had them both removed and was back in heavy chemo this time. She went thru recontructive surgery as well. My sister passed away on her 46th Birthday in May 2003.  I don't know if she had good advice back then even though I was there with her whenever I could be because she lived in Michigan. But I made a trip every month, went to appointments with her, sat in on doc appointments with her all the time. I really don't think she thought 3 out of 13 nodes was a bad thing. I had breast cancer last 2/2008. I can tell you that my Sentinal node was clean, and my issue was stage one caught at the earliest stage. I had a Lumpectomy and it was all removed and had not traveled far at all. It was \"non-invasive ductal carcinoma\". However, had they told me it was in just one node I would have had chemo and radiation.  I did have rads, 30 treatments. My cancer was not hormone related as many breast cancers are.  Mine was a different kind, but my reoccurance rate and mortality rate was very low due to the stage, etc.. the pathology reports. Only because of what happened with my sister I would have taken a different approach had mine been in any nodes.  I am very curious as to why they did not recommend chemo for you since it was in one node. Did they remove the node in question? Yes it does depend upon the TYPE of cancer, but I'm just curious as to why chemo was not recommended for you. Good Luck, Kathy B.",

It IS the first node or GROUP of nodes dissected today.  In the traditional \"axillary dissection\" a pathologist will receive 10+ nodes.  There is a 95+ chance that a negative \"SENTINEL NODE\" will mean the remaining lymph nodes in the \"axilla\" are also cancer free.  I took the above directly from my pathology reports.  This is all so interesting and thanks for all of your input, very educating.

I found out about an issue in my legs (sciatic nerve issue from an injury when I was much younger) just this week that I was blaming on the rads and it had nothing to do with rads.  However, the upper torso joints and muscles are effected in the line of the rads. I think people should pursue every avenue to find out about their muscle and joint pain after rads because sometimes it is not the rads below the waist concerning the muscles and joints. It's a pain in the butt making appointments with doctors to find the answers, but I believe that evenually the answers do come. It's very frustrating. I have finally gotten all the answers, but it took a few months. just took a look at what is in \"Joint Juice\" and it does not have chondroitin, but just the glucosamine and a few other supplements. I think my \"Osteo Bi-Flex\" has more of what I need for joints and muscles. Thanks for the info, it is appreciated. God Bless Kathy B.",

Every doc I went to said it was my bladder. It was the bladder area that gave me pain.  I spent my 50th Birthday in 1/2001 in a docs office still going thru the ups and downs of this flu-like issue. Tests would show small blood amounts in my urine and antoher antibiotic would be given. On Presdients Day 2/2001 my husband took me to the ER as I was doubled over in pain. I sat there for 6 hours in a wheelchair before I was seen and the ball started to roll because the blood work they took when I arrived showed ECOLI. My intestine had ruptured. The cause was a seed or nut that got lodged in an intestional sac that either had ECOLI or developed into ECOLI over months. I was taken to surgery, 1 foot of infected intestines removed, hospitalized for 10 days, had a bag on when I left the hospital.  Wore the bag until then end of 5/2001, had my intestines hooked back up, and healed beautiful and got on with my life. Had I been a child I would have died, my surgeon says I am his \"miracle\" because not many pull thru the way I did.  In 2006 I started developing a small surgical hernia on my left lower abdomen. It blossomed in the fall of 2007. When I went for my physical in Feb. 2008 I was already having pre-tests (pelvic CT, Colonoscopy, heart stress test, numerous blood testings, etc.)  to have my hernia fixed when they found my breast cancer in my right breast. It was caught in the earliest stage and I never would have felt any lump because there was none. Trained eyes found the breast cancer. I was more worried about the lump I did feel in my left breast which was a \"common cyst\".  Had my Lumpectomy on 4/23/09 with the Sentinal Node done (negative) Under the \"Nottingham Histologic Grade\" it was \"111\"(Tubule formation score=3) Tubule formation 3=little or none (<10%), Nuclear grade score=3, mitotic rate score=3 /more then 10 mitoses per 10 HPF  (Necrosis is present / Necrosis in the tumor means that the cancer is dead within the area). Focal tumor is present (focal means limited to a small area). It was the TYPE of breast cancer I had, none hormonal related, that sent me to an onocolgist review. The small area was totally removed in my right breast, nothing present in node. I was due for my hernia surgery on 5/23/08 and had 2 consultations with the onocolgist before my surgery at which time I was told that my life expenctency was excellent up to 10+ years without reoccurrence if I did nothing. If I chose to do chemo and radiation it would up the percentage of life expectency even higher (to 95% from 85%) and if I chose to do just radiation it would decrease the occurrence to 95% from 85%. The onocologist wanted to \"try something different\" on me and after 2 visits and him telling me \"there is no urgency for you to do any chemo at this time\" I decided to do just radiation after my heria surgery in the fall of 2008. I was all clear to have my hernia surgery and went forward on 5/23/08. I was released from my surgeon and my heria issue on 10/16/08 and went for the app't I had made in the Spring of 2008 with the rad doc. in 10/08. This was when that onocolgist dropped me as a patient. Dropped me because I had decided to just move forward with the rads.  He was also ticked off at me because I hadn't gone back for a 3rd app't concerning what he wanted to \"try\" on me\".  I had an MRI and Mammogram prior to rads starting, all was clean. And I might add I was feeling very good physically before the rads. I sit here today and I wonder how I bounced back so well from my bout of ECOLI, a serious surgery (2 of them back then) and I can't even bounce back from the rads.  I was feeling great after my hernia surgery then I did the rads and NOTHING compares to this feeling I have had since rads.  I am no fool though, and I know the type of cancer I had could show up later in life again, but I will cross that bridge when I have to. Chemo was not necessary at this time. I had to do something and I THOUGHT rads would be the least taxing on my body and I guess I was wrong in that assumption.  Thats just a little about me.

Discomfort will follow the path of the radiation rays. Most people will have the off and on discomfort. People that are experiencing serious pains in the front and back rib cage should further get to the bottom of it after rads as there are conditions that can form in those areas after rads.  I didn't have that at all. However, I did have overall joint and muscle aggravation and the upper body aggravation is from the rads.  The issues with my leg joints and muscles, after her doing tests and x-rays,  is a sciatic nerve issue from a skiing injury when I was 23 years old. I took a bad fall on the lower top area of the tail bone, bottom of my spine. It seems the sciatic nerve which goes down the back of your legs is the culprit. So I am taking Celebrex \"as needed\" and we are going to monitor this issue.  The Celebrex took away my upper body issues also, but I will only be taking Celebrex \"as needed\" because it's not something I want to be taking on a daily basis. I saw her May 12th. Today, May 14th,  I had my revisit with my surgeon and asked him about the issue also and he basically said the same thing my Orthopedic did concerning side effects of rads.  I asked him about my itchy boob, general itching of the skin in my rads areas and he said my inner boob was still healing and building new cells.  I had stage 1, receptor 111 cancer, but he cut deeper and wider because he's that kind of surgeon so I have a bit more scar tissue also.  The receptor 3 I didn't like, but my area was so small and my overall reoccurrence was low and mortality rate was low so I am going with it all and just took the rads and will cross any bridges I have to in the future IF it comes back.  My Sentinal node was clean as was the area outside the duct. I always think back about why I made my mammogram appointment first and earlier and it was due to a lump in my left breast. That was a common cyst and my doctors all said the same thing, \"it's not what you CAN feel that you should be afraid of (thats assuming we all do our breast exams as we should on a regular basis), it's what you CANNOT feel that you should be afraid of \" and thats why we all need to stay on top of our breast exams. I go to the Onocologist on 5/26, my new one, and thats it for awhile.  I live 6 months at a time for another year and then go back to yearly testing. Kathy B",

The pain when you take deep breathes is probably fluid also. The rash and itching may be the early stage of edema in the breast, thats what happened to me a year after I had rads. I finished my last rad on 12/12/2008 and a year later developed a rash, hotness, and some swelling on my right breast. I just happened to have a scheduled wellness visit with my oncologist coming up back then and when she saw the breast she immediately said it was edema (fluid) and I was scheduled for physical therapy, 8 visits. The highest doses of my rads were the last 7 that were shot over my right lung and into the right breast. I developed a cough from rads also. I used to go to bed at night, lay on my right side and proceeded to go into a nightly 10 minute coughing spell until all the fluid was dispersed. Was aggravating. The physical therapy helped the cough a little, but the cough didn't go away until this past June 2011 when (of all things) I was put on preventive antibiotic Doxycycline for Lyme Disease. I had a deer tick in my leg this year. That was weird to say the least. Can't wait to see the reaction my oncologist has when I tell her how the cough went away (laughing). I think you need to either see a pulmonary doctor or your oncologist if you have one about the chest pain, sounds like a fluid issue and you don't want to develope pneumonia from that. That rash and itching sounds like edema developing also. My physical therapy worked 100% for the edema in my right breast. I went for 8 weeks and in between my weekly visit I did certain given home massage and exercises each day. It all worked for me. Edema can show up at anytime by the way, my oncologist told me that. My breast cancer was in the earliest stage, nothing in nodes. I opted to have the rads. I don't have alot of good things to say about rad doctors because they were less then honest with me. I got the truth from other doctors I have concerning side effects of rads. Please get the chest pains checked out, that shouldn't be going on and get that rash issue checked also before it goes full blown. Hope I was of some help......God Bless Kathy",

It causes many skin issues for along time. I was told, when I developed a horrible skin rash that \"it wasn't from rads\". I went to my skin doc and he told me it WAS from rads.

If I decide to stop thats when I get sore. I am a gardener/landscaper on my own and have 3 clients I work for during the warm weather. I've developed lung issues from the radiation. That cough came back and I use an inhaler as needed (non-steriod) and I don't smoke. Rads can cause lung toxicity, it damages cells, causes scar tissue to form. So to answer your question honestly, yes it can go on for a long time and who knows, maybe forever, muscle/joint issues from radiation. I really think the people that do rads need to be a little more honest about the effects after and I mean years after. I am doing great concerning no cancer, but I pay dearly from making the choice to have radiation. I have had great physicians guiding me thru the things that pop up. When I went for my yearly with the rad doc last august 2010 he asked me to explain how radiation has effected me and I said this, \"my body feels like I put it into a light socket and got a mild jolt\". Between the on going nerve and joint/muscle issues I can't say which can be aggravating. My shoulders always ache in the joints. I live with it. I have no over-all fatigue though. In that I am lucky. Physical therapy works, but not forever. I've had my shoulders done a few times now, feels great for about 2 weeks and then it's back again.I have also had it for the scar tissue on my surgical area. Keep in mind that radiation kills cells/tissue  from the point they shoot it from. good luck.",

It actually gets into my leg joints and kills the minor pain there also.  if I've had a vigorous day outside I pay for it for 2 days and I have to take it easy. I take Excedrin because that also works,  Motin and Advil and Aleve do nothing. I was just wondering if anyone has experienced this after radiation?  I have my appointment with my Radiologist the first week of July and I'm hoping this starts to completely subside by then.  I am not \"sleepy\" tired at all, but I do have fatigue still.  Can anyone give me some input here?

      "Content": "Apr 30, 2009 12:44PM - edited Apr 30, 2009 12:47PM by kat06365 Everytime I bring up this joint and muscle pain issue to anyone in rads they all say the same thing (and I decided to contact them again this past Tuesday, April 28th, 2009), \"it's not from the radiation treatments\".  I think they are full of it (sorry).  I NEVER had this prior to radiation, I am 59. I was NEVER with pain issues in my muscles and joints. I have no pain in my shoulders, or upper body, just some muscle weakness now and then.  I do arm curls every day, 100 total, since I had radiation for strength purposes. My Primary care doc has sent me for all kinds of tests, nothing is wrong. I lost count of the number of women I have spoken to that had rads and have my issue of joint and muscle pain that comes and goes and they are told the same thing by their docs, \"not caused by rads\".  We can't all be having illusions ya think?  I was never like this prior and neither were they so who's right here? My fatigue is not the sleepy kind of fatigue like many get, my fatigue happens when the joint/muscle thing starts and I have to relax for an hour or so.  I happen to have had my 6 month mammogram this past Monday (4/27/09? and even my tech said she hears the same thing from rad patients about muscle/joint pain after rads.  Thanks for you're input, I do appreciate it alot.

Did the docs explain what the E&P Receptors were all about? Are you on any of those cancer drugs related to E&P receptor breast cancer? If you are they do have side effects. I have to be honest with you here, I was relieved when they told me my BC was not E or P receptor related. My sister was just 46 when she died from 10 long years of BC coming back, but when she was diagnosed at age 36 it was already in 3 of the 13 nodes they took out of her and she did rads, and got half way thru chemo and couldn't finish it due to enemia. From age 36 to her death on her 46th Birthday in 2002 she had it pop up every 3 years. However, hers was not E or P Receptor related either, the genetic testing was done and it was not genes either. No other cases are anywhere in the families except hers and mine. Mine was non-invasive ductal, earliest stage possible, but I now live with this monkey on my back because cancer cells can show up somewhere else. I have not needed alot of tests done since my issue, but the rads did something to me. My oncologist was very honest with me in telling me that radiation related cancers can show up 10 to 15 years after the fact. By that I mean from radiation treatment FOR a previous cancer. I never could get any straight answers from the radiology people, it was always, \"thats not from radiation treatment\". I got myself educated when they wouldn't define what I wanted to know, I got the answers elsewhere. I can relate to how you feel, seriously. One other thing.................I had chest testing done, lungs etc., I have scar tissue on my right lung from rads and that was the only thing the people in radiology ever told me I may have happen. It did happen. Let me know how you make out..............I really am so sorry you're going thru all that you are and I do relate. In my prayers. Kathy",
