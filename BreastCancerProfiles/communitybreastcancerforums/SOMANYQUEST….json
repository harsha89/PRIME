I have a follow up mammo in six months to recheck that it stays that way. I know it's crazy, but I feel horribly guilty sharing my results... I want to take you all with me, each and every one of you, off this journey, or at least onto the six month exit ramp. I hope it's OK if I check in to see how you are doing.. I will pray for each and every one of you daily - for comfort, for strength, for clarity and for peace. I will try to take the good out of this experience and not let the fear affect me going forward, though I must say, nothing looks the same as it did before. Thank you for the love and support you've shared with me. You all have a special place in my heart forever, sincerely.",

There has never been anything to biopsy in my stomach on my previous endoscopies!! And I have a hernia all of a sudden??!!?? Well, I was traumatized when I feared a breast would have to go, now I'm really upset .. please pray it's something simple, like an ulcer they can fix easily with antibiotics.

I pray the ladies here who had their Wednesday procedures today things went smoothly for you, and results will be swift. Hugs!",

I saw the x-ray of the calcifications they removed on the screen... they seem to have gotten a very good sample of them... So now I wait... and try to stay sane. I've been absolutely wiped out with exhaustion since Tuesday and slept a lot... if the nurse calls with results, I'm ok. If the surgeon herself calls, I'm in trouble. this will be a very long weekend waiting, and wondering whose voice will be on the other end when the phone finally rings... I will try to catch up on everyone's details tomorrow, i see i missed a lot of posts the last few days... i wish it were like facebook where we could comment on each post so i dont miss anyone... for now warm hugs everyone, i can't believe we all find ourselves here... stay strong! stay strong!!",

I went Tuesday to the surgeon's office where the nurse confirmed this and gave me a copy of the report. She pointed out the important words and did a quick exam of the biopsy site to check healing and we were done! Made my appointment for follow up in 6 months and left very happily relieved. As I read the report in depth later on, I noticed a specific detail in the report about the tissue samples that make me and my husband very concerned as to whether the samples reported on are actually mine. Now we have to wait until Thursday to even ask anyone due to the holiday - going to make us crazy with worry. Hubby confirms my line of thought because he was there at the test and saw the x-ray of the samples on the screen as well as I did, and agrees the discrepancy noted in the report is very concerning. Now, I'm not sure if I really have accurate results or not.",

WayTooAnxious, thank you for the advice you shared. Well, I've been trying to stay calm since what seems like forever ago, but in reality was only ten days ago on June 12 that I had my call back mammo views and ultrasound findings that launched me into this process. In just a few hours today I will meet the breast surgeon for the first time to see if she agrees with the radiologist's recommendation of a stereotactic biopsy, and if she does it will likely be done on Tuesday, the 26th. I have kept myself very busy to distract myself, shoving as many appointments as I could into these last ten days to help clear my schedule (either for the coming treatments if needed, or a well deserved rest if things are B9). I also continued going to PT for my back and upper body strengthening, which has helped keep me calm - truly without the PT exercises to expend my energy, I would be an anxious mess and getting no sleep these last ten days. PT takes all the anxious wind right out of my sails. In a way, after the first couple days of panic, once I decided on which surgeon to consult, I have felt oddly calm and very detached, which makes me wonder if that is very good or very very bad.. not quite autopilot, not quite denial, more like compartmentalized with a touch of pissed off and determined. Even though my husband will be driving me today and sit by my side, the men can't understand really, not the way a woman can, especially one who is going through it or one who has survived it... I will feel like I have all of you and those who have gone ahead of us sitting beside me as well, giving me strength and courage to hear what ever the surgeon has to say. Thank you all.",
