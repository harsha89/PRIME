Had BMX with TE's on December 21st. I am told that I am healing beautifially. Don't know about that but I am super anxious to get this chemo show on the road. I used the link that was posted in a previous post about the headscarf site that is going out of business. I bought my first 2 scarves and a matching headband for my 4 year old. I also have an appt for a wig fitting this Wednesday. No idea what to expect but I will probably be checking this thread daily. Glad to hear that the ladies who have already started that things are going well. HUGS!!",

I started chemo a week ago today (9th) and then had neulasta next day (Tuesday). My bad days were Wednesday-Saturday this past week. I saw my onc today and he said my nausea lasted longer than most so next treatment I will be getting a bag of fluids and additional IV anti-nausea meds when I go to have my neulasta shot. He told me today that with all the meds out there something should be able to make me more comfortable. Everyone is different but I have noticed most say their bad days are day 3 & 4. I am interested in what others might have to say are their bad days as well since it lasted so long for me. Good luck with your first treament FLDDREAMER.",

I was able to convince onc to reduce steroids today. He knows how much I hate them as I tell him every time I see him. yay!!! He would only reduce it by 2mg to see how I did and then another 2mg decrease next week. I am still wired as the benadryl that I got at 9am wore off hours ago and I fully expect to be pacing and twiddling my thumbs at 2am. Also got up to full speed with the T/H and was in and out in 4 hours. I started having a little neuropathy in my left hand yesterday. Not painful, just annoying, and it only lasted about an hour. MO set up my RO consult for next week so my type A personality will feel better having the next plan in place.  Anyone else having radiation and have had their consults yet? Been doing a little reading and I must say there is alot more finesse to radiation than I expected. I also abruptly realized just how much of a strong front my DH has been putting up. He joined the \"I forgot my son at daycare today\" club. He felt horrible. He thought it was Thursday and picked up our daughter at preschool (our son only goes 2 days/week) and drove right by daycare. No harm done as we've been going there for almost 4 years and they are well aware what is going on with our family. At least he was only 1/2 way home when the teacher called me. DH says to me when he gets home \"Well, my 37 year old wife has stage 3 breast cancer and I'm a little stressed sometimes\". My heart melted and a little guilt crept in on me for having this crap cancer. It completely put into perspective how much I haven't noticed HIS stress levels. Actually made for a good heart to heart and I am hoping he feels less weighted now that we talked. He works 50 hours a week, we have 2 kids under 5, and I have cancer. If he were a girl I'd send him for a spa day.......... I hope everyone is having a good week with little side effects. I think of you all often knowing we are all trucking along getting through this together. {{{HUGS}}} Brooke",

The premeds alone took almost an hour. By then the lovely Ativan the nurse gave me had kicked in and I no longer remember the names of the anit-emetics. I am so very, very thankful for the amazing kindle my friends at work bought for me. It was the perfect, perfect chemo gift and made time go by relativity quickly. GUYS!!!! Lunch was brought in for my hubby and I. While I ate the nurse did the manual push of the hot pink colored Adriamycin over 20 minutes. No problems so far, just my nerves being fried and I peed pink for the rest of the day. The bag of cytoxin was hung next and took a little over an hour. I then asked to have the rest of my saline bag finished. Why not take a little extra fluids when they were just going to discard them. Want this crap flushed out as soon as possible. By the time I was ready to leave my head was pounding and fuzzy. A little tylenol and I was on my way home. 1 A/C cycle down 3 more to go. Unfortunately the expander fill and PT felt like a baseball bat attack again. All completely normal I was told -- Yay me!!! Had to stop on the way home to pick up my 4 Rx's. Compazine which I took immediately, steroids, Ambien to counteract the steroids making me unable to sleep, and more Ativan.That along with the pepcid, sencot and ibuprofen I have to take regularly as well. By the time we arrived home I was nauseous, had a massive headache, and was shaking. I cannot believe what a person would feel like before the introduction of long lasting anti-emetics, etc A wonderful meal was delivered from my friend. Meals are set up 3x/week from now until the end of May. What a god send these are going to be. This morning I woke up feeling like I had the worst morning sickness ever and a migraine. Ate some oatmeal and got all my meds into me. Now I feel could at least take a shower but I am probably going back to bed until it is time to head back to the oncology center for my Nuelasta injection. Have heard that the first couple days after this shot can be worse than the chemo after effects. Basically every bone in your body aches. Hopefully I will not be one of those people. Did take the claritin I have seen advised on her. So that has been my last day and 1/2. I wish eveyone starting the week, having their port placed, or 2nd treatment goes well!!",

My last taxol will be May 23rd very close to you. I met with RO last week for consult and he said I need to wait 3-4 weeks for my body to recover from chemo. I would definitely rather start sooner if all my bloodwork is good which it has been. What were his/her thoughts?? Thanks for any help. I had Taxol/Herceptin #2 today. No reaction, so onc nurse got to speed up infusion. In and out in 5 hours. Much better than last week's 6 1/2 hour day. A tiny bit of nausea tonight, nothing even remotely compared to A/C. Am preparing for the 2-3 day sit in of bone pain that will probably start Friday. I am so jittery from these gosh darn steroids (not what I really want to say). I just despise them. I asked MO if we could please, please reduce them. He said not until after my 4th treatment. Hopefully out of the woods for any reaction by then. As you all can see I am becoming less and less depressed about this BC crap, but becoming more and more impatient with it. Anyone else?? Don't know if that's good or bad. I'm just gonna blame the ROIDS. Good luck to everyone for the rest of the week!! Brooke",

The nightsweats started about 10 days ago and then the hot flashes started last Friday. Well, those just suck!!  Not something I expected to be having at 37. I feel like I owe my mom and aunt great big hugs. They have complained about hot flashes for a couple years but I could not relate until now. And I have several bloody noses a day. Ummm, didn't see that on the menu of side effects. In the words of my 4 year old \"ugh, another bloody nose mommy, yuck\"... On the upside, I got to go for a facial and massage this morning. There is a breast cancer survivor in my area that is oncology certified for skincare and massage. She provides her services free of charge for bc patients in treatement.

I think my body knows I am trying to army crawl across this finish line and wants to give me one more insult. At least I see the horizon. I hope eveyone has a wonderful sunny weekend.",

Winter for kids is like sickness hell here and we all seem to pass it around. I too have broken down and feel like I just cannot take much more. Being chemo sick and then stomach flu sick just plain rots.... Be kind to yourself and know that you are not alone.",

We capped out after 1st treatment since my EOB showed my neulasta shot was a little over $14K. Nope not a typo. Also, many hospitals will negotiate your bill. We did this with our son's bill when he was having some health problems the first few months after he was born. We paid a moderate portion of the bill in cash, spoke with the CFO and in exchange for our cash payment the rest of the bill was forgiven. We have a close family friend who works at a large hospital billing dept and helped us through it. We will try it again at the end of the year with my bills. PM me if you want any more info. Don't panic like I did.. Now my husband refuses to let me see any EOB's or bills. He tells me my only concern is getting better. I still peek when I get the mail first, I can't help it.",

You did everything right for her and I am sure she knew it. We lost our Persian to kidney failure about 3 weeks ago. I think it was harder because we feel so bad a lot of the time. I had a frustrating \"does the snowball of bc ever end\" moment. I have very fair skin with lots of freckles and moles. When I went bald I noticed a large (size of eraser) mole on the side of my head. Finally got an appt with my dermatologist to have my whole bald head checked. :) Well, everything on my head is fine but I left with 3 more scars for 3 biopsies (leg, back, stomach). I was not expecting this and just wanted to truly throw my hands and and scream \"I give up\". Now I wait 7-10 days for results. I know I should look on the bright side that without going bald I would have waited til my annual appt this fall to have my skin looked at. But I am not seeing the bright side as of today. UGH!! I hate this crap!! I have #6 this week. Thinking about asking for pain meds as this past weekend bone pain was crippling. I really hope everyone is doing well with their SE's. P.S. Cat, my hair is growing too. A noticeable layer of soft fuzzy hair.",

The compazine was contributing to my blurry vision so I had to stop that. I wish you well on your treamtent tomorrow. There are other meds and treatemnts to help with the SE's.

Pretty much been in bed for 10 days along with being hit with a whopper cold. MO finally put me on a z-pack \"just in case\". Kept saying he was reluctant but since I have sounded like a frog for 12 days he would go ahead and Rx it. I do have a couple question for you ladies. Has anyone gained weight? I am really thin in the face and torso but I cannot button my jeans and my abdomen feels doughy. Onc says it is related to the steroids. And has anyone else lost their tastebuds. I cannot seem to find my pre chemo ones. Taste was a little off first 2 treatments now eveything just tastes bad/metallic/acrid/bitter. And it's not going away this time. Anyone else??? And to a few of you that posted your ears were ringing.. Mine started after this treatment too. Oh joy......I do hope evyone else is doing well. Brooke",

They still did a pathology on the right prophylactic side and it came back ADH (atypical ductal hyperplasia) throughtout the breast. ADH is one step below DCIS.

I had treatment #4 yesterday. Thank freakin goodness the red devil will not be seen again. Had to have more IVF and IV anti-nausea meds today. MO is reducing my steroids again (yay!!). I absolutley HATE the steroids. Now all aboard the taxol/Herceptin train for me in 2 weeks. Hoping it treats me better than this A/C crap did. Hope everyone else is doing well with their SE's and good luck to those having treament this week. {{{Hugs}}} to all!!!",

My daughter started Kindergarten and my son preschool which I am thrilled I was here to see. During those beginning dark days I sometimes wondered if I would be around. I am doinf better emotionally but sometimes the fear of progression creeps up. I am still having some painful scar tissue problems and I definitely still struggle with fatigue. But overall doing well. I am also enrolled in the AE37 vaccine clinical trial. About to take my 5th trip to Mayland this weekend for my Monday morning appointment. Hoping others will \"check in\" too. HUGS Brooke",

Started regular saline fluids and the Taxol, or so I thought. I got a burning in the back of my throat and then my chest started to feel tight and I couldn't breathe very well. Told my lovely oncology nurse as she instructed me to do if anything felt funny. She then tells me, \"well honey I haven't even started the taxol yet, just your saline\". Yup, I was having my first panic attack. Felt pretty dumb. After having such a horrific time with A/C, I completely worked myself into a tizzy. Nurse ran the drip slow and everything was fine. Herceptin went off without a hitch as well.  I did ice my fingers and toes (I looked pretty silly with frozen peas on my extremities but oh well). So we'll see how this goes. I feel completely normal today. No lethargy, nausea, no GI problems. So I am cautiously, and I mean cautiously, optimistic about SE's. Hope this helps anyone starting tomorrow or next week.",

Wednesday wired and blah combined from the treatment itself, Thursday is good but not much sleep the night before, Friday afternoon the aching begins...... Saturday, I wake up almost crippled, and now Sunday I am still pretty painful but able to get around. Tomorrow will start to be better and then Wednesday do it all over again.  Basically my neck, shoulders, down my back, hips, pelvis, knees, and ankles are killing me. I have also had horrible bladder spasms as well. Sometimes shooting pain in my jaw and hips that make me yip like my little Brussels Griffon when she gets under foot. I took tylenol the 1st round but onc told me to switch to the 12 hour Aleve and I did much better this weekend. I am so very sorry you both are going through this. I have to imagine the dd is even worse than the weekly I am doing. Just wanted you to know that you are not alone. Unfortunately these SE's are the norm for Taxol. I was told Taxol would be much better than A/C as well and I would even be able to exercise again. Still waiting for the \"better\" part. Try a different OC med. Maybe Motrin or Aleve will give you better pain relief. If not, I have heard some women take RX pain meds to get through the bad days. I pray you both will have a little relief tomorrow.  {{HUGS}} Brooke",

I am headachy and nauseous but I am just so darn happy to be done. I received the triple dose herceptin so I think that's why the new se headache. But I can pop a few tylenol and happy dance with those of you that have also finished. My treatment center had lobster rolls (we are in Maine ) and cake for me and my dad (chemo buddy). The nurses all came in with presents and told us this was a celabratory day. They were all lined up so I asked if they were going to sing to me like it was my birthday in a restaurant. They declined. They gave me a t-shirt, a giant chocolate dipped fortune cookie, and a journal. My chemo nurse who I am close to, came back later with a Pandora \"journery\" charm from her since she noticed I had a bracelet that I would wear to chemo each week. That's when I lost it and stated crying. Also, a surprise visit from my husband who usually has to be at work with flowers and chocolate. My garage door was decorated with 3 congratualtions signs and balloons by my neighbor for when I came home. And the wonderful BC survivor volunteer who comes in every week to see me did an hour of reiki instead of the usual half hour. I felt so pampered. Overall it has been a wonderful day. Except for the chemo part anyway. I hope all you wonderful ladies that have finished are getting stronger everyday and for those of you about to finish I wish send you good healing energy!!",

Since we are now into Septemeber already and most of us were diagnosed in October, November, December. I was wonder what you ladies are considering your 1 year cancerversary. Date of dx or surgery?? Just a little informal poll. It would be great to hear a little update from everyone since we are all approaching 1 year. I've had 2 surgeries, 5 months of chemo, 5 1/2 weeks of radiation, 9 months of PT (continuing), continuing Herceptin every 3 weeks until end of February, and now Tamoxifen for the past 5 weeks. What a nasty little pill of SE's that is.... My hair is officially 2\" long (had DH measure it for the first time today) and I haven't the slightest idea what to do with it. It literally just sits there and I try to avoid any mirrors or I end up fussing with it to no avail. My daughter starts Pre-K on Tuesday, my little man turned 2 in July and is quite the handful. I wouldn't trade the feeling of love when I look at them for anything. We were able to get to our camp a few times this summer and next friday we are heading to Gatlinburg for a much needed family vacation. Can't wait to hear from you wonderful women!!!!",

I have 9 more T/H, then surgery early June, with rads to follow late June. There are days when I am a crying mess and terrified that I am stage III. Then there are days I know I will beat this. I went 3 weeks without crying and feeling pretty good. Last week my onc talked to me about tamoxifen and I ended up crying for an hour. It was a completely benign conversation and for whatever reason my mind chose that moment to be overwhelmed. I did feel better and have been fine since. I too hate the way I look, especially the 15# I have gained so far and the bald head to go along with it. I cannot scream it loud enough some days that this really sucks! You are not alone. I GET everything you are probably feeling. You are also one of the first women I have encountered that is having exchange surgery before radiation like me. I have felt very alone and scared about that as well. You can PM me anytime. I think what you are feeling is completely normal. We are not that far out from diagnosis and cying can release a lot of pent up feelings like Diana said. There are no right or wrong feelings. {{{HUGS}}} Brooke",

I sit here tonight with an itchy, painful head that is starting to show the bald spots. Sometimes I feel like crying and I do, but sometimes it's really not so bad. I had really long hair, cut it just below my ears when I found out I was doing chemo, then cut it into a pixie cut the week before I started chemo. I just had my second A/C treatment last Monday. I had it shaved by the lovely young wig prothesis woman last Wednesday. I've only worn the wig once but I think that is because my head really hurts....

I am about to have taxol #4 tomorrow and I swear my hair is starting to grow. I need to shave my legs and my head has a slight covering of \"soft fuzz\" as my mom described it. I am down 1/2 an eyebrow and lashes are really thin. So is it even possible the hair on my head is growing or am I just wanting it so bad that I am seeing things???",

I am a few days past my 3rd A/C treatement. I shaved my head 2 weeks ago and still have some stubble in places. Mostly, I am concerned because my head is scaly, like dandruff. It is cold and dry here in New England. Are there any products you all used? Should I be moisturizing my head (seems weird to say that)? Dandruff shampoo? Use something like a Sensitive skin body wash on my head? Should I keep it covered at home or should I cover it to prevent more drying from the heat being on? I am a newbie to all this hair stuff and have no idea what I'm doing. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!  <HUGS> Brooke",

And don't get me started about the hot flashes since starting chemo in January. Menopause at 37 was NOT on my to do list... I have 3 creams which were recommeneded. Aquaphor, 100% Aloe, and Emu oil. Just have to see which one/combo works best. My first treatment today was quick/efficient which I like as a type A. But the whole process was just awkward. The techs were very nice and told me that yes the first treatments are awkward then they are just repetitive and boring. I'll take boring right about now. Hugs to those starting soon......",

My 20 months old looks like the michellin man with his snowsuit and boots on. Every other step he falls, has to roll to his belly, in order to stand up again. Hilarious to watch. But he keeps on getting up. That's what we keep doing on this crappy BC ride right???",

I actually called my PS and BS 2 days ago to beg them to take them out. I was having a meltdown because I found out I will have to have radiation after chemo and then will have a 6 month wait after that to have exchange surgery. That's 15-16 months with these things in. I was just having so much pain and I too feel like a weenie. I don't know about you but I have a small frame and I can feel them sticking into my ribs and sides. Both PS and BS said I should be taking pain meds regularly for minimum of 2 weeks with TE's. After 7 days I tried not taking them for a couple days. BIG mistake, hence the pain, followed by previously mentioned meltdown. I too cannot sleep on my side which is the only way I like to sleep. The hospital bed is a wonderfule idea. I sleep on a wedge pillow withanother pillow on that in bed with more pillows under my arms and knees. Working well so far. I am just starting to feel better todaywhich is day 11 post-op for me. Well enough complaining. Just wanted you to know that you are definitely not alone with these awful things. I pray for a speedy recovery and less pain for you and everyone who has had surgery recently.. Hugs to all!",

I was diagnosed in November, BMX in December, and started chemo in January. I finished rads yesterday and I too had implants put in before radiation.Justwanted you to know my synopsis to know you are not alone. I am so sorry you've had a rough go so far. What happened to your arm? Was this during your planning session? I have lymphedema in my left (BC) arm so the planning session was the longest my arm was above my head. The radiation appointments only last about 7-8 minutes each time. Good luck and pm me anytime. Belinda: I finished yesterday and my breast is bright red and swollen. My armpit is swollen as well.RO told me to take IBprofen to ease the inflammation. Good luck!!",

I don't know what the connection is whether its the fertility drugs, the subsequent pregnancies, or both. But I do believe something surrounding fertility contributed or \"turned on\" my bc.

I have been absolutely devastated the past 24 hours. I have actually said to myself, why bother with chemo, radiation?? Lymph nodes involved, well what's the point. My children are 4 years and 18m. I cannot even look at them without crying. I just had a BMX with TE 10 days ago. I hate these TE and they will be in for at least 15-16 months. What the hell was I thinking?? Then I gently try to tell myself that this fight isn't over, mine is just beginning. I have children and a husband that I have to try and get through this for myself and them. One foot in front of the other. If you ever want to talk just pm me.... We are all here together. And yes is SUCKS!!!!",
