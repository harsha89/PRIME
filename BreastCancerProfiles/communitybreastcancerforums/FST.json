The nurse ccordinator told us not wait and go see oncologiest at other hospital because our case is simple (we think it's because all 7 lymph nodes are negative), we are also learning and looking at Oncotype DX test (Checking with my wife's doctor), in our situation does Chemo really necessary? No we didn't met onco yet, our first appointment in Nov 6., there are two onco doctor in leaves and that's why the schedule is tight, We are focus on the surgery and recovery, and not thinking about this situation may happen in the past few weeks, we should book it earlier right after surgery.  ",
