I was scheduled for a masectomy on the 11th, but my cat scan showed possible liver mets. I went for a PET scan, and I not only have liver mets, I have some bone mets as well. This cancer just blew up from nowhere! I guess I'm considered stage 4....since it has spread? I'm still unclear, I never was actually told I was stage 4, but with everything I have read...... So, right now I am undergoing chemo, just had my 2nd round on the 26TH. The plan is to shrink down these tumors, and I believe possible doing surgery to take my breast off if we can shrink it down ( was 10cm).....seems to be going down a little since these treatments. I've been trying to deal the best I can. I have a wonderful support group of family and friends. The hardest part is not knowing if I will get to see my baby girl grow up, that's what tears me up the most. I have been doing ALOT of praying to the good Lord. I know he is the ultimate healer, and it's all in His hands now. Well, thanks for letting me share, and anyone who is in a similar situation like mine, please let me know and maybe we can chat. God bless you all, and lots of luck in your recoveries. Happy Thanksgiving!!    Missy ~ Missy Braddy ~ Dx 11/3/2008, IDC, 6cm+, Grade 3, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
