I will have 30 sessions with the last 5 being boosts to the scar. To say I am nervous is an understatement. Terrified is much more accurate. I am so grateful to have this place and all of you wonderful women Feels less lonely and more doable as I read your stories thank you coyote for keeping up with everyone Blessings",

Would make it easier even if it's only a small detail in the big picture of all this breast cancer trauma. Labelle, I really like your lottery ticket idea. I hope you get lots of winners.",

So I am a little behind the rest of you but wanted to ask those of you that have tissue expanders in place how long you had to heal prior to starting rads and if you have found getting your arm in position ( above your head ) difficult or painful. Any advice is welcome. Thanks Good luck to everyone too",

Embarrassing but true to how I feel. I was told to start with 100% aloe vera gel the first week or so and move to aquafor as I needed it. I looked for the aloe vera gel but haven't been able to find 100%. Everything has some sort of preservative list of ingredients or dye. Does anyone know if that matters or where to find the good stuff?? And I have all of the markings drawn on me so won't using these products make them wipe off? Argh",

I am happy to say that with Physical Therapy I did get my range of motion back and per my therapist have not had measurable swelling in my arm. The problem is something is still not \"right\". This will probably sound stupid but the back of my arm and upper back feel weird all the time. Yes it is numb in these areas but that isn't it. My therapist seems dismissive of my complaints and I feel frustrated. I have an arm sleeve that I got during treatment and wear it frequently because as soon as I put it on I feel relief in the back of my arm but as soon as I take it off the sensation is the same there and remains continuous in my back (right side latissimus area). I feel lopsided and acutely aware of this feeling almost all of the time. The BMX has been traumatic enough but as many have said before this SE from rx is the worst. Any ideas to help or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. thank you Log in to post a reply",

I am happy because it feels good to hear some validation that I am not just imagining this. Frustrated that I have been complaining about it to my doctors for sometime now with no one seeming that interested and sad to have to admit to myself that I have a problem like LE. It is such a miserable side effect. I never imagined. But I guess the sooner I can get help the faster I can feel better. I googled the cami you mentioned and plan to order asap. Do they run true to size/measurement? They seem pretty strict on the returns so I'm just trying to get it right the first time. Any other suggestions are welcomed. Thank you again for your help.
