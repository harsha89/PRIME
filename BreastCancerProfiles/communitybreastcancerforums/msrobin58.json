As soon as she hooked up the bag that said antihistamine, I was out for two hours, hubby said. I'm still feeling quite well, but eating cautiously anyway, toast with peanut butter, soup, mashed potatoes, roast chicken, eggs, fruits and veggies. I guess all the pre meds are holding on, but I have pills here for when they give out. This is day three, so I'm on guard for the next couple days when many women say they start to get a bit queasy. I'm ready with sea bands and various ginger products. The Neulasta pod thing was quite interesting. It was stuck to my belly, and timed to inject 27 hours after my infusion was complete. Didn't hurt a bit, but was strange nonetheless. For the few hours leading up to then, I could feel myself getting weaker, just at the time the oncologist said your white blood cells drop. The first night I slept well, last night the steroids hit me. My face turned hot and beet red, and I was awake for a few hours in the middle of the night. But if it's keeping the nausea at bay, so what! I counted yesterday as a gift, same thing today. A little tired, but hanging in there!",

My nerves always go my stomach, and I've often been queasy since my diagnosis in January. Antibiotics make me nervous every time, but I'm on my third round so far this year, once after my lumpectomy as a matter of course, once again shortly after that for a touch of cellulitis around the incision, and now for just a smidge of redness near the upper port incision. That being said, the pre meds are holding tough and I can honestly say I haven't had any nausea yet. You might want to see if you can get an anxiety med so you don't go in already queasy. And tell them you need all the help you can get with nausea! I was given three different types before my infusion, that hit different receptors in your brain. I don't know if that's the normal protocol, but it worked for me.",

I'll continue to keep tabs on my temp, but for now I've taken Tylenol. MamaEnki-You understand just how I'm feeling, like the flu. If I can avoid that sick feeling on Taxol, I'll be pleased. I actually like wearing dark nail polish, so that's my plan for dealing with those dark spots. Are they simply cosmetic or does it mean you may lose your nails? Funny thing is, on AC my nails have been better than ever! But I think it's just because I haven't been doing much gardening or housework. notanisland-I'm sure you are glad to have the AC neutropenia behind you, because you sure know what I'm going through. Sorry to hear that Taxol is aggravating your sinus condition. We've been on similar journeys, so let's hope it doesn't happen to me. Claritin is also something that I've been taking for my allergies, so maybe it will help me with SE. BJI-I'm curious if the achy bones will get me when I start Taxol. I haven't had that issue from my Neulasta shots. But because I have problems with lower back pain, my doctor already has me on Gabapentin/Neurontin, and I understand that can help this issue. LovePugs, my drippy nose has been making me crazy through most of my AC treatments. A nurse told me it's the Cytoxan part that does it, and here I thought it was my lack of nose hair! On my good days, I've tried to garden, which was nearly impossible with my crazy nose dripping. A friend advised me to stick tampons in my nose, and that comical image gave me such a chuckle.",

I'm still in the hospital and probably will be till Monday. My counts have climbed slightly, and no fever yet today, so that's improvement. I also managed to eat a few bites. Yesterday it was almost nothing. They removed my port today, suspecting it as the source of infection. It was almost three weeks ago, and yet I still had some redness there despite a round of antibiotics. The infectious disease doctor took one look at it, and just knew. I'll get a new one on Monday, on the other side. The doctor who did my procedure today says she has much better results putting ports on the right blah blah blah vein instead of the jugular. I think they originally chose the left so it was opposite of the affected breast and future radiation. She pooh-poohed that. I've definitely learned about the nadir our counts reach on days 7-10, despite the Neulasta. For my own peace of mind, I'll be hyper vigilant at that time, remaining in isolation, even eating the neutrapenic diet at that time. I don't want to do this again.

MsLin, I'm using the same philosophy, I'm trying to own my new look. I've always been a bit bohemian anyway, so I'm using my many colorful scarves to wrap around my head. Trust me, I can always find one to coordinate with what I'm wearing. I've also upped my lipstick game, wearing red or other dark colors that I wouldn't wear before. And I think large hoop earrings look great with scarf heads, so I'm going for it. Maybe they'll think I'm mysterious instead of a chemo patient. That being said, I'm not looking forward to losing my brows and lashes. I've got fake lashes to apply, and a good brow pencil. I hope I'm successful at drawing them in, but my friend had a good suggestion to go to Ulta and let them help me. And now for a brief bit of negativity. I sure am scared to get my second dose, and start all this nonsense all over again. When my WBC nadir hits on days 7-10, I'll quarantine myself I suppose. But it didn't help last time, now did it? My first question for the MO in the morning will be why the Neulasta didn't seem to work on me. Onward to better days!",

I can only seem to taste salty things, and sweets taste too cloying. BreastlessBeth-I think PTSD is probably pretty normal considering what we're all going through.

The nurse it often starts to grow back during this course,but no sign yet. I'm sure growing weary of the bald look. notanisland You've had some challenges too, that's for sure. I'm glad to hear your tumor is shrinking, but would also be a bit frightened if I wasn't able to finish chemo. I already had my tumor removed before starting chemo, but I'm terrified that it will return since my Oncotype Dx score was 66! Even though my lymph nodes were clear, this tough chemo course is to prevent a recurrence. And I still have radiation afterwards. lovepugs77 I had my expectations too high for Taxol also.

I thought I\u2019d at least have some improvement by now. The nurse practitioner reminded me that there\u2019s no guarantee it will heal at all. My taste buds are near normal but I never did get back my taste for sweets, and that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m still losing weight though, surely from removing sweets from my life, not to mention trying to keep myself healthy with my eating. My hair is growing in well. I finally gave up the fake lashes and my brows are nearly normal. By spring I may be game to stop wearing hats. We\u2019ll see. I actually find my stubble kind of cute, but it\u2019s just too chilly to go bareheaded. I finished radiation on January 4, and I truly think it was a piece of cake compared to chemo. I didn\u2019t have any burned skin till nearly four weeks in, but fatigue was noticeable. Quick afternoon naps worked great for me. The skin irritation was short lived, thankfully. I was quite thrilled for radiation to end simply because it meant my nasty treatment year was over! Because my cancer was estrogen positive, I\u2019m stuck taking this Arimidex for the next ten years. The hot flashes are nasty, but generally only last about a minute. Still there are many times I feel that I will spontaneously combust! Keeping in mind that I sing at church and therefore sit near the altar, recently my pastor noticed me frantically fanning myself and literally stopped his sermon to tell someone to turn down the heat! Oh my did we laugh over that one! And I told him later not to worry when he saw me fanning because it was just medication induced hot flashes. I was not embarrassed, only amused! The other side effect is joint pain, which shows itself by going right to my already bad knee and settling in. I\u2019ve already had knee replacement on the other side so I was hoping not to have to do the other one. This may escalate that. But even with these two issues, I\u2019ll continue to take this medicine designed to keep a recurrence far away from me. Hope everyone else is doing well!",

Of course I talked to my MO before hand, his remarks were \"It looks like you got into some trouble!\" He was surprised that they kept me five days, he thought 48 hours would do. So that got us into a discussion about the Neulasta injection, and how it did not appear to work on me. As I suspected, he wants me to come in tomorrow for my Neulasta injection, to be sure it goes in. Neither one of us trust the on-body pods at this point. He said I'm the second person in six months that had this issue, and he wasn't happy about it. He also lowered my dose by 10%, which is still considered in the effective range. After all that discussion, I'm feeling better that this round will go smoothly. Other than being tired and groggy, I feel very well tonight. I know pre meds have a lot to do with it, but I'll take it. Two more quick things, he's going to bring me in for blood count check after one week. I like that idea. And he gave me a prescription for what he called Magic Mouthwash, to be used and swallowed four times a day.

NCBeachGirl, mostly I've been wearing my own scarves wrapped around my head in gypsy styles. It's been fun to experiment, and I have enough colors to match everything I wear. I picked up a couple of bucket hats from Target, checking to make sure they have good coverage. From TLC Direct, I ordered a plain sleeping cap to keep hair from getting all over my pillow. I'll probably sleep bald once my hair is completely gone. I also ordered a pre tied scarf that I don't like as well, because it doesn't fit snug around my face. But then again, my glasses push it out some. My favorite from TLC are the ones called Chemo Beanies. They slip on easily, fit nicely, and have a ruffle at the bottom. I'm going to order another one. I also picked up some headbands, because they can be used to fill that gap around the edges of your hats. Brneyegrl66-I'm so glad you had a good day. I consider those days gifts.

It's my own fault, I suppose, for not making it clear until now that I was not managing well. I'm trying to remember if I ever told him before that *every*single*bite* was a struggle to get down.

Sometimes I just focus so hard on getting through my days that I have little energy for anything else. To say that I'm quite selfish these days would be putting it mildly. I'm on day 13 from my 3rd AC treatment, with my final one scheduled for July 5. While nothing serious has gone wrong, it's still been a rough go this time. I'm going to blame the promised cumulative effects, as each has been a little worse than the one before. I'm so glad to hear that many of you are sailing through chemo with few ill effects. Please keep posting and never feel guilty for those of us struggling. I think the difference is what regimen we're all on. AC is known to be the worst, the big guns, if you will. Most of the time those us having a rough go are on AC. As usual I have to fight through the neutropenia period. Some women feel normal even while their WBC dips, but for me it's a lot like having the flu. I just feel awful days 5-11. And the self imposed isolation is trying. I'm feeling a bit better now, but I've developed my first mouth sores which make eating difficult. I can't stomach the nauseating Magic Mouthwash he gave me for it, and I suppose I'm too late for the preventive baking soda/salt water rinse. Is there anything healing I can use? I'm also fighting with my bowels which alternate between two opposite poles. I'm at my wits end, trying to get to that third week of normalcy which should start any day. I'll be so disappointed if I don't get much normal this time.",

I just never know what's going to happen exactly, since I've had all manner of SE on my journey. All I know is that soon AC's ugly effects will be behind me, and I can move forward into the Taxol adventure. While they keep telling me it will be easier, it sounds like it will mostly just be different. Less nausea and less neutropenia will be most welcome! But the trade off sounds like more pain related SE. I'm more confident in my ability to handle pain. After all, I've had a bone on bone bad knee that was excruciating and was eventually fully replaced. That stuff is not for sissies, so pain doesn't scare me as much as the tummy troubles I've been dealing with. Either way, my last AC treatment is behind me and I sure won't miss it!",

I see a lot of Taxol ladies talking about their hair falling out, but I assume that they are starting chemo with Taxol. On AC, my head hair fell out about 99% two weeks after my first treatment, which is the norm. The remaining 1% never fell out, mostly around the edges. The rest of my hair fell out after AC #3, including nose, pubic, lashes, and brows. I don't know when my legs or underarms went because I shaved them at the start and they never returned. Again each loss left me a few stragglers, except nose which drives me crazy! I'm going through mountains of tissues, as each tiny sniff is an emergency when you don't have nose hair to catch it! I can be sitting there innocently and suddenly a drip decides to exit my nose with no warning. Argh! LOL",

I keep using the excuse of not feeling well, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a legit excuse. Why do I feel that I have to lay low and take it easy instead of grabbing life now?",

Tomorrow is treatment day, and I have to decide what to say about it. Is it bad enough to delay again, or is it actually a bit better? Hard to say for sure. With only three treatments left, I just want to be finished! I must admit that I\u2019m dreading those last treatments, with all those unpleasant SE\u2019s. I\u2019ve been sleeping normally, eating better, gained energy, and even gained a bit of taste. I honestly thought I had just gained insomnia, when it turns out that it was a simply part of my side effects. Do you know how enjoyable it has been to sleep peacefully? Ahhhhh! Paulette. I\u2019m sorry that your infusion is a struggle. My MO doesn\u2019t advocate icing, and I know I couldn\u2019t bear the cold anyway. Besides, I think it\u2019s too late.

The week after #9 was rough indeed, and I\u2019d not like to go through it again. Others have said that their hair came in white but soon transitioned into color. They simply snipped off the white ends. I hope they\u2019re right, because mine is also coming in bright white. I had dyed my hair for so long that I\u2019m not entirely sure how much gray I have. But pure white? That\u2019s for older ladies than myself! Lol Dodgersgirl, my nails are a bit sore, but not discolored. My toenails are slightly lifted, and the purple/red blotches are actually on the skin of my feet. Where those same blotches showed up on my hands, is now peeling skin. Gross, I know! I\u2019m glad to hear your pain is fading. I have a hard time telling the difference between nail pain, neuropathy, and the whole rashy, peeling, raw skin thing. My poor feet! ",

His plan is to take me off the dose dense therapy and switch to every three weeks for the next two. I guess that won't be so bad, gives me chance for a little normalcy between doses. But I can't help but think that my chance for recurrence may have just inched up, since this isn't the toughest plan we originally planned. We also talked about the nausea/queasy/lack of appetite. I've lost about fifteen pounds already, which would normally be good news. But again he shook his head when saying that my insurance company had rejected the better meds!

The fatigue was frustrating, but I was still grateful not to feel ill. By Monday I started to perk up a bit, and Tuesday I even went to a chair yoga class at the cancer center. I was the youngest one in the class at 59, and the only one currently going through treatment. But I'm feeling so weak after AC that I thought I should start slowly like that. It really did feel good to move again. I also returned to my chiropractor for the first time in months, so I really got all my kinks out! I even shopped a little and went to choir practice, but that was a lot for one day and wore myself out. Taxol #2 in the morning. In some ways I'm going to miss that third week honeymoon where I felt fairly normal. Not much turn around with this. If this first time is indicative, fatigue is going to be the enemy.

The real Robin has often been lost during this journey, to be replaced by a much more sedate version. So the real Robin was enjoying her time at the cancer center today, believe it or not.

I\u2019ve had surgery already so next will be radiation for me. Lovepugs I have that same white fuzz all over my head and I assume my hair is just that gray. After all, I am 59 years old! But maybe it will turn back to color like yours. Sounds like radiation is going well for you.

Went back in to get my blood count rechecked on day 14 from my second AC treatment, and my WBC had rebounded nicely. I felt like I was released from prison! After quarantining myself the week before due to neutropenia, it felt wonderful to be out in the world again. I ran errands, shopped, went out to eat, and saw friends. The next day, I went back to my beloved gardening, and it filled me with joy. I've been working intently the last few days as my garden club wants me to be on their tour in mid July. The GC president, who happens to be a dear friend of mine, has assured me they will bring a crew to help me prepare. They've actually helped me several times already when my count dips low and have been told to avoid gardening at that time to avoid the risk of infection. My time is the hospital has made me overly cautious on that score! My third treatment is Tuesday the 13th, and of course I dread it since I'm so enjoying this period of wellness. But I'll be getting Sustol for the first time, so hopefully the nausea will be less of an issue. Please! Still, I fully expect to get neutropenic again, which I find to be a royal pain. Neulasta doesn't appear to work much on me.",

I'm starting to climb out of that yucky period, but it has sure been slow. Here I am at day 13, and I'm still battling. We've decided that when they say the effects are cumulative, believe them. Each one was worse than the one before, and took longer to recover from. But I'm grateful to notice daily improvement. I still need to gain stamina. It feels a lot like the recovery from major surgery. You don't feel well in many ways, while also feeling weak as a lamb. That part is very frustrating to me. I guess this is why even my oncologist says \"You don't handle this (AC) very well.",

I can't even take NyQuil when my stomach isn't queasy from chemo, so I knew it would be a no-go. It was very frustrating to have those mouth sores and not be able to do much except drink water. I did chew ice during the AC treatments but it didn't help. They usually hit about the two week mark. Maybe Taxol will give me a break in that respect. Obviously I am very curious about this next part, and I appreciate you ladies answering my questions.",

I could barely keep my head up, yet it also gave me restless legs, so instead of sleeping, I just remained in a fog throughout the day. The fog lifts in the evening and then the steroids kick in and I'm awake all night. It's quite a turnabout in one day! I finally fell asleep around 5 but woke up at 8. It's happened both times, so next time I'm not even going to attempt getting into bed until much later, to cut down on frustration. Saturday was a good day, did a lot of housework, got some groceries, went to a church picnic, then to see a friend perform at the local bar. Sunday was the complete opposite, I was tired, cranky, and sore all day. Looks like Sunday is going to be my low point each week. Feeling slightly more perky today. Last week I felt pretty well on Tuesday and Wednesday leading back into Thursday treatment day. Because my AC treatments were so rough on me, I've been feeling a decided lack of stamina. I took a chair yoga class at the cancer center, and found it to be a great way to ease back into moving my body again. I may be 59 years old, but I was definitely the youngest one in the class! But I was still feeling weak enough that I didn't want to tip over. LOL It was actually the perfect starting point, and a surprisingly good stretch. I've been practicing the moves on my own at home, plus adding some short walks around the block. It wasn't too long ago that I'd walk 3 miles a day, but this is a start. I plan to continue going to the chair yoga and will add their gentle yoga class as I progress.",

My eyebrows and lashes fell out after my fourth AC. They say my head hair will start to grow back during Taxol but it will be hard to tell. I've had some stubble all along, especially around the edges. I'm starting to look wistfully at women with hair. I'm also noticing how frequently my friends complain about their hair! I chuckled along and reminded them of my own situation. Perhaps they were grateful for their troublesome hair after that. BCFighter2017, congratulations on completing chemo! Is there a bell to ring like at my center? I saw them taking pictures and videos, and just generally celebrating the event. Good luck with your surgery. I had my lumpectomy with sentinel node removal before chemo. notanisland, I had lumpectomy with reconstruction and two sentinel nodes removed, which were clear. But I did have a drain for several weeks. I found it difficult to bathe at first, tubes, drains, dressing, etc. Hubby was a lot of help in that regard. You'll be uncomfortable and you won't be able to lift or carry. It wasn't miserable by any means, but give yourself some slack. NurseinBoots, good news that the masses shrank! Good luck with Taxol. It's not a picnic, but definitely easier than the AC.  ",

Yes, I tired quicker, but I'd just sit and rest for awhile before taking off again for more fun. Seeing the grandkids did me so much good! And they never said a word about my hats and scarves, even though I had a little speech prepared. Visited with the inlaws and my siblings too. It wore me out, but was so worth it. Drove over to my beachy hometown on Sunday, which is my most tired and achy day. But the three hour drive allowed me to rest and nap. Made it down to the beach and lighthouse in time for sunset. Hubby was worried about me climbing around on the sand dunes taking pictures, but it's what I love to do. Plus I discovered that my achy joints actually felt better moving around, so we even walked all the way out to the end of the pier. The next few days I just dragged hubby back and forth to my favorite stores, beaches, and restaurants while taking lots of pictures. Saw my bestie a few times, and I thought she was going to squeeze the stuffing out of me! I even indulged myself at the spa with a mani pedi. Back at it today with Taxol #4. 8 more to go. Not quite as groggy this time, guess I'm getting used to the Benadryl. But here it is two am, and the steroids have me wide awake. Oh well, I enjoy the energy boost I'll have tomorrow. I'd say the most bothersome part so far is the way food tastes like cardboard, and my achy weekends. Nausea has not been an issue, THANK GOODNESS, but my appetite isn't all there. Still losing weight, but at a much more reasonable rate. 32 lbs. so far. I'm starting to have to buy some smaller sizes, because nothing says cancer patient than a woman wearing hats and droopy clothing. Quiet group lately, are you ladies still out there?",

While I definitely agree with this, my frequent delays worry me. I'm frightened that it's weakening the effects of my chemotherapy! My AC was supposed to be every two weeks, but my body just couldn't handle it and they switched me to every three weeks. Now I've only had five Taxol treatments and I'm three weeks behind with delays! That makes a lot of changes to my original treatment plan, and my fear is that the chemo just won't work quite as well as it could have, allowing the cancer to return. That's why I've been so bothered by the delays. RebaMacFan123-I was too sick and weak to fight much during my AC treatments, but the Taxol has been kinder to me. So now I can fight! MoodyBlues-isn't it maddening how much this disease has taken from us? I'm trying to find my real self again, but I must admit to struggling with self image problems. My physical appearance shouldn't matter that much, but it does. My bald head, no eyebrows or lashes, scars, two different sized breasts, and just plain feeling ill have all combined to make me feel so unattractive. I'm sorry you had to postpone your last treatment. Someone rang the bell at my place today, and I was envious! PauletteK, good luck on your first Taxol treatment tomorrow! I hope it goes well. LovePugs77, I sure hope to see some returning hair growth soon! I'm older than you at 59, so I don't really care what color it is. I've colored it for so many years that I'm not entirely sure how much gray I have! I don't want to continue coloring it due to the chemicals. But if it makes me look old, I might weaken that stance. Notanisland, don't you wonder why we in particular struggle with low blood counts? The isolation wears on me, as does trying to stay out of my garden. A couple weeks ago, I was feeling so well and spent several hours on a Wednesday digging and planting. The next day I went in for my treatment and my WBC was dangerously low! I really took a risk, and didn't even know it. Now I'm frightened to garden, and will have to leave it to hubby. I'm glad that your postponement gave you some relief from the neuropathy.  ",
