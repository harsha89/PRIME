Isn't that strange? On the one hand it is great but the other feeling is the apprehension of dealing with the anxiety of moving into the next phase, which for me is Hormone therapy----then reconstruction later in the year. So far, the only person causing me anxiety about \"moving on\" is myself! I really want to enjoy my summer!

I'm sure my blood counts crashed because I couldn't even walk across the room without the heart pounding, out of breath stuff. Somehow, just knowing others are dealing with similar circumstances is helpful---even though I feel bad that others are going through the same thing! Does that make sense? My \"Cleaning for a Reason\" housecleaing service came yesterday. She was awesome! I had a very emotional reaction when she left--was like that the rest of the day. I know that because I felt so bad physically, the emotional stuff just kicked in. The other day in a grocery store an older lady tapped me on the shoulder and asked me if she could pray for me---I said \"Of course\" thinking she meant she would going home to pray for me. Instead, she gently hugged me and whispered a short, sweet prayer in my ear. At the time it gave me comfort---that day, I had not worn my wig but had on a hat (I think it is called a bucket hat) that I got from the TLC catalog. She was not loud or intrusive but it was quick, very natural for her... I don't think I would ever do that to anyone but I appreciated the gesture at the time. I am working during this garbage....I usually take about 4-5 days off per treatment cycle (I am on a 3 week TAC treatment). I was granted 25 days from the Sick Leave Bank but I have to request, with the doctor's signature, every day I use. That means I have to really stay of top of the days and how they fall into the payroll schedule. If I don't get them in on time, they'll dock my pay and won't reimburse me.....I still have a few days left of my own leave that I have to exhaust first. As some of the rest of you have experienced, this third treatment was the worst.....day 3 and 4 were horrible. Felt well enough to work days 5 and 6 and then yesterday-day 7 was another bad day. Today I'm feeling much better but still not able to do much. I'll have my blood counts checked again tomorrow. Our Spring Break is next week and I hope to fly to see my mother. It will be the first time I've been on a plane since diagnosis/surgery/chemo......don't know what to expect. Have any of you flown since doing all this......? Any suggestions or hints?
