    "Content": "cmlorino1 wrote: LymphademaMy sister has been diagnosed with breast cancer. I was wondering if 1 lymph node is removed from each breast during bilateral mastectomy, is lymphadema a concern. If so, would she be required to wear a compression sleeve when flying, on both arms? Would she be limited in needle sticks, blood pressure, etc. in both arms? She is trying to decide if she should not take a node from the breast with no cancer. Her cancer is DCIS, Stage \"O\" on the left, however, they will not be certain of that until surgery due to additional deeper calcifications that were not biopsied. Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
