Breast cancer also spreads through the lymph system and blood stream.  I had clear lymph nodes, but biopsy report said \"suspicious for lymphatic invasion.\"  This is different than having it in the nodes.  The purpose of chemo is to knock out the stray cells that may not be picked up in tests...it's systemic.  It's good that you are arming yourselves with as much info as possible before your wife makes her treatment decisions.   Best wishes to you both- Patrice (GSG) ",

I had my ovaries removed so I could take Arimidex for 5 years, but I was 50 at the time.  If I were younger, I would have taken the Tamoxifen.  In fact, I feel very fortunate to have something I can still take every day...mentally, it's comforting.  At the end of 5 years, if my bones are okay, I'm going to ask if I can stay on it.  After 16 months, I've had no side effects. I would also recommend reading about flax seed and breast cancer.  I'm starting now to ingest 3 TBS of freshly ground flax seed a day.  Studies show, it can reduce breast cancer tumors.  I figure it can't hurt. Bottom line, though, your wife must be comfortable and at peace with the decisions made, and in this journey, everybody's emotions and needs are different.   Good luck to you both.",

As an aside, if your wife hasn't done this already (or been given one by her doctor's office), put together a 3-ring notebook and every time a test is done or a report is issued, get a copy of it and stick it in the book.  (They have to give it to you.)  Stick it in a satchel and have it with her everywhere she goes.  You have no idea how important this is and how much it will be used.  I still keep mine in the trunk of my car and take it in with me for every doctor's appt.  Cancer can be a full-time job for a while, and it's made a lot easier if you can keep the stuff organized. Here's a link to a thread that has a description and picture of the patient book I use.  It's still my bible and other specialists I go to (even noncancer related), are happy to have all the reports & history right at their fingertips.  http://community.breastcancer.org/topic/7/conversation/702723?page=1#comment_866871 take care- Patrice (GSG) ",

I, too, have been irritated at how they only show the \"pretty\" petite women who seem to come out of treatment looking none the worse for wear.   It's not even close to what breast cancer looks (and feels) like. It almost sends the message that\"treatment has come so far\" it's not that big of a deal.  The awareness they are promoting is kind of a sham in many cases. Thank you...just thank you.",

Don't fret over the old onc.  You aren't the first person who has come to him who wanted a second opinion and you surely won't be the last....and lots of women on this board have switched oncs.  Oncs know it's important that the patient is comfortable with them and that not everyone is a good fit.   Just stay focused on what you have to do to make yourself feel better and everything else will fall into place. ",

The \"Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996\" (HIPAA) requires guaranteed renewability for all health plans, including individual insurance. The law says that \"a health insurance issuer that provides individual health insurance coverage to an individual shall renew or continue in force such coverage at the option of the individual.\" There are several exceptions. Again, according to the law, \"A health insurance issuer may nonrenew or discontinue health insurance coverage of an individual in the individual market based only on one or more of the following: (1) Nonpayment of premiums; (2) Fraud; (3) Termination of plan; (4) Movement outside service area.\" As you see, this list does not include an exception for reaching a lifetime maximum benefit. If you have a question about the applicability of this law with respect to a lifetime maximum benefit on your plan, consult the insurance company or call your state's insurance department. \"",

What was nice about doing chemo first was I was able to feel the tumors shrinking.  By the time they did surgery, there were no live cancer cells left.  As others have said, chemo is different for everybody...some girls breeze through...others it's rougher, but definitely doable.  I never had one moment of nausea...the meds for side effects today are remarkable. Rads also were no problem for me.  I'm now on a drug similar to Tamox, but given to postmenopausal women, Arimidex, and have had no side effects from that either. Breast cancer does change your life forever, but it turned out the treatment part was not at all as bad as I was expecting. Good luck to you both! Patrice (GSG)",

I never experienced radiation fatigue and I credit that to swimming laps for 1 hour each day.  I think the coolness of the water also helped. Good luck to you...you're almost there! ",

My mother and I read through the angels list on the board yesterday....besides being completely heartbroken, we had a sense of incredulousness and outrage...but also helplessness.",

At least now, if I have a recurrence, I will not be second guessing any decisions made 2 years ago.  For me, that was important.  But you will find with this disease, everybody's emotional (and physical) needs are different and it's important all decisions made in your wife's case are what makes her the most comfortable.  As you move further along this path, you will come to realize how \"individual\" this disease is...it's different for each person...the treatments, side effects, emotional impact.  That really surprised me.  It's what makes this board so helpful...while not everybody will experience a particular side effect or issue, someone will come along who has and can shed insight.",

Here's a study on the calendula ointment published in the reputable Journal of Clinical Oncology.  It was comparing calendula with biafine and you can see how much better the calendula was. (I bought the ointment, not the cream.)  I think it was about $7 for a tube.  I hope you are able to get some relief.  Also, as I said, keep the pure aloe in the refrigerator.  It really does feel soothing and cool when you rub it on. jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/f...   Keep me posted on how the rest of your treatments go.  I'm going to be watching for you.

I may have been bald, bloated and funky on the outside, but she made me feel like a girl on the inside and i walked out with a smile on my face looking at my 8 painted toenails. Here's a toast to your first postchemo pedicure!  Enjoy!",

I had chemo prior to lumpectomy and by the time they did my surgery,  ALL cancer cells were dead.  Chemo is not easy, but not as bad as I thought it would be and I found out I actually liked having no hair, which was a shock because I had pretty good hair and don't have the \"face\" to look good without any.  But it was great being able to shower and run.  I even stopped wearing my wigs.  Radiation truly was a breeze for me.  So treatment turned out not to be as daunting as I first feared. My cancer year was 2 years ago and there is now no evidence of disease.  This could be your mother's path as well. Once you and your mother start learning more about breast cancer and her specifics, you'll be able to relax and start taking control of her life again. Good luck to you both- Patrice (GSG)",

I've read on some websites to use 1/3 cup of molasses. ",

Congratulations and hope you AND your mother enjoy your day! ",
