I felt a lump mid April 2011, went to my family Dr April 19th, they sent me to the radiologist where I had 2 ultrasounds, and 2 mamograms. The radoilogist then sugested a core needle biopsy. I had the biopsy done on April 26, and received the phone call on April 27th. I have DCIS, no lymphnodes affected. I had surgeries May 16th & May 24th, Chemo every 3 weeks from June 20th - October 3rd, Radiation every day (Mon-Fri) from November 1st - December 21st. My hair is starting to grow back, and I am hoping to be wigless in the next 2 months!  ",
