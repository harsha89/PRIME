In my mind now....I'm cancer free. Yes said my doc you are but....I recommend chemo then herceptin then rads then hormone therapy. Woah!! Said I!! Overkill? What's chemo zapping if I'm cancer free eh?? Well...there's sign of vascular invasion. And chemo will mop these up and give you better chance of no reoccurrance. As will rads. So says I ...I have to fill my healthy body with poison then....no he said. ...your choice. I wonder if he knew that I know a \"secret\" questionnaire asked oncologists if they'd take chemotherapy. ....a large percentage said no! I'm in the no to chemo camp (very contravercial I hear you say...especially in the uk!). Doc could give me NO guarantees either way with or without chemotherapy of it reoccurring. I'm yet to see my oncologist. I'm dreading it really as I bet he/she isn't expecting my response. I'd dearly love to hear from anyone who's in my camp. ...they're few n far between in the uk! Surely there's other routes I can take....why o why can't I be given herceptin alone? Isn't there trials of this type? I canf find any in the UK. Thanks for reading xx I'm 48 by the way.",
