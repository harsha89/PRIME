The worry and fear that runs through us all waiting to be DX is almost paralyzing or it is for me. I have even found some Breast Centers (at least one in my area) that is very cold & isn't up to date with the Breast Cancers out there that made me feel like just another \"11 o'clock appointment\". It seemed that unless I had a LUMP that JUMPED out I had nothing. As many have told me \"YOU HAVE TO BE YOUR OWN BEST ADVOCATE\" & \"YOU KNOW YOUR BODY BETTER THAN ANYONE\" . It took my insurance a year of testing silly things first & a very wonderful Dr. Broady had to fight with the insurance board to allow him to do a hysterectomy on me when I was 25. Because it took so long they were forced to take everything leaving me on Hormones since. It took me 5 doctors before finding that doctor, do NOT give up. Thinking of everyone and Praying for all.

I was already stressed and at a very emotional point with No answers and yet more symptom's popping up almost weekly and when I read something about me \"not wanting help\" or \"wanting cancer\"  that was my breaking point. I am sorry for those who've been such a wonderful support and I am very Thankful for you all. Now I have been waiting and trying to deal with life a day at a time. As of last week I've been getting more pain, my nipple is very dark almost black (left side), I have such awful pain in the breast and nipple. I ended up going to my GYN and was seen by another doctor there who ended up to be an Angel... She saw the difference in the color of the nipple (other is pale/white), saw the swollen look of the left breast, felt the firm feeling of the left breast and most importantly she felt the mass/lump/spot... It just came up last week but when it did it caused more pain than I ever thought I could handle. After she felt that she said \"Get dressed we need to get you to a Breast Surgeon\" . When we talked she told me that the long odd shape hard mass that I am feeling and that is causing so much pain is a Duct (12 o'clock position) and there is another on the bottom part of the same areola between the 5/6 position that is firm but not yet like the other. The area that is near that swollen Duct feels as if it's Bruised and I no longer even wash that breast daily but every other day because of the pain. I go tomorrow at 10am to see the Breast Surgeon. I don't like having this mass but at the same time I feel it will get me more answers than not having it but just having pain and swelling. Again Thank you all. I will let you know how it went and what they find. I hope you can understand that mini breakdown. Praying for you all daily, Angel Log in to post a reply",

I'm sorry that you have to know what it feels like waiting...... As for ranting... GO FOR IT! There is NOTHING at all wrong with it and gets some of the pressure off your shoulders. It's hard going on with life when you can't seem to ever feel comfortable because of discomfort and pain. It's not much of a life living like that either. I've heard way too many life stories now about how long it's taken someone to get relief from one disorder or another and to even be DX sometimes can take soooo long even YOU can start to feel like you're nuts..... I won't ever give up and would tell the same to EVERYONE else who is going through something like this. Giving up is NOT an option. I've even seen shows now called \"MEDICAL MYSTERY'S\" and as long a wait as I've had there are longer and there are doctors who'll get the answers. I am not alone... as sad at that is. I hope everyone is having a great week and the weekend gets even better. GOD Bless,",

I've found that this doctor really does want to help and wasn't passing me on because he didn't want to help but because he wanted to rule stuff out. I will have to have many more test as to why my ANA test came back so high/elevated and I'm not worried about that at all because I know they WILL find out and help me. The white blood count being low... I'm not even worried about that because again I'm going to get answers and treatment whatever that may be. I can say today I feel such relief inside, such peace.... I am still in pain but KNOWING someone is doing something I am okay taking my medicine knowing I'm NOT masking it but giving myself a little less stress until we know what it is. Yeah, Vickie \"Dip and Dot's\" snow flakes!!! I couldn't believe it and I would've loved to have seen much more but it's gone, melted the same day. Next time I'm running to get my camera and taking pics. I'd love to have about 5 inches and send some your way too. I Love snow just not the cold, although I love the fall above all seasons. One more thing.... the doctor told me \"Angel you know this biopsy is going to leave a is scar right\" ... I wasn't sure why he said that but I told him \"Doc, I don't care if leaves many scars I want this help and it's not like I walk around the streets without a shirt on, heck at this point I'd be okay with you taking the whole thing\". Of course only if they had to. Thank you all and know I APPRECIATE ALL the advice and caring thoughts.",

I too had a \"no show\" lump but could definitely feel it.  Doc found it during biopsy and it was cancer, much to everyone's surprise.  It is doubtful yours is cancer just because of the odds, but get it out anyway. My  doctor found a lump which did not show up on mammogram or ultrasound, even though we knew exactly where to look.  I was offered needle biopsy, core biopsy or just removal.  I chose the middle ground, core biopsy, which showed 1.7 cm of malignant tumor It was lobular instead of ductal which means it hides in the small milk-producing lobes and is very hard to detect.\"  So, at least I know again it's not just my US not showing up what we can all feel. Now the next step is to get a biopsy or at the very least take a look at it. The BS did say he would just waiting on my \"call back\". I seem to do a LOT of that.",

I am doing ALL I can and not sure why this is going on but it is. I'm sorry you had to go through what you did and I'm so very happy that you were able to get the help you needed and fast. My prayer will continue to be for you to be cancer free. As soon as I know what is going on I will let you all know and until that time Thank you for the support. Anyone living near Knoxville Tennessee is welcome to come with me to a doctor appointment to see if another voice other than myself, my boyfriend and my doc. will help. Although as I said my insurance advocacy program is stepping in and we are waiting for the approval. State insurance isn't always great and sometimes takes awhile but when that is all you have it's better than nothing at all. I'm off for the weekend. Take care and  GOD Bless. ",

Time has been slow but I keep telling myself this is happening for a reason... One I can not understand or see but nonetheless I have to just go with it. I have an appointment this morning because of yet more problems. My wrist and hips have been hurting me (hips feel like they are crushing when I lay on my right side) I had an x-ray last week because my wrist has been hurting (haven't hurt it) but they said there was no break, fracture or sprain and put me on Naproxen, which has not helped. Well yesterday (around 5pm) my wrist got so bad that I couldn't even move it, after awhile I was able to move it but the pain is awful when trying to move it or lift anything. So, this morning I go in to see WHAT is going on now..... I'm too young to be falling apart.   I've been going to the Mountains (My Grandma passed away and we now have her home) which is in the middle of nowhere at the top of a mountain. It's so nice and peaceful, deer all over, wild turkey, cows and birds singing all the time. I Love it! It really does help. Know that I am thinking of all of you and Praying for you all as well.

I am sorry for those who've been such a wonderful support and I am very Thankful for you all. Now I have been waiting and trying to deal with life a day at a time. As of last week I've been getting more pain, my nipple is very dark almost black (left side), I have such awful pain in the breast and nipple. I ended up going to my GYN and was seen by another doctor there who ended up to be an Angel... She saw the difference in the color of the nipple (other is pale/white), saw the swollen look of the left breast, felt the firm feeling of the left breast and most importantly she felt the mass/lump/spot... It just came up last week but when it did it caused more pain than I ever thought I could handle. After she felt that she said \"Get dressed we need to get you to a Breast Surgeon\" . When we talked she told me that the long odd shape hard mass that I am feeling and that is causing so much pain is a Duct (12 o'clock position) and there is another on the bottom part of the same areola between the 5/6 position that is firm but not yet like the other. The area that is near that swollen Duct feels as if it's Bruised and I no longer even wash that breast daily but every other day because of the pain. I go tomorrow at 10am to see the Breast Surgeon. I don't like having this mass but at the same time I feel it will get me more answers than not having it but just having pain and swelling. Again Thank you all. I will let you know how it went and what they find. I hope you can understand that mini breakdown. Praying for you all daily, Angel Log in to post a reply",

I've even considered writing to that show \"Mystery Diagnosis\". It's a sad fact NOT all doctors are as fast as you are, I've been told to try many many different things ALL of which failed to work, I've been sent from one doctor to another and back to the \"Breast Surgeon\"... ALL doctors agree \"Something is going one no doubt but they don't know what it is\"..... My last GYN is the one who wants this OUT she says \"You may not be able to see it but everyone can sure feel it which means we can go in and take it out\". What it is..... Is that if it's not cut and dry out of the \"Medical Book\" cancer or deadly it's not in need of surgery and there is time to \"Rule out\" one by one everything else. When this is all over and I have faith that someone WILL get me an answer and treat this but I'll let you know. As for everyone else I want to Thank you for the on going support, encouragement and advice, it is much appreciated. I'm keeping you all in my prayers daily.",

I just knew you too haven't gotten true answers yet. I thought \"ruling out\" the implants which seem to mean it makes you less of a person/worry to doctors would help me to get results but as you know all to well... it does NOT and implants are still on the mind of those doctors. Due time though, OUR (everyone waiting) time WILL come and we'll get healthy again. If no one calls by Wed. my insurance advocacy person ask for me to call her back and she'll get me a biopsy come hell of high water. LOL! Although she is an advocate with my insurance she is NOT the one to \"approve\" but to push for it to be approved.  So, this mass/limp IS coming out. I'm done guessing and way past ready to know.  Thoughts and Prayers are with all those waiting and those in treatment.  ",

I have been to so many doctors from the Dermatologist, Immunologist and all of them sent me back to the \"BS\". My GP sent me to another BS and I have documents that state \"IBC must be considered and ruled out\" and I have documents that state \"I recommend a biopsy be done\" YES, all those and the one doctor \"Lewis\" who is proving to be very helpful but he to can only move as fast as my insurance will allow him; he did my 1st Punch Biopsy that showed up as \"Dermal Fibrosis\" which has been left not sure why... Something is causing this scaring in the tissue but we aren't sure what. The next step is to do a biopsy of the new mass/lump that my GYN believes is a swollen duct. I \"DID\" believe this was cancer when it started although I now am just so unsure but MY GUT does tell me SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG and the last time it did... I ended up getting a total Hysterectomy and that took many doctors as well and even a visit to a therapist who told me i\"It's not in your head, you don't need me you need medical attention\". I hate to say \"I'm not alone\" because it just means others are going through this. Look at \"Vickie\" she (as with me) was told it was the implants for sooo long (I got mine ruled out by testing) she has thickening and many other symptoms as well and she is still getting the run around, she has taken a BIG step to get her implants removed (which she believed wasn't the problem but wanted to get them out so Dr's couldn't keep using that) and now she is STILL in the same shape as she was before. So, it's not just me and there are \"Doctors\" out there that don't JUMP when someone says \"JUMP\", that aren't as educated as others (as they should be) and that don't see what might be unless it's some HUGE HARD MASS jumping out at them. Cancer or not it still interferes with the life and it still causes pain and still needs help.  I PRAY it's some odd infection.. I've had many blood test and been on many antibiotics, creams and anti-inflammatory med's . I'm NOT giving up because I want my life back and I want answers. I've even thought about (before knowing they are going to do a biopsy of that mass) asking to see an Infectious disease specialist. I do feel comfortable with Dr. Lewis and believe he'll take care of this. Right now I am at the Beach with my boyfriend (he's at a coaching clinic) and I've been trying to relax... some might think how nice but even this isn't enjoyable because of the pain/discomfort. THIS is why I'm NOT going to stop until I get answers and HEALED! I really do Pray for everyone on this site daily and will continue to. You are true Angel's on this board. THANKS. ",

I know he is bewildered just as I am and wanting to help.. he's just not sure how just yet but is willing to do what he can. I am putting my trust in him. For all those who are having problems with no answers and not being listen to... PUSH until you get an answer and understand what that is.

I'd like to say 100% it's not cancer and I'm willing to believe that right now and I mean that but what I don't know is WHAT THIS IS. It's hard to find people to confide in, who truly care and give advice and it's hard to be so open with your life and I found it here. As I've said for those who don't understand, aren't willing to hear that there are doctors (many) who don't go beyond and who pass you on and times that things aren't cut and dry and found asap, as we'd all like it. As of this post I am NOT talking about what was or wasn't said anymore. I'm still waiting on that Nuclear Bone Scan report... I'm calling back today though. Again Thank you all and I'll let you know when I know what this is. GOD Bless,",

I just don't understand why they didn't see it or get it but IF I call today and they say it's NOT there I'm going to tell them to have someone WALK across the courtyard and get it because their fax isn't working.

The \"Wait and See\" appointment they wanted me to schedule. Lucy, I'm so sorry that you too have had to go through so much before getting answers yourself. I've found that more often than I had thought that is just the case.... If something isn't as \"cut and dry\" as the doctors would want or as the text books say.. they don't want to admit \"not knowing\" and either do \"wait and see\" or think \"it's all in your head\". I KNOW this is NOT in my head and I feel the pain that reminds me. I'm not giving up (even though I sometimes feel that way). My Daddy does have Prostate Cancer and it's neither slow or fast growing but right in the middle. They believe that it's just in the prostate right now and he'll have surgery Aug 25Th. (we have to be there at 5:30, surgery is at 7:00/30) he'll be in for 1 night if all goes well (Praying it does). By removing the prostate/cancer he'll be able to tell us all more. We just got back from RV'ing which was a GREAT relaxer/ stress relief. My mother is pushing me even more now to get \"Answers\" to my medical mystery..... I'm sure she is scared because all she has is me if anything were to happen to my Daddy.  My thoughts and Prayers are with all of you daily.",

I'm not sure what is going on but I've stopped doing the things that cause pain (duh). I have looked up some things on masses/lumps not showing up on ultra sound and find (as awful as it is) it does happen. I am going to ask for that PET/CT scan that you talked about Gg08.

There doesn't have to be a history of BC to have BC, there is just a greater risk of getting it with a history. There are MANY WONDERFUL PEOPLE on here that will help you out as much as they can and give you support.  Praying for your daughter in-law & the family.",

I want to also say as I was told many times \"YOU HAVE TO BE YOUR OWN BEST ADVOCATE\"  although I've found that some just think you're being \"emotional\" and dismiss you..... That by no means isn't to say you should stand alone cause having a Patient Advocate is very good. I understand your emotional frustration and am right there with you. Have that cry and have that shouting into the pillow and when you are done.... Get back on that phone and FIND someone else, if that person doesn't listen find someone else. Talking to that Patient Advocate will help a bunch. Praying for you to get answers and peace.",

I was told \"We believe this is IBC and it must be ruled out, you need a Biopsy\" and was sent the very next day to the surgeon but when I got that He didn't want to do the biopsy because it wasn't a classic case... I was sent on. Truth be told I am still trying to figure out what is going on. I think it's great though they are getting you in and Pray that it's B9. It's better safe than sorry.

You worry because you are human and have had family members with Breast cancer anyone would. It's a great thing that they are moving so quickly to limit your anxiety, waiting and just in case it were cancer they can get treatment started quickly without delay. Thoughts and Prayers are with you and your family. These ladies on here are wonderful lots of support and kind words.",
