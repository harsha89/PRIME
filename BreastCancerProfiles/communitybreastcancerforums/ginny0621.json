I am very active still Drive, cut my grass with riding tractor, run errands, attend church, etc. started treatment 5 months ago of IBRANCE + Letrozole. Did very well on meds with tumors shrinking and not in lymph nodes. WBC does get low but only had to halt ibrance for one extra week 2 months ago. This last month has been worst. I feel weak, can\u2019t taste much of anything or it gags me. No appetite lost 6 lbs since 12/21. Thinning hair, headache, feel disoriented, can\u2019t concentrate, get out of breath going up steps. Couldn\u2019t drive like this going to dr today. Has anyone else had symptoms get worse the longer you took? Has it built up. I am 87 and don\u2019t want to live my remaining years this miserable Log in to post a reply",
