Walking so soon out...love it!  I have not even been given the okay to drive yet...but I can not wait. I heard lots of protein intake for our recovery?  I was told I would not gain weight sitting round, but I have packed on five pounds in the last ten days.  Anyone else?   Keep positive, we will endure!  ",

Dede~Hugs. In fact hugs to everyone.  It is crazy to believe that we are all going thru this.  My first dx was nine years ago (2004, Not_Me), and I found these boards at that time.  I spent hours every night, for a few years, being here.  Thought about C every day of my life until a few years ago.   Life goes on and it is beautiful.  Since then, I have made life long C friends, been on many vacas, hiked mountains, ran some road races, became a grandmother, and just downright enjoyed myself.  Hang in there.   I am started exercises (the ones they give you) today.  Yes!   ",
