My story is a bit different as I was diagnosed in April 2010 with bile duct cancer because I had extensive liver mets and no evidence of any disease anywhere else in my body. So I started on a regimen of Gemcitabine/Cisplatin (3 weeks on/1 week off). My liver was so enlarged and my abdomen so bloated. Within a month I definitely felt better but still had this large protuding liver. Fast forward to October 2010 and my mammo/breast biopsy confirmed that I have breast cancer and my previous diagnosis was wrong because they never were able to see the cancer in my breast. So my diagnosis changed to breast cancer as my primary with liver and bone mets. Now I'm on Herceptin and Xeloda and feel fantastic. My liver isn't protuding from my abdomen anymore, my liver enzymes are much improved.  I just had a PET scan and everything is stable at the moment. My liver tumors and ascites have decreased.",

I know there are people who have it much worse than I. I do let myself grieve for my old life and for the life ahead that I use to plan. I can't plan anymore anything for the future, I do get stuck and only think about the next few weeks or months. There are moments where I think I feel normal and am so grateful to have those. But then reality sinks in and I'm in bed by 7pm because I'm sick or too tired to go on. Those are times where I have to focus on what I was able to do with my husband and children. I tend to not get emotional thinking of myself and my future, only when I think of my children and when they will lose their mother. Then I try to think about what I'm suppose to teach them about life and try to focus on that. Not sure where this quote is from but it goes like this: \"Life is not about what happens to you, its about how you chose to live despite it.\" Another coping mechanism that I realize that I have is that I don't make breast cancer the center of my life. I realized this after I overheard another woman at treatment this week complain about a friend who didn't show up for lunch on her good day and how her disease was the center of her life. Maybe I'm trying to ignore the disease, but I don't want anyone to treat me differently because of it. I decide what I can or can't do.",

Decadron can definitely cause mood changes. I am on day 5 in 14 WBR. I can tell you that I hate decadron, it makes me so wired, dry mouth, exhausted, unable to sleep, and so emotional. It's been a little over 1 week since I found out I have brain mets and being on decadron does not help. I feel so depressed and cry at every little thing. Though there's a lot to cry about I'm just not coping with all these side effects well. I count the minutes to the end of the day when I can't get any sleep, Ambien only works for a few hours so even that doesn't help out with the side effects. As for food, I think I've lost some sense of taste as I'll look at food and want to eat it but it just doesn't taste good. I've lost 3 pounds this past week and thats with donuts and pizza and Christmas candy/cookies all over the place. ",

If I eat a sparce diet for the day I am fine, but I;m hungry so I eat like I use to then get into trouble with the ab pains. I take sennakot, oxycontin, prilosec, docusate, and lorazepam to help control the symptoms. Does anyone have anything similar? Solutions?

But for me, my spleen is enlarged and my doc thinks my platelets are stuck in there and I'll need to have that removed. I won't know for at least a week before I get the bone marrow results back.  I had several platelet transfusions with no lasting effect. I also had a weeks worth of daily injections of Neumega (a platelet growth factor), unfortunately the drug does not work very well and it did nothing to boost my platelets. The shots were awful, I felt like I had the worst flu everyday about 2 hours after each injection.  I unfortunately haven't been able to get full dose chemo for months, so we really need to get my platelet problem figured out soon.  I wish you all the best and hope you recover soon!",

I just finished a round of steroids for my taxotere and that really screws everything up -- I take ambien for sleep, oxycodone for pain, and the antinauseas medications. But then today I feel really good. I'm going to try negotiating with my doc on these meds.Sometimes people are just too sensitive and the doses can be adjusted. Maybe if you spoke to your doctor he can prescribe an antidepressant. I read somewhere that survival was improved in patients who had a more optimistic outlook. Personally I hate taking medications, but with cancer and all the other drugs I wouldn't be surprised that there was depression lurking in there and there is something that can be done for that.  Good luck!",
