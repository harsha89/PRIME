I am healing really well and a star patient! Lol. She took one drain out so I have 2 more to go.  Go back next week and she may even fill me.  Then saw the breast surgeon. She said surgery went fantastic. My pathology says margins are clear, lymph nodes negative and size smaller than they originally thought of 2.75cm ...it was 1.7cm so I am stage 1 not 2!!!!... So nice to hear some good news for once!!!",

I am 1 month 2 days out from DMX with tissue expanders and actually feel really good. I have been for two weekly fills my third this Wednesday. Once I started my fills I actually started feeling a lot less tightness! My PS filled me with 300ccs each during surgery. My first fill I got 30ccs and my second 45ccs. She said as long as I am comfortable she will keep increasing slightly. So I am almost at 400ccs each side but I think I am probably only a smal B! Lol. I was a small D before so still have a ways to go but getting there! Today is a rough day for me as I am heading to my first MO appt to see what treatment she says. I am just so angry that my surgery found no nodes and all clear margins but since I am trip neg I have to do chemo :-(. I am getting very anxious about this but I know I have been thru a lot so far and will pull thru this also. Hope everyone is feeling good today and recovering nicely!",

My mom moved in the day of my surgery and is staying for a couple weeks so they love that!! My son seemed to be a little strange when I came home and did not understand why I could not lay down in bed with him or he could not hug me hard. But he is doing ok with it now. My older daughter has seemed fine since I came home. And I was worried because this week she is taking state testing but her teachers say she is in good spirits and seems to be handling it well! She even has been helping more around the house for me. So I would not worry. Kids are so much more resilient and caring and compassionate than we realize!!",

Sorry took me so long to get back on here after my surgery on the 2nd but I have had a lot of visitors and been trying to do any normal activities I can! I had surgery Wednesday the 2nd and got out at 6pm. Woke up from Anestestia at about 7:30 and was transferred to a room. My surgeon came to see me the next morning thursday at 8am and discharged me! I was home by 11 am before my kids came home from school! I was also one to work my nerves up so bad before surgery being someone who never had been sick or in the hospital except for the birth of my kids but not c sections. I never even had a tooth pulled or filled so no anesthesia! It was not nearly as bad as I was making myself think. I had to be at the hospital 7am for 12:30 surgery. The BS gave me the injection for the radioactive dye for the lymph nodes. She said that would be painful but it really was not that bad. I then got marked by the PS and went in to the OR. The anesthesiologist put the IV in the nurse asked me how old my kids were and then I remember being woken up in recovery! The first night was rough but I got thru. They put some gauze over the steri strips and a surgical bra over which was very tight. My BS came the next morning and took all the gauze off and the bra. All I had left was the steri strips. She said that was fine. I have 3 drains on on the left and 2 on the right where the BC was. They took 3nodes and the BS said the prelim tests of them came back negative. Just hoping I get the same good news at my post op Thursday! I am home resting but you would be surprised how much you can do. My mom has moved in to help with the kids and housework and of course drive me or the kids around but my BS and PS are big on keeping up your normal activities. I do little things like make lunch and straighten up but it is slow going. But every day gets a little better. The pain meds work great and I take them as often as I can to stay on top of it. It is hard sleeping because getting in and out of bed us tough but I prop myself up and my husband pushes my back to help me out of bed. I actually went to my daughters softball game today! My friends could not believe how good I looked! So it is doable and not as scary as you are imagining. The TE do hurt in that they are very right but bearable. The drains are not bad. I got a Velcro belt with pockets that they go in under my clothes. When I shower I put them thru a string around my neck so I don't get the belt wet. I showered Friday two days after surgery with just the steri strips on my incisions. The shower felt great and made me feel better. So everyone that is waiting for surgery day don't drive yourself crazy with anxiety. It is not as bad as you can anticipate. You will get thru it! Now I am making myself crazy over my chemo that will start after I recover. I hope I can get some words if encouragement from you ladies that have been thru that part already! Good luck everyone! I will be thinking of all of you and your upcoming surgeries!",

You are able to raise your arms until your elbows are even with your shoulders. As long as you keep them moving and do your arm exercises you will be amazed what you can do. Certain things you will need help with like maybe getting dressed but even that today I was able to do totally on my own! Each day does get better and now that I am 5 days post op I can definitely see how much more independent I am getting each day. The anticipation is definitely harder than the actual surgery and recovery. Good luck to you and all of the upcoming may surgeries!",

I left surgery with three drains and one came out last week. Hoping to get the rest out Thursday! As far as clothes too I bought a couple of stretchy tank tops that I could actually step into for the first couple days post op and some short sleeve open front cardigan type tops that have all that material in the front! Lol don't know what they r called!! Anyway hope that answered your questions and if u have anymore I'd be happy to answer them. My surgery went great and recovery is not what I think it will be! I was discharged from the hospital 12 hrs after BMX with TE surgery and never was just in bed at home recovering. I was up with my family although tired and sore but not laid up in bed! I went to my daughters softball game 3 days post op! So don't plan on being in bed for days!! The best thing for you is to get up and do normal activities as much as you can.

But my question is my hair is coming back white and fuzzy!! I am 36 and had beautiful thick black hair with some gray but nowhere near what is coming in now! I am horrified that this is what my hair will look like! I have heard that at first for some it comes in fuzzy and white but does change? Is this true?? I am really worried. I know at least it's coming back but it makes me look so much older than I am :-(. Just another crappy SE! Thanks for listening! Melissa",

It has been so crazy with the holidays and tomorrow is my sons 7th birthday! I am ready for a vacation! Lol! Hope everyone is doing well. Been trying to catch up on the posts :-). My best Xmas gift was that I had enough lashes back on Xmas eve that I could actually use mascara! My eyebrows are also almost back although still a little more sparse than normal. I am still a little freaked out about the whitish fuzzy hair though....hoping that changes soon though. Wishing everyone a happy 2013... Much health and happiness to us all! We deserve it! Melissa",

It's really hard to see it falling out. Losing my hair was harder for me then my breasts. But once u get passed it falling out it gets easier. U get used to it in a way. I was fortunate to have a friend in town who works for a place called hair solutions. I got a real hair unit that she matched to my hair highlights and all. It stays on my head for a month at a time without me having to take it off! during treatment when i was bald it was on with glue then tape once my hair started coming in. Now this week she will put it in with clips attached to my hair. It was expensive but well worth it. I vould not deal with seeing myself bald every day snd to this day almost 1 yr out from dx my kids still have no idea...But focus on the end and it will be here before u know it! I",

First of all so sorry you are dealing with this especially at the holidays but know that you have come to the right place. These boards will help you get thru this journey whatever it may bring you With that said this is by far the hardest part. The waiting and not knowing what's to come. The endless tests and dr visits. Let me give you my story so you have something to go by.... I found my lump last year just about this time right around the holidays. I had a mammo scheduled already as my gyno wanted a baseline when I was 35. So I had made the appointment months earlier but with no reason to... Nothing was there when gyno wrote script. Anyway. Mammo was jan 20th. Went in knowing they would find something but really hoping it was nothing. Got called back for diagnostic (more detailed) mammo on jan 27. Went and was told if they found anything they would do ultrasound and biopsy right there. Well they found something but when I was waiting for biopsy was told my gyno did not allow that til I saw a breast surgeon. Of course I freaked out and cried hysterically and was livid but realize now she was doing what was best for me. Anyway went home and was given names of breast surgeons to see. Called and was not able to get appt til feb 13. Went and was given a script for biopsy although after feeling the lump she said it really felt like a cyst. Go for ultrasound guided core biopsy feb 23. Ultrasound tech during biopsy said this looks like fibroids. I don't think it's anything. Got a call feb 27 from surgeon that she needed to see me the next day. Needless to say I went with my mom and was told I had breadt cancer. 36 years old with two kids ages 6 and 9. In total shock. So now my surgeon sent me for an breast MRI to see if it had spread anywhere else in the breadt and then an axillary node biopsy of lymph nodes under my arm on the cancer side to see if it had spread. Both thank god came back clear. So i coukd get lumpectomy and not need chemo!....but then Pathology for biopsy of tumor then came back showing I was triple negative with 2.7cm size tumor. So there are no other options to kill this other than chemo... Damn!! Now I decide on a double mastectomy with tissue expanders. Surgery is scheduled for may 2. But before then my surgeon want a cat scan and bone scan to make sure still no more spreading. Went for the scans and more waiting for results but again they came back clear. So had surgery all went well. Tumor was actually smaller at 1.7cm than they thought. And they took out 3 lymph nodes and again they were clear. I recovered great from surgery. My mom moved in for three weeks to get the kids back and forth to school but I was able to get out to my daughters softball game 2 days after surgery! I was not letting this damn thing run my life! My mom moved out when my drains were out andI got clearance to drive after 2 1/2 weeks. I started chemo June 28... Asked my mo if I could wait til my kids were out of school she agreed. I did dose dense adriamyacin and cytoxin every two weeks for 4 doses then 12 weekly taxol. I finished nov 7! I will tell I that just like every other step the anxiety before chemo was worse. I got thru fine with minimal side effects. The meds they have now help tremendously. I was able to take care of my kids all summer go to the beach the pool and felt fine mist of the time. Now I am just finishing up on my fills with my plastic surgeon and my implant exchange surgery is in march. I didn't need rads cause my tumor was small and not in my lymph nodes so for now I have a little break! I just had my 6mo followup with my breadt surgeon and she said I look great see u in 6mo. So there is light at the end of the tunnel. It will get better once u have a plan. And u will get thru it. You have to. I had to for my kids. There was a spam of 2 1/2 months from diagnosis to surgery and I was fresking out it was spreading but it wasn't... U have time to make decisions. My kids never still to this day don't know what happened this year... I felt they were too young to know. For my sugary they knew I had surgery but not for what and they loved that grandma moved in! They never even knew I was going they chemo. During treatments they were at play dates or school. I felt ok and my husband picked up the slack when I needed. But I have a great wig that is actually on for weeks at a time with tape and my kids never knew! Most people don't it looks so great. I did lose my eyebrows and eyelashes late in treatment and used extra eyeliner and drew in my eyebrows but anyone I met said it looked really good. But I have to say the eyebrows were the hardest part. But now 7 weeks after chemo my hair is 1 1/2 in long. My eyebrows are halfway back and my eyelashes are short but coming back enough for mascara to make them look even longer! So yes it is hard and a journey, a bump in the road, but it is doable and u will be ok and out in the other side before you know it. So try to relax. Easier said than done but try. Get some Xanax if needed. It helped me greatly even during treatment days. Stay here and ask questions all the time if needed. These women will help you get thru what will probably be the hardest year of your life. Please feel free to ask away and pm me if you have any other questions. Tru to enjoy the holidays and take everything one day at a time :-) Melissa",
