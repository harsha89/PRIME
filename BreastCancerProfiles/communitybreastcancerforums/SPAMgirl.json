The CEO of the company wrote a policy letter stating that anyone with a terminal disease has the right to work as long as they can complete their duties. We have 54 weeks of short-term disability with 90% pay. I was able to retire with a pension at 39 since I had worked there for over 15 years. My DH will receive 75% of my pension once I'm deceased. The HR department did/is doing absolutely everything they can to take care of me. The most amazing part is that they re-hired my DH. He had been looking for a job to no avail. The director of his department wanted to make sure my kids were okay so they hired him. He has worked for Hormel before and had all of the qualifications needed for the job. Hormel has been fantastic, but my immediate boss did push me out the door. He knows that I'm a believer in following all of the rules and he directed me to stop being...less of an employee than I was. He knew that would push me out the door. I think he was tired of hearing about how I was going to die. He even went so far as to tell me that I should just drink more water instead of getting fluids. I had even repeatedly told him how much I needed to work for my mental well-being. He has always come across as being nice, but he's really slimey behind closed doors. Since Hormel has been so awesome to me, eat SPAM!!!",

I am opening to hearing more of those tricks from caregivers. I love my Ritilan and I hope I never have to swallow a pill in marshmallow, but I'm glad to know it works. I suppose I'm more willing to allow caregivers to post here if they are with the IV person the entire way. But they shouldn't post about their own fears, etc. that needs to go to the caregiver forum. I do find it amazing how many people read this column who are not IV! I don't understand, there is no way in the world I would have let this thought enter my life. Since they have no understanding and they aren't at the onc appointment listening to the issues and treatments of IV, I don't think they should be posting here.

Probably a few weeks to a month after I started it, my 8-year DS has become a little bully. (Which is not a good thing since he is half the size of his classmates.). He's become mean to his older sister and become a habitual liar. His school principal just called me because of his poor behavior. A classmate's mother actually called because her son was being bullied by mine. I've been trying to ask him what is bothering him, but he hasn't cracked. Has anyone else run into this issue when chemos change. Or does every kid go through this stage around 8. I think I'm too lax sometimes because I blame my cancer on ruining his childhood.

He's already lying so much, I can't set a bad example and do it myself. I think the unknown is a lot more scary than the known.

My main liver tumor went from 2.1 cm to 1.4 cm, but I had a crop of new tumors. I wonder if they had remembered to give me the Lupron, if I would have lost my Halaven. I can't believe they forgot to give it to me. They switched computer programs in August, so it would never had flagged to give it to me again. I was the one who had to catch it. Just like I had to catch my next Xgeva shot.",

I did it to help keep my mind busy and I needed to stop procrastinating organizing the financials. When I was diagnosised stage IV, my onc explained that treating the human body was an art because our bodies are continually changing. I'm sure every year, I'll be grateful that my onc has succeeded with treatments and more drugs are being approved all the time.",

They promised me that radiation would help, but the tumor outgrew the area being radiated. Then I became so constipated from the all of the opiates, that I ended up in the hospital for 2 days to get cleared out. Did I mention that I love my worry-free pain pump. I'm currently going in every couple months to dial in the dosage, but soon I'll be able to space them out to 3-6 months. They did give my a \"push\" button so I can get an exta hit every 4 hours as needed. Right now, I think about pain medicine less than once per week. Good luck with whatever you choose.

I was bad and didn't have my next checkup for 1.5 years. By then, it was 2+ cm and I was stage iii. Then, exactly 1 year after my last chemotherapy, they found the liver and bone mets. I did watch them do the ultrasound, and the tech could tell it was cancer by the way it looked. Then the radiologist explained how you could see the difference between the different kinds of lumps. From her explanation, I knew I had cancer before the biopsy came back. I think my mammogram just indicated that I should get the ultrasound. I have a lot of faith and confidence in the ultrasound. Make sure you ask a lot of questions about the color and shape of the lump and what it means.",

I spend much of my outdoor time watching my kids play soccer.  If I'm inside, I like to dabble on my iPad. 3) What is the main thing that makes you unique? I have a strong personality that likes to plan.  Typically, I'll plan out a trip the most efficient way possible so that everybody can get what they want at the lowest cost and in the least amount of time.  Some of my friends call it scheming, I call it planning:) 4) What is your favorite memory - as a child and as an adult? I loved taking trips to see my Grandmother ad a child.  She lived 2 days away so I only got to see her every other year. As an adult, a groups of friends and I went to San Fransico and had the craziest time ever.  We had a guy walk off the sidewalk and spit on our windshield, took a taxi to dinner and the driver kept trying to convince me I should go the S&M festival and on the flight home, they pulled our airplane away from the building because of a potential bomb (this was pre 9-11.)  They didn't let us get off the plane, just moved the plane away from the terminal.  That was just a few highlights of the many crazy things that happened.  I certainly wasn't in Kansas anymore. 5) You have said that you love your job.  What do you do and what is the best part? I'm an Industrial Engineer and I love trying to lower the costs of our products while trying to make the jobs easier for our employees.  That probably goes with my love for planning.  Bonus question: If you have 30 minutes have unexpected free time (and you are feeling well) what do you do with the time? With any free time I have, I'm reading BCO.  i think it drives my Husband crazy because he is trying to forget that I'm going to die. Bonus bonus question: Why SPAMgirl? I work for Hormel Foods, the company that makes SPAM!  It pays my salary, so I'm very thankful.  In case anybody was wondering, SPAM is make out of ham meat and the meat from pork chops.  While it has very good, quaily, lean meat in it, it does contain a lot of salt and starch.   Hormel has been an exceptional company to work for during this mess.  The CEO even has made a clear policy that if a terminal employee is able to show up to work and do something productive, they will keep their job. One of our Vice-Presidents called my plant after he retired just to see how I was doing.  My husband was having a hard time finding a job since he had taken time off to take care of me.  They asked him to interview with them and gave him a job.  (He had worked for them before, that's how we met.)  They truely care about their employees.",

If they are, your doc, might send you to an orthopedic surgeon to strengthen that bone with metal plate. Lots of things can happen and you have every right in the world to freak.

Also be aware that if the TMs work for you, you will generally see a huge spike after you start a new chemo. It's called a tumor flare because your body has not had time to flush out the dead cells.

I had about 2 weeks to live when they switched my chemo. Within the first week of the new chemo, I had tremendous regression. I had regression every cycle for 9 months before I had a tiny progression and switched chemos. There is tremendous hope that your next chemo will be a magic bullet and blow those little bastards to the sky. I found a book at Barnes & Noble called, \"All About Me.\" It's a journal with set questions for you to answer. Where did you grow up, who was your best friend, what did you guys do together, what was your first job, etc. Once I could get past the tears everytime I opened the book, I started to fill it out. I like that the kids will have a chance to read about my life even after I'm gone. I also got a book about my relationship with their father where it asked questions about where we met, what we did on our first date. How did we decide to get married, etc. since I've been feeling better, I've been bad on filling out those books.",

Depending on the person, I can see using either one. Second, I was trying to think of the best way to picket the Komen walk. Can we walk the opposite way around the track? Maybe with shirts that have pink ribbon with the slash through it like a stop sign and at the bottom it will say, \"Cancer Still Kills\"",

The tumor outgrew the radiation, so it didn't stop the pain. I was in horrible pain, and I was sent to a neurosurgeon. He installed an interrathecal pain pump. It is filled with morphine and dripped directly into my spinal column like an epidural. Since it goes directly into my spine, I don't need as strong of a dose as the narcotics. Depending on my pain, they can increase the amount of morphine drip whenever I need it. I also have a push button to give me an extra dose for four hours. Prior to the pump, I was immobilized and severally constipated. Now, pain killers rarely cross my mind, my bowels are in good shape, and I'm not loopy from the narcotics. My only downside is the scar. He certainly was not a plastic surgeon!!! Good luck with whatever you decide.",

The answer is fluids, fluids, fluids. I never threw up, but I took a lot of drugs too. I take that back, I threw up once, but I think someone else in the house was sick. I did ask my DH why he didn't hold my hair back while I was throwing up:)",
