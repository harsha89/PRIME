I went to see the BS today and am feeling a littel better (though mostly from the circle of loving women on this site!).  I do have a question for everyone and it is this. The surgeon said he does not use drains. I am having a bilateral on this Wednesday. I have taken care of lots of pts. who have had reductions or mastectomies and I have never seen one that didn't have drains. The surgeon tells me that he often has pts that return 1-2 times a week to have fluid drained from the upper chest. I live an hour away from the town he is in and i do not like this idea. He is pretty firm that he will not use drains. (He also will not tell me anything about my ER, PR or HER2 status until after my surgery -- he is a bit militaristic in his manner -- we get along. He just is very paternal). Have any of you seen or experienced not having drains for a bilateral mastectomy? What was the outcome?  I am partly of a mind to call him and say drains or no surgery...  Blessings, Sara",

My Biggest question is what kind of sensitivity will i have on my chest when my incisions are healed. Will I be able to feel touch to my chest? Is there anywhere on this site where intimacy is discussed? I have other questions, too. I am planning not to do recontruction. Should I have a plastic surgeon as part of my surgery team in 4 days? Aghh . I need lots of information/questions answered. I do have an appt.that I requested  /c the surgeon Monday. I don't know any results other than IDC, and 1 cm. What *must* I know before surgery? Thank you all soooo much. I am (oddly enough) a prn Breast Bx RN at a Breast Dx Center. I also work for the state Health Dept as a Wellness Nurse. I worked for a couple years as a pediatric chemo nurse, and also on GYN surgery floor, school clinic, free clinic, kids camp, also direct entry midwife before nursing school. ",

I decided to cancel the surgery and change surgeons, the day before I was to have surgery. I also found out that my state's (Alabama) breast cancer detection program would allow me to pick the surgeon & also to get a 2nd opinion. I was trying to be grateful and compliant and had not asked about this. As soon as I made the decision to cancel and switch, I felt hugely relieved. And have received lots of affirmation for doing so! OK, my new surgeon is recommending (standard of care) for me to have a sentinel node bx on my other breast, because he points out that a SNB can't be done after the breast is removed. I had no indication of tumors, calcs or anything else on the other breast, just on my right breast.  So I would love to hear from folks who have had a SNBx on the non-affected side.  As an aside, he commented that there was a possibility that he would have to do a node dissection instead of a SNB on the affected side because the bx (the other surgeon did) I had 3 weeks ago may have disrupted the lymph node chain. Anyone had this happen?  Thanks for all the love and support on this forum! Blessings, Sara ",
