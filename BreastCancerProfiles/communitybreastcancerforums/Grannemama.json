Ultrasound and mammogram September 2016. Biopsy 10/3/16 of lump and lymph node. Both positive. Invasive ductile and lobular carcinoma. Grade 2. ER+ 95% and PR+ 70%. HER2 1+ so negative. Ki-67 15-20%. I'm 39 mother of 2 boys 9 and 6. My mother had breast cancer at 57 so we're doing a genetic test to see. My mother didn't have a test done. She's 5 years cancer free this year. Same diagnosis. Same breast! I quit smoking this week. I'm also scheduled for a breast MRI. I have small breasts so talk so far has been about mastectomy. But we're considering neoadjuvent chemo before surgery, for lymph nodes. Really like the MO, like the BS, but everyone is putting in their 2 cents about where to go Any thoughts would be appreciated. So much to think about. Not afraid of surgery or treatment, afraid of being sick and tired. Love to exercise, sad about lifestyle changes or not being able to care for my boys. Dx 10/5/2016, ILC/IDC, Right, 2cm, Stage IIB, Grade 2, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Cut my hair short last week, but hair started falling out in clumps today in the shower. I'm not dealing with that mess, so I had my husband shave it. It feels so much better. What I experienced this week with regard to side effects was not acceptable. I will be doing all I can to avoid how I felt on Thursday, 2 days after treatment. I just can't tell if it's the chemo, the withdrawal from the steroid, or the Neulasta, but I had an incredible headache and couldn't get out of bed just slept on and off. Nausea too of course. Can anyone tell me if they are getting headaches after the Neulasta and anything to help? And then Friday felt like a new lease on life! Like in the movies when a person gets punched, then gets up swinging at everything? That was me! Will keep checking in on everyone",

I bought them at Target. They are acupressure wristbands that so far are really helping, I didn't feel the nausea breakthrough at all today. I'm still taking meds, to be sure. I wanted to share with everyone right away. Best to everyone this week!!!",

      "Content": "Dec 9, 2016 12:24PM - edited Dec 9, 2016 12:40PM by Grannemama Hi ladies! Haven't checked in for a while. Had third AC last week and then came down with a cold this week. I know, my fears came true. Stuffy nose and scratchy throat. Temp only at 99.0.Seems I'm constantly hand washing and sanitizing, but...I'm guessing I just need to take it slower. Can't take vitamin C, so just spending the entire day in bed and drank 3+ liters of liquids. I love to go to the supermarket but now I'm considering delivery. And a mask when I attend the kids holiday concert at school. Cant be too careful now I feel. Amw5-we have the same regimen AC x4 then Tx4 on Tuesdays!! I'm just at #4 this week if WBC are ok after this cold. Nfullbloom- I'm just one day ahead of you. Can you believe it? Who thought we'd ever be excited about our last AC? What a club! BG46TN- hope you're feeling better Ladies, don't ever be afraid to ask for help, try not to overdo it, practice self care and self love Anyone on AC feeling tenderness in their toes? I am. Wasn't expecting it yet, not until Taxol",

I am also in the pattern Dianarose anticipate feeling lousy tomorrow after Neulasta today. But my doctor decreased my steroid so the withdrawal has been much much better. Nfullbloom--Since I started using acupressure Seabands I'm using less nausea meds. They were $8 at Target. They are made for motion sickness, and work on all kinds of nausea. I eat oatmeal every morning, I snack on bran flakes in the afternoon. And have a few handfuls of sunflower seeds. But that's how I normally eat--high fiber. What I really want is some pho! Nanpop-- sorry to hear about the tachycardia. My mother also had breast cancer, was treated with AC&T, and developed supra ventricular tachycardia. 180 bpm in the ER. She likely had an underlying condition before chemo now takes meds beta blockers. She had difficulty getting a diagnosis. I hope it's just the steroids and temporary. I heard vagus maneuvers help Oh why did I get a mini period this week? Like what? Huh? Is anyone experiencing this: swollen eyelids? I look like I've been crying a lot, which I haven't. Or is it from the cold I had Take good care of yourselves ladies!",

I had really wanted to check in and respond sooner. There were many interesting stories. Nanpop, Marie, Leslie, Becky, Pamela, javamama.... At any rate I started my first Taxol on Thursday. I didn't get it on Tuesday because I wanted them to test me for a UTI because I have these strange sensations in my back. Well it was negative. Found out my hemoglobin was low, so now I have to take an iron supplement. I noticed the difference the next day. No longer so tired and short of breath. I'm having trouble with menstruation. Spotty period day 20. Body aches with Taxol to be sure by day 3. Took Tylenol as directed. Today, day 4, I felt better so I went for a short hike with family. Felt achy towards the end so came home and went to bed. Took temp and it was 100.2. Now waiting, watching, hoping I didn't over do it. I'm still interested in the Facebook group BG46TN. Good health",

AC and T. 4 treatments of each every 2 weeks. 16 weeks total and all before surgery just like you! Hope you are hanging tough today. Felt nausea this morning, took some medicine and went back to bed. Was good by noon. The worst part of starting this week was menstruating too. Thus, feel achy, sweats and can't sort the side effects from the period. Worried about all the side effects and how to report to the doctor. For instance, I had chills and sweats last night, but no fever.",
