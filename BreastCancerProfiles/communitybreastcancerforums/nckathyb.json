    "Content": "Jul 9, 2011 03:13AM - edited Jul 9, 2011 03:22AM by nckathyb I was very glad SAVI was offered to me when I discovered later the after affects of whole breast radiation.  I was the first one at my breast care facility to go through it and so I had the SAVI people guiding the doctor's every move.  The device was uncomfortable at times, but I slept well, and continued to work.  I sill had to wait to use the shower until the insertion site healed over which was inconvenient.  The radiation process was painless.  Being bound up during the day put pressure on the device and it sometimes pushed up against raw tissue, so having everything removed for the treatments felt great.  Now, a year and a half later, all of the scars have faded considerably and I continue to be cancer free.  I am on Tamoxifen for 5 years however, and the side affects that I experience from it are longer and more intense hot flashes than I had before.  I just have to keep a fan nearby, either electric or manual. Hope you are doing well!",
