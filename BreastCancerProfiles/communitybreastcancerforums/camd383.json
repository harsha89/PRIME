I guess my reason for writing is if she's refusing to drain the fluid shes not going to make it to a nursing home or on a plane right?? This has been crazy and confusing..sorry for taking up your time I'm know what I'm feeling is nothing compared to all of you.",

I agree with everything you said except that alcoholism isn't a disease but a choice I feel like it is a disease and the only one choice is to have that first drink or not. I stay away when I feel she is being destructive or hurtful she was banned from the hospital during the birth of my first son because she was drunk, after when she was sober I let her meet him and she fell in love she sends dollar store cards every holiday even when she is living in the woods hes now 6 and has no idea she is a drunk she is his grammie and he loves her, for him I will be there in the end. (This is not saying its the right thing for every situation I have a friend who hasn't spoken to her mom for same reasons in almost 13 years and I think her choice is right for her, and I also know that your choice was right for you or you wouldn't have made it) I am just going to let nature take its course I will let her choose to handle her bad news the way she wants to and hope she ends up back in the hospital and not ending her life before we all get to say goodbye..I can also secretly hope she just needs a weekend bender and will decide to go to the facility and get treatment after but Im not holding my breath. Thank you everyone for offering your advice and sympathy it really eased my stress last night. and camillegal I do know thank you :) ",

My mom Michele Elizabeth Caranci lost her battle Oct 8 2012, from prayer she was able to get in a nursing home and then transfered to a hospice she didn't spend anytime homeless and I was able to spend that last of her days with her I was blessed enough to be by her side when she passed.
