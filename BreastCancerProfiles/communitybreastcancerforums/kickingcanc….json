He had a last minute cancellation and they called me on Friday to see if I was available on Monday-grabbed the chance. In Hospital 3 days and now recovering slowly at home. My oncologist has me on Faslodex injections-doing loading doses now then go to monthly. Don't know what is next-sure would be glad to stop CT scans-had 21 in 3 years plus 3 PETS. Should be glowing in the dark. My surgeon thinks this will buy me some extra time and maybe some new therapy will be approved if and when it returns.",
