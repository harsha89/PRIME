I am guessing many of those are normal, sigh ðŸ˜¤ My only sister was dx at 41 yo. And has since had two reoccurrences one of which she remains on chemo for...bless her heart...she just turned 59. I am in awe at her strength and determination. At 30, I began annual mammograms (47 now). I have family history on both sides, all before the age of 40. I am BRCA- (gratefully). Anyways, so went for my usual Mammo, and of course with dense, microcalifications in both breasts was called back for spot compressions on the left. Immediately had a CNB of the left and was dx with ADH. I had always said, the girls will have to go someday....and the someday is finally approaching. I have chosen to have profilactic bilateral mastectomies. I cannot go through the millions of surgeries, infections, and treatments. I wish I were as strong as others but it is not where I can best focus my efforts. I've already been down the cancer road with my 1st DH and lost. So I truly believe this is the best choice for me. I am grateful to find this community. It comforts me to know I am not alone in my choice, struggles and emotions. For me the next few months will be filled with appointments and trying to figure out what to do for reconstruction. Although I am very comfortable with the girls going, I had never thought about the what next part. Duh? Don't know why I didn't get that far. Prayers and blessings to all of you!!!",

I am sure much like me, you find comfort in knowing we are not alone. This seems to be a very healthy place for us all to be able to share our situations, thoughts, worries and even tears if need be. The strength in these forums is amazing. A place to get strength when one feels depleted. Thank you for sharing you with me I will be thinking only warm, safe, peaceful thoughts & blessings for you. I will be thinking of you Monday as you meet with the plastics peeps. I meet with mine at Moffitt just this past week. I have to say it was very reassuring. He was actually the 1st doc to come right out and say he thought I was making a very wise decision. I think I'm at peace with the thought, just so very scared of the physical surgery. On my way to sleep, but will write more soon. May everyone be safe!!",

You're post gives me comfort and hoping I can follow your journey. I am scheduled for BMX 1/8. Although I had hoped having the surgery scheduled would start to provide some peace - it's become a bit of a panic. thank goodness for those of you sharing your bravery.",
