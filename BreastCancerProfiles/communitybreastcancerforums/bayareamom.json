It was a problem. I had a difficult time getting my blood back to a normal level with such a short time inbetween treatments. I got sick with neutropenic fever twice. So then we decided to space them out to every three weeks. It has been somewhat better but then this last time I got a cold and it got really bad because my defenses were down. There are pros and cons to both schedules. Good luck. Jeanne",

I thought that being bald and wearing different wigs would some how be fun but I don't find it fun at all. I can't wait to get hair back. I'm just a month away of being done with taxol (two more!). Can't wait to leave this behind. Lovely forum!",
