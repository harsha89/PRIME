The tissue beneath the scars, more so on one side, feels thick and extremely tight. The tightness is like a metal band across my chest, sometimes a pinching sensation, quite uncomfortable but not 'painful' . The skin and scar area is still profoundly numb except for this tightness. It intensifies when undressing or in cold air, similar to the sensation of 'goose bumps' but stretched armpit to armpit across my chest. I used to think I needed to do more stretching exercises but that actually makes it worse. The most comfortable thing is heat. My surgeon shruggs his shoulders and suggests it's from the nerves that were cut. I'm 1 year post op and this condition seems to be getting worse.",

Balance and eveness is better and it's easier to get 2 matching prosthesis (or reconstruction) than to match the other breast size and weight. Also, I never wanted to go through mammograms again. For years I'd had a normal negative mammogram but 7 months after the last one I find a 1cm tumor myself. I'd lost faith in their accuracy finding early tumors. MRI is the new way to go. Very difficut decision for sure. Best to you whatever you decide and hang in there.",
