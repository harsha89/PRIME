    "Content": "Ashley26 wrote: Well I am a 26 year old mother of two. My son is 4 and my daughter is 2. I breast fed her until she was 22 months old. She only nursed on both for 15 months and then for 7 months on the left only because that one always seemed to have more milk and she didnt need as much milk as she was eating alot more solids and had a sippy cup by then. So all in all its been over a year since I've nursed her on this (the right side). It feels like my right breast is sore and heavy all the time and hurts to put any kind of pressure on it and in the last week my nipple feels raw and sore even tho it looks normal. Ive been having the sore heavy feeling since november 2012 only in my right breast but have shrugged it off because of my age. Do these sound like brest cancer symptoms? i'm going to make an appointment to see my doctor but would like any input or comments you all have regarding my symptoms. Thanks Log in to post a reply",
