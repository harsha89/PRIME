I got my surgical date set (2 and 1/2 weeks away) and we told our kids this morning. They handled it surprisingly well so far. Our 19 yo son was emotional but asked intuitive questions (stage, how bad is it, etc.) our 12 yo daughter asked technical questions (chemo?, is it genetic/will I get it, will you have nipples). I'm so glad we waited until we had a game plan and had dealt with it emotionally ourselves first. We presented it in a way that was reassuring for them (it was caught early so we are so lucky) and \"what a great celebration to be able to celebrate Christmas and the New Year cancer free\". I'm so thankful for this board and the wisdom of others. My knee-jerk reaction was to want to tell them right away. I'm glad we listened to others and that they shared their experience.",
