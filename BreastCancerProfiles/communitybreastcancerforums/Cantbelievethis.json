As I posted in a previous message, I was freaked out after the path report from my lumpectomy showed the tumor to be 2.7 cm, after all the mammograms and breast exams, and ultrasounds, it still go this big. No lymph node involvement and no LVI, thank goodness. Â I consulted with several doctors who I respect including the doctor who read my mammograms. They all said my breasts are so dense and lumpy that it is very difficult to read imaging. They all recommended a bi-lateral mastectomy. I'm going to do that, even though MRI's may catch it earlier I want the least chance possible of ever going through this again. The oncotype test came back 19, low intermediate, even though it was grade one. I'm going to do the chemo so that I know I've done everything possible to increase my chances for long term survival. Plus, it will likley send me into menopause so I can start an aromitase inhibitor sooner, which was the topic of my previous post. I'm at peace with the decision I guess, though I get hit by moments of WTF is happening, this can't be me we are talking about. I start chemo in early August and mastectomy in December after I heal. MRI pending to make sure nothing else is lurking. Anyway, I'm kind of numb right now so nothing to really ask, but I know I will have questions so I thought I would give the update. Oh, one question, I want to stay as active as possible, is it really possible to jog or run while on chemo? I usually run about 2 miles every morning, not a lot but it makes a difference. I actually want to make it my plan to increase that when this is over. Is it still realistic to run? What did you use as headwear, I just can't run around my neighborhood bald, I just can't.

I was doing just great, minimal side effects, jogging every day, etc. I woke up yesterday with a raspy voice and its gone to the point I seem to have laryngitis, can't talk about a whisper, it feels like my vocal cords aren't working. Any one have this symptom and what on earth can I do about it? Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
