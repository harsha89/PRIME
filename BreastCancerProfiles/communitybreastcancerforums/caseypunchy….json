Just as when I see my scars on my chest I see them as a symbol of my victory over this enemy. Embrace each moment, own it and live it in the present! hugs to you caseypunchy",

I had another glass today while preparing lunch and that was quite nice - so my advice is, Listen to your body and don't deny yourself any little pleasure at this time, your body will tell you but if it's ok, however remember that the liver is affected first with chemo so it doesn't need any extra toxins or extra work to do.
