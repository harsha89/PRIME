For right now, she said to leave them alone and give them a chance to dry up.  She seems to think that it can take quite some months before your breast milk dries up after having a baby. ",

I did talk to my doctor about it.  Again, she said it was normal to produce milk after you have a baby for some time and to stop squeezing them.  I am trying to trust that.  Gee, I really hope I should.  I am trying not to let some of these horror stories freak me out.  Nonetheless, thanks.",
