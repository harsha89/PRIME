My PS is very strict, didn't want me walking outside in case I slipped o the ice etc. BUT he did give me permission to go on the stationary bike after two weeks, and the elliptical after 4 weeks. I usually do yoga but I have heard a lot of stories of women ripping some internal stitching and I think it is SO important not to mess things up. I am going to the gym almost everyday and doing either 45 min on the bike or 30 min on the elliptical. I do my stretching exercises at home every day although I have been less good about those. My ROM seems pretty good. I am going on vacation next week, and look forward to swimming in warm water altho the PS said not to do rigorous crawl, just gentle paddling around. We'll see! Maria, I did 4 rounds of TC. It is not a walk in the park, but it is doable and will be over before you know it. Good for you for doing the cold caps. I have a friend who did and she was very pleased. I was too lazy and my treatment center was not encouraging. I am 3 months out form chemo now and still wearing a wig. I am getting hair but it is slow. I would feel over the chemo if it weren't for the hair (and nails are still a bit funky). Feel free to PM me if you have any specific questions. ",

Now that I have buttered you up, may I ask ot become an official member? I have posted occasionally and followed every post. I'll leave it up to your fearless leader. It is interesting what you say about the newbies being afraid and then most people shifting to wanting to get it over with ASAP. I think that I am some where in between. my chemo teaching nurse had led me to believe that my side effects wouldn't be too bad and then I was really slammed the first time. I had every SE in the book and more. I went back to work after a week worrying that I should have been wearing Depends just in case! I now have TC #2 on Wed and am both extremely apprehensive but also eager to be half way through. Sound familiar to anyone? I think that I have been weird about hair too. My onc had said that was the most traumatic part. From my perspective it was creepy but not nearly as bad as the SEs. I got the last remnants buzzed off on Friday and it was a relief as it was coming out so fast. The weird part is that I have yet to look in the mirror. I just go from one head covering to another. Btw- I hate the wig. it itches. Guess I will use it for work and go to scarves for home. I had a weird \"discovery\" too. My tumor was picked up on regular mammogram but was 2.7cm. BS said that it had been there for years, but my old films look \"fine\". Reading all of your stories, it really strikes me how many stealth tumors there are out there. Makes me want to get on my soap box about the importance of regular mammograms. If they had switched to every other year as the study recommended, many of us would be in much deeper but also the need for even more refined imaging techniques. These tumors are tricky. So, best to all of you for a SE free day. Hope that you will take me into your group. With affection and respect. Elizabeth ",

My onc said something helpful this week, which is that we all deserve cadillac care right now, and not to use the same standards in deciding whether to call the doctor that we would use when we are \"regular\" patients. Cancer patients are more vulnerable, and don't need to worry about calling the doctor. Just do it, if you are worried. Lizzy, shouldn't your onc give you some sleep meds? You need your rest. I am getting extra roids because of my weird allergy issues so they gave me some Ambien and it really helps. A word of admiration to the mothers of young children. I love your parenting stories and how well you are handling all those hard conversations and embarassing moments with your kids. I have no idea how you are handling all the SEs and fatigue and still taking care of a young family. My kids are 17 and 21. I don't know how I would have managed if they were younger. of course keeping after my son to do his college applications is a hassle, but I can do it form the couch. For those who were looking for easy family friendly recipes. Martha's Stewart's Everyday Food magazine has a website. If you google Everyday food it comes up, and they have reasonable easy, healthy recipes. My treat for this week. They have decided I am allergic to taxotere, which is then making me allergic to other things(like wig hair). One choice is to start over on AC (no thanks!) or do a slow densitization infusion over six hours, with one on one nursing, I guess to make sure I keep breathing. I think they start out with very dilute solution, give a little, wait a while, then give a slightly more concentrated amount etc. of course this also involves LOTS of steroids.  Apparently they have been doing this for a while at Dana Farber with success. So I go in at 7AM on Friday for basically the whole day.  I get the sense that people are getting more worn down and weary. As my onc always signs off \"Hang in There\" we are getting closer. I send congrats to those who are done, and encouragement to all who are getting closer every day. Elizabeth ",

They were able to continue the infusion after giving me lots of IV steroids and benedryl. I have been breaking out in hives intermitently since the infusion so the allergist thinks the taxotere sent my immune system into overdrive and that another infusion would be \"dangerous\" without the desensitization. It was either that or start over again with other agents. No thanks. I think that many people here talk about being more easily winded. I think an actual allergy would present more dramatically, but it is worth asking the onc about as the allergist says that 10% of people have reactions to taxotere. Seems pretty high. Wherria, did you make it to the marathon. It was a beautiful day. Hope that you did. ",

My message is....don't fear any possible allergic response, because even though mine was dramatic, ultimately it was managable. Ideas about tother things....Lizzie you mentioned a need for good scentless moisturizers. I have been using Kheil's for my face (expensive, but a little goes a long way) and Cetaphil, which is awesome, effective and cheap at CVS. Cetaphil was recommended by the LGFB woman, nad my daughter who has major dry skin issues. I wish everyone a SE free, lovely weekend! Elizabeth ",

My eyelids swelled up so much that I burst capillaries and look as though I have shiners. They started me back on steroids to treat the hives. I am also congested and have bronchospasm, all allergic. I have never had allergies before this treatment. Seems I might have an allergic reaction to the already not beloved wig, or maybe to the \"hat hair\" I just got this weekend (a baseball cap with a fringe of synthetic hair attached).

The whole thing makes me feel sad, but it is about time (I had a lumpectomy and re-excision over the summer, all invasive cancer was removed, but there were patches of DCIS) I wish you all a Happy Holiday, and few SEs so that you can enjoy it! ",

I am a month out from chemo and still have no hair. I am wondering what those of you in my situation did during surgery. The wig seems cumbersome, and as though it will get moved around. A scarf would be hard to tie afterwards. I have a little cap that I wear when I am sleeping, which is comfortable but not too attractive. If anyone has had experience with this, I would really appreciate hearing about it. Many thanks, Susan ",

Getting up and down, especially out of bed is challenging. I am not looking forward to the limitations on movement. I have had 8 weeks between chemo and surgery and have been trying to be as active as possible to regain some strength before being knocked over again. I have gone to Pilates and yoga and am working with a trainer who has had at least some experience with mastectomy patients. My PS says that he worries more about people doing too much too soon after surgery. I guess that we will have to be patient and let people take care of us! Thanks for the welcomes  Elizabeth ",

I had no trouble with the anesthesia, but feel as though a truck is parked on my chest. The expanders make my chest feel very tight, and there is a pinching where the drains go through the skin, but it is bearable, not horrible pain.I get charlie horse like spasms across my chest when I stand up. I am taking the pain meds every four hours as directed and not trying to brave out the pain.  For those of you yet to go, I recommend getting the c-shaped travel pillow for sleeping. It makes a huge difference. Also if I had it to do over again I would start Colace before surgery. The pain meds are very constipating. I bought a camisole and belt to hold drains but my surgeon put me in a tight surgical compression bra to keep the swelling down, so I haven't used the other things that I bought.  EVERYONE said that the anticipation is worse than the actual event and I really think that is true. Even without my breasts, I still feel like me (haven't dared look yet and won't for a while) and I feel relieved that the dangerous cells are gone. It IS a big surgery, physically and emotionally, but scared as you may be, you CAN do it. One last thing...move your clothes to lower shelves as well as things in your bathroom and some glasses, bowls etc in the kitchen. Soon we will all be on the road to healing and leaving this chapter behind us. My thoughts are with all of you who go next. Please PM me if you have any specific questions. Very gentle hugs, Elizabeth ",

That one was clear for invasive CA, but there were patches of DCIS. My docs decided to delay my next surgery until after chemo. I had TC X 4, finished in Nov. and am scheduled for a BMX with TEs on Jan 6.  My PS is very conservative and won't start fills until 3 weeks after drains are removed. I am filled with dread about the surgery, disturbed about the bodily changes etc.,  but also have been on this path for many months and would like to move on. Everything has felt quite dragged out.

I am a week out tomorrow from BMX with TEs, and have been taking walks outside for the past 3 days, which has been nice. My PS warned against doing too much with my arms as the TEs can get displaced. I know a couple of women who opened their incisions or disruption their recon by working out too soon after surgery. Remember the chest wall will be numb from the nerves that are cut, so be very careful. I too, hope to be back at the gym and yoga ASAP, but it probably helps to work with a trainer who has familiarity with BC patients or a physical therapist. Good luck to those of you going tomorrow.

I am trying to rearrange the pillow to lean slightly sideways. Progress is slow, but there is progress. What are your doctors telling you about driving?

One tip that I got from a Dec. woman who PMed me. Bed, Bath & Beyond has small \"travel pillows\". I bought three of them and have them wedged in various places (e.g. behind my back) to keep me in a relatively comfortable position while I am sleeping.  I am three weeks out today, and went to the gym once so far to ride on the stationary bike. I couldn't get off the couch for the rest of the day, but it is start! A question for those of you who are a few weeks out......I am SO tired still. I can do a couple of things during the day e.g. go out to lunch, stop at the market etc. but I am totally wiped out afterwards. How are the rest of you doing with fatigue? I did chemo first, so maybe it that contributes to the exhaustion. I have to go back to work soon, and am worried. To all of you having surgery this week.....it isn't nearly as bad as you are anticipating. You will be on the healing side soon!",
