      "Content": "Feb 24, 2016 01:32PM - edited Feb 24, 2016 01:34PM by TwinklyToes Thank you for your help! I am on the fence about the cannabis thing-I just don't know, but my brother feels very strongly about it (as that's his livliehood) and as soon as my mom found her lump, he put her on his treatment regimen. From that day on, she had 3 months of undergoing medical tests to see if her aggressive cancer had spread (it had-to her lymph system) and in that time she received no treatment from her doctors. By the time she started chemo her lump (which was the size of a small orange) had decreased in size by a third to its original size due my brother's treatment. So she's very on board with the cannabis oil therapy and was very disappointed that her doctor told her to abandon it. Well, the lotion part of it anyway-the pills are still ok for her to take. But the cream really worked well for her. She was pretty upset when she called me today. When she first started my brother's treatment, she told her oncolgist about it and they told her if she wanted to pursue it, then go ahead. They couldn't see any harm, but with the lotion, now it's an issue. :( Thank you for the links-I'll pass along the info to her. She's doing really good, in spite of her \"setback\" today. She's such an inspiration to me.",

One of the doctors asked her today what kind of lotion she's using and she is using a lotion my brother is mixing up for her. He's a licensed cannabis manufacturer and combines the cannabis oil with lotion for her to use and it is working really well-no redness or burning at all. However, the doctor told her not to use an oil based cream during radiation because it can cause the radiation amount to in intensify. Now she's scared because she's been using it for 4 days and is worried about the radiation being too strong and causing damage to her body. She's also disappointed because the cream he gave her was working really well-she didn't put it on today and her skin is red and irritated now. Is it true that oil based cream can cause the radiation effects to be stronger? Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you!! Log in to post a reply",
