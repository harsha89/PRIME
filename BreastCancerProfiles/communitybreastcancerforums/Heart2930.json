I am actually having 30 treatments. 25 regular and 5 boosts. Hi Idesim- The pain was not actually so bad. It was more irritating and uncomfortable than real pain. So I wouldn't worry about it happening.",

I would love to switch back to my regular bras, but the aloe stuff they have me using is pretty goopy and I don't want all my bras to get stained. If it is a special really thin tank top could you please tell me the brand so that I can try to find some?",

I was really concerned with effects to my heart, but we ended up doing breath hold radiation. During the sim they determined how much air volume I can take it and how long I can hold it for. They used 80% of those numbers as a treatment guide. By holding my breath I expand my chest so it gives them more room to miss my heart. I actually can take in enough air that we have gotten my heart almost totally out of the radiation field. Every 5 treatments we will do a series of 6 X-rays to make sure we are still on track and to check for any lung issues. I really didn't have to ask too many questions. My RO and my radiation nurse practitioner gave me so much info that they answered questions I had not even come up with yet. I am currently done with 4, 26 to go. The last 5 will be boosts. It is really not as bad as I thought it would be, eventhough I am starting to burn a little and have some fatigue going on. I actually thought it was going to be much worse. My RO explained to me that skin tone and if you sun burn easily really has no bearing on radiation burns. But even with this info in the back of my mind I expected the worst, and have been pleasantly surprised that my burn is rather minor at this point. I guess I expected this because I am VERY fair skinned. My Dad is a red head, and I have his skin tone so I am kind of pasty white year round. I have never been able to tan and always burn. But so far... not too bad..Good Luck!",

Well I just went online shopping to see if I could get more of the silicon dressings I got today. They only gave me enough to get through Wednesday and I am worried about ruining any of them trying to get them on. They are not super easy to get into place. They have me using Mepilex Lite. When I looked it up online I was just floored. It will cost between $75-110 dollars depending on where I buy them from to get enough for 2 weeks!!! That's only 2 large dressings that I can cut into smaller ones. Think I am just going to hold off on that one and ask for a new bag of dressings next week. Yikes!",

There are people I see everyday at radiation that are way worse off than me. I see a woman who is maybe 30ish who has stage IV lung cancer with mets to her brain. Her lung rads are burning her esophagus so badly she needs numbing meds to even drink water. But when a new area breaks down or an old area breaks down further it is just sometimes hard to keep this in focus. However the end is in sight. I think you and Idesim are done on Wednesday right ?

My skin would most probably have kept breaking down for a week or so after ending treatments anyways, and I was already in enough pain to need more than just advil. Basically I told my RO \"let's load me up on pain killers and finish this\". Corky60- Mepilex is actually pretty decent if you are not allergic to it. I stopped using it for a few days because it would not stay on without a bra, and I actually had a lot more skin breakdown in those few days just because the area was not protected. So I have started wearing a bra and mepilex again, and I am just taking more pain killers to combat the pain the bra is causing on the sores on my side. Can't seem to get mepilex to work on my side since the area moves with my arms. Good Luck!",

The raw spots seem to be healing. Still sore as I move around, but not really raw spots. The one under my arm is actually scabbed over, and the crease is just not as painful as it was. Yipee! There is definitely hope for everyone who has started breaking down, it just seems to take about a week or so to start getting better. Everywhere that was red has started peeling, but that doesn't hurt at all. I have stopped using the aquafor since that seems to make the skin adhesions and only use the aloevesta now, so maybe that helped. Nothing horrible from the tamoxifen, although it does seem to make me a little dizzy and light headed. I sort of feel like I have medicine head from cold medicines, and all of a sudden I have so much energy I am kind of wired today. Wishing everyone peace and healing over the weekend!",

Still have some soreness and a little raw area in the boost area, but much better. Now that the skin is healing I am noticing that I have really painful lumps throughout that breast. Hoping it is just scar tissue. Since I was never able to get clean margins surgically, this has me a little worried. I know there was cancer left behind, which the rads was supposed to kill, but the lumps are concerning. Next mammo and possibly MRI is in October, so I am hoping the pain goes away and I am not stuck worrying about it the whole time. Like we don't have enough to worry about huh! I know you said you are healing Idesim, how about you Sciengal? Still doing ok? CassDugan- it's pretty normal I think. Some of the women on this thread use the Frogg Toggs chilly towel available on Amazon. I just turned the a/c up in the bedroom at night. Now that my skin is finally healing, I started the next part of this journey this week.....trying to find a bra that fits. I had a LOT of tissue removed. Basically I am a D on one side and barely a C on the other. I am trying to avoid having to wear a prosthetic filler though. Sick and tired of my old bras collapsing and looking wrinkly on one side. Also tired of wearing just sports bras. After a lot of frustration and a crying session I finally went to a professional bra fitter today. Success! Not the pretty, lacy pastels I am used to wearing, but doesn't look like my Grandma's bra either so I am satisfied. In case anyone is in the same boat after a lumpy, the brand is Anita and the style number is 5490 & 5493. These are soft stretch microfiber bras with underwire or without. I went down a size to fit the smaller breast, but it still stretched enough so it fit well on the larger breast. It seems like such a small thing, but getting a bra that actually fits seems to help me mentally get one step back to normal or start achieving a new normal anyways,",

It kept everything just lubed enough. Now this was against my nurses advice.

The found grade 2 & 3 DCIS, and unfortunately I was left with a dirty margin that we can't get clean so off to radiation I go unless the plan changes. Right after they found the DCIS, I also found a lump in my upper thigh. My PCP thought it was an enlarged lymph node or maybe an infection. We waited a few weeks for it to go down on its own. It didn't. PCP was going to start a course of antibiotics, but I end up with a post surgical infection after the lumpectomy so my BS beat her to the antibiotics. Lump is still there. Had an uiltrasound, and it is not a lymph node but an area of fluid. Now PCP has referred me to a general surgeon and radiation can't start until we find out what is in my leg. I had asked my PCP if this was related to the BC or would impact radiation, instead of an answer I got a surgeon referral. Now my RO wants to know what it is before we proceed. I think I got spoiled going to the breast center I go to. They answer all my questions and spend as much time as I need them to. The lack of communication from my PCPs office is aggravating. I ask a question and instead of an answer get a referral. URGH!!!!! So for now the plan is to start radiation this summer, unless whatever is in my leg is nasty and changes the diagnosis.",

I don't think my Radiation Nurse Practitioner (is this RNP for short) buys into his theory since she is constantly talking about ways to ward off the fatigue. I really feel it today. It's a weird fatigue though. Not like when you are tired after a day of doing something, and are just kind of sore maybe and worn out. It is like I have lead weights in my arms and legs. I just discovered those new Crystal Light Energy packets. I think those are going to be my friend today. Go Caffeine!!!",

I was told that the radiation can really stir back up the surgery site and it seems to be doing just that. My RO said the soreness should get better once radiation is done. I am also having shooting pains throughout the breast and into the armpit. Unfortunately these shooting pains may be forever. Both my RO and radiation nurse practitioner say sometimes the shooting pains get better or go away, but a lot of times they will always happen. I guess between the two types of pain I am having right now that is the best outcome. The shooting pains are occassional (a couple of times a day), but the soreness is always there now.",

I found a great thread in the Hormonal Treatment forum that is for people who had not had any SEs to relate their experience. Reading through this has really helped me with my concerns. Although Tamoxifen is scary, at least for me I think it is necessary. I left surgery with positive margins that we are not able to get clean. So Tamoxifen will hopefully go a long way to making sure I don't have a recurrence. Idesim- Thanks for the info. Hopefully like you I will not have any SEs. Today is 18 out of 30.

Karynhelen- I would probably wait and see what your RO gives you. I know from reading the posts some people either get prescriptions or have to buy their own lotions, but my RO told me not to buy anything and he would give me everything I need. Whenever I run low on something I just ask for another bottle. The hydrocortisone mixed with aquafor worked really well for me for the itch. My RO did tell me to make sure I mix the hydrocortisone with something and don't use it straight. Since hydrocortisone is very drying if I use it straight I could end up in worse shape. 10 treatments to go at this point. 5 regular and 5 boosts. Unfortunately, at this point my skin is not holding up too well. Which really is a bummer since I have been super vigilant with the creams and lotions. I too have the itchy raised rash, but as of last night the whole area in the crease is just raw and looks like it has some cracks in it. Even plain water in the shower burns. When it started looking rough last week my radiation nurse practitioner offered to put a special bandage on it that would protect the area and possibly calm it down. Passed on it last week and just slathered the aquafor on extra heavy, but I think I am going to take the bandage this week. I had not moved back into regular bras since my surgery (still wearing sports bras), but now I need to make sure the sports bra band is well onto my rib cage not under my breast or it REALLY hurts. I'll let you know if I get some sort of new cream when I go in today. Have a nice restful weekend everyone!!",

Wonder if I should ask about that next week since right now the over the counter hydrocortisone is only lasting a couple of hours. Even during the night I sometimes get up to reapply it. Saw my nurse practitioner today. She gave me silicon bandages. Since we really don't want to use tape anywhere near that area, the aquafor basically pastes the bandages in place. We knew that stuff was really sticky huh :-). These bandages seem to really help. The feel cool and seem to soothe the whole area. It's pretty raw right now. Unfortunately my nurse told me it will probably get a lot worse before it gets better. Once your skin starts breaking down i guess it doesn't stop until after you are done. Since I only have 9 to go (4 regular & 5 boosts) we are going to keep going unless it gets a lot worse fast. For anyone just starting rads, I wanted you to know this does not seem to be the norm. Most of us make it through with little difficulty. So don't be scared!",

By breaking down I mean the skin is gone. I have figured out the pattern now so I know when that is going to happen. For about a day before it happens the area I am going to lose is super red and kind of shiny. Then I usually wake up the next morning (my treatments are at 3pm) with the area being crazy itchy. Not just regular itchy. By the time I get undressed for bed at night the skin in the super itchy area is gone. Sometimes you can see where it peeled away, sometimes it is just gone. The area now looks like and feels like a skinned knee. It is just raw and either oozes fluid or sometimes blood. I am super careful not to scratch so I am not scratching it away during the day. This has happened to the whole under breast crease (except about 1 inch) and it is starting to happen under my arm. My apologies to anyone who read this and got grossed out.",

I had a lumpectomy not a MX, but rads seemed to work up the whole surgery area and I couldn't lay on my left side. Even in the beginning prior to the skin issues. Sciencegal- Honestly I think I am the exception not the norm for skin issues. almost everyone else seems to get through fine with just some redness/pinkness and a little burning. I worried initially because my complexion is very fair and I have never been able to tan. I have always just burned and peeled, and then started the whole process over again. However, my RO said that has nothing to do with radiation and will not necessarily predict how your skin will react. He said either you will or you won't have issues and there is no way to really predict it in the beginning. Goldycat123- Welcome! There are some great women on this board. I have really found it super helpful (even on days I just need to vent). I hope you do too! IamNancy- Yeah!!! Your almost done!!!! Well....not a super day for me. The first day or two after a certain area of skin breaks down is the worst, and I have two more breakdown spots today. After about 3-4 days I either get used to the pain from that spot or it stops hurting as much. When I saw my nurse practitioner yesterday she was really worried about skin breakdown in the tumor area since it looks kind of bad already, and had me start putting the mepilex dressing on it as a precaution to stop any rubbing. It already really hurts so she is probably right. If this happens I think they better break out the morphine!! I will start my boosts this afternoon. So they will leave most of my other problem areas alone so they can hopefully start healing, but might make the tumor area worse. Sigh............ I start Tamoxifen next Friday. Initially I was more worried about it than the rads because I had heard so many bad stories of SEs from tamoxifen. But now.......eh,not so much. Maybe like everything else, I am just tired of worrying at this point. Off to treatment.......Sending everyone gentle hugs and good vibes for a healing weekend!",

I've taken two sick days (one for fatigue and 1 when my skin first started breaking down). I also have the option to work from home if I need to. So far I have only done that twice. It's not easy but doable. My employer knows about my skin issues and has let me know that whatever I can manage to get dressed in that day is ok to wear to the office, so that helps. Not sure what I am going to do next week though. Since surgery I have been wearing sports bras, but due to some skin breakdown under my arm I can't even get those on anymore. I absolutely refuse to go out in public without a bra. On Saturday I tried putting a Telfa pad in that area, and it sort of worked, just not sure I can take it all day. Honestly though.....most of the women on this thread are doing ok with skin issues. Even with my issues I think working is mostly doable. Having something to do can keep your mind off things.

These studies are based on radiation levels women received in the 70s, and it is much higher than the radiation we receive today. Today we receive lower radiation in much more precise areas. I had left side radiation, and we did some imaging studies to see if we could buy my heart some room using a breath hold method. We could. By holding my breath during rads we were able to get my heart about 99% out of the field. Now not everyone can do this due to personal anatomy, but I can hold a fairly large amount of air, and that inflation brought my whole chest up and away from my heart. Has your RO mentioned breath hold radiation to you? Breath hold radiation is not terribly more difficult that regular. I used a snokel like device and basically video game glasses. The glasses had a graph on them, and after taking measurements  based on 85% of the air I could take in for about 70% of the time I could hold my breath, I just had to take in air until I hit the green bar on the graph, and hold it until my tech told me to release (about 28-35 seconds). The snorkel measures air going in and coming out. If I had an issue where I had to release my breath during treatment, the machine shut off and we re-started. Hope this helps!",

On the other hand, since you are not having major issues, the non-prescription might be fine. I had heard that the prescription was very expensive. Even my dermatologist said it would probably be $75-$125 dollars and that insurance usually doesn't pick it up. However my insurance did pick it up, and all I had to pay was the tier 4 copayment of $40. Still expensive but much better than expected. I think they might have covered it because one of the prescribed uses is to treat radiation wounds, and my dermatologist usually prescribes it for other things. For instance she used it because the day before her wedding she ended up with a waxing burn on her face. The Biafine cleared it up enough to be covered by makeup by the next day. So that might be why she said they usually don't cover it.",

The treatment only takes about 1 minute though. nyama- I wasn't totally healed up prior to radiation. I still had scabs on the incisions. I had gotten a post op infection that caused blisters to form as well, and they were still able to start my treatment. My RO was more concerned about the infection coming back during radiation than the state of my healing. Welcome to all the newcomers! Sadly there are a lot of us now. I also wasn't told not to eat certain things. Unfortunately, I am having some significant fatigue. It started really bad last Friday. It's a weird fatigue. It not like when you have been doing something like working in the yard and slowly feel yourself getting tired. One minute I am chugging along through my day, and the next I feel like I have lead weights in my arms and legs and really need to sleep. My radiation nurse practitioner says she hears that a lot, and that is how the fatigue seems to work. After today though I am halfway through. So only 3 more weeks of this. Hopefully the fatigue gets better quickly once I am done. Good Luck to all!!",

After being so worried about having to take a break we actually ended up working it out. My skin was a little better this morning after the weekend of rest. At this point the whole area in the crease is raw, like a skinned knee. But it is no longer bleeding or running. I am sure this will probably change since treatment started again today, but it's mildly better for now. My RO and I had a long conversation about whether I was going to continue or not. If I had more than 4 whole breast treatments left he wouldn't have let me continue, but since I only have 4 and the boosts don't hit that area, he left it up to me. I decided to continue. He gave me a topical lidocaine gel, and will prescribe pain killers if I need them. Took the gel, but passed on the painkillers for now (due to tons of painkiller allergies). Might take him up on the painkillers tomorrow if I keep DH up all night again. Guess I yiped every time I moved last night. At least I can finish though and be done with this. Yeah!!

When my skin got a lot worse this weekend I was wondering what was wrong with me that it wasn't getting better like it was supposed to. New RO told me to expect the bad areas that I have now to start getting better maybe by next week, but expect the boost area to break down pretty fast.

To be honest I went to work without a bra today and just felt awful, just not used to going out like that. So maybe it's for the best anyways. I agree Linda. Not ready to celebrate yet, although.....all drugged up maybe I'm more fun.... I had heard the skin breakdown can keep happening 7-10 days after rads ends so maybe celebrate in a couple of weeks after you are healed and feeling better. Congrats Cmbernardi! Good luck with your surgery. I had a partial hysterectomy about 6 years ago. Honestly my lumpectomy was way more painful. Looking back, compared to all this cancer stuff my hysterectomy was a cake walk. IamNancy- that is happening to me too. During the whole breast radiation I wouldl feel sporadic sharp jabs for an hour or two after. Now that I am doing boosts I feel them during the boost and sporadically throughout the day. They are a very deep pain. It doesn't feel skin related. My nurse practitioner says it is normal and not to worry about it. Gentle hugs to everyone! Good luck to all just starting!

Don't know if it was going to get better anyways, or if maybe with the skin breakdown I noticed it less and thus did not scratch at it during my sleep to further irritate it. However, it came back last week after I finished whole breast rads. It got better after my (unbroken down) skin peeled. It just kind of peeled it away and cleared all the bumps. Not sure how far back you have read in this thread, but some of the women really like the Frogg Toggs chilly towel you can get on amazon. That might help as well. Yeah Nancy!! Almost done!!! Thanks AnnieLane- If my doctor and pharmacy can get this straightened out, I can't wait to try it. Well....woke up this morning, and so far the boosts area had remained intact. Sigh.....not anymore. I noticed that the smell had kind of come back yesterday but it wasn't the mepilex that smelled, and this morning the boost area is definitely breaking down.

They did tell me the skin breakdowns could continue for 7-10 days after the rads to that area ended, so it is not a total shock at least. Hope you are doing well! Edit- Just looked at the stuff on Amazon, and it is the non-prescription strength of the stuff my dermatologist told me about. Guess I am going to keep hunting the doctor's office for the prescription.",

I know it probably won't help much but...this too shall pass. By the week after rads ended I had pretty much no skin left in the crease. I had a large broken down area under my arm, and my whole nipple was raw. I am now 3 weeks out from whole breast rads, and 2 weeks from boosts and the healing is amazing. I went from awful to being able to wear a real bra this week. I had a small area peel yesterday that left new and tender skin exposed, but that is the worst thing that as happened this week, so its been a really good week. The best advice I can give you is to ask for pain meds if you need them. I ran out of my tramadol left over from surgery and toughed out the pain for almost 3 weeks before asking for pain meds, and it was a miserable 3 weeks. I should have asked sooner. GoWithTheFlow- love the new picture! Sciencegal- in response to Caitlin's post I was going to let you know what is in the prescription Biafine, but it is surprising how little info there is. When I first got it I was a little shocked. You know that little booklet you get from your pharmacy every time you fill a prescription that has the uses, drug interactions and such? This little booklet is pretty much empty. In every section it says ask your physician or pharmacist. Even the packaging insert lists ingredients but no info. A little scary, but since it is working so well, not sure I care what's in it at this point.",

My RO did tell me than my skin could contiue to get worse for 7-10 days after the end of rads.  BUT.....like Linda said...once things start to improve, they improve fast! My RO gave me the option of a radiation vacation twice during treatment. But each time we were so close to the end of that phase I opted to continue. I just wanted to get it done. Thinking of all of you. Sending healing wishes to all! Remember there is a light at the end of the tunnel even if you are having some really bad skin issues. By the time Linda and I were done I think we had more bandage and mepilex than skin in a lot of areas, but things got better. I really agree with Linda about the pain meds. If you need them, ask for them. I spent almost 3 miserable weeks between when I ran out of my surgery pain pills and when I asked for a new prescription. I was trying to tough it out just using the prescription lidocaine. They were 3 miserable weeks I could have and probably should have avoided. There are no medals given for toughing it out. It is all about getting through it and moving on to the next phase.",

GWTF- So sorry you are having such skin issues. To be perfectly honest...so sorry....after the dark crusty stuff came off the pain was worse for me. All those nerve endings were now exposed. But the worst areas of breakdown I had did not start off as dark crusty areas. The dark areas turned into pretty shallow breakdowns that healed relatively quickly. The areas that got shiny though were bad. Once an area of skin turned shiny the next day it was gone, and it was a much deeper breakdown that bled and seeped. DizzyMom- Congrats!!!! Sophia-Anne- Welcome! I think everyone already said everything I would of said except about the tumeric. I noticed someone told you they were taking tumeric. I have researched the tumeric pretty extensively at this point. I was hoping to use it to help with my asthma. I take tamoxifen, and it seems like most asthma meds have bad drug interactions with tamoxifen. There appears to be two schools of thought about the tumeric. One is that it helps the tamoxifen do its job, and kind of punches it up a little which would be great. The other is that the tumeric blocks one of tamoxifen's binding locations and thus makes it less effective. Not so great. It's a personal choice, but for me I didn't wanted to take the chance of the tamoxifen not doing its job. Unfortunately, with regards to my asthma, this has left me with a very complicated drug regimen where I have 3 different drugs that I take at different times on different days to try to keep the toxic effects and the interactions down.",

I also sometimes just feel like a whiner when I am complaining to my family about this symptom or that. On the up side though I am very happy with the radiation center I go to. I was wondering if everyone's center is like this. All radiation patients receive a ton of extra services to try to make the experience as easy as possible. For free I can attend weekly yoga (not really my thing though), I can get weekly reiki sessions (not really into this either), but I also get 2 free massages (gonna do this for sure.) We also get the use of a private locked parking lot so we never have to circle the hospital for a parking space. Is this how it is everywhere? I feel kind of spoiled.",

I tried out the Pears but I thought it smelled mediciny so I am now using Dove unscented. Tom's Deodorant was also on the list. I bought the Peach solid. So far it is working fine but it is not really hot yet here in the Northeast. The list also said to use an electric razor. I just can't do this though. I don't think electric razors shave close enough and I just can't stand razor stubble. So I have been using my regular razor and so far so good. I do already have a slight burn, but it is not in my armpit, so I will continue to use the regular razor for as long as I can. Good Luck to everyone just starting radiation.

I am having left side radiation, but using the breath hold technique. My heart is somewhat in the field (like 1% of so). I do worry about my lungs. But after my surgery I still have positive margins, so if I don't do radiation my cancer will most probably come back since there is still some there. I look at the tamoxifen the same way. Radiation lowers my risk of recurrence 50%. Tamoxifen takes it down another 40%. This is the only way to get my risk into a reasonable range.",

Think my temper is getting short. Well anyways.....she finally leaves, but she tells my nurse to see me after treatment. So treatment took forever today. I really don't mind my nurse, doctor, or my radiation therapists checking in with me if I look bad. I am just not up to the creepy silent eye contact thing from the social worker. On the upside though.... All whole breast treatments done. Yeah! Only 5 boosts to go.",

You are right, everything else does especially the aquafor. For some reason the aloevesta is a little better. I have started putting some neosporin in the crease area instead of the aquafor since I lost some more skin overnight and the aquafor is just brutal. The neosporin seems to burn less. Hoping to see some improvement prior to the 7-10 days after the end of rads that my RO predicted. Sorry you have to deal with the smell too. :-( as long as the Mepilex stays in place it seems to contain the smell, but I am afraid to go out since if the Mepilex moves the smell is awful. My nurse said she couldn't smell it unless she got really close, but in my mind I am convinced if I can smell it everyone can so I think I will get some rest at home this weekend. Wishing everyone a peaceful and healing weekend! Gentle hugs from NH.",

I am kinda squirmy about it right now too, but for different reasons I think. Tamoxifen has a very small chance of causing endometrial cancer. I have had a partial hysterectomy but still have really bad endometriosis. I am really concerned about this. Since I have had a partial hysterectomy I won't show any symptoms of endometrial cancer until it is too late. My MO researched this for me and only found 2 cases studies ever when someone with a hysterectomy and endometriosis turned up with the cancer. I know 2 cases are not a lot but they are not zero either. So I don't know what I am going to do. Since I had a dirty margin after surgery that we could not get clean the Tamoxifen is pretty important for me. I have a consult with another doctor or Monday to discuss this but I am probably going to take the Tamoxifen.",

Both the RO and MO feel VERY strongly that I need to take it, expecially since we were not able to achieve negative margins. Finally, decided to visit my OB/GYN who I have been seeing for 20+ years to get his take on Tamoxifen. He also felt VERY strongly that I needed to take it. So I am going to give it a try and see. I actually just found a very interesting thread in the Hormonal Therapy discussion area. This thread was started by someone asking for people to chime in who have had little to no SEs from Tamoxifen. There was a surprising number of people who had no SEs or very small manageable ones. The name of the thread is \"Tamoxifen, Its not all bad is it?\" It made me feel much better about the whole thing.",

I had read a recent article in the American Journal of Medicine that discussed just this issue and it had me pretty worked up. My RO and I discussed the article at length. One thing the article failed to mentioned is that it's data is based on radiation treatments from 20+ years ago. Nowadays we get much less radiation than they did in those days. But they still do all they can to try and keep clear of the heart. I am doing breath hold radiation. During my sim they measured my air volume and how long I can hold my breath. They took 80% of that volume and determined I can hold my breath for way longer than I need to for treatment. Everyday I use a snorkel type thing to monitor my breathing and I wear video glasses. On the glasses is a graph. When they tell me to I drawn in air until I hit he green line on the graph, and hold it for about 30 seconds. We do treatment from 2 angles so I have to do this twice. It is really easy, and has put my heart almost totally out of the radiation field. Lin43- they do offer at lot at my center, which is nice. I guess we take our perks where we can get them through this whole cancer thing huh? I am trying really hard to see this glass as half full. One big perk I have noticed is that I no longer have to wait for doctor's appointments. Before the big \"C\" if I wanted to see my PCP or OB/GYN it would sometimes take weeks to get an appointment. Now I always get seen the same day or next day. My DH thinks I am too negative (I see myself as a realist). So I am trying to find the positives with all we have to go through. No lines, no waiting at non-cancer related docs is a positive.:-) But acupuncture.....now I'm jealous!! I'll trade you some yoga or reiki for some acupuncture.",

He is concerned since I had a really bad post-op infection (it traveled the lymph nodes into my left arm and even my hand swelled). He said radiation can stir it up if there was anything left of it. So we are going to watch the pain. My left arm aches pretty bad too. He said that the radiation field covers most of my left shoulder since they want to get the breast tissue under the arm. He thinks the radiation may be aggravating the nerves in my left arm. As far as the shooting pains go...it was expected. Nerves are regenerating, and radiation can cause shooting pains anyways. So no worries on the shooting pains. Just watching the soreness and the left arm ache. Welcome AnnieLane! Doing the weekend dance!!! Two days of no radiation!!!!!",

I don't want to be a downer, but I think we have all discovered (and many of our ROs told us) that you are either going to have problems or not, but lubing up might not prevent the problems if you were going to have them anyways. It might just help with the symptoms. A couple of women in this thread (myself included) really were very rigorous about lubing up but still had significant breakdown. The other side of this is a lot of women had no problems at all. Luck of the draw I guess. I worked throughout my rads too. If you do have breakdown there is stuff out there to help. Mepilex is a silicon bandage that covers the breakdown area to make it more comfortable. I believe Nancy was prescribed silverdene cream. I know Linda used a whole bunch of different things to help with her breakdown. I think Biafine was a godsend. I was actually prescribed this by my dermatologist after rads had ended. I had a lot of broken down skin. Enough that I was taking prescription painkillers on a daily basis. The biafine really helped things start healing in just a couple of days. Most of the SEs are pretty easy to solve....itching (mix hydrocortisone with the aquafor or aloevesta), minor redness and soreness (OTC antiinflammatories seem to help). My RO told me there is no way to tell who is going to have serious skin issues from rads. He had told me not to worry about it until it happened. Did that stop me from worrying?....naw...but that is what he told me. Hope this helps and is not too much of a bummer. Just my two cents......",

Mine actually also felt like needle pricks along my breast bone. The techs said it was due to static electricity from the machine. They said they see it a lot more in the winter. Sure enough as soon as it started getting really humid here it stopped. Is the air really dry in your treatment center? That could do it. Clyday- Congrats! Sadly the answer to your question is yes. For 7-10 days after treatment you can see more breakdown. I saw new problems for a little over a week, but then it drastically started improving fairly quickly. So there is definitely a light at the end of the tunnel.",

My primary care actually thought I had whooping cough about 2 years ago. This is no where near that bad. It is a dry cough that comes and goes but sometimes get bad enough to cause an asthma attack. Two years ago my doctor actually chose not to test for whooping cough when I was so sick. She said the test is fairly inaccurate and gets a lot of false positives, and even if it is a false positive it still creates a CDC paperwork nightmare. So instead we chose to use the antibiotics you would for whooping cough just not do the test. Melody- Did the CT show anything on your lung? Scarring? LW0919- I think you actually get used to being on display. I am a very shy person but since the whole breast cancer thing I am getting used to being topless in a room full of people. In answer to your bra question, I wore a sports bra from surgery through radiation. I am a size D (well at least on one side) and I just couldn't go braless. I was just not comfortable going out in public like that. CassDugan- I did have more swelling during radiation. I had read in another thread that some other women had permanent swelling. The rads swelling sort of filled out their lumpectomy areas. I was actually pretty happy about this since it sort of evened me out and didn't cause any discomfort. Sadly the swelling just went away one day, and I am lopsided again. ItIsWhatItIs- My RO and I had a discussion about skin types and SEs. He said there is absolutely no correlation between being fair skinned and SEs. I am very fair skinned and never tan. I always burn, so I was really worried about it. I guess he was right since during radiation one of the women I saw everyday was black and her skin was actually in worse shape than mine. The pain pills I took during rads was for the topical pain of skin breakdown. It feels kind of like a skinned knee, but unlike a skinned knee that pain doesn't stop in a couple of hours. Thank you to everyone who sent healing wishes for my cough.",

My RO had also said to watch for areas that seep too much. A little clear or slightly bloody drainage is ok once the skin breaks down but a lot of clear drainage or anything that isn't clear is not good and to call. Welcome Aviatrix58! Thanks Nyama! I remembered her earlier post but with so many posts now I had a hard time finding it. Thanks for the thread too! Thanks GWTF! I hope you are feeling better over the weekend! You have been through enough yourself. Healing wishes to everyone over the weekend!",

Seems like everything for asthma interacts badly with tamoxifen. So we are going to switch drugs on different days in order to try to lower the chances of a bad interaction and in some cases the toxicity of the interactions. Sounds pretty scary, but at least most of these don't have the \"sudden death\" interaction issue when used with tamoxifen that my old ones did. I have decided not to use the turmeric and here's why since there was some discussion earlier about it. There are two schools of thought with research going on about the turmeric tamoxifen combo. One thinks turmeric helps tamoxifen keep cancer at bay which is great. The other however thinks turmeric blocks one of the binding agents in tamoxifen and thus renders it less effective. Not so great. I left surgery with positive margins that we are not able to get clean, so we know we left some cancer behind. We hope rads killed anything that remained, but nothing is 100%. Because of this I just don't feel I can risk making the tamoxifen less effective. Hi Johnetta- Welcome! I agree with GWTF. I wouldn't buy too much. My RO told me not to buy anything since he would give me anything I needed. I also would suggest you buy some cheap cotton tank tops that you won't mind throwing out when you are done. The grease stains just never come out. I have soaked mine in both Shout and dish soap, but nothing helped. I would also recommend you buy some Tom's deodorant since you won't be able to use anything with aluminum in it.",

Going to watch my protein intake today to see exactly how much I am getting. Starting to really think it is the Tamoxifen. I see my MO in September and will ask then. I am about 1.5 months into Tamoxifen and starting to see some side effects (aching joints, night sweats, etc). I normally get 6-7 hours of sleep a night and am fine with that, but now I am getting 9+ hours a night and am still exhausted. If it is the rads I hope it gets better soon. A year is a really long time, but if it is the tamox 5 years is even longer. So not sure what I am hoping for.",
