With respect to lymphedema, it is very mild in my arm at this point.  It is worse in my chest due to the radiation.  I watched the video of the MLD and the self-bandaging techniques, and I cried when it was finished.  I felt so overwhelmed by it all.  I think I have good therapist, and she has performed the lymphedema massage on me but hasn't taught me how to do it yet.  I can learn practically anything that I set my mind to, but I don't know how much pressure to exert.  I know that it should be very light but that's about it.  I see the PT in two days and will ask her.  The video is excellent from a learning perspective, but I can see that I will have to watch it numerous times in order to learn the technique and all the steps involved.  I want to thank you ladies for being here.  I have learned more on this site than I have from all the medical professionals that I've dealt with.  You really help tremendously!",

Nancy: I had my last chemo on 4/15/10.  It took about six weeks before I saw hair growing.  It grew on the top and down the back first and then finally began growing on the sides.  I was worried I'd have a permanent mohawk!   Now I am 17 weeks PFC and have over an inch.  It is extremely curly and has a mind of its own, but at least it's mine and I'm grateful.  I would think that you will see hair growing by November, but it seems that it does also depends on what type of chemo you receive.  Some seem to be harder on hair than others.  I was given Taxotere and Cytoxan as well as Adriamycin and I think my hair grew back slowly.  I stopped wearing my wig when it got to be about 1/2 to 2/3 of an inch long.  The wig was hot and felt like it was going to slip off my head once my hair started growing in. LilyLou: LOL.  I have a flat spot on the back, top of my head, but I don't have a twin to blame it on.  My coworker measures my hair every week or so.  I'm fortunate to have such supportive friends at work. They always tell me how great I look.  It feels good to get some positive reinforcement.  After my hysterectomy five days ago, my mom said, \"Now you're an IT.\"  At first I wasn't sure what she was talking about and then I realized that she meant that since I no longer have breasts or a uterus or ovaries, that she considered me gender neutral!  How's that coming from one's own mother?!  I was absolutely speechless!",

PFC, and my hair is a little over 4 inches long.  It has been extremely curly since it began growing back.  I have always had straight hair and struggled to know what to do with it.  Now I'm embracing the curls.  I use Moroccan hair creme and Moroccan hair oil only.  I use a blow dryer with a diffuser so it doesn't get too frizzy.  I stop drying when it is still slightly damp and then finger curl it.  My avatar was taken over a month ago, so my hair is longer now.  It reminds me of the hairstyles from the 40's and 50's.",

I worried myself sick about losing it, but when day 14 arrived (TC) after my first TX, my hair began to fall out.  I tugged on one spot on the side of my head until I had a blad spot.  Then I began to tug on the other side and created another bald spot.  I looked ridiculous standing there in front of the bathroom mirror with two bald spots - one on each side of my head.  I didn't cry, rather I got a pair of scissors and cut sections of hair all over my head to remove the length.  Then I got the clippers that I normally use to cut my DH's hair and buzzed my own head like Demi Moore in GI Jane.  Within a few days, the remaining stubble had fallen out as well.  I am thin, with a very fair complexion.  While on chemo I became even more pale.  I felt like Gollum in Lord of the Rings.  I was very surprised that I didn't cry when I lost my hair.  I expected to, but I cried over other things, like losing my breasts and having none of my fitted clothing look right because I couldn't wear prosthetics until after rads.  I had a major meltdown in my closet one day. Anyway, I didn't have a game plan either before day 14, but when the day actually arrived I handled it much better than I expected.  I believe that you will too.",

I did go topless at 12 weeks PFC.  My hair was super short, but it was so hot with the wig in NC.  I remember the first outfit that I wore with my spiky short hairdo.  We were going out for a fancy dinner, and I wore a long, sleeveless, bright green and black, bold-patterned maxi dress.  I have mild LE so I wore my black arm sleeve and big flashy silver earrings and an intricate, wide silver bangle bracelet.  I put on my strappy black sandals with two inch heels as I tried my best to look artistic so people wouldn't question the hair as much.  I wore a little extra eye makeup too since it was evening.  It seemed to work.  The only comments I received were how wonderful I looked.  The hardest thing about going topless was going to work.  I was very self-conscious, but all my coworkers were fabulous.  They were so encouraging.  It was very freeing to ditch the wig. MBJ recommeded the foam color.  I was really quite pleased with it.  The first two days I felt it was a little too dark (my chemo curl sucks up the color), but then it lightened up quite a bit after I washed it a few times.  I applied the foam color to my dry hair. My eyebrows have always been sparse, but when they grew back in after chemo, they came in nice, and then I lost them again along with the eyelashes, well after chemo had ended.  Now I use a light brown eyebrow pencil (I keep the tip sharpened well) and draw in little brows to fill in the more sparse areas.  It is made by Covergirl and two come in one package along with a little pencil sharpener. Well happy hair growing everyone!  For those of you without hair or with some just starting to grow in, be patient.  You will get your hair back.  It might be different than you expect, but it's better than bald at least as far as I'm concerned.",

I held my head up high and walked with confidence. I had so many positive comments, and I never put the wig on again after that evening. I had colored my hair a light natural brown with Loreal Excellence cream color. It looked better than the black and white hair that had grown in. The white hair looked like I had gotten highlights when I put the hair color on. Just go topless when you are ready. The truth is that we worry about our looks way more than others do.",

To answer your question, I had three tumors, all of considerable size and none of which was detected by a mammogram as I had extremely dense breasts. My doctor kept reassuring me for five years that it was fibrocystic breast tissue. Two of the tumors felt like large thickened areas and the other felt like a lump that was visible when you looked at my breast. I went faithfully to my appointments every year and had yearly mammograms, the last of which was nine months before my dx. If my doctor had offered me an ultrasound, needle biopsy, or MRI, we could have found the cancer sooner and I might not have needed all the treatments I have endured. So my advice to everyone - leave NO lump unchecked by at least two different tests. I was VERY fortunate that the cancer hadn't spread to my lymph nodes. It was in fact a miracle as far as I am concerned. I pray that your turns out to be harmless and nothing to worry about. Be well!",

Keep us posted on your progress and know that we are here to help and encourage you.  We've all been there, and I know it helped me a great deal to have the ladies on this site for support.",

As for the radiation, I had 36 treatments.  Doctors were on the fence as to whether I needed it or not, but I chose to receive it because one of my tumors had only a 2 mm margin.  It was a clean, acceptable margin, but too close for my comfort.  Rads was tiring in the last two weeks, and for two weeks following, but overall nothing like chemo.  It was comparitvely very easy.  Each daily treatment was very quick and painless.  I worried about it a lot prior to going, but the techs put me at ease and while it was a pain in the butt to go every day, I had relatively few side effects.  The worst being that I had 3 blisters during the final week of treatment (they were small), and I had the fatigue which was relatively mild.  I didn't miss any work during my treatment phase.  I wanted to be very aggressive treating this cancer and I never want to experience a recurrence so the treatments to me seemed like a small price to pay compared with the regret that I would feel otherwise.  My tumors were in my right breast so there was less risk compared with women who have rads to the left breast as their heart can be affected in the radiation field.  I also didn't have my axilla radiated because I already have truncal lymphedema and mild lymphedema in my right arm.  The rads could have significantly made it worse, so I elected not to have it there because I had no node involvement. I know these decisions are very difficult, but I can honestly say now, being on the other side of the treatments, that I don't regret any of my decisions.  I made the most aggressive ones and I won't look back later and say, \"I wish I had done more.\"  I did everything that was possible to irradicate this cancer.  If it comes back, then I will deal with it as aggressively as possible again.  I hope to be around for a long while.  I hope all the best for you Shelley.  How many rads treatments have been suggested for you?",
