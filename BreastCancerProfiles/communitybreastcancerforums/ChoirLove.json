I'm have a bi-lateral on Monday the 26th and I think I'm going to need some support from others who've been through this. Had DCIS 5 years ago and had a mastectomy on the right side with a saline implant then. Now, even though my dr says it won't improve my chances to beat a recurrence, i'm having them both off. There's nothing wrong with the left breast except for a slightly suspicious MRI. But I just feel it's the most aggressive thing to do...almost as if it will help me feel like I'm doing SOMETHING to kick this cancer in the face! I was so sure of my decision about this the entire time, until last night when I started having doubts. Then this morning I was really down for the first time, crying a lot (and I'm not a cryer!). Does this sound normal?  What is normal right now?  I'm afraid I will miss my beautiful breasts and will hate the way the scars feel. I'm scared that there will be cancer in lots of nodes (one is for sure cancer, probably two) or that in spite of everything they do, it will have metastasized a tiny bit and will be back in 5 years. It's all so scary. I'm putting up a good front to my students and my friends and family. But I'm scared.",

Apparently I bled a lot. I felt really good yesterday, good spirits I mean. I was so happy to have the surgery done. Now I need to set up some kind of routine here at home to keep my mind occupied. I was fascinated to read how quickly you recovered, Marg--you are such an inspiration to me!  Also a bit jealous that you were allowed to shower. That is one thing I would LOVE is a shower, but my surgeon said no showers until the drains are out. I'll have my husband wash my hair for me when he gets home. I also found it helpful to read about home health. Since my sisters live far away and both parents are dead and my daughter is at college too far away to come home, I am on my own during the day while my husband (who's a saint!) is at work. What do you recommend I ask the home health nurse to do, other than change the dressings? And what do you girls think about taking a shower with the homehealth nurse here to help me, even tho my surgeon told me not to?  I really like feeling connected to all of you and supported by all of you. And I LOVE the practical advice. I haven't tried the camisole yet, because it seemed too tight and I was afraid to have something tight over my former boobs.  Here's a nitty-gritty question: did you pin the drains on the outside of your shirt/PJs or on the inside ?  I hate the plastic against my skin so I have them on the outside now. But of course I'll want to hide them when I go out or someone comes over. Just wondering what all of you did/are doing?  Thanks so much!",

Has anyone tried pot for the nausea? Does it help at night? I was awake 4 hours in a row last night because every time I lie down the nausea is so horrible. Any advice is welcome on surviving tonight and my 4th treatment.",
