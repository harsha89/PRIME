How bad is the pain? 3. How long before I can start exercising (weights) and doing stuff around the house, driving? 4.  How do I deal with the mounting terror about what they might find?  I am trying to be strong for everyone, so I feel I am keeping all my fears to myself.   5.

Take care and  let us know how you are doing. Mary",
