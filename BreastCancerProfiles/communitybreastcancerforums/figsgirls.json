My daugther says it looks totally natural and she is brutally honest so if they looked fake she would definitely tell me! My brows only thinned a little on AC but then fell out a lot on Taxol. The same with my lashes. Now, after tx 9 of 12, the upper lashes are almost all back, lower ones are coming in slowly, but those brows are really poky!! My head hair is coming in steadily, and my pubic hair is starting to return! Donna",

How about dill pickle flavored potato chips?? While on the A/C I was really into olives, but now on Taxol I can't stand the sight of them. I think I associate them with the crappiness I felt on A/C. I don't have a metallic taste but I do think my tastebuds are dulled.  I, too, lost a significant amount of weight about a year before my dx - about 35 pounds through Weight Watchers.

I bought these things called buffs to wear on my head. You can configure them several different ways - like a beanie or a cap with some of the fabric coming out the back to protect your neck from the sun. Sometimes I would wear them under a baseball cap. I like them because I can still use them now that tx. is over. (If you ever watched \"Survivor\", these are the things they wore on the show. I will NOT be wearing mine as a tube top, however! lol) They are effective at keeping sweat out of your eyes, which I found to be an issue especially once I started losing eyebrows and lashes in addition to my hair. I ordered them online. Good luck with your treatment.",

I recall someone posting to be careful about eating foods during chemo that you loved before chemo, because you might associate the food with the bad feeling of chemo and it will turn you off. Well, it happened to me. I have been craving pizza for weeks and have been afraid to eat it for that reason. Now that I've had my 3rd of 12 Taxols and don't have any stomach issues, I think I may try the pizza..........

Lots of times there is chatter and joking going on between the nurses and the people receiving treatment, so it's a pretty relaxed environment. For the Taxol I was told I was required to have a ride because they would be giving me Benedryl, so my daughter took me. She went and got us lunch, then we chatted and she got some reading done for school while I did a puzzle. The nurse said I would fall asleep because of the Benedryl, but I didn't. Just felt a tiny bit spacey. By the time we left, I felt like I could drive myself.

I was not in an emotional state to be around anyone, so I didn't call her back until later in the afternoon and then I tried to explain. Her response was, \"Your brother was disappointed, he really wants to see you\". So I had to (gently) tell her that I couldn't make myself responsible making my brother feel better about my cancer.

Family, friends, colleagues of my husband and me....they call because they care and want to express their concern...but it seems that if we answer every call we would spend every waking moment talking about my breast cancer. Caller ID helps, and many times we let the calls go to the answering machine and return them if/when we are up to it. Sometimes I feel like I'm being rude if I don't answer or call back right away, though, because as I said I know people just mean well and are concerned. How do you handle this part of having cancer?
