Make sure your doc REALLY understands you do NOT want future recon or they will leave dog-ears which are pouches of fat and skin under your arms that are used for reconstruction later. A lot of the women on this board are disappointed when they wake up! (You can always get an incision revision later if you don't like the look of the scar. I got one on my cancer side due to excess skin left.) The recovery IS easy compared to say, my hysterectomy! There are no bones, organs or muscles involved, so you are dealing with skin issues only. It does tend to get itchy 10 days out or so. Don't take pain meds if you don't need them as they'll only constipate you and keep you lethargic after the anaesthetic. Listen to the 'rules' for afterwards and follow them. Don't try to be a hero, you have the right to recover at your speed. (Some people may jump in and say they had pain, but if it's their first surgery, or they had recon, they may have nothing to compare surgery pain to. As I don't know your situation, please don't be surprised if you find it painful! I wonder if I should have mentioned my experience, but I do want you to know it is easier than reconstruction, that's for sure!) God bless and God speed!",

I do remember the moment, though and was amazed that for all that it was just a long strip of white tape!! Didn't seem important at all, if you know what I mean. I was thrilled, truly, for how quick the healing was and with the minimum of pain! I thought I'd be laid back for weeks. Instead, I went back to work 2 1/2 weeks later, the day the second drain got removed. I feel very sexy with clingy, soft fabrics and it makes me look slimmer. My husband rubbed in a cream every night once the wound healed to keep my skin supple and loose. He got used quickly to my new look too. It is doable. Good luck!! Please let us know how you do.",

It reminds me of that very, very full feeling when you are pregnant and the baby has dropped into postion. That's the only analogy I can come up with. The first two times it was on the left. Neither time did I consider kidney. This time it was on the right. The doctor thumped me on my back and I shot off the table and retched into the sink. He felt really bad. Strangely enough, the kidney imaging request says \"frequent UTI's\". I wonder if that is so they will check all the way down. I am estrogen positive, does that mean anything?",

But, as you said, the survival rate of 80% (without treatment) is what you had figured WITH treatment!! So you're already AHEAD of the game (and stats are only for the average women)!! You see?? You don't have your treatment plan in place yet which is why you're still hanging in limbo. Once you know what else you are going to do to the breast cancer (if anything) then you will feel so much better!! Do you see how you are kind of still in the waiting game? The fear of mets will lessen with time, but you do need to stay vigilant of your body. You know your body best. Right now your body is taking care of itself by dumping excess weight. Lucky you! The stress of the situation and the surgery all add to the \"not hungry\" feeling. This too, will pass. Stage 1, 2 AND 3 are all considered Early Stage Breast Cancer. So it doesn't matter what stage you are assigned, the disease is still breast cancer and you will be treated. Normally the higher the stage the more treatment you got, but oncs are beginning to figure out that this \"blanket treatment\" doesn't work for all, and now all stages are being treated on an individual basis. Being on these boards for 5 years, I've seen more stage one ladies (WAY less treatment!) progress to pass on than stage 4!! Go figure!!! Now treatment is considered on YOUR tumour and it's features. It's a much better position to be in than even five short years ago.",

Thank goodness!!!! As for the sentinel node, the latest technology is to only take one. The surgeon would go back in if you need more. This lessens your chance of developing lymphadema, so it's a good thing!!! My surgeon took a couple that were mashed together just to be safe. As well, did your surgeon say she just took one? You may see more than one on the pathology report. As for the fear of the future, you will learn to get nervous only when you get a weird symptom in your body.

The tumour depth wasn't just skin deep so you can't hurt it my gentle patting, but poking is another thing. Your body is trying to heal and everything is rushing in to help. Maybe you have too many chiefs and not enough Indians standing around wondering what to do. Try icing the area with a bag of frozen peas (they mold best) to the area, but not more than 15 minutes at a time and WITH A TOWEL between the ice and your breast - you do NOT want to kill off the skin!!!!

The Oncotype test is perfect for you as it will let you know whether to bother with chemo or not. BUT it is based on you taking Tamoxifen for the next 5 years. No point in skipping chemo AND Tamoxifen. Exercise and eating well just keeps your body chemistry flowing correctly. If you are all \"inline\" inside, there is less chance of that perfect storm to set off with a cancer growth.

Think of the nodes as the drains of your breast. Any cancer that tries to get out of your breast via the lymph system will have to travel through the nodes first. So, by picking out any that turned blue with the dye, they will see if there are cancer cells in the nodes. Years and years ago they would just take out ALL the nodes with horrendous results for the poor women!! This is MUCH saner and safer for you.  The dye drains through your lymph system and not your ducts so there was no reason for your nipple to be sore. How is it now? I researched everything they were going to do to me so I wasn't scared. Until 3 weeks before I had my dye injected in four places, they used to do it directly INTO THE NIPPLE!!!!

That is a GOOD thing as you will be able to make decisions as they come up. As for the dye, I had it and it does NOT sting!!! The needles that put it in are very, very thin and perhaps that's the sting he was referring to. It's like having anything injected, you don't really feel where it goes. That's used to help them find the sentinel node; the first node that picks up the dye going into your armpit area should be checked to see if it contains cancer cells. You have at least 21+ nodes in your armpit, they only need the first one and may take another couple for good luck. Some places check the nodes while you're still under and more may have to be taken. You might want to ask that. It's not common anymore to strip rows of nodes out as that could give you future lymph drainage issues. So, hopefully they will only take out the ones with cancer in them. That means they did their job and stopped the cancer from moving further into your system. That's a good thing! Your surgeon probably won't have any answers for you when you wake up except that it \"went as expected\". It's up to pathology to figure it all out and that takes days. The lump taken out might be big, but the cancer inside might be tiny. The surgeon won't know if the nodes taken out were cancerous or not. Just because they take up the dye doesn't mean they are cancerous. The surgeon wants to take a bigger lump than the cancer is expected to be because you want \"clean margins\". That means that there are no stray cancer cells at the edges of your lump which could mean there are even more stray cells wandering around. You need to have a certain \"clean\" area around the cancer to show the surgeon got it all. This won't be known until pathology tells the surgeon they either found something or didn't. So you see, the surgeon won't be able to scare you any more than you already are. Fear at this time is a good motivator to get things done. It's when your body shuts down and you can't function that you have to worry. At that point, a good long chat with your cancer team to let them know you are frozen in fear will allow them to help you. There are meds to help you get back on track. It can be paralyzing to hear you have cancer. We know. You will learn the difference between fear and vigilence; a way to keep on top of your own health. Learn your body. If anything bugs you for more than two weeks, see your PCP. A lot of us have ruined good years in worry and fear and gained nothing for it. But don't be naive either. You got cancer once, that doesn't give you a \"get out of jail\" card for life. Your body now knows how to create it. Remember: You don't have to be brave, you just have to show up! Good luck, sweetie, the way you are articulating now shows you have \"it\" all together. Make sure you cry though - in the shower or car - it has to come out at some point, so be ready.",

So take a pain med if you need one and don't let anyone tell you differently!!! But, be cautious of getting consitpated or you'll have a whole new set of troubles...hehehehehe. A couple of days with the meds and you should be okay without, but everyone is different. Some ladies go months on them and they're only hurting themselves because they still have to wean off them! Morining and night, or just even night is a good plan so you get a good sleep. Sleep is what will help you heal and moving around by walking, especially outside is what will clear your head from the anaesthetic. You done good, sweetie!!

If you have a pain or symptom that continues for more than 2 weeks, then you make an appointment. Finding mets now or later does not increase or decrease your mortality. It would only treat the symptoms sooner, that's all. Don't borrow trouble...you can't live month to month worrying about a recurrence or cancer will win over your life. We have very similar time frames and I have just learned to \"move on\". God I hate that term! But, I don't ever forget that I have/had cancer, I just don't worry the same way I used to. We are ALL just one diagnosis away from Stage IV. It doesn't matter what stage you are now. That was just for your treatment plan. Best of luck and gentle hugs....",

The breast tissue they take has no bones, organs or muscles in it so there is very little to \"feel\" afterwards. The most annoying is the drain(s), but very doable. You won't need to sleep in a recliner as you aren't getting a recon. Get in and out of bed using your ab muscles not your arms. The hardest thing will be to wash your own hair. Get a friend to do it over the kitchen sink or your hairdresser. Driving can be tricky as you don't realize how many chest muscles you use to turn and check your lanes. Bending down can put a lot of pressure on your chest too. So as Lisa says, bring things to counter level, both up and down. I used a zip up hoodie and carried the drains in the pockets. I left the hospital without a pain med and I have Fibromyalgia and was terrified of being in too much pain. No problem. The second annoying time is when the nerves start to regenerate and they ting and zing and ITCH!!! Are you going to wear a prothesis? If you just get one breast off, you'll still have to wear a bra... Good luck!",

I've had a specialist that was able to do a gastroscopy in her office. Nice to not have to go to the hospital if I can get away with it. The only difference is if it's too big. I don't know where they draw the line on the shattering of it, but websites say if it's too big it can cause damage when it breaks up. If he has to take it surgically, it's just a little incision in my back and out it goes! I just wish I could get it done before I go away in May for my daughter's wedding in the Dominican! ",

Very impressive that it can be done that quickly. Then I took the CD copy back to him and he was able to view it. I will finally be getting surgery on July 24th! What a long and painful journey to add to my angst. At least he added Demerol to my pain cocktail!",

A change of work, like you said, might be best for you!! Breast cancer cells double every 180 days. That's 6 months. So if you haven't had any significant growth then you KNOW and so do the docs, that it isn't breast cancer. I hope that alone can give you some peace of mind! That's why they have that horrid \"watch-and-wait\" time period before they do another test. Hormones affect cysts in your breasts and the timeline of your period does as well. They have to know your cycle to do the tests at the right time, so keep a schedule to help them. All in all, it looks like you're in good hands with your breast surgeon and may you two have a very benign relationship for another 7 years!! I wish you only the best, sweetie, enjoy your new babe.",

Topic is \"Intramammary lymph node metastases are an independent predictor in breast cancer outcomes.\" It says we are treated as stage II, even in the absence of axillary nodal involvement.  Mine were taken out as part of my mastectomy (double) so do they still count?

My breasts used to enter the room before me, even after a reduction. I'm so glad to have the weight off my neck and back. I don't wear a bra or prothesis or have recon. I do make sure that whatever I wear against my skin is sooooft. In fact, sometimes I feel very, very sexy/naughty by having a bare chest under my clothes. My grandkids are growing up with me like that so it's normal to them. My first grandson, at about 2 1/2, while on my lap sat up and reached back and sort of felt my chest then turned back and cuddled up. My daughter said I can hold my grands closer to my heart this way. Another grandson on my lap poked my belly and asked if I had a baby in there. I told him that was a very good question (for a 4-year old), but sadly no, NaNa didn't have a baby in there. I've done the Survivor Lap at the Relay for Life 4 times and wear my snug t-shirt with pride. I like to walk past all those ladies dancing around in pink frilly bras over their t-shirts and watch the \"penny drop\" when they realize what breast cancer really is. Everyone once in a while I will dream about my breasts and how sexy they were. I asked my surgeon where those wonderful nerves that used to be attached to my nipples went. He told me to have fun looking for them.... The only time I cried was when I had to climb onto the operating table. The staff were surprised....like, duh! I had to get an excision revision a couple of months later for excess skin and was telling the surgical team how well I was doing. I had just said \"breasts aren't very important after all\" when another doctor entered the room and said \"breasts are VERY important\"! They slapped the gas over my face before I could start laughing. I'm sure he got shit from the team for such a stupid remark. LOL",

I think a 3-day program would actually give you LESS stress than going back full-time so that's a no-brainer. I know you will have to learn new things anyway, so the new position is just the same as going what to what you used to know. The pay being the same for less time worked is easy to swallow. It's the fear of getting sicker that scares you. That scares everyone at every stage. Even people without cancer worry sometimes. You are not marrying this job, you are only performing it. Even actors have \"seconds, or stand-ins\" in case they are ill. It is a fact of life. You would be part of a team again and that team would have to pull your weight if needed. If the contract is only for one year that is not a long committment. If anything came up, you focus on the new health issue as aggressively as you did the last one, then back to work, if and when you want. This is about YOU, not about fulfilling a contract.

There is no point wasting your insurance dollars if you have no intention of taking Tamoxifen. And yes! Even Stage 0 can get to mets. Last year on this board we lost a wonderfully talented artist from South Africa who started out with DCIS. I needed to get back to work as fast as I could as I am the sole bread winner in my house. I had a double mast without reconstruction and took off between Christmas and New Years in 2008/09. There is much less residual or ongoing pain without reconstruction. I do not know what PMPS is, but as for RSD I can't find anything on staging, that is new to me. I have Fibromyalgia and that was my fear - ongoing pain. Some women who have reconstructed with FM have had to get their implants out due to constant pain. I made sure I stayed on top of my pain but left the hospital without even Tylenol 3's. A mast doesn't touch bones, organs or muscles so there is very little pain. When you start putting in TE's and bringing tissue from other areas of your body you will be in more pain. I now have Costochondritis which is a result of the surgery, but at least I'm alive.",

I have had over a dozen family members die of cancer and have watched this disease go through pretty much every body part a human has. I never pretend to know how you feel. I hope you have never thought I was so presumptive! We all need our time to crash and burn every once in a while. This is a good, safe place to vent and rage. I tend to form my responses based on the post. Do you want a spritual response? I will respond as such. Do you just need a hug? I've got one for you. I don't respond, though I do read, a lot of threads that I just keep my mouth shut on. I respect the issues that are being faced by the poster and unless I have a connection, I will not add my own feelings. I responded to this one as Elizabeth and I go back quite a number of months and I'm waiting for her to come back to Canada. How do I find these threads? Some of my best \"friends\" on this site are Stage IV and I always check the \"Active Topics\" to see what's happening. I have cried for a number of sisters since I've been on here and have watched others pass in silence, knowing my words would mean nothing. But, I do have an interesting observation to make, one that I have felt since my diagnosis, and strangely before. Recently I was with about 9 other bc ladies (HATE the word survivor, and bootface, by the way) and I asked, \"Do you feel you will die of breast cancer.\" To the last person, we all said YES. None of us were an advanced stage. Interesting, I am not paranoid. I know I could never mention that on any other post but one like this as newbies would freak out. I do not read these threads to be morbid or to show pity, but to learn. It takes a lot of guts to spread your soul out for everyone to see and I respect that. ",

My mammo was Oct 1st and my diagnosis was Dec 10th of 2008. I had a doulble mast Dec 16th. There's a lot of time to think carefully now, so take the time to do research. You might make a rash decision if you go forward in panic mode, so slow down. There is no reason to believe that they would \"go for mastectomy\" anyway. A 3 cm mass might turn out to be a 1 cm tumour surrounded by pissed off cells! They need to see your scans and do their own assessment before they would consider a biopsy. Be glad that you are moving forward to a cancer centre and not being told to wait 3-6 months then go back! Keep posting on this thread so we can follow your news. Don't keep making up new threads or we'll lose you and you'll think no one cares! You'll get the same advice no matter where you post, we have walked this road before you..... Good luck.",

I think they have to be cautious when there is not exactly a diagnosis to provide and that could be why they say \"suggestive' meaning they didn't actually see a fibroadenoma, but the cells were building up into that pattern. 4 samples is more than enough to test, they may have divided 2 of them to create 6 or they just fell apart. I just had a biopsy with only one sample and I'm sort of deep down questioning it as you are. Mine said 'suboptimal sample' which to me means they didn't have enough to test. But, I'm going with no sign of cancer and running with it. What you saw on the ultrsound screen (if you did) seems very big, but if you consider how fine the needle is that is going into it, you realize how small the tumour really is. So even if they missed it this time, if it was cancer, it is way too small to count. Your body may even take care of it for you. Our immune systems are pretty good for things like that. That's why you'll hear of someone having their cancer disappear. It is SO scary once you start the googling and discussion forums and realize that it is all so very real. There are SO many women with breast cancer, but treatments are getting more accurate as time goes on. You may have another biopsy or two in the future if your breasts seem to be the kind that 'grow things', so you'll get used to the wordage. Next time you may see 'benign fibroadenoma' and know that it is all good. Good luck, sweetie!",

The bigger the cyst or fibroadenoma, the more odds it's not cancer. The fact that it fluctuates with your period (the hormones!) is another way to tell it's a cyst. But, sometimes large cysts have cancer in the centre. The cyst is the body's way of trying to enclose it. If it really bugs you and insurance will pay, get it out. But you will have a scar and it's under general anaesthetic. The divot caused by the surgery will eventually fill in so you aren't misshapen. If you read the bottom of a lot of the posts, you'll see that most ladies are dealing with tumours of ONE cm or less. That is the size of your baby fingernail.",

I'm glad I did as now my \"big guns\" are really little guns at this point. I still have the big guns available to me. I have a cancer that is less than 2% of all breast cancers - Papillary. There was so little known about it in 2008 that my surgeon Googled it and there were only 3 posts - all on the same woman. We treated it as IDC and as it was ER+ and slow growing, knew chemo wouldn't work anyway so I didn't even consider it. Now there are all kinds of tests to see if chemo will help someone! Just 7 short years ago it was an automatic chemo/rads combo. Then Tamoxifen for 5, now 10 years. So I would be off Tamoxifen now anyway. Would my cancer have recurred? I dunno. Would the chemo and/or rads done worse damage to my system? Maybe. I'm the one famous around here for saying your odds are either 100% or 0%. I mentioned it back in 2008 and got jumped all over for saying it that way, but it's true! You either recur or you don't. You either make it, or you don't. I know women who started with DCIS who are no longer with us here, and ones that have been stage IV the entire time I've been here! So there's your logic.",

I woke from a morphine induced nap to find a tech about to do a blood draw on my left arm and snatched my arm away so fast I scared him! hehehehe My right arm did swell a lot, but I'm hoping it was just from over-use and will settle down.

You will probably get more mammos and ultrasounds than you want, and then a possible biopsy to see what you're growing. It takes normal breast cancer 180 days to double in size. That's 6 months. If you're growing that fast it's probably a fluid filled cyst. I had 4 biopsy and cyst removals before I was finally diagnosed with breast cancer at 50. My first cyst was removed at 21. I went through 29 years of abnormal mammos and biopsies and cyst removals and more testing....I get what you're saying. If you recently had surgery, you must make sure the area in your breast isn't infected now by bacteria that could be going through your system. So, you do need to get it checked, just not in a panic.

I had to take 2 1/2 weeks off as one of my drains had to stay in 22 days and I went to work right from the surgeon's office. I didn't mind going to work with no breasts, but didn't want to go with a drain. Go figure. The nerves settled down beautifully and the itching stopped. Now there is quite a tight feeling as if there isn't enough skin to stretch across. I have had cream rubbed into the incision every night since my steri strips came off to try to keep the area supple. I have started to exercise with a large elastic strip to build back muscle, so I guess it's working the area. I don't need further treatment as mastectomy was my best option. I opted for a double so I didn't have to get recon or wear foobies. I am quite happy flat after years of 42Ds and everyone at work thinks I'm so brave... I was off through Christmas and New Year's where I got 3 days stat holiday pay and I had 5 days of sick days for the year, so that all helped. Keep us posted on your surgery dates! ",

I have fibromyalgia which intensifies pain so badly that they usually start giving me pain meds before they even cut me open. I was stunned by how little it hurt! Even my surgeon admitted it is really a deep skin cut. There are no organs, bones or really any nerves involved. I had a reduction years ago that was quite painful as they have to sew the aureola back on! Even my hysterectomy was bad. This is no where near what I expected. Trust me. I wore a soft tank shirt to the hospital with a zip up hoodie with pockets. The pockets are great to put the drains in without having to worry about pins. Pull up pants and slippers I can slip into, not have to use hands to put on. I was worried about sleeping too, as I had both breasts off. I just put an extra pillow under me in bed and propped up one side with a body pillow. I slept like a log, probably because the stress of waiting was over! Leaning back to reach the pillow may require help at first, but getting up is easier if you roll to the side to get off the bed. As no abdominal muscles are involved in the surgery, feel free to flex those abs!  Don't just worry about reaching up. I try not to reach higher than my shoulder and haven't felt the pinch since I learned that. Your sutures will be different and I had a sentinel node biopsy as well. Worry a little bit about bending over searching for something you stored low. You will feel pressure and possibly pain build up in your chest. Keep stuff at counter height and put a TV tray by your bed so you don't have to reach back for your night table. Magazines are easier to concentrate on in the hospital and you may want candy or something to suck to keep your throat moist. Your throat will be tender from the intubation and ice is wonderful to have access to.  I found getting \"dressed\" everyday has helped me feel not so \"sick\". That only means putting the same hoodie back on and slipping up my pants, but it does feel better than pj's. Tomorrow I am having my husband wash my hair over the kitchen sink. I haven't had a shower since last Tuesday and even the home nurses say not to put your body through that kind of stress. A warm facecloth can reach anywhere you want! I am worried about the one above who mentioned a tight chest. You will get that feeling, especially when the wound starts to heal. Itchy too! The drains are the biggest hassle though. Be prepared. ",

I was not surprised to get the word as I had NEVER had a mammo in 30 years that I didn't get a call-back for!! The mast is an easy surgery, no bones, organs or muscles involved, but, if you're going for reconstruction, that is a painful and long journey. Be careful what you wish for! I stay flat all the time and I enjoy it after years of heavy 42Ds AFTER a reduction.  Are you going to attempt reconstruction? Would you go bigger?",

There is so much noise there and even though I was semi-private, my roommate would talk on the phone or use her TV and that was annoying enough until I found out she snored at night! The ear plugs kept me safe and soundless in my own little world and my IV bag would get changed at night without even waking me up! These are not swimmers ear plugs, they are like dense sponges that you twist up then put in your ears and let them expand into the space of your ear. I let my roommate know I was using them at night and sometimes through the day to nap. That kept her from trying to chat. She was in for a rotator cuff and not very sympathetic to my breast cancer cause!",

It is just my  humble opinion, but I was very pleased with how quickly I got back in the game. I had to get back to work as quickly as possible as I am in commission sales and in this economy....hey, need I say more? I only had 3 weeks off and am doing great. If you get reconstruction I know the surgery is longer (twice under for that long!) and your recovery is longer as well. I wish you both only good things.",

My breasts were tender at most times, not just around my period, which is normal. Have you started your period yet? It is very, very common for your breasts to be tender at your period time. If you haven't started you periods yet, perhaps this is a sign that you are about to! Cysts are also very common and I had 3 removed and/or drained; the first one at 21 years old. Lumps are scary and your mind probably has trouble thinking about anything else. Why don't you get it checked out before school starts back, so you can start with a clear mind? As a Mom, if my daughter had come up to me and said, \"Gee, Mom, I seem to have a lump or two in my breasts. I'm too shy to show you (or not), but can we have a doctor look at them?\" That wouldn't offend me at all, as I always taught my kids to respect body-privacy areas. My daughter did tell me that she had sore breasts when she was about 14, but I was able to tell her that was normal.  You will feel much better if someone besides yourself takes a look. No one but a professional can assure you of anything though, not even your best friend, but sometimes fear shared is fear divided. Good luck sweetie! Keep us posted here so we know how you're doing.

While you were mentioning your Mom and thyroid cancer, I knew there had to be another primary as thyroid cancer can only grow in the thyroid and not spread. Sorry to hear it was her lungs. I'm very surprised that you got the gene results so fast!!!! Microcalcs aren't usually IDC, are you sure they didn't say DCIS? Of course you are nervous and anxious, that's perfectly normal and gives you the momentum to get something done about any diagnosis you get. You are now in \"fight\" mode and that is good.

      "Content": "Nov 10, 2008 04:50AM barbe1958 wrote: Well, then, let me tell you. I have had lumpectomies in the past and last year's mammogram in August showed two areas of concern that they then decided would be okay. Then in May of this year I noticed rusty spots in my brassiere. I normally wear a dark bra and this day it was a light one. Checked for scratches but found none, then promptly forgot about it. I had been experiencing weird chest pains on my left side so bad that I had an angiogram in September of 2007. Then 2 week Holter monitors in May of 2008. Nothing showed up, but with my history of high blood pressure (on meds for 15 years) they had to watch it. Finally in June of this year I thought, hey, I wonder if the chest pain could be breast? As I had just turned 50, I was allowed to book my own mammo. I called in early June and was given October 1st as the first appointment. It was done that quickly because I had suspicious results before. (That's quick!) On October 1st, I sat in front of the mirror with the breast specialist and when I took off my bra I looked down and noticed dark blood coming out of my left nipple! Boy what a shock that was. Right in the imaging department! I was understandable upset and the lady tried to reassure me. When I got to the mammo I was worried about the procedure as a number of years ago a mammo had burst one of my cysts and I had to have surgery to clean it up. On this day, the technician was very blase about the whole thing until blood started to run onto the panels of the machine. She was visibly upset and told me to expect a call for an MRI. So I waited. Finally got a call 5 days later to come in for an ULTRASOUND! I tried to tell the girl it was supposed to be an MRI but she insisted it was for US. It was for the 8th of October. I missed even more work as I went to that appointment. During the test the tech mentioned that my mammo was fine and bleeding could be just anyting. Right, I knew from reading that a unilateral bleeding could only be cancer or papiloma. She called in the radiologist who wanted to see if I could express the blood. So far it had only been spontaneous, I couldn't bring it on and wasn't able to that day. She took my breast and made me bleed, looked up at the tech and said, oh,yes, this is definitely an MRI. The tech took me to booking and tried to give me a November date but I asked for earlier. She looked down at the paperwork and gave me a 2 week later appointment. I went to the MRI and they took the requisite pictures, me missing even more of work, as I work an hour away so I can't go to work, come back for my appointment, return to work and the drive home at the end of the day (4 hours of driving in a 8 hour day?) Surprise! I got a call from my doctor's office (who didn't even know I was going through this as I had booked my own mammo), that the hospital wanted me to go in for a mammo and and US. On my RIGHT breast. ?. I told Sharon that I had just had both and then an MRI on top of that and what the hell!? She said she'd call the hospital and get back to me. Next day she did. They wanted to see me on November 3rd. Just over 1 month from the first appointment. Well, the waiting was hell. I went in for the mammo and the tech was very flippant about the bleeding and only took pictures of my right breast. Told me she would take me up to US and that the left breast was fine (remember, this is the one that is bleeding!). Got my husband and up we went to US. She told me they wouldn't be ultrasounding my left breast and left us waiting. About 5 minutes later she came back in and knelt (!) in front of me and took my hands and told me that yes, they would US my left breast. Then she wished me luck and left. WOW. Went in for the US and they skipped pretty fast over the right breast and into the left. I told the tech I wanted her to find a papiloma. Then I saw a very dark gray area and said maybe that was a papiloma. She got pretty quiet and left to take the pictures to the radiologist. Came back and said they wanted to do a core biopsy right now. On my left breast. Thank God! I told her to go tell my husband and to make sure he knew it was the left breast. The doctor came in and took 3 samples. The bruising is amazing and I expect to hear today (one week later) what the result is. Maybe the roller coaster is finally smoothing out. You have to be your own advocate. Good luck to all! ",

It was so surreal! When we tried to make love one last time, my cancer side nipple bled so it kind of freaked us out. I was very strong and didn't break down even when I hugged my DH (dear husband) good-bye before walking into the OR. In Canada, we walk in and get up on the table ourselves! You feel more in control, I guess, but I would have liked a sedative! When they strapped me down I started to panic a bit, thinking \"this is it!\". I started to cry a little and a nurse said \"What's the matter?\" She was very sweet and I told her I was scared. She held my hand and the anaesthesiolgist put his hand on my head and held me until I went under. I will NEVER forget that feeling of being protected and that was a year ago! I chose not to do recon because of the lengthy surgery and recovery. I have other health issues and I had to get back to work fast. Also, my breasts were more of a sex turn on for me! My DH loves my whole body, while I thought of my breasts as the biggie. I'd had a reduction years ago to bring me down to a 42D and the new breasts never really felt like mine. I was worried I'd go through all that surgery to feel the same way. I'm 51 though, and I've nursed two babies (now 28 and 26 and both married!) I wear my flat chest with pride, like a shield of honour. I beat breast cancer! I think of the cancer a lot still. My flat chest I see twice a day while getting dressed/undressed or when I notice someone looking at it. It's interesting to see \"the penny drop\" as they figure out what must have happened. I've even strolled around a pool for a week at a 5-star resort like I had the 2 best ones out there! I do not feel that my missing curves makes me any less of a woman, and have been told in some ways that my confidence has made me sexier. Go figure!",

Even THEY said to not bash someone who's ideas aren't the same as yours - ME!!!! Why has this become such an active thread for such a simple OP???? Josi has the right to her feelings. Period. So do I.  Period. I learned a lot from Elizabeth (Konkat) before she died and I will carry her life lessons to my own grave. She was an outspoken and strong personality, and she shot straight from the hip. She told me that I was her soul sister and not to falter in my life beliefs.

You either recur, or you don't. It's a simple as that. But be gentle with others with a lesser diagnosis as they haven't been treated as aggressively as you. Also, an awful lot of woman with only Stage 0 have to get mastectomies!!! I see more mastectomies with DCIS than I do with any other kind. I've been on the board over 3 years and have seen a LOT of Stage 1 and 2 gals jump into the Stage 4 venue. It can happen to ANY of us. We are ALL just one test result away from stage 4. You normally never have to worry about what you post in any forum. But, most ladies check the Active Topics list and all sections come up. That is why you'll find other stages responding to your thread. I'll say, I'd rather be Stage 3, grade 1, than Stage 1, grade 3!! It's the grade that shows the aggression of the cancer. The stage is only used for your treatment plan. Can you imagine one of your kids getting diagnosed with cancer and you tell some friends and one of them says \"Big deal, my kid has a higher stage than yours!\" Just hearing the word 'cancer' in the same sentence as our own names is enough stress for most of us. Stage and grade at that point don't even matter. Cancer makes it a level playing field. Good luck, sweetie!!",

Breast cancer is not curable for ANY OF US. Those of you who got aggressive treatment have a better shot at staying cancer free than those of us who ONLY got a double mastectomy.

I don't think I'd make that my only parameter on why not to do reconstruction. I chose not to as I don't want the extra surgery with time off, as well as the pain.

I never got to the sobbing point as I've had 3 other biopsies and lumps removed in the past so I've been expecting the other shoe to drop for a long time. I, too, am incredulous that you can get an immediate diagnosis. The cells have to be stained and everything, don't they? I got my diagnosis in person with my DH beside me, then I drove to work alone and told everyone I met. It helped to say it outloud a lot, kind of gets it out of your system. I stayed calm and so everyone else did too. I didn't even cry going into the OR for my mastectomies when I had to say \"good-bye\" to my DH. I did cry though, when they strapped me down. Someone held my hand and the anaesthetist kept his hand on my head while I went under. That's the last crying I did. I think as women, we stay strangely calm during crisises and we do need to vent at some point. That's why it's best to let out whatever you need to in a safe environment. Here is safe. You've come to the right place. We are all here for you. Please update us on this thread so we know how you are doing. Hugs",

You have to look to see where the venting is for drying on the inside and make sure you do NOT put a plate up against it. That is one of the problems. The vent is where 99% of us would put a large platter or cutting board and it blocks the vent when you push the rack in and your dishes won't dry properly. Also, take your dish in to the store when you pick your model as the racks are very tight!! They CAN do tons of dishes, but your dishes have to fit between the tines. READ THE MANUAL. Bosch is European so they don't necessarily plan things the way we North Americans do. If you can afford it, go for the model with TWO cutlery baskets. Ours only has one (we wanted a black model) and it fills up quick. Our plates are jammed together and it cleans them EVERY time!! The noises you hear with your top load washer is the gears engaging. It is a strong machine (good choice!) so the action sounds loud. Also, on the dishwasher, Bosch is the quietest out there but it is all relevant. They have inuslation on the back which most units don't so they are good for an island. BUT, because they are a strong machine, again, the gears engaging seem loud. I hear my Bosch where I didn't hear my cheap model. But...only when the gears engage. Not too bad. Use Finish and make sure you always have a blue rinse agent in. The machines are MADE to use the rinse agent, so not using it leaves out part of the equation. When I see that my machine is in \"dry\" mode, I'll open the door about 6\" and let it air dry. Finish is THE best out there, expensive but truly the best.",

I had them integrated before (accessible only when the door is ajar) but find those ones have fewer options as the space is restricted. It's true about the size of the Bosch. On my cheap dishwasher, I could fit 5 coffee cups along the top. This one only holds 4 and a bit. What do I put in the \"bit\"??? The shallowness allows for some of the technology the machine has. For instance, it has a triple-filtration system. Big deal? YEP!!! It checks the water to see it it's clear enough for a final rinse. So no matter what you set it at, it will over-ride it if the water that is checked shows otherwise.  Kira, the plate tines are close together for a reason. The Bosch CAN clean plates that seem too close. Hard to believe, but I've challenged mine and it came through. Next appliance??",

The most of any manufacturer (and even more if you count what they make for other companies). When you get over $1,000 or so, then you get the second cutlery basket. BUT, where that basket goes, you lose loading room for something else. We have learned to put our cutlery stem side down (I hate doing that) and it all fits. Never had a mark on any spoons either!",

      "Content": "Dec 31, 2010 11:58AM - edited Dec 31, 2010 11:59AM by barbe1958 Last night I had my first negative dream about my breasts. I was in a beginning relationship with a younger man and had the interest of a second gentleman as well. The first guy realized he couldn't handle my scarred flat chest and said he would have been okay with a scarred \"fake\" chest! I was devastated and turned to the other suitor. He too backed out and I went to my younger brother to try to undertand. I showed my younger brother my chest (this is all in my dream of course!) and he understood the younger guys' repulsiveness! I woke up with a very heavy heart \"hearing\" him saying \"It DOES matter!\" So sad. I'm 52. Do I really need new breasts? My DH is 60, what if something happened to him? Would I want a sexual relationship with someone else? Really makes me think if it was just the immaturity of the younger guys (who in my dream I had warned!).....sigh. It's been eating away at me for the past 4 hours......",

I seemed to have little blow-up forms underneath my t-shirt and my Mom (who is dead in real life) was doing the fills!!! I had little tubes hanging down from each foob like the ones on a blow-up toy. I recall very clearly looking down at the trim shape that was beginning to show and remember touching the shape and admiring them!! What would Freud say????",

Doctor told me if it was cancer and that big I'd already be dead! Even if your lump is cancerous, the cancer grows in our breasts for as long as 10 years before it can be felt. That's probably why the doctors are blowing you off, it would mean you got cancer at 14.... You will learn here that we have to be our own health advocates. Next time a doctor gets snotty, ask him/her what they would do if you were THEIR daughter? Hmmmmmmmmm? Makes a difference, eh? ",

We all freak out at every new ache, no matter what stage we are. The stage IV gals freak out just as much as the stage 0 DCIS ones do. One of the toughest things my onc said to me (besides saying that I had \"slipped between the cracks\" -her words!) was that if I get mets, the speed at which they are diagnosed has no bearing on the treatment or survival rate. She actually said \"It doesn't make a difference.\" Now, I beg to differ on something like brain mets, wouldn't you??? But bone mets you may not know for years and as some oncs say, it's almost better that you don't know until you are symptomatic, which is why a lot of docs don't do screening tests, but only upon symptoms.",

You proved my point in your previous lengthy post about how and why early stages seem to recur more. Same as Elizabeth said - there are more early stagers to recur. So both of you agreed with me yet continue to say what I'm saying is wrong! I don't get it. Is everyone going to jump on Karen for saying her odds are 100%??? That she \"either gets mets or not\"?  How about ali68's comment about \"if you can't deal with people who have a lower stage then to be honest you have not come to termis with Cancer and I really feel for you\".

It's true that your body reacts differently when you are really in pain rather than just trying to get high. You have to stay on top of your pain to keep it under control so it's a fine balance. When I start to feel good for a couple days I reduce the break-through pain meds, oxycodone, but then find I work back up to even higher pain levels. It's a very fine line. I take oxymorphone twice a day and use the codone for break-through pain. Most people would be stoned out of their mind on the meds I take, but I only get a gentle \"reminder\" that I have taken one. It's like a feeling of relief that the med is starting to work. I drive 2 hours a day on my work commute and I guess legally if I got in an accident I could be charged if they tested me, but no one knows how much I'm on except my docs (and now y'all). My next step is methadone and I know I can't drive with that.  As long as you can function normally, you will not get addicted. It's when you lose interest in other things, like your personal grooming for example, that red flags should go up. We have the rights as humans to be pain free and we have the technology.",

I had NO chemo, NO rads, NO AI's and NO Tamoxifen or other treatment. NO onc. I finally got one 9 months after diagnosis. She even said that I seemd to \"fall between the cracks\". It was too late at that point for any further treatment. I am at a watch and wait. I've had 2 biospies for enlarged nodes in my neck and am getting surgery on Feb 6th to take out the large tumour that is in there with them. So, have I had is EASY? NO!!!!! I had a double mast and now a couple years of fear. I honor and respect ALL sisters with breast cancer, not just the ones that think they had it the hardest!! More stage 0 ladies get masts than stage 4. Why does no one acknowledge that? Some stage 3 keep their breasts and then are surprised when they get a local recurrence. Why are you surprised? You kept your breast!! So when you do have to get a mastectomy, maybe you won't mind when \"some stage 0\" pipes in on the surgery thread to HELP you with your mast!! Now my back is up.

There are more early stages diagnosed, so it makes sense that more early stages recur compared to stage 3. I was thrilled to see that point by Elizabeth because it confirms what I have OBSERVED on these boards for the past 3+ years. Also, there hasn't been hundreds of thousands of statistics (real ones!!) to base any firm stats on. Stats are just like betting or spinning a slot machine. They start new with every diagnosis. You admitted you had to \"pull your numbers from the air\" so that kind of proves my point. Not enough info being considered quickly enough to make stats more definite. With Herceptin in the past 5 years, any stats made before then are outdated already.  I use the 50% only because it makes it all simpler. If we just had a 3% risk (pulling a \"number from the air\"), why would anyone bother with chemo, rads or AI's that change your life and give you OTHER diseases to deal with?? I wouldn't risk my heart or lung function over a 0-30% risk factor and I'm sure most women wouldn't. Who would be foolish enough to risk a more important organ of their body?? ",

They often have to come out as they can grow large enough to hurt or cause nerve symptoms which may be what you are experiencing. 30 years ago I had a lump that grew so large my surgeon said if it was cancer I would already be dead!! The sugar drop is probably from adrenaline as your mind tries to deal with the panic you are rightly feeling. Don't let anyone deny you your emotions, but do know that, again, 80% of lumps are not cancer. Be reassured that by the very volume of people on this site alone (over 47,000) that there are an awful lot of us walking around with breast cancer that you didn't even know about! We work, we go to school, we shop, we laugh, we pass you in the streets. We are alive! I had to wait 4 months for a \"rush\" mammogram. If your lump is cancer, it has been in your body as long as 8-10 years already! Don't let the stress of worry kill your joy of today. I know, easier said than done! But once you have the mammo, the waiting for the results is even harder.. Good luck to you. You are in my thoughts. ",

Kmmd is right about who you tell until you have treatment in place, then ignore everyone else and focus on your team. I had someone phone me the day before my mastectomy and tell me that if I had taken apricot seeds when he told me to the month before, I wouldn't have to have surgery, my tumour would be gone! Oh, thanks, buddy.  You are in the right place at the right time. Now, take a deep breath and welcome to the rest of your life... ",

Shame on the doctor who told the lady above that she'd be out of her mind with pain! There is no bone, muscle or organs involved. The biggest hassle is the drains. I only wanted to deal with them ONCE. The second hassle is the itching as the nerve ends regenerated. Some people stay on heavy pain meds for too long and get very lethargic and depressed (and constipated!). I left the hospital without even Tylenol. Is is SO doable! The anaesthetic is something you have to get over whether you had a lumpectomy or mastectomy. It does take a toll on your body. Now, reconstruction on the other hand, is another issue! I chose not to reconstruct so I could get back to work as quickly as possible. 2 1/2 weeks after surgery, the day my last drain came out I drove my hour to work.  I didn't want to put something ONTO my body that wasn't mine. Kind of a different kind of thinking than those that don't want to remove something that isn't \"sick\".... I also didn't want to put my body through the tedious reconstruction process. Mantra, the tumour board at RVH will have to approve your double mast anyway. If they do approve it, you know you did the right thing. Did you want to meet up?",

If the IDC had good margins that's great. As for the DCIS...I'm a bit confused, how could DCIS within a duct have close margins to tissue left behind? Did the duct get severed? Or was the duct that was taken out so close to the margin? Think of slicing moldy cheese. You can get the mold off the surface, but you don't know if spores are left behind. That's kind of the IDC analogy. But now think of a pot of spaghetti. If you take all the spaghetti out (ducts), what's left behind? I hope you don't think I'm taking your question lightly, but the fact that two doctors have said no means a lot. I just finished radiation for stage IV cancer and it's not an easy treatment. I didn't get radiation after my initial double mastectomy but who knows if it would have kept me from progressing. I got 7 years with no treatment except surgery. That's pretty good. If I'd done chemo and rads I would be just as happy getting 7 years. Breast cancer is so unpredictable there is no way of knowing for sure what is right. Go with your gut and take in the information the doctors have given you. Tamoxifen is a VERY powerful drug and is given to women who progress with more serious breast cancer with mets to the lung and brain and effectively stops the growth. So if your wife has any cells left behind, Tamoxifen should kill them off, if she's ER+. Because I didn't have chemo initially, I can take Arimidex (like Tamoxifen but after menopause) without having to go to harder chemos. My oncologists hope to get one to two years out of it before I progress. At that point I'll have to move on to IV chemos. See, even they don't know what will happen! Some people go for second opinions, and third opinions etc, until they get someone to agree with them. Make sure that isn't your intent. Good luck and I hope someone else pops by.....",

I find that when I am really bad I catch myself holding my breath. So when the others above mention breathing, it is a fact. I don't know if you have kids, but think about labour. If you breathe with your pain and do some visualizations (I think of myself going \"over\" my pain to push it down) it can help control the panic of \"just how friggin' bad is this going to get?\" Also, the renewed oxygen to your body helps feed your muscles to support your body as best it can. I find when someone catches me in tears, if I just say I have a \"bad back\" they can relate. I mean really, there's no blood or guts running off me, but I truly feel like I could pass out from the pain. Then there are the days that I pray I would pass out. I find the use of a cane or walker gives my bones the needed assistance. It's hard to admit you need them, and I'm in sales in front of the public so it can be off-putting, but I can't survive without the extra support.

Either way, the breast cancer can't progress. I've seen women here with brain mets and the lesions disappear after being on Tamoxifen, so it's pretty powerful stuff. Your wife's cancer would have to be ER+ for Tamoxifen to be effective and there is a test she can take when she's been on it for a bit that will tell if her body is using the drug properly. She can also stay on it for more than 5 years - in fact, 10 years is more common now. I will be on Arimidex for life, or until it stops working for me. There are side effects, of course, and she may find it hard to handle, but her body will adjust at some point, so you both have to be patient. The loss of hormones to her body is very difficult, it's like menopause...or think 24/7 PMSing!! Keep us posted on anything else you learn. ",

Someone posting and then being given \"cyber hugs\" is all very well and good, but I find someone's experience in the same matter very valuable! Let's talk about drains. Someone posts that she thinks hers are draining too much. So we're just supposed to say \"oh dear, hope you feel better\"?. I don't think so. IMHO, I think when people respond with different experiences it helps the poster figure out if there is something wrong there or not. I have learned so much by cruising all the threads. I learned my lump after surgery was a seroma. I got it drained. I learned I needed a bone scan. I got one. I learned what lymphadema was so when I was sent to a PT appointment I wasn't confused or scared. I learned how to let people around me help me by letting them know what I needed. I learned a lot and still learn every day. There are posts that are very factual. That's nice; a lot of that I've already googled myself. There are posts that are very exacting on what they need \"Help! I need advice!\" and others that need specifics \"Lumpectomy or Mastectomy?\". Those kind of posts are asking for experiences and points and feedback. We can all research to our hearts content but then reach a point where we need to hear from someone who has already gone through what we are facing. People aren't giving opinions, just experiences. I think there is a lot of empathy and sympathy on this board. I don't let isolated incidents skew my feelings about what this board is for - support. I'm sure I've pissed off a number of people as I have so many posts (games, games, games!) but I have learned by doing that. The PM option is a wonderful tool as well. The one thing no one wants is pity, which is why people posting on the stage IV boards are sometimes jumped on, and I don't blame the jumpers. Common courtesy isn't so commom. Either is common sense.",

My \"beef\" is with the lecturing of some posters that we are here to support but not comment or give our experiences or advice. That is just so silly! As I said earlier, it is those experiences that make this such a rich board of information. I may have over reacted yesterday as I do get angry when \"told\"how to feel or react. As others have said after my posts, stage 0-3 really shouldn't make a difference in sharing information. It is the mis-information that hurts some that is dangerous. I give these ladies a lot more credit for doing a bit more research than to think we have to stop all cross-stage posts. For those that don't know, search \"papillary carcinoma\" on this very website. It is to be treated as IDC. When I was first diagnosed there was no information anyway on my type of cancer. My surgeon showed up in the operating room with pages of what he was able to get of a medical subscription website that he belongs to! No one knew what to do with me. My tumour was on my chest wall right over my heart. Radiation was not an option for both heart and lungs issues. Chemo, not an option as I'm ER+. Herceptin, nope, I'm HER2-. I'm post menopausal as well...sigh. My surgeon said to \"save the big guns till next time\". That's why I have an issue on staging. I had 2 nodes with microinvasion but no further treatment. Some people do, some don't. Some people throw everything at it, some take risk into consideration, but, the big point is, we are ALL cursed with the same disease. Breast cancer. Some are just further along the road than others. God bless you all, and again I apologize for my childish behaviour.",

So....I dunno, but like you, I build all sorts of scenarios in my mind to explain things.

I have/had micromets in my nodes too and was told they don't count, either. So that is good that your docs have confirmed that. Nodes with cancer at time of diagnosis are used for staging, but are not considered mets. If you found cancer in your nodes later, then you have progression. The fact that you've had 2 bone biopsies come back benign is very good news! Take that and run with it!! They are treating you nice and aggressively, but until confirmation, I'd say you can play in the Stage IIB threads for a while longer yet! Congrats!!",

But they discovered an enzyme \"P\" in our systems that does not shut off pain sensors. If someone normal touches something hot, they say OW and remove their hand. We say OW, OW, OW and have pain for much longer. It is real. Your onc is a specialist in his field and can't be expected to know everything. Even for surgeries, when I mention the FM I am treated much more aggressively for pain. I am given pain meds before they even start as once the pain is over the top you can't get it back down again. It is finally recognized in the past 10 years or so as a serious disorder. As for your feet, not FM related. I used to stand a lot and was so bad once that I said it was like walking on pencils. The foot doctor was stunned to see that all my metacarpal bones had collapsed! I was literally walking on my bones! He couldn't understand how I had kept walking, but once you get used to being in pain you learn to keep going. Get it checked out. I had to get inserts for my shoes!",

Sunnyone - please, please please do me a favour. Don't use the word \"cured\" when talking about breast cancer. There is NO cure for breast cancer, only the hope of becoming NED (no evidence of disease) for as long as you can. Look how many \"Run for the Cure\" races there are around the world.... It is deceiving to use the word cured and sets people up for unreal expectations for the future. Yes, we all know someone who had breast cancer and died of something else. Like someone with heart disease being hit by a truck. They didn't die of their serious disease, but of something else..

The reason for the number of zaps is due to the \"life cycle\" of the cancer and them wanting to destroy any growth as/if it occurs. I asked. Stopping for 5 days is scary, but hey! I had to not come in on Good Friday at Easter. The cells would be zapped again when I went back 3 days later.... I do want to add for anyone new here: Aloe of ANY kind is \"just to soothe\" the skin and not moisturize!! In fact, it will dry out your skin. You must, must, must moisturize heavily with a quality product. I'm getting 9,500 gys and the \"normal\" is 5-6,000. They kept warning me that I was going to have bad skin damage. I have 7 zaps left and I know it gets worse before it begins to heal, but my skin is just tanned. Not even red. I started to get itchy and immediately got a prescription of hydrocortisone and my skin is not itchy anymore. I'm pleased to say the least and hope I didn't just jinx myself! I had a new tech this morning and she was amazed at my skin. I told her I wasn't bathing every day and was using Glaxol Base. She gave me a thumbs up and said \"I can't believe years ago we told people to use Aloe and cornstarch!\" I see both mentioned above in the TIPS and am worried for others. Perhaps that is \"old\" thinking???? My heart goes out to those of you with breasts still as I can imagine heat is trapped under the bra-line and gets irritated under there.

I hear of women saying it takes 1-2 YEARS to complete reconstruction and I just didn't have that down time of repeat surgeries, infections, encapsulations, tatoos, revisions, etc, etc. So I had a double mastectomy and was off work for 2 1/2 weeks. Didn't hurt as much as I was prepared for. As there are no bones, muscles or organs involved, it's really just the wound itself you have to recover from. Good luck in your decision.

I also know women that get them where the side wire under the arm irritates the area. As for the surgeon knowing by touch? Not a chance. BUT, having said that, my first breast lump when I was only 21 was SO big that the surgeon assured me it wasn't breast cancer as I'd have been dead by then (the incision/scar was 4 to 4.5\"). I had two more biopsies over the years until a final one showing cancer.  There is a saying - the best lump is a lump in a jar.",

Having said that, I did touch, feel and look at them a fair bit before they were gone forever. Just before surgery your surgeon will draw all over them with a marker and that kind of violates them too. In the operating room as they were strapping my arms down I started to cry. It was really going to happen! They were very nice to me and someone touched me until I was under. After, I'd get ripples of anxiety go through my body reminding me about the permanence of the surgery. I could be driving, watching TV, anything. I'd get this little \"yikes\" shoot through me. But, I have to tell you, the emotion isn't nearly as bad as hearing CANCER. Without immediate reconstruction (none for me anyway) the healing was ridiculously easy! And with good weather coming up where you can get out and about you will be amazed at how quickly you feel good. Right now, part of what you're feeling is because the CANCER is still in there! It really poisons you....  I am now 3 months out and have absolutely no panic about it all. Just fashion challenges that I have really taken to heart. I find it so important to dress prettier than I did before to difuse the flat chest. It's working and I've never regretted a second of my choice. I'm able to tell people I no longer have cancer in my breasts! ",

I didn't get recon after my double mast and I've shown my scars to women who had \"great surgeons\" and they have said that my scar line is more sublte and clean than theirs is!!! So, my point is that waiting for a superb surgeon probably won't make a difference at this time. If it was heart surgery, now...that's another thing! With the breast, there are no organs, bones or muscles involved so it is pretty simplistic. BUT, having said all that, just what kind of surgery are you waiting for? Lumpectomy? Mastectomy?",

Thank goodness I don't wear a bra (flat from BMX) but have been wearing a cami under everything to keep creams off my clothing. I feel bad for those of you who have to wear bras as I'm sure underwire isn't allowed. Would sports bras work? Hanging in there....barely.

Are you going to take the Tamoxifen? I didn't get anything the first time, so when I recurred 7 years later, I'm put on hormonals (AIs) to start as they can arrest progression!! Easy, peasy. Even the surgeon the first time said to \"keep the big guns until next time\". Well, I don't have to use big guns right now either until if/when Arimidex stops working and I get some sort of progression and then I would go on an IV chemo. If I had taken chemo the first time, I would have to start on an IV chemo this time. This way I take a pill everyday instead of risking damage to my heart, lung and other organs with a harsher chemo. We don't die of breast cancer, we die of the treatment! I didn't even want to get rads this time (didn't the first time either) as it's directly over my heart and lung. Not questioning your decision, just curious.....",

My surgeon went for a triple bypass emergency surgery and I didn't even see an onc for 9 months after surgery (they admit I fell in a crack). Too late to start anything at that point so I just crossed my fingers for the past 7 years. I knew my ER+ tumour was slow growing so didn't feel I needed anything for the first 5 years. I actually saw my onc more often AFTER the 5 year mark. I moved to another area of the Province and saw an onc last May who missed the new growth on the CT I had last May. I didn't know that until the CT this year said \"compared to last CT\". I was FURIOUS!! She only talked about her imminent retirement and didn't lay a hand on me. The tumour grew up between ribs so couldn't be felt at that point but she could have at least look at the bloody CT results! Good luck on your second opinion and I hope you get a solid decision.",

I can't take a chance that it throws me down. My longest time incapacitated was 3 months. I prayed to die during that time as my doctor at that time didn't believe in pain meds and thought it was all in my head. Even the sheets touching my legs was excrutiating! No one who doesn't have it can possibly understand. Doctors are getting much better at pre-treating FM patients. Once I couldn't get out of the recovery room because my blood pressure was too high due to pain. I told them to give me a pain shot but they said that once they did that I would have to stay in recovery for a certain period of time. A vicious circle. You have to stay \"above\" your pain because once you are in pain, it is too late. I was on Oxycodone for 9 months for 3 herniated disks and one bulging one. It was the narcotic equivalent of 25 Percocets a day! (And I continued to work!) They thought I would have to be hospitalized when I finally got off them, but I didn't. Without the pain, I needed need, or want them! Please make sure who ever is treating you is sympathetic to your situation. Best of luck!",

On my days off, I will wake up at 10 am (after going to bed at 9 the night before), have breakfast, do one chore, come home and have a nap until 4 or so. Then back in bed at 9. I have actually used a wheel chair in Costco as I was too exhausted to walk around. My husband just takes one look at me and knows. I can't even get out of the car sometimes and he goes in and does what we need. There have been times in the past that I have crawled to bed on my hands and knees. I was looking for a mother-of-the-bride dress just last month and couldn't even move the dresses aside on the hangers! I had to rest after one or two! Scary stuff...  Fibromyalgia is a very serious disorder and cannot be taken lightly. You get flares just like with MS and lupus. If you don't take care of yourself you can get very, very ill. I was told it was \"all in my head\" for years until my GP (not anymore!) admitted I had FM. I was furious! My quality of life at that point had me in an electric scooter! It took a long time to get my body back into a functioning mode. I had kept pushing and pushing myself until I literally had a physical breakdown. See your doctor if it continues or gets worse. Google fibromyalgia and read up. Good luck!",

Our brains run on chemicals, a fine balance. With all that is going into your system including steroids, it's a wonder you don't feel worse! There are so many anti-depression/anxiety etc, drugs out there, but as one doctor said to me years ago, \"You have the right to be angry!\" That took a lot of guilt off my shoulders, but I still need the Zoloft to give me a reality check. Good luck with your treatments. You are in my prayers tonight. ",

There are many of us out there who are not in the healthcare field and it helps to learn all aspects of our disease. Most of us are searching for info on the diagnosis we are handed rather than the way we got to diagnosis. My mammo said \"worrisome for cancer\" and that is what my tests were based on. By the way, they kept doing tests on my RIGHT breast (probably from the follow-up info stated above) when it was my LEFT breast that had a bleeding nipple. The technologist said they weren't even going to do an ultra sound on my left as they were more concerned with my right due to \"architectural changes\"! Thank god I pushed it. Cancer was in the left! ",

Many, many doctors and techs have scared the living daylights out of us with their 'thoughts' or 'actions' that make us think it's cancer when it's not. Good luck!",

I've seen people mention it on other threads and I shudder. Pathology is the gold standard. I didn't know until 3 weeks after surgery what they had determined and I was happy to wait. They sent it to a larger centre to make sure. I had positive nodes WITHIN the breast tissue they took, but my sentinel was negative and they only did one side which I did question at the time.

As for cancer, if it's breast cancer cells then that is a recurrence but of its ovarian cancer it's not a recurrence it's a new cancer. You were NOT given hormones for your treatment, you actually had hormones stopped for treatment so don't add that fear into the mix. As you get older all sorts of new issues arise that aren't cancer related so glad to see your onc is looking out for you. Please let us know the results and let me be the first to wish you happy birthday for tomorrow!!!",

When the lump comes out, that's when you'll know how big the tumour really is. So she could have a 4 cm lump of cancer inside a 13 cm mass. Did I explain that okay?

I've had injections both ways, too, so I don't read anything into it anymore. I had a bone scan that lasted an hour and twenty minutes!! They actually let me up to go pee. That freaked me out. Then I've had many scans that go in for better shots and the last one this February had me sit on a chair and put my arms and hands on the scan bed!!! I know breast cancer doesn't go down an arm so I figured it was something else. I found out I have arthritis in every joint in my body including fingers and toes!!! I KNEW I was in pain!!! I've had CT's where they say \"that may or may not be real\". Go figure. So a repeat scan will often have a slightly better view and discount the first one. For instance, my last CT showed a thickening in my frontal lobe that may or may not be real. As well, a thickening of my colon which may or may not be real. I just had a colonoscopy to see if the colon issue is \"real\" or not. Oh, what we have to deal with...sigh. We get your fear. Trust me. We've had the other shoe drop and we know it will drop for others. This may sound weird, but I was kind of relieved when my other shoe finally dropped as the 8 years it took to recur were scary ones. Like you're going through right now. I just knew I was going to recur and finally did. It was easier to deal with than I thought. Now I know I'll be watched like a hawk.",

Cancer won't spread into your shoulder as you don't have breast tissue in your shoulder, so you can let that one go.

I am also thrilled to learn about levels of nodes, so if it ever comes back to me I can talk with knowledge. I've heard of some superior centres that have someone check the pathology of nodes during surgery, but my hospital was too small and my surgery too short, only 4 1/2 hours. I guess with reconstruction and the longer process there is time. Also, you had a real centre! My hospital is currently trying to finance a cancer centre. For years I've driven by seeing the banner saying \"Your Future Cancer Centre\" and now it wasn't built in time....sigh.",

Personally, I trust proven medicine but supplement with minerals like Magnesium and vitamins like B12.

It depends where the mets are in your body as to how you can live \"normally\". If brain mets, you'd have different issues than with say, bone mets. We are surviving longer with current meds, but even diseases like diabetes and heart disease cause death still. The body can only take so much of a treatment before it begins to break down and you have new issues. Some chemos cause heart disease for example. Starting new unproven treatments is difficult to accept unless it's a last resort. Doing so is like going back 40 years when it was all experimental. There are now proven treatments but remember, there is no cure for stage IV.",

So, having had a recent surgery and the stress of diagnosis, I wouldn't be surprised if you were a ball of tension right now. See your doc but try for massage, heat/cold, Tylenol, etc before more scans and tests. The benchmark is a two-week window before going to your doctor, so make sure you let him know if it's been that long. Both he and you can monitor symptoms as they arise, it's a team effort, sweetie.",

I saw techs standing around and wondered what they were doing and then I heard a GONG and knew! Someone was finished rads!! To my surprise I burst out sobbing. Not crying. Sobbing. Really surprised my DH and me as I'm not a crier. Wasn't sure where it came from but was glad I was in an appropriate area (not work) when it all hit me. The gong was on the other side of a small divider where my DH was sitting (so neither of us saw the patient. I caught on quickly when hearing the gong and joined the clapping. My DH jumped 2 feet off his chair and then started clapping after we had already stopped! Said it scared him no end as we hadn't heard it go in the two weeks I've been going.

I've been following your thread from the beginning and thinking FM. You may have BC as well, but those symtoms are screaming FM! The sternum pain, I used to call my \"soul\". I come home from work and tell DH that I was exhausted to my soul. I was actually on an electric scooter then cane as I had to work to get over weakness and pain. I still have my electric scooter and don't want to part with it yet. FM is totally debilitating! I have been bedridden so bad that my DH will put Tylenol 3's in my mouth and I can chew and swallow them without lifting my head! The agony of even a bedsheet on me can send my pain level over the moon! I am on some pretty heavy narcotics for the past number of years so I can even get to work (my DH has 3 brain tumours, someone has to pay the mortgage!).  FM is one of the reasons I didn't get a reconstruction after my bilat mx. My docs and I were thrilled with how well I handled the surgery and didn't want to push my luck.  What do I do to survive? Sleep. Rest. Read novels. Sleep. Rest. Read novels. On my days off I will sleep 14-18 hours alone. I give everything I have to getting up to go to work in the morning. I pour myself into my commission job and then come home and drop like a ton of bricks. Sometimes my DH has to help me out of my car to get in the house. He cooks and we eat at TV trays because once I have sat down I can't move around. I have to take narcotics early enough that I can have a shower on the days I shower (not every day).  I have been diagnosed for about 11-12 years now. I have had to learn by trial and error what my body can handle. For example, something like Disneyland would be WAY too much! Even movies aren't really good for me. Too much stimulus is bad for FM. Sleep is the best thing you can do.  You will not always be \"bad\". You will get flares just like MS. It comes and goes. But, if you are under stress, like you are right now, it's a constant. Because I am under financial pressure, my FM is pretty constant. It's funny our perspective. People want to win the lottery so they can buy a big house or whatever. I want to win the lottery so I can give my body a break and maybe be pain-free! Good luck on whichever way it goes. If God takes you to it, He'll take you through it!",

I HATED my breasts for causing that agony! With the surgery I had beautiful perky breasts for a 50 year old, but they never felt like mine again. It took a year for me to get sensation back in one of the nipples. So having no weight on my chest has been a Godsend. When I've had my scares (2 lumpectomies and 2 additional biopsies) I knew I'd never get recon. I have other health issues and to put myself into yet more surgery was not smart. I did not want to focus anymore attention on my breasts. They'd taken up enough of my life. I was 38D in grade 9. Not having to worry about clothing issues and gaping buttons has been wonderful! I feel much slimmer and move and stand way better as well. I looked at a LOT of pictures on a LOT of websites and didn't like the scarring I saw with the surgeries. To me, it wasn't worth keeping the breasts just to have bumps in my clothes if they weren't going to look good naked. I am not that concerned about body image at 52, but still dress girly with make-up and jewelry and stuff. Just no boobs. I needed, had to, get back to work as quickly as possible due to financial issues and the quickest way was mast. As I'd already had 2 surgeries on my right breast - the non-cancer side - I said take them both off. Now I'm not lop-sided weight wise, so my neck is fine. I sweat enough as it is without a heavy gel form. My breasts were a 42D so my form would be awfully big. I have been VERY comfortable with my decision and the first time I have felt even a bit sad is when I consider holding my new grandchild in September in my arms and not have the bosom to cuddle him with.....sigh.",

So if you go back in 6+ months they can see if the lump has grown. Some lumps ARE too small to biopsy. We understand your fear. I had my first lumpectomy when I was 21!! The tumour was so big the surgeon said I would have been dead if it was breast cancer. You are wise to keep an eye on the lump, but rest assured that they will take you very seriously if they see something in your next set of tests and scans. We grow lumps in our breasts for so many reasons - hormonal, caffeine, hereditary, etc that they just can't jump onto every lump they find. Good luck, sweetie! (Less than 10-15% of all breast cancer is hereditary so that is a dumb excuse on the doctor's part!!)",

They send a report through to the ER to show you tried them first. It doesn't mean that you get seen quicker (they mention that) but it shows you made an effort. I felt good knowing I had someone to call. Both times the person said they were a nurse. They asked very appropriate questions, eased my concerns and then directed me to the ER. Hope that gives you some local info Hmmm, just read your post again. You may be talking about a Skype-like or webcam program connected to a doctor? So you show the doctor where it hurts? Explain your issues and get feedback? I saw a TV documentary that used robots to visit cardiac patients in out-of-the-way cities while they were still in the small town hospitals.",

The last time I was on oxycontin they thought I'd have to be hospitalized to come off them, but once the pain lessened, the drug was so strong it made me sick. So it was easy to ease off. I'm not doing this to get high, I'm doing it to function day-to-day. Addictive? Who cares!!! I still need to get to work! I'm not lying at home watching TV popping pills and dreaming my day away....

If it can be shrunk enough, she may get away with just a lumpectomy where they take part of her breast away with the tumour. It may seem backwards but it is actually a better surgical outcome, depending on where the tumour is sitting. Mine was sitting right on my chest wall and was only 1 cm so I tried for a lumpectomy. He couldn't get clear margins - meaning that there was still cancer cells right to the edge of the tissue he took out. There is always the fear that those cells go even further, so I chose a mastectomy. I didn't want to go through more surgery for reconstruction so I had both breasts removed. I'd already had a tumour removed from my right breast anyway and the patholgoy showed I was only months away from a developed cancer there anyway!!!! In fact, they were more worried abou my right breast and the cancer was actually in my left! The PET (wow!! I can't get a PET in Ontario) or CT scan is to make sure there isn't obvious cancer anywhere else in her body. If so, they would treat with chemo until she showed NED (No Evidence of Disease) and then maybe, consider surgery or not. It can also check her nodes to see if any have to come out with the surgery. There is a fear when they go to get the tumour as certain things can happen. Even the biopsy can lead to 'seeding' where the needle actually pulls cancer cells through normal breast tissue and deposits them to the breast on the way out! When they do a lumpectomy, the surge of oxygen that the tumour gets causes it to grow drastically. That is why you have to move quickly once you've pissed off the tumour. Having the chemo first can kill off any nodal issues as wel as shrink the tumour. After surgery, she'd probably get rads to kill off any stray cells that remained. All in all, it's a normal process for the medical team - just not for you guys! It's new and scary, make sure you like your team or ask for another. You have the right to be comfortable with the people that literally are holding your mom's life in their hands. Keep us posted!",

It took a long time for it to be \"right\" but I only take 2 pills a day for BP. The other 14 I take are for other issues...sigh. It seemed that everytime I saw a doc I had to double my BP meds until I put my foot down and said no way. They sent me to the specialist and he worked with me month after month until I got balanced. You have to give the meds a chance to build up in your system and then when you change them, you have to get the old ones out of your system to give the new ones a chance. Frustrating for sure!

Find a therapist, support group or just talk to your doctor. You can't do this alone, no one expects you to. If you have a higher power, reach out and grab his/her hand and tell them you need them. NOW! You are in my prayers. And I have a strong God that I will share with you! ",

The kids hear cancer all the time on TV and the character lives on. We hear the word as a death sentence and they hear it like an episode or something. I don't know!  I think I was too calm and collected when I told my kids. I was trying to not scare them, so they were calm then too. That was my first mistake!!! I have lost both my breasts, my 2 kids got married, there have been 3 grandkids born (one from step-daughter) and NO ONE seems to acknowledge the cancer!!! I didn't want to be 'poor mom was sick then' and be bald at their weddings so I did the double mast (not the only reason) to avoid harsher treatment. I finally played the 'cancer card' about a month ago (almost 3 years from diagnosis) and my daughter said it was a pathetic move!!! I said what IF this IS my last summer? This was all done by email....so sad. My dad had died in 2005 from lung cancer and here was I with breast cancer in 2008. I was just trying to protect everyone inlcluding my sibs. I did too good of a job! Don't even ask me about my sibs! It sounds like you did what I did and how you're getting what I got. Sucks, eh????????",

      "Content": "Mar 13, 2009 12:51PM - edited Mar 13, 2009 01:00PM by barbe1958 I have read this thread with much admiration for you ladies. I have chosen to go flat. I mean flat. No recon, no foobies. I went from a 42D to nothing. I am not a small lady, size 14-16 and still carry some weight around my ribcage (previous ballast for large breasts). I don't know of anyone who has gone totally flat; I had no role models. My work knew I was getting them off; and as I told one co-worker before I had surgery, \"Why should I wear fake breasts to make YOU feel more comfortable?\"! The public didn't know (I'm in sales), but have been polite enough to not say anything. I wear cute cropped sweaters or something so from the side it is not obvious. What is anyone going to say anyway? It's kind of obvious... I have had a lot of flack from other sites who acuse me of wanting to be a poster child and that I'm not normal. They say breasts are about being a woman. I have felt so frustrated until I came upon this thread. I am not ashamed of my cancer. I can't forget it every day so why should I \"primp\" and \"preen\" just to make the general public think everything is okay? It isn't! I have embraced my flatness. I look thinner and clothes fit a lot better. I carry my flat chest as a shield and unlike some of you ladies, no one has cared to ask. I'm sure they'd know if they were really checking me out. I don't feel like I have to explain anything, but wouldn't feel badly if I had to.  I didn't flaunt my breasts and now I don't flaunt my flatness. It just IS. I carry myself with the same grace and elegance as when I had breasts. I am still me. I am still woman, hear me roar! Thank you for an inspiring thread! ",

Their job is to reassure you of YOUR decisions and make YOUR treatment the best one for you. Whatever you decide WILL be the best for you. By the way, I also, didn't get reconstruction and the surgery was a breeze! Others without recon will also agree. It's the hours of reconstruction and abdominal muscles, flaps and flesh that add to the length of recovery time. I have been on a sales floor for the past week selling just like I did before, just now without breasts. No fake ones, either, just camis and soft blouses and jackets, etc. I was a 42D.

All pointed to brain mets!! I can't get an MRI due to a pacemaker so had a CT which did show a thickening in my frontal lobe but we already knew that. It also showed what might be the beginning of an aneurism. A CT Angiography was recommended which I did. After the CT I was so bad I went directly to the ER. They figured it was an inner ear issue and put me on a medication for tinitis that acutally worked. It took about a week but it finally began to resolve. Fortunately the pending aneurism turned out okay as well. I was so sick and had just started a new job as well. I had to take 2 1/2 days off my first week at work! I did bring them a letter from the ER to cover my butt. It said to take off a week, but I just took off 3 more days. I was sweaty and disoriented at work and bouncing off the walls at home. I even introduced myself to someone at work by saying, \"Hi, my name is Paul.\" Can you imagine my fear? I've had a couple of \"black out\" kind of moments - watching TV for example and finding a fresh cup of tea in front of me and my DH saying he just brought it. Really? He paused the show, left the room and brought in tea....I had no idea. I was doing a jigsaw puzzle on my laptop but I wasn't that involved! I found if I went into a dark room at night I was totally disoriented - couldn't tell up from down. I stubbed my toes so many times I had a black toe on one foot or the other for weeks. So I'm still not sure what to do and I totally understand your fear. Please let us know what they are recommending and I pray for a clear study for you.",

It cannot be determined if it is truly cancer, until it is biopsied. That should be one of the first things they do. 80% of lumps that are biopsied are benign (good), so hold on to that fact; even when they are feared to be cancer - as a lump wouldn't be biopsied until that fear was there. So, she only has a 20% chance of it being cancer, but that does happen. So get ready to hang on...the ride may get quite bumpy!",

It's a bit of a hassle working it out, but once in place is literally a life saver. For your daughters and you. I have been on some kind of anti-anxiety med for over 30 years as my body is missing the chemical that others have naturally. It's not my fault and I am mature enough to accept the fact that for me, it's a maintenance drug, just like a diabetic has to deal with. You should not feel 'high' or even know there is a drug in your system, but at first you may think it's too much to deal with. Try to ease onto something over a long-weekend (July 4th?) so you are used to it before you have to drive to work. Let your daughters know what you are doing so they understand that you are taking responsibility for your part in the stress. If you want to move off the farm, do it!! The kids are too young to help you effectively, and probably don't want their weekends taken up with chores! They'll get over it, if you move into a cute little town house. They've had the farm experience. It's time for YOU and your needs. That's part of your stress, worrying about the effects on them. Of course if affects them! Anything would, even good news.",

As there is no muscles, bones or organs involved, the healing is fairly quick and painless. I have a very LOW tolerance for pain and didn't even take a prescription pain med home! When the nerves started to regenerate about 1 week to 10 days in, that was the most annoying time of zapping on my chest wall. The drains are a hassle, but very do-able. You don't want to have to reach UP or DOWN for anything for a couple of weeks. Have your hair done at a salon or over the kitchen sink. I put a TV tray further down my bed than my night table so I didn't have to reach up, just over. You will use your abs and legs to get in and out of bed instead of your arms. Get lots of good books and/or videos and don't lift anything over 5 pounds. Seriously. You have inner stitches you don't want to tear!! Don't try to be a hero - SLEEP and NAP as often as you can as you heal while asleep. You have to get over the anaesthetic too! Build a nest of pillows around you wherever you are so that you don't turn or move the wrong way. You won't be able to drive for a couple of weeks as you use a surprising amount of chest muscles when driving. Practice in your driveway first so you see what I mean. When you turn to look behind you, you will be tugging on your chest muscles. You might also want to make or get a little pillow for the seat belt as it tugs across your chest as well. Have soft sily nighties so they'll slide easier in bed and feel good on your chest.  Good luck, sweetie! Feel free to PM me if you need more answers. ",

It's important to note in your posts whether you are having recon as that makes it a longer and more painful recovery. You should be able to wipe yourself, but doing your hair is hard - your hands over your head is difficult in the beginning.  It was my idea of the silky pj's, thanks. You will find you have to use your legs and ab muscles you didn't even know you had to get in and out of bed. You can't push down on your arms (you won't want to!! ). Slippery also helps you adjust in bed without using your arms. I used a zip-up hoodie with pockets for my drains and my housecoat pockets when in pjs. At night, I laid the drains out carefully on the pillows by my side so I knew where they were when I woke up. You will NOT be tossing and turning while the drains are in - trust me!!  Someone above mentioned rubber gloves for the drains but that wouldn't work without using something jelly or slippery-like on the drains as well. You have to run your fingers down the plastic tubing to get the gunk moved into the drain, so if you use rubber gloves they won't slide. Drains are only in for a short time, so don't invest a lot of dollars in their use!!!!",

They may come back undetermined and need further testing - mine took about 10 days. The radiologist won't necessarily have the best bedside manner, either, so be prepared. Knowledge IS power and the more you know the more prepared you'll be, but please know that 80% of BIOPSIED lumps are benign!!!!! That means there are a TON of women without cancer walking around. They only biopsy suspicious lumps or ones they can't definitely determine by shape, size, etc. They may make you wait for another period cycle as well...I'm fortunate that I'd had a hysterectomy, as they were going to wait another month for more testing. Cysts react to your hormones during your cycle and they might want to see what happens. If they tell you to wait for 3 months to be re-tested don't panic. If your lump grows fast, they'd take you in sooner, but breast cancer doubles in size every 180 days (3 months) and that would be another indicator. A lot of cancer has been growing in a breast for 8-10 years before it is big enough to be felt or show up on imaging. The most frustrating thing you'll hear is the \"watch-and-wait\" I mentioned as you'll be chewing your guts out for 3 months!! An appointment with a breast surgeon would be most appropriate as you'd want one to see \"normal\" results if this lump turns out benign. If cancerous, you've already started the process. We have blazed the trail before you, so please know you are not alone and we TRULY understand your fears, panic modes, denial, promises to God and all those feelings you are having right now.

I've read of women getting a benign for nodes during surgery with immediate checking and then be told afterwards that they found cells on further investigation. I wasn't allowed my DH to be with me during my biopsy (the gun that shoots a needle into the mass!!!). The bruising was truly spectacular!! The entire lower half of my breast was BLACK. He was allowed in for a thyroid biopsy - FNA - years earlier. It was a gentle process where the worst was when they said \"don't move or swallow\". They took 13 attempts and he hit the wall and slid to the floor at about number five!!! They had warned him they wouldn't help him and they didn't!!!

Not too bad to be a zero? Why do DCIS ladies have mastectomies, chemo and rads? Oh, and hormones and LE and all sorts of stuff that comes along with the whole package? And who says my Papilliary Carcinoma wasn't invasive? You cannot imagine the flack I had from a couple ladies who didn't know what it was and therefore told me I didn't even have cancer!

Then I started a job which I loved - BUT - last July I got a new boss who hated me. Seriously. She rode me day after day and I would go into my office and cry. I didn't even cry when my parents died, or when I was diagnosed with cancer! Then in October I felt a new lump. I've had a biopsy and lumpectomy which is positive for breast cancer but I don't have the markers in yet. I had a CT and bone scan this week and will see the surgeon on Tuesday and new onc on Thursday to set up a plan. I had a double mast the first time without any further treatment. I've been 7 years \"cancer free\". So. Did the stress of the new boss and/or lack of bco support change my body chemistry? If I'd had chemo and/or rads the first time, we'd be saying \"hey I had a good 7 year run, I'll take it\". But I got the 7 years without any treatment except surgery. This time I can do the chemo and/or rads I didn't do the first time. Sadly I kind of made a \"deal\" with God that if I stayed cancer-free I'd stop drinking. Two of my kids got married and I toasted them with ginger ale. Then by September I was so stressed with my horrid boss that I started having a glass or two of wine occasionally. Did breaking my \"deal\" with God cause my new cancer???? So just how much does our thoughts create - help - stop - change our body. They say what you think you are, you are. Now I have to think of myself as a fighter. She fired me 3 days before I got the diagnosis (she knew I was getting it). After all, wouldn't she be a real bitch if she fired me AFTER learning that my cancer returned?",

My first time around I had choices, too, and chose a double mast instead of chemo and/or rads and was glad I did! About a year later, it was discovered that chemo didn't work on slow growing cells, which mine were, so it would have been a waste of good health in my system. I'm so glad to see less chemo automatically given. There wasn't even oncotype testing (especially in Canada) back in 2008, so they've come a long way. I agree that a combo of conventional and alternative works best, but it's an individual choice as to what we chose to do from each protocol. Curious to see what my options will be this time - surgeon on Tuesday, onco on Thursday.... (exbronxgirl, good to see you too! Glad to see you're still around as well.) ",

I would like to have known that my nodes were doing what they were supposed to do!

Also, common cysts react to your hormones during your period and swell or hurt. Don't knock yourself out for what you \"may have\" missed. Cancer lives in our breasts for many years before it is big enough to be picked up by technology. You don't really want to skip the imaging, you want to skip the diagnosis!! We GET it. We know exactly how you feel!! Your girlfriends and husband won't get it the same way we do. There is an area of your breast where the underwire of your bra ends, pretty much at the site you speak of. Your skin can build up underneath that to protect the area. It may all be as simple as that. Your doc would not have been doing her job if she didn't pursue ANY lump or mass she found. We are here for you, please let us know how it all goes!",

I also think a sense of humour helps. Remember, your body runs on chemicals. Your brain can be either over or underloaded on important ones. That is why you may need a chemical intervention. You do it for cancer, don't you? I find my Zoloft keeps my anger at bay and my Welbutrin keeps me upbeat. Of course I have horrid things happen to me, but I deal with them much more positively when my brain isn't dragging me down. I don't feel drugged or medicated at all so I'm not over-prescribed on it. It takes time to hit your system and experimentation to adjust the dose for balance. You have the right for help. It comes in a bottle and no one has to know. (and it's not alcohol! LOL) ",

I am not an athlete, but without breasts I look slimmer. I have people say they notice I've lost weight and I say nothing! If you are concerned about your body, you might want to seriously consider whether ANY implants are right for you! There are a lot of things that go wrong during surgery and many women end up with what they call \"a tight band around my chest\" as the surgeons have to tighten all your chest muscles to hold up your implant. No thanks! As for risk, my tumour was over my heart (and lung) at 6 o'clock on my left breast. I didn't even consider RADS!! Both my cardiologist and PCP have said thank God I didn't do rads! My tumour was 1 cm, the size of your baby fingernail. By removing the tumour with the breast tissue there was nothing left to radiate and as it was a small tumour (1 cm) there was no more need for rads. There was no way I was going to risk my heart and left lung for a 2% drop in recurrence! I've said before that it would have to be a 25-30% reduction in risk for me to take on rads. Say your recurrence rate was 10%. Say someone told you that rads reduces your rate by half. That's not 50%. That's 1/2 of 10%, which means your recurrence rate has dropped to 5%. So you can still get a recurrence! So can I. Odds are just numbers and we have both already beaten the odds by getting cancer in the first place. Maybe we've had our dose of crap and there's no more to come. Maybe there is.... NO ONE can tell you what is the right thing to do. Only YOU can figure it out which is why your docs are sitting back. No one wants to say do it and then you get lung damage. Please read the threads on pumonary issues!!!! No one wants to say don't do it and then you get a recurrence!!  It's kind of like being Clint Eastwood....\"Are you feeling lucky today?\"",

My first week was amazing, like yours! Then once the nerve endings started to regenerate, wowzie! You'll read that in a couple of posts all over the place. I felt worst in my 2nd week and then fine after that. The drains don't hurt coming out. Just make sure they take the suctin OFF by opening the drain before trying to remove it! Makes a huge difference. I had one drain for a week and it hurt getting out. I had my last drain out yesterday after 22 days and I didn't even feel it because the surgeon opened the drain first! Makes sense. ",

I have been readings posts tonight from members who can't believe how much pain they are still in and feeling depressed and guilty. With FM you have to take the pain meds BEFORE you feel the pain, as once you have reached a certain level, nothing will get the pain down. More doctors are aware of this disorder and I often get pain meds before surgery even starts. I make sure that anyone dealing with me during a procedure understands what FM does to my sensation of pain. I do not have a low pain thresh-hold, I have FM. It has been a deblitating cross to bear over the last 10 years or so, and I was terrified that the stress on my body and mind would put me into a \"flare\" with the surgery. By being proactive, I was able to maintain control over my whole healing process and am very proud of myself.

I had an ultrasound guided biopsy and my tumour was very close to my chest wall, too. The radiologist who does the biopsy does NOT want to go through the tumour as that would be pointless - they wouldn't get any sample tissue. So they judge very carefully how deep to go - sometimes making a number of attempts to judge it, so be prepared for more than one poke. Perhaps an MRI guided biopsy is more precise, but I watched on the US screen as my doctor shot a needle (from a gun thingy) into the tumour exactly! It grabbed a piece of tissue and brought it back out. Fascinating. I don't know how much you'll be able to watch, but it was cool seeing the lump they were after. It was totally black on the US monitor. I don't know the process you'll be getting, whether a gun or hand-held needle but they do not want to mess around, so trust the process. If they don't think they got a good sample, as I said, they'll go in again. Sometimes, rarely they burst a cyst that they thought was solid, so don't be surprised. I've had 4 biopsies over 29 years and one lump got burst that way so they knew it wasn't cancer. Good luck, sweetie!",

Lumpectomy showed cancer but not clear margins so they had to go in again anyway. (Needle biopsy had been \"worrisome for cancer\" but inconclusive.)

The ones that had darts, plunging necklines, would sag with too much fabric without boobs, etc. It was very cathartic. Some were very expensive, some not so much. I gave the huge green garbage bag to my DD and DIL to go through so I knew at least some would get used by family. I gave my hairdresser a couple of my favourites from over the years. As I throw NOTHING out, it was quite a packed bag, well over-due in purging. Then I got to shop. It was actually quite painful at times to lift my arms over my head and manouver out of some types of tops. Twice I was almost in tears in the change room when I realized that I couldn't get the top off! I learned to pull the bottom hem up and over my head by leaning my head between my knees as I sat down. I felt NO guilt when I brought my purchases home and would model them for my DH. I let him feel how soft the fabrics were and made him a part of the decisions. I think it helped him a lot too, to see me so happy with a new top for my flat chest! I'm sure Ed is pleased as puch for Cathi that she has found so many bathing suits, it wasn't a good Spring for her as she dreaded the purchasing process. Good luck to everyone!

I left the hospital without any prescription and I have a very LOW tolerance for pain due to Fibromyalgia. That was my biggest fear, that the pain would knock me for a loop! The most annoying time (besides the SNB site and the drains) was about 10 days out when the nerves started regenerating and it felt like zaps shooting across my chest. A good sign though, so tolerable. If you take too many pain meds, you will hold yourself back. They will tire you out and constipate you. So make sure you take a Sennoket laxative with a stool softener to keep you regular during healing. You do NOT want to deal with that during this time. If you find yourself sleeping too much, it could be the pain meds. A nap is nice though!! You will be able to type immediately, but will find you arm will tire easily. I remember searching for mother-of-the-bride dresses about 2 months out and being surprised that it was hard to \"flip\" through the heavy gowns on the racks. That is a time line that I remember well. You want to gently stretch out your arm and keep it moving or you could seize up. That is also something you won't want to deal with - frozen shoulder. I remember the first time I woke up with my hand above my head and being really pleased that I didn't wake up due to zaps. You won't need a recliner necessarily. Women who get recon need them. You WILL need to use stomach muscles to get up and down in bed. Swing your legs over the side first, and then sit up. Do the opposite to get in. You will not want to push down on your arm(s) to brace yourself. The biggest thing is to try not to ge scar tissue build-up. I had my DH give me nightly cream rubs (from pharmacy, not beauty centre) across my wound once the steri-strips (instead of stiches) came off. It relieved the itchiness as I healed and got him very used to my new look. You will only want very soft things against your chest forever now. You will find polyester irritating and may have to wear cami's underneath your present clothing to act as a softness between you and scratchy fabrics. Before, your breasts kept clothing tight against your chest. You won't have that now, so you will get gaping like you've never had before! Soft cami's will look very sexy and make you feel pretty, believe it or not! I actually feel sexier now than when I had breasts like everyone else! I use big necklaces or earrings to draw eyes away from my chest. At my present job, I worked with someone for 6 months before I mentioned breast cancer and her jaw literally hit her desk when I mentioned that I didn't have breasts! It does NOT have to be obvious! I wear busy patterened, flowy, ruched, soft tops that aren't tight to my chest. It's not obvious. I went from a full 42D to nothing! Some people mention that it looks like I lost a lot of weight and I just smile! Good luck and please let us know how you are doing!",

They didn't really want to be touched and pulled away. When they started \"picking\" at their blankets my sister said that was a classic sign that death was imminent. My Dad said nothing for 2 days and then woke up for 3 seconds and said to my daughter \"In 24 hours I'm going up\". Freaked her out (she was 23) and I was in the bathroom and missed it. Sure enough he died 24 hours later...... While he was semi-conscious he was really quite funny - asking for Evian water and then saying you know what that is spelled backwards, right? It was like he was trying to entertain us. He kept \"smoking\" too (no cigarette in his hand) right until the end, almost. I feel guilty that I'll possibly die before my husband! I know it will rip him apart, as would his death do me. Good ole Catholic guilt.......",

Cancer is caused by an uninhibited growth of previously normal cells that expertly evade the body's usual defences to spread, or metastasise, to other parts. When cancer affects a vital organ, its function is impaired and the impairment can result in death. The liver and kidneys eliminate toxins and maintain normal physiology \u2013 they're normally organs of great reserve so when they fail, death is imminent. Cancer cells release a plethora of chemicals that inhibit appetite and affect the digestion and absorption of food, leading to progressive weight loss and hence, profound weakness. Dehydration is not uncommon, due to distaste for fluids or an inability to swallow. The lack of nutrition, hydration and activity causes rapid loss of muscle mass and weakness. Metastases to the lung are common and can cause distressing shortness of breath \u2013 it's important to understand that the lungs (or other organs) don't stop working altogether, but performing under great stress exhausts them. It's like constantly pushing uphill against a heavy weight. Cancer patients can also die from uncontrolled infection that overwhelms the body's usual resources. Having cancer impairs immunity and recent chemotherapy compounds the problem by suppressing the bone marrow. The bone marrow can be considered the factory where blood cells are produced \u2013 its function may be impaired by chemotherapy or infiltration by cancer cells.Death can occur due to a severe infection. Pre-existing liver impairment or kidney failure due to dehydration can make antibiotic choice difficult, too. You may notice that patients with cancer involving their brain look particularly unwell. Most cancers in the brain come from elsewhere, such as the breast, lung and kidney. Brain metastases exert their influence in a few ways \u2013 by causing seizures, paralysis, bleeding or behavioural disturbance. Patients affected by brain metastases can become fatigued and uninterested and rapidly grow frail. Swelling in the brain can lead to progressive loss of consciousness and death. In some cancers, such as that of the prostate, breast and lung, bone metastases or biochemical changes can give rise to dangerously high levels of calcium, which causes reduced consciousness and renal failure, leading to death. Uncontrolled bleeding, cardiac arrest or respiratory failure due to a large blood clot happen \u2013 but contrary to popular belief, sudden and catastrophic death in cancer is rare. And of course, even patients with advanced cancer can succumb to a heart attack or stroke, common non-cancer causes of mortality in the general community. You may have heard of the so-called \"double effect\" of giving strong medications such as morphine for cancer pain, fearing that the escalation of the drug levels hastens death. But experts say that opioids are vital to relieving suffering and that they typically don't shorten an already limited life.",

How can a mother see her own child pass before her? I cannot imagine her pain. Her Dad and brother were there as well, and a cousin of Yan's as well as his Dad. The boys were upstairs making boy noises, which added some levity as they played their games. There was a communication issue as Olga's family only spoke Hebrew, but grief is international and we sat in mutual pain as Yan spoke of Olga's last days. He told us how peaceful she was at the end, slipping from breath to no-breath without any pain. He told us how the older boy was being seen by someone at the school who had prepared him for his Mom's death; how calm the boy was as it was happening, and the letdown of grief when it was all over. Yan didn't have the boys at the hospital while Olga was in such pain as he didn't want them to remember her that way. He couldn't imagine having her pass at home as the memories would be so hard to bear. \"It was pretty bad at times,\" he said, \"She was in a lot of pain before they got it under control.\" His eyes showed his pain and we shared more tears. Then it hit me that I felt guilty. My kids were grown up and had kids of their own!

I was sitting there with Yan, where Olga should have been and I felt so bad. I began to cry harder and Yan, bless his heart, tried to comfort ME. That's when I knew we should leave. I went to comfort Yan in his time of need, not to have him need to comfort me. As we had a final hug, he told me to pass this hug on to everyone, so I told him to make it a good one. He did, and I am passing it on. I got a hug from a strong and loving man who just lost the love of his life. His compassion for us here was very evident and he will be back to let us know how they are doing. God Bless you Yan, and your boys. May you find peace in the days to come.

The drains are more of a nuisance and itch, sometimes uncomfortable to lie on and every once in a while you tug on one too hard, but the stitch holds. I am still draining over 50 cc's a day on my left side (SNB) and can't get the last drain out! I really don't want to go into 2009 with a drain in. Crossing my fingers for Tuesday when the nurse comes back. I am not going to wear foobies and have already gleaned my wardrobe of clothing I can wear to work. As everyone at work knows what I have been through, I don't feel I have to wear anything. I have jackets that cover most of my chest and have bought beautiful tanks in gorgeous colours to add a shot of distraction. I'm finding it harder to find casual clothing and am looking for waisted items that can \"slouch and puff\" across my chest instead of pulling flat. I was a 42D (after a reduction!) and am so thrilled to not have breasts that I think I'm still in denial. I do find that I am fixated with other womens' chests on TV, when before I didn't even notice. I know I'll shed some tears down the road... ",

There were only a couple of sites here (one was the Breastfree site) and another by a lady called Linda who posted pics of herself in clothes with a prothesis and then without that gave me the strength to say no to recon. I didn't want the drama and the mulitple surgeries and the pain and disappointment I kept reading about here. Some ladies took as long as 2 years before they had even finished Stage 2 of thier recon!!!! I didn't have the extra time to take to give myself 'barbie doll boobs'. My surgeon watched me very carefully as he said that about \"deep tissue wound\" but I agreed with him. I wonder if he was expecting me to lash out? hehhehheheehhe The physical is taken care of. Make sure you take care of your psychological side too. You WILL get boob-envy when you see sexy ladies walking around in the summer.

I also love not wearing a bra, and many women with implants say they don't get cleavage anymore with recon, just two forms facing forward in their bra without being squishy soft. A more invasive surgery like DIEP is just not in my future as I have heart issues and I'm pretty sure they wouldn't let me be under for the 10-14 hours needed for the surgery. Then again, I'd have a scar from hip to hip as well as new scars on my breasts. ANY surgery or not even more surgery will never let you forget, while naked, what you have been through. I also don't have the 2 years necessary to go for TE's and continual tweaking-surgeries until my breasts look normal. Just not for me. But, like I said, I do consider it every once in a while. Just did consider it yesterday when I had a bco sister over for lunch. She is 10+ years older than me - I'm 53 - and she is wanting DIEP. I applaud her bravery at the same time I pray for her continued good health! At least we have options.",

I am still very concious about that and will be until the day I die! I have mild truncal LE and do NOT want it to get worse! LE can develop as long as 20 years out.

Some ladies even wear garments inside out so the seams don't irritate areas like the underarm. Brilliant!!! I used to buy something and show my husband saying \"look at how pretty this is\". But I got to the point I'd say \"look at how soft this is\". You will find something that feels right. If you keep wearing a compression, you won't get used to the feel of fabric moving on your chest. It's about time to start to experiment. An old soft tee would be a nice start.",

You have to judge if your pain is muscular or skeletal. Otherwise, it's used for burn victims as well because there are no pressure points. Another thing, you should sleep with a pillow between your knees when you lie on your side. Otherwise the long muscle over your hips is stretched all night and can make you sore. As well, sleeping with a pillow under your knees should only be a short-term remedy. It can shorten the long muscles in your legs and cause worse problems later in life. A good mattress should come up and meet your lower back and support you that way. You should be changing your mattress every 8 years if there is 2 adults on it. Now is not the time to cheap out.

This site blew my mind when I found it!!! I have degenerative disk disease as well as a bulging disk that is bulging the wrong way (of course!) so they thought it was a tumour years ago. I have horrendous arthritis even to having spurs into the back of my throat from my neck! I had a reduction years ago to alleviate the weight and bc has given me the penultimate reduction. That's one of the reasons I've never, ever considered recon. Lyrica and Neurontin both cause weight gain. I am on Cymbalta and my regular doc can't believe I'm NOT pain free! I also take 18 mgs of Hydromorphone a day, and Oxycontin for breakthrough pain up to 4 times a day. Can you say narcotic overload??? I take a stool softener and laxative EVERY day. edited to add NOT pain free",

Then my injection for a bone scan, lunch, a walk to find a new purse (always cheers me up!) and then back for the bone scan. Scanned for 1 hour and 15 minutes!!! When the scan completed my body she said she had to take additional pictures and hang on, she had to go to the waiting room to tell the 2 people waiting that she'd be even longer! I am worried, but am able to put it in a box and shut it away. My husband was right outside the open door of the exam room and heard her telling me she needed the extra shots of my chest and......get this....my FEET!!!!

My back is bad and I can't imagine how bad it would be by now if I still had my 42Ds. I look slimmer and clothes look neater. I'll say it again; when I see big floppy boobs a voice in my head goes \"Mooooooooo\".

I decided there was no way in hell I was going through that. The doctors truly don't believe me to this day! The pressure is immense to reconstruct and I resent that. I haven't read a single thread in all this where the HUSBANDS are thrilled with the new foobs! I've only read threads with women horrified that after all they went through their husbands have NO interest in even touching their new breasts! The ladies are generally happen, when they like the outcome, I ignored the problems as that would happen with any surgery , but wow! The horror stories of open woulds and collapsing, shifting, under-arm-boobs, etc. I have read a lot of threads from women like myself who have the guts to say that they are very happy without the weight and heat of breasts! It is also more slimming in a profile shot..... I actually had someone PM me to tell me I was mentally insane for feeling this way! This is from someone on this board! I'm sorry, my breasts aren't even part of my soul, and it is my soul that lives and breathes. AND I had a reduction years ago and had magnificent breasts for a 50 year old last year when I lost them. Someone said that only women who were unhappy with their present breasts wanted to take them off. There are a lot of different ways to think about all this, but breasts, though an important part of our sexuality (I've also been known to say my breasts used to turn ME on!), when it all boils down, they are only lumps of fat! They are not me. My reduced breasts never really felt like mine (stuff taken away NOT added, but still...) so I was pretty sure recon would feel the same way. I felt that society wanted me to have breasts. I am defiant in the presentation of my flat chest. If I have to live with bc, so does everyone else that has to look at me! I certainly don't plan on going topless, just like I never breast fed in public. It's no one's business what's beneath my clothes. I only had one negative comment, from a guy who is dating someone with a double mast! He said a womans shape should include curves. I felt like saying a man's shape should include a large penis, but hey, that's a discussion for another thread! ehehehehheee Anyway, the whole point of this rant is that I agree with your post except that I don't consider myself a freak. My genius IQ, now that IS freakish...and hard to live with! I am known to quote myself as saying, \"Why should I have fake boobs to make YOU feel better?\" I had made my decision before surgery and and thrilled that I was comfortable enough with it to take it to heart and live with it for the past year. Still no niggling desire to reconstruct! So, I know I've probably rocked some emotions over this rant, but I only do this every 6 months or so, and it was time. I feel better...whew!",

Make sure your surgeon cleans up any issues as best he can. Tell him to use his expertise to make your scar line perfect. Dog ears are almost always necessary and they normally put them under your arms. The incision has to end somewhere and when it does, the normal tissue starts. There's going to be a starting ridge. Starak/Barbara had hers in the middle of her chest!!! She finally got that removed...see her smile??? I must say, if I'd only had one breast removed, I would probably have made the effort to get reconstruction as I had to wear a bra anyway. But, as my right breast had already had one cyst removed I just had them take it at the same time as my left. NO regrets!",

You don't want to try it for the first time in traffic! Don't pick up anything heavier than 5 pounds and don't put your hands up over your head. Have someone else wash your hair for you if you can as the jiggling of your arms kind of pulls the incision. Be good to yourself and rest as you need to. Everyone takes different times. The anaesthetic is what is hardest to get over.  Nap when you can. Put an extra pillow in your bed beside the surgery side to prop your arm if you need to. Good luck! ",

In fact, years ago they would have women start manipulating their breasts before they gave birth to \"speed up\" the milk to come in when the baby was born. We were also told to rub a \"rough\" washcloth on the nipples to begin to toughen them up!",

They can even buy meals the same as yours to share with you. The staff are sensitive to your needs as well as the people who are grieving. It's a very humane space and I hope I'm in the right place to take my last breath in hospice like my parents did. One was in Toronto and one was in White Rock (think Vancouver). Miles apart but the same dignity and grace. No alarms, no bells, no paging, no bustling. Just calm. There is no emergencies in hospice. Everyone is there for the same reason.",

Call me crazy, but to me, that would be the harder memory. For the rest of his life he would be lying in the bed I died in?? No way. I don't want the house tainted with death. Yes, I know death is natural but so are other things that we keep separate. We're not the generation that gave birth in our homes nor the one that dies in our homes and holds wakes. If that is your custom, then of course you would do it. My Mom worked for years on a hospice floor in a hospital and said it's very common for someone to pass when their loved one leaves the room. Many times she actually went to the elevator to call them back before they left as the person had passed already. Weird, eh? Perhaps they think they are saving the loved one from the pain of actually seeing you die......I want my DH there and will talk about it when I get there.",

When you first lose your breasts, that area will seem so obvious and your belly will seem so much bigger. In time, you will learn to stand a different way (sub-conciously) because you don't have the weight of your breasts, and those two areas will seem much smaller. A lot of us said it was like we had a toddler's body when we were first flat. The relief is strange...I still haven't mourned or cried and I'm 2 1/2 years out!!! I keep wondering if it will hit me and I'll lose it, but so far, the logistics have been just perfect. I had NO idea how I'd handle it and had no one to talk to about it. You will be so much better prepared than most of us were. Oh! Another thing, you will be very concious of the feel of the fabric against your chest. Some will irritate you, others will feel wonderful!!! So if a top is rough on your chest, wear a soft cami underneath. Also, my two incisions don't quite meet in the centre of my chest and there is a natural dip there. So sometimes, it looks as if I have a bit of cleavage!! Go figure.....",

Years ago I had a reduction and the surgeon mentioned not to ever wear an underwire bra for that reason. Also, underwires cut blood circulation. I asked her how the heck a low support bra would give me any support!! I mentioned age only to say that I had underwire rubbing against that area for 37 years! My ribs protrude enough that I can fit my fist underneath them!! Now, with the built-up area it is even more pronounced. That's all it is.",

When you first have surgery, you will be too sensitve to wear anything skin tight as your wound is aggravated by itchy or stiff fabric so you tend to wear loose clothing like hoodies that also hold the drains. So it's a bit before you wear anything too revealing and by that time you're used to it. I had my DH massage cream into the area every night to keep circulation going and to \"scratch\" the itch of the healing nerves. He got used to it way before me.",

I don't get \"high\" when on them, the narcotics are used up in the pain killing process. But, like you, I need more and more. (I have something wrong in my hip and am on a cane awaiting an MRI.) It's a combination of your body getting used to it and the pain really getting worse. I remember from years ago with herniated disks, that near the end I would get narcotic headaches. To me that meant my body didn't need as much pain relief any more as my body healed. I was warned that I would probably have to be hospitalized to get off them (the narcotic equivalent of 25 Percocets a day!) but once my body didn't need the pain relief, they actually nauseated me. I weaned off them in about a 2 week period. You HAVE to do it slowly and listen to your body. You may have to go to a pain clinic as your body MIGHT be producing pain to \"get\" the meds. The docs do anything they can to break your pain cycle so you can get off the strong stuff. In my case, I had 2 epidurals in the base of my spine and 2 in my neck! When I went back for more, that's when they realized how truly in pain I was as no one wants to do that in their neck. I had tried nerve blocks, but they didn't last long enough to break the pain cycle. Your body needs enough time pain-free to break the cycle. Could be days, could be weeks. We are all different. This time on the pain killers, I'm not worried as I know I can do this. But, I too, had worried about a dependency and that's why docs are concerned giving them out. BUT, we have the right to be pain-free...AND we have the technology. All the best to you! PM me if you want - I'm a pain expert!  ",

It then becomes either LCIS or IDC. DCIS stays in the ducts and once it pops out it is no longer DCIS. You will get told this over and over in the threads. I had a double mast to avoid radiation right over my heart and lung and am glad I avoided it. As for pheromones, I'd like my DH to be attracted to ME and MY pheromones! Not another scent!! But thanks for pointing out that you don't have a financial interest in that thread as it's breaking the rules to post links for financial gain or use this board for marketing purposes. Good luck in your decision!!",

He actually got used to my look before I did. He is very supportive of my decision and I'll often read him posts from women who still have problems with recon two YEARS later!! We are both glad I didn't go that route. Unfortunately, his libido was cooling off as I was facing breast cancer. The last time we made love, to both our horrors, my left breast (cancer side) started to bleed red blood from the nipple. It was quite disturbing. He hadn't seen it yet (I had) and it really put him off. We haven't had sex in 3 years!! He says he just doesn't feel like it (he's 62), and tests show a low testosterone, but he doesn't want to take anything. I have to give my head a shake every once in a while, just to remember that I have a loving, caring DH...we just don't have sex any more!! He supports me buying clothes to compliment my flat body and knows that it is the \"feel\" of the cloth that is more important than the look. I feel very sexy when I feel the clothes against my bare chest. I am very happy being flat. Much less stress on my arthritic neck too!",

Guys who hug you don't want to know what it feels like! There was only one guy at work that hugged me from tip to toe and I am forever grateful for that. He was my mentor and I miss him dearly. I dropped into my old work once and when one of the women hugged me, I said \"Oh! You're so soft!!\" Another woman said, \"Am I soft too?\" and proceeded to hug me! hehehehehe It could have been an awkward moment, but I assured her that she was \"soft\" too! badger, I have a great smile and a great attitude, but that still doesn't mean my DH and I have a great sex life!

I wear almost the same clothes as before except for ones that have extra space and darts for breasts. Those kind just leave empty fabric hanging on my chest. I wear a lot of tanks with cropped sweaters and they are just cute!  There is one example of a cowl necked top and large necklace to draw your eye up. You wouldn't be able to notice I had no breasts unless I stood side-ways and held my arms back. This is a good example of the \"busy\" fabrics I talk about all the time. They are distracting to the eye.  Here is another one wear I took off the sweater part as I was warm. You can see I still get a kind of \"cleavage look as the scar doesn't join in the middle of my chest. This was the first time I changed my new grandson!!!  Another 'busy' fabric and necklace.

I was going to go back to work tomorrow, but am going to wait until I see the surgeon on Wednesday. I only have Sunday or Tuesday for the visiting nurse to take the drain out before I see him. I do not want to wear the drain to work! Bad enough no breasts... I am still itchy and put a lot of Glaxyl on. My husband had to take the tape goo off with nail polish remover (as per the nurse!). My ribs hurt badly and of course, I think immediately of bone mets. Sigh....thought I was over the scary part.  I have put together a great work wardrobe (good time of year for sales) of camisoles and the cool new stylish loose cardigans. I already have jackets so I am good to go. I walked around the mall today with my coat over my arm and a loose shirt on. No one stopped to stare and scream that I had no breasts, so it felt kind of good. I think I'm ready for my co-workers to see me. The only weird thing is that they guys used to hug me a lot and now I know it will feel different for them. Kind of like hugging a guy! Does anyone else have problems with belly swelling? I almost look pregnant, and it's not just because I have no boobs, my jeans are actually too tight! The nurse says that the body produces fluid as a result of trauma. I would have thought it would be gone by now. ",

I believe it was the universe making them take a closer look. Tumour at the chest wall are hard for a mammo to pick up. I was hoping for a pappiloma when I went off to ultrasound. They did a biospy on the spot which came back inconclusive, but \"worrisome for cancer\", so I had to have a lumpectomy. The lumpectomy came back as cancer with margins too close so I just said \"take 'em off!\" I had a double mast 6 days later. My point is, even if it's not cancer. At least get a second opinion!

He had to go back in a do an incision revision on the left (cancer) side as there was too much tissue left still. When I saw him post-op that, he couldn't belive it! There was almost as much 'tissue' there still. He said he swore he took out a big chunk. What we didn't realize at the time, was it as LE!!!!! Now that I treat my LE with MLND, my look is much smoother. Thank God I didn't go for yet another surgery!! I've heard of so many women who get lipo as stage 2 of their reconstruction, to clean up dog ears and flatten under the arms. They say the lipo was the hardest part to recover from! You've been very lucky to date, I hope everything goes as well for your deconstruction, you will feel so much better without having to wear a bra.

My arm was a MESS!!! I wasn't trying to commit suicide, I was trying to control the amount of pain I was feeling by ME being the source of the pain. You know what I mean? I took a butcher knife and slashed the fatty part of my lower left arm. Didn't need stitches, but have bad scars. When my doc saw that, he finally believed how bad I was. He also wanted me to get a psych consult which I did, that confirmed my only issue is pain! That's why he will prescribe the heavy narcotics for me, knowing that I've been able to get off them 3 times over the past 6-7 years. I'm almost at the max that I can walk around with, though, so getting nervous wondering what's next. Must call the hospital to see if they have the MRI request yet....",

Describing the \"pathways of pain opening and not closing\" again is classic FM. We have too much of a substance called \"P\" and it keeps pain reactions going when they should have stopped. Sleep is the NUMBER ONE defense you have against this FM. Everyone listening??? You MUST get as much sleep as you can. I sleep 12-16 hours a day and can barely function at times even with that much. I am on Morphine Sulphate for my spinal stenosis and that doesn't even touch my FM pain. I can't imagine how bad I'd be without the heavy meds. I did a big boo boo yesterday. I always tell surgeons about my FM so they can pre-pain med me, but forgot yesterday in the rush of the surgery. I had a pacemaker put in yesterday and had a VERY rough time of it! I was told I'd have 'twilight' anasthetic and the surgeon said \"No, nothing!\" They had to medicate me twice for anxiety (once before we started and then when I was reacting to the pain) and then FINALLY he had them give me Fentanyl. Sheesh!! It friggin' HURT!!! Of course, I was a 'bad' case where they couldn't find the vein and had to go on a witch hunt for it through the muscles of my chest...sigh. Pretty sore today and annoyed that I didn't remember to advocate for myself. Not their fault as they were giving me Oxycontins (but I eat those like candies). So, one of the down-sides of taking so much pain meds is that when you need even more, there's not too many options for your surgical team! I would have liked to have been 'out' for the surgery. The needles required for the local totatlled about 8-10 I'd say.",

In the morning it was just as bad after lying flat all night. In fact, the watery parts felt firmer. Off to the hospital I went....sigh. The ER doc did not want to aspirate as she said it would hurt so bad. I told her I had to get the fluid out as I couldn't walk, sit on a toilet or certainly drive and I had to get back to work! She said I had to be off for at LEAST a week. I said I'd need a letter for my work if that was the case. She said she didn't like doing the letter for a week as I might need even longer!!! She finally did one though. Anyway, I broke her down and she finally came back to drain my knee. Holy CRAP!!! The pain as she worked the needle between my knee cap and the other joint bones was excruiating. Good thing she froze me first and I'm already on so many pain meds! You should have seen the crap that came out!!! She had to use a larger bore needle as the fluid was viscous (thicker). She got 55 cc's out and said that was enough to send off to test. So here I am at home waiting to hear if I have to go on an antibiotic or maybe it's worse...sigh. It's funny, because after all I got done on Friday with the MRI and other things, I said to my DH that the only pictures they missed were my knees!!! I think I jinxed myself!!!!",

I want my kids to remember me alive. My Mom took a week to die in hospice and it felt like forever. My Dad took 4 days and that felt about right. I asked my Dad if he was scared of dying and he said only of the pain and I was able to assure him that we would make sure he was pain-free. They both were kept pain-free. No IV's feeding nourishment, just morphine for comfort. They both died peacefully. I told my DH I don't want a \"death-watch\" around my bed when I'm unconscious. If the kids want to see me then they can while I'm still \"me\". I don't want my grands (5) to see me in a bed either. I might feel differently on that as the time gets closer. A friend here on bco went into hospice and watched them put in the IV that would keep her pain-free as she died. That kind of freaks me out. She had asked about pain and they told her that yes, it is painful as your organs start to shut down. They let her x-DH bring in her dog for a visit. The disposal of my body if I died at home is another matter. Would I want my DH to die in our bed and then watch him be zipped up and taken away? Not really......",

I was getting a bit anxious as the first wedding is end of May and I wanted to be healed up. My left side incision (the cancer side) has too much flesh left and even sags a bit. The surgeon actually agreed after he tried to defend himself. Then I told him to get over it, look at the perfect right side so I knew he could do it! He had left too much from only about where the nipple would have been to under my arm. I had wanted that definitely done as the dress for the 2 kids' weddings is strapless and I don't want that little bit of bulge to make people think I've shoved my (non)breast under my arm or something.  So, back for the anasethetic consult, sigh, but oh so worth it. I'm pretty sure there won't be drains as it is pretty non-invasive. I had hoped to do it under a local, but he doesn't like that. I want him to check the extra skin through pathology as well.

I'm overweight and the concept is that they have to stop 'carving out' somewhere. So they stop under the arm as it's the easiest place to hide it. When they stop, the fat continues and gives a bulge area. You shouldn't be able to feel it, but some summer tops are too low for me and it shows!! As far as pain goes, there is NO muscle, NO bone and NO organs involved. My surgeon described it as a deep tissue wound and that truly is all it is. I have FM and expected a pain pump and they looked at me like I was crazy. I left the hospital without a pain prescription!!! The most irritating part was as the nerves start regenerating and they ITCH!!!!!! As for the ribs, where the drains have sat for week(s) it is, or can be, painful to push on. I was so worried I had mets to the bones so soon that I was a basket case. Then I found out it was from where the drains sat, the body starts to heal, and then the drains are ripped out again! Trauma to that site. Oh yah, the drains do NOT hurt coming out as long as whoever is pulling them remember to OPEN the vacuum part so there isn't any drag!!!",

I don't usually say that, but we had this discussion many pages back about stopping your anti d's. All of us said to do it ony under the supervision of a doctor, you dang fool you! At least we know you won't try THAT again. You WILL feel better by Friday, not to worry. But you should see your doc. I take TWO differnet meds for my head. One helps anger, the other stress. Each one works differently, you may need more than one, or two.... Please, please know this (and anyone else reading!) that some antidepressants (believe this please!) can cause suicidal feelings! That's only ONE of the reasons you cannot handle your dosage alone. This is serious shit ladies! These chemicals interact with your BRAIN function. You know we love you, I've said all this out of tough love. Taking anti-d`s isn't something to be ashamed of. I just believe it makes me the person I really want to be. I obviously have it in me to be this way, I just need help. Like permanent training wheels. My brain doesn't make a certain chemical, or makes too much of another. Not my fault. It's like diabetes. Would you blame a diabetic or expect them to be ashamed? These drugs should not make you FEEL drugged, if you know what I mean. It should be a seamless transaction until one day you say, 'Gee, normally I would have blown up over that!', and then you realize the meds work! Take gentle care Sue, and do NOT double up to speed up the process! See your doc to add or adjust anything! Strong hugs today!",

Breast cancer normally doubles in size every 180 days. That's 6 months which is the time line you were given to be rechecked. Enjoy your child and breathe deep knowing you are cancer free.",

He remembered me from last December when I had requested a prayer of thanks after my mast surgery. Today, not having asked for him in the first place, but glad to see him, I asked for a prayer of healing. He annointed me and within minutes of leaving the doctor came in with my diagnosis! I have a perfusion defect to my kidney which means there is a whole area that is not getting oxygenated blood and is going into spasms. No dialysis or surgery needed but may be a couple weeks still until I'm out of pain. He hopes I can go home in the next couple of days. I am thrilled that I don't have to be opened up as I know that opens a whole other can of worms. Glad it's not all in my head and had a medical reason (no, I'm not hysterical). It is something that got exacerbated by the surgery last Friday. Then a second priest came in !!!! so we did a prayer of thanks. Wow, I've got all my bases covered so now I can concentrate my energy on those in more need. AE, please let us know how your brother is doing! So many other medical issues could be causing his angst and they could be ignoring such an important issue. My prayers are with you all. Cathi, I have not forgotten your DDDay (heheheehe) and want you to keep us posted on how it goes.....how is Jaclyn handling the imminent arrival of her sister?  Judie, please know that as you mail off each item of your son's that you are spreading his love for music, not diluting his memory. It will be hard for you, I can only imagine...... For everyone else in need, I will catch up as you post. Love to all.... ",

Weird. I hope that doesn't stop me from going home. The only thing is that what is wrong with my kidney is usually found AFTER it is found in your  heart! sigh.....more test down the road for sure. As for his urges, here's what you do: It takes 21 times to break a habit. That's why rehab for alcoholics is 21 days. (By the way, God bless him to have his withdrawal sedated, what a small blessing, like you said!) So...when he gets an urge for a ciggie, he marks down I on a sheet of paper. That urge will last 45-90 seconds and then is gone if he doesn't feed it. When he has his next urge, he marks another I, etc, and he can count them off in groups of five, until he has 21 checks marked off. He will be surprised how far apart his urges will get when he denies his body the drug. Of course, being on the patch isn't helping rid the urge, just the habit. He may get bored doing the monitoring and not care, but that is a good sign too as it means he's not as focussed as he thought he was. Playing cards was a great distraction for him, good idea!  I've had habits I've needed to break over the years, and this method seems to work. At first you fixate on checking yourself for urges, then that becomes anti-climatic and the novelty wears off. Keep us posted sweetie. You done good!",

I had teeth cleaning about 10 days ago and I used to take antibiotics due to a heart defect before I had dental work as there is so much bacteria that gets into your bloodstream during the treatment.  I don't get the antibiotics anymore as the medical industry changed the parameters on the prophylactic meds. I wondered if that was what caused my infection. You could have had an infection from your dental work too! Very dangerous as it is in your bloodstream. Keep an eye on it. The infection would show in a weak or damaged area of your body (think breasts!). I'm going to be getting a crown too. Was it horrible?",

I was at a local zoo a couple of springs ago and went around a building and found a tech playing with a lion cub. They have to play with them when there is only one so it learns to socialize or something. Anyway, I got to pat it. Too old to hold as it was almost 3 months old and at 4 months they're own their own in the cage with the rest. Anyway, the point is that they are NOT soft! They are NOT cuddly!!!! It feels like patting a broom or something. I guess it's a defense mechanism...but boy! did that ever pop a lot of bubbles!!",

Her husband had kept telling Children Services that she was 'crazy' but they left the kids with the mother anyway. Is that what you want for your grandchildren??? OF COURSE NOT!!! I know that, but I am SO worried!!!!!!!! Please, I beg of you, get an ambulance to come the next time she calls and MAKE them take her away!!!!! Her reaction to the guerney will be enough to make them notice her. I was a police auxilliary in Toronto for 7 years. I saw a lot of 'damage' to both people and homes through mental states. I even had to hand cuff one suicide and have them put her face down and strap her in the guerney to avoid her kicking us. Amanda will get an incredible strength with all the anger she has bottle up. I don't want her to use that anger against herself or the kids. Who gets the car? The idiot, I presume??? Cathi, I ask you again. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, the next time she calls you, call an ambulance and meet then there. Tell them your daughter has threatened to take her life and as she is in the care of children under 5, you are afraid she will hurt them too. They will become a burden to her once Bill is gone and she is homeless. GET THE KIDS OUT OF THERE. Please!!!!!",

The police are NOT there to mediate between families and children. They are there to perform an action. Arrest, separate or calm down a situation and move on. It is NOT their job to assess a situation as far as imminent danger goes. Seriously. They are there to be reactive, not proactive. Otherwise they'd never get any work done!! So, do NOT call the police, call the ambulance! Tell them your daughter is suicidal but will protest that she isn't as soon as she sees the ambulance. Tell them you are her mother and are insisting that she get taken in. The police will NOT do this. They are NOT babysitters!! The ambulance people are there to TRANSPORT. Not to assess or mediate. Just to get someone into care. That's it. You guys are using the wrong people to help you!!! Get the family isolated with Amanda under care and the kids with you. Why do you ask about custody?? Just take the fucking children away!!!!!!!! Don't get into legal battles with people who don't care!! At a scene, if a child said 'grandma' to a woman, we would allow them to go with someone they knew. We would not allow kids to go to a neighbour. This would happen if we had to take the mom and/or dad away. That is not the time for legalities, that is the time to react. Just DO IT. You are driving yourselves crazy by expecting the 'government' to clean up Amanda's mess. They have no interest. Get her committed and take the kids. It's as easy as that. Bill will be glad they are well taken care of and you'll never see the idiot again after he performs his one 'stunt' to get his kids back. If he shows up with the cops you tell the cops that he beat Amanda who is now under medical care and you are afraid he will hurt the kids. The cops will see that you are the saner party and leave them with you. Tell Bill to get a court order to get the kids back. He won't bother. Take CONTROL sister!!!",

Your own doctors can visit you which is comforting and the wards are often very zen-like. They do have regular hospital beds and the suctions and lights in case they are wanted, but nothing else much that says \"I am in a hospital\". Princess Margaret Hospital here in Toronto (HUGE cancer centre) has entire floors of hospice. There is a DVD player for both music or film, a chalk/white board to write notes for the next teams coming in and fridges to keep snacks. Patients are bathed if they want, fed if they need, and medicated to their level of comfort. It's where my Dad died and priests, rabbis, ministers and all types will wander in if you want them to. It's very dignified and there are separate areas closed off for families to chat and eat and just get away from the loved one. Kind of to de-pressure. My Mom's hospice was on the West Coast and was integrated in a regular hospital as well. She had been a volunteer on that floor for years and that's where she died so she knew where she was. Very surreal I'm sure.",

I KNEW you would do whatever you could to get \"real woman\" breasts. You'd never had breasts in your life! Of course you'd want to finally get some. You make it sound like you are glad you got cancer so you could get a new rack. Of course, you'll never know what real breasts feel like... My DH and I looked at tons of pictures of recon on the internet before I made my decision. All the pics we saw without FAIL, looked too much like Frankenstein breasts with stitching lines and different coloured areas (Alloderm?) and fake obviously fake nipples or even tatooed nips. Not for me, thanks. I had REAL breasts, like a REAL woman. Not a Barbie doll look for me, thanks!! As for sexy...I LOVE the feel of soft silky clothing rubbing across my bare chest. I find it very erotic, almost a bit naughty!! I don't consider myself \"deformed\" at all, as Sheri is sure we feel. I had large 42D's since I was 13 with 38D's. I wore an underwire bra for 37 YEARS. I am THRILLED to no longer have to wear a bra and the single layer of silky fabric between me and the world makes me feel very, very sexy. Otter, I do have to say that if I had only one breast taken off, I'd fight to get the other one off too. I didn't have to fight my surgeon as I'd already had 2 biopsies over the years on my right side, and 2 on my left side, with the final one finding the cancer. My \"good\" breast was full of ADHD and calcifications so it was a breast all setting up to turn cancerous.",

I had a reduction years ago, and the breasts I just lost were a small 42D! I am thrilled to have no breasts! My surgeon said it was easier for thinner women to handle and I know why. My belly looks larger, like a toddlers', kind of stuck out and off balance for now but I am just out of surgery. I have already found a dozen things to wear to work that look great, my hardest thing is casual wear but I went out today in a patterned t-shirt with a jacket over and no one could tell what size my breasts were, never mind that I didn't have any! I am sure that I will stand and move better without the weight. From what I've read on this site the problems some of the ladies have with the foobies shifting and sweating and not sagging....just doesn't make it worth it. My hairdresser was the only one who said \"But you're in sales, you have to keep them!\" I told everyone else, \"Why should I wear fake breasts to make YOU feel more comfortable?\" I am sure I'll have a melt-down or two (I have 2 of my kids getting married in 2009 and want a really pretty dress, please God!), but so far I am so happy, my surgery is behind me and I can go on NOW like normal. Good luck in your decision! ",

I must admit, I've been pretty accepting of my cancer as so many in my family have died from it! At least 12 at last count....I've just been waiting, not wishing, but waiting...I've always assumed I'd die of cancer, just maybe not yet please.....I've got the kids' weddings this year and want to hold at least one grandchild.",

He must be wondering what HE has done to get two, now three, important people in his life affected with cancer! I think my family has backed off me because my Dad died of lung cancer and they don't want to go through the emotions anymore. Tell Ed this: We urged my Dad to get everything. Surgery (why he didn't get his whole lung out is something I can't figure out!), chemo, radiation and everything that goes with it. At the end, 2 years after diagnosis he told me, 'If I knew the treatments were going to make me feel so sick, I'd rather have done nothing and gone in peace.' Or something to that effect anyway. So you see, he didn't LIVE for another 2 years, he DIED for another two years. It was horrid watching him shrivel up and die after all.....  So, when I go, I go with 'tude!",

The oxy is the \"drunken\" one and the Gabapentin is the one that has to build in your system and then be adjusted (possibly up) until you are not in pain. You can take the Gab and be fine, when you skip it, you've broken the build-up in your system. I've spent hours with pain specialists...it's a very fine line. It will always take a combination of drugs as you need some for break-through pain and some to keep you out of pain (like a maintenance drug). Once you are in pain it is very hard for the drugs to work properly and you need way more to get the pain level down. It is important to take the drugs before you are in pain. Good luck with Landen, please, please let us know. He has been in my prayers. XOXOXOXOXOX",

While you are doing something about your fear of recurrence you are 'in control', but once it's over, you may feel thrown to the winds. My humble opinion is that you ask your doctor for some help. You got help for your cancer, now get help to get through this (notice I did NOT say \"over\" this!). I am 3 1/2 years out and still in fear of a recurrence!! If I knew that I'd still be looking over my shoulder this far out I would have asked for help sooner. We have the pharmacology to help you ease back into the horrible reality that you have to face right now. It's more than most of us can bear. A lot of us cry in the car or the shower - alone. It may seem pitiable, but it's a good venue for tears.  You express yourself very well, your doctor should be able to address your concerns....either medication or group/solo support. As far as medication, you don't want to be numb (maybe you do!) but it can take a couple of tries and many weeks to find the perfect drug to take the edge off your fears and allow you to grasp the joy of your little boy. Let's get you out of that box. Hugs, sweetie! ",

You don't what to add impacted bowels to your equation! If you're just starting with pain meds, you might want to start with Tridural, it's a stronger Tramacet (Percodan). You can always work your way up the chain to the hydromorphs and oxys. Or, you might want to consider an Oxy-IR which is instant relief. It gets into your system faster and you don't have to keep it built up. I use them for break-through pain. I'm normally on hydromorphone. I'm allowed up to 4 IRs a day and consider it a good day when I only have to use 3 for breakthrough! Strange what makes a good day now....",

With my FM, I can tolerate air, but at times during a bad flare, I can't even tolerate a sheet on me in bed! Because I have no outward signs of this disease, people have negated it and denied it to my face. They are no longer in my life. FM is an overabundance of substance P (same as RSD) and gets worse with over-stimulation. I would be a basket case at Disney Land for instance. I was afraid of my double mast but it was surprisingly not as painful as expected. There are no muscles, bone or organs involved, so as my surgeon says, it's just a deep tissue wound (paper cut!!). I tolerated it very well, but didn't have recon as I didin't want to push my luck. On the other hand, my hysterectomy brought me to my knees.....",

Also, I'd wait until they balance your thyroid meds before adding more, you're right! And, you may find that balancing the thyroid may help other issues. I am off all my anxiety meds except 60 mgs of Cymbalta, it's the lowest med level I've been in about 30 years and I'm fine!!! I had my thyroid meds adjusted 3 times so far and am due for another blood test. That shows how much time it takes to adjust as I've been doing this since Feb 7th when the last of my thyroid was taken out. Makes me wonder; instead of docs labeling us hysterical, maybe they should check our thyroid levels!!! I hadn't wanted to say anything in case it was a fluke and also because poor 3jays isn't able to enjoy the full benefit of the medication....sorry 3jays!",

He was the one who had done a thyroidectomy on me so I trusted him. He called from the operating room right in front of me as I lay on the table. They told him it was arthritis spurs from my cervical spine area bulging into my throat!  He did nothing about the arthritis; I'd have to get it scraped and it's pretty involved as they have to go through the front and mess with all your vocal/eating thingies and I'm not there yet. But the dumb thing is, he put me under anyway! I have no idea how long I was down but woke up and had a popsicle! Doi! ",

After a day or two they'd be spooning with one or the other of them. I LOVE seeing animals interact, and how they deal socially with jealousy and all. Nettie, it's logical, not crazy, to be calm about your surgery because procedures are in motion and plans are in place and things are being made right!  Karen you look better than that Julia somebody....You have an inner glow that shows, and with just the right weight that you have, you look healthy even with your body fighting. I was glad for my extra weight as I was able to stay strong on the days I couldn't eat. I must post a new avatar as that one is only 2 weeks post-op and I'm still swollen up...

Cathi, I love the poem you wrote, I love about the ink drying...kind of like it's past, it's over, it's set and you don't have to worry or deal with it, just move on. I know you wrote it meaning you have no chance to change it, but I felt like interpreting it differently The other poem was beautiful too! You have to wonder what people are thinking of when they write them. I used to hate when English teachers would ask, 'What do you think the author is saying here?' And then when you tell the teacher what you think, you're wrong! Doi ! I guess I should go to bed...nite all.",

For those of you who know I've never had an onc, I was at my surgeon this morning and I'm finally getting an appointment with a real live onc! Don't know when yet, but I have a couple new lumps and some interesting skin issues that we are going to have checked out. I feel relieved, as I want him to review my CT and bone scans as well. My surgeon said the radiologist would do a better job, but I'm guessing the onc would be more specific. ",

I have found a couple of really pretty tops that drape from a semi-cirlce around the neck, like ) but sideways, if you know what I mean. Kind of like off a necklace.... They tend to be fuller, have no arms of course and are really pretty. You can't tell what's under them (or not!) Then you wear cute shorts (I've seen your legs in that hammock shot, you go girl!) and you really feel pretty! Now when I see the boobs flopping around, in my head I go moooooooo. They have begun to look sloppy to me and I never felt \"neat\" in my large 42Ds anyway. Someone on another thread mentioned she was told she looks \"athletic\" with her new shape. That's a good spin. Not everyone has large boobs. Try to remember the other summers. Did you ever get this feeling before you had your mast? I'm remembering that I always felt sloppy and admired women with trimmer shapes. Human nature, eh? ",

It would take WEEKS to months to get a CT. Nope. He sent me across the street to the hospital and I got it in 30 minutes! I took the CD back to his office and surgery is booked for next Friday! Woo hoo! He also gave me Demerol to add to my pain cocktail. He is my new best friend! They can't shatter it as it is too big. It has been in there too long for me to pass (at least a year now at the size it is). Not quite big enough for him to have to go through my back. What he is going to try first is to go through my eurethra and up through my bladder and into the ureter and pluck it out. He will leave a stent in to keep the ureter from collapsing and scarring together and then I pull it out three days later with a tampon-like string that is attached. OUCH! ",

She should have had someone there, if not police protection. This is serious shit guys. Women get killed over domestic abuse every day! Either she likes being a drama queen or it is an illness. Once that is decided you will be able to start in the right direction. Perhaps she needs the drama in her life for excitement. Okay, so be it. You can deal with that. But if lives are being threatened that's just not part of reality and some intervention is due. Cathi, it is up to you and Ed how much you want to be drawn in. You can be the kids' care-takers without condoning her actions. The two are separate and I hope she knows that. You are all still in my prayers....

Have a quiet Christmas until everyone grows up or moves on. God bless you all! (I went to do x's and o's and I got sosoosososososo) Save Our Souls XOXOXOXOOXOXOXOX",

Yes, it is tough, but like I said above, it's better to know now that the parents can't step up to the plate and something PERMANENT has to be done. How long do you think is long enough? 6 months? How long were you going to take care of them in limbo like this? And then rip the kids up and send them home? NO! The DCFis doing you a favour right now in a way. They are pushing the issue to make the kids wake up. It's family time now or NEVER. Your other concerns with knives and drugs are police issues. You have the RIGHT to call the cops on them!!! Yes! If you find out their is physical abuse you have the RIGHT to get your daughter and grands out of it. But it won't be resolved by band-aids. This is a safe place for you to piss and moan. You HAVE to keep us in the loop. This is your haven and this will be the hardest couple of weeks for you. Forget Christmas!! This would be bad at any time of year. Just fake it till you make it. Something will be resolved around all this. Even if it's you calling the cops and getting them jailed. But something PERMANENT has to be resolved. This is too serious for a temporary assistance stance. Now you KNOW I LOVE you. I am HERE for you. You know that.",

Sounds like she will be fine, but what a pain! I went to the ER once with a sewing machine needle right through my finger. With the thread still on! Everyone walked by to take a look until I finally put a towel over it and I guess they would feel too rude to ask to see it. Thank goodness it was a new needle and not dull...I left with a bandaid. The freezing before the \"pull out\" hurt more than anything. Fingers are really bony and there is no soft tissue to put the needle in. The freezing needle, not the sewing needle.

Sure the kids could afford that, but they'd have to buy the suits when winter starts and they wouldn't be that cheap. I am blessed that I can do this....I even have 3 sets of crocs for them for summer! ehehehehhe",

Cathi, you'll live on in imortality! Woo hoo to you, too! Lisa, Lisa, Lisa. When Paul and I moved in together, the first hiccup we got he actually sat down and told me to \"move out by Friday\". We still laugh about it to this day, 17 years later! hehehehehe (Don't know if I'm stubborn, or smart.....) When we had started to get serious, he told me he wanted to meet me one night. I thought \"this is it!\" Duh on me, he told me that he was starting to get deep feelings for me and therefore he thought we should split up. Again, stubborn me....hehehehehehe Men dont' know what they want until you tell them! Also, his kids are probably telling him to slow down. Is there financial issues here? Does he have money his kids may be trying to \"protect\" from you? It is always something other than what we think. Men are'nt deep, they're just well-hidden. Val, congrats!

You probably are boring to her at times as she needs stimulus to develop. She needs social interaction and Landon isn't there anymore. She needs a schedule and a regimen. She isn't getting mommay and daddy time now, so how is putting her in daycare going to make that worse? Now, having said all that, if you were talking about putting her in an orphanage I'm sure I wouldn't be the first one down your throat! Maybe doing this will show Amanada the seriousness of her ways. You are prepared to go on a guilt trip if you do this (I know you by now!) and that is wrong. The BEST thing you can give Ella at this time is a routine. She deserves it and so do you. How about 5 mornings a week and then you and her nap together in the afternoon? Maybe a full day is to long for you both at this time.... Amanda can go suck eggs. As was already said, her opinion means absolutely nothing in all this! We already know the way she thinks, and that hasn't worked out so good so far now, has it? You don't want to become a martyr....be very, very careful.",

Do what you're doing and ignore this and see it repeated month after month, dragging you along in the drama and scraping the kids along with you. Call the authorities (not police, the kids advocates or whatever) and have them intervene. Put Amanda under psychiatric care. They can hold her for assessment where she can't leave. She said she was going to kill herself. A story from up here? A young mother said that. No one listened, but the husband was spinning because SHE had custody and he'd been telling everyone she was nuts. What did she do? She videoed herself drowining her 2 kids (1 1/2 and 2 1/2) in the bathtub and laid them out dead on the bed. All the time recording it saying \"You're not going to get them!\" She didn't hurt herself. Now the husband doesn't even have joint custody as his kids are dead. What do you want to do? Cathi?

They have your case tied so tight you don't have a chance! I once sued Sears for wrongful dismissal and it never got settled. I spent about $12-15,000 in legal fess and when they realized it was just hanging, they gave me $10,000. My Dad was a VICE PRESIDENT of Sears, Human Resources!! He was retired, but he was the one that set the system up!! The store (furnishings) had gone to all the support staff to try to rustle up anything on me (I was in sales) and there were little hand-written notes in my file with no dates on them and no initials from me that I saw them!! It was a real cockpile of shit! It took 2 1/2 years and was NOT worth the stress!!! They said I was fired because I \"didn't fit\". I, and my other coworkers, know I was fired because someone who'd been with the company for 27 years didn't like me. I sold better than her and I was part-time! It just became a pissing contest - he said/she said. Courts hate that kind of crap. I only got the the Disovery part and that's when Sears realized I might have a case! So all in all, do you have thousands to squander? I know I was right! Sears knew I was right! BUT there was someone who had wormed her way into the morals and ethics of the other workers and they were afraid of her power. So I lost. It sounds an awful lot like your case. Fuck 'em. Don't put your tail between your legs. Hold your head high and walk away. They have the money to fight you and they know it. Let it go. A toxic portion of your life has just been peeled off your heart and soul. Now you can take a deep breath and watch them tumble into oblivion without you! Can you do that for me???? Sheila, I've been wondering about your job prospects. Bullshit on the unemployment! Go to a government office. Let them see how \"old\" you are. The stats are for younger kids!",
