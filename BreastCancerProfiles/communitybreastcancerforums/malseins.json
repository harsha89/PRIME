The radiologist said I could have a biopsy or see the surgeon to have it removed. I made an appointment with the surgeon, because the discharge and pain don't show any signs of stopping, and I don't want to go through a biopsy, only to then have surgery. Can anyone give me their opinion if this is a good choice? I have had microcalcifications biosied 9 months ago that were benign. Does anyone know if this puts me at a greater chance for DCIS? Thanks in advance, I am worried... Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "malseins wrote: I am writing from that treatment decision crossroad that many have faced and am hoping to hear some advice on my situation from those that know more than me... I had surgery 6 months ago for nipple discharge, duct ectasia and a \"lesion\" seen on ductogram. The pathology report stated that what was removed showed no etiology for nipple discharge nor the lesion and it was not clear that \"the targeted lesion was removed\". I had my 6 month ultrasound and a mass was seen at the previous surgical site, as well as another one in an area I pointed out that I felt a lump. I had a core needle biopsy and it showed papillomas with no atypical cells. My doctor recommended watching them, but said she would remove them if I wanted to. Since that conversation, I felt another lump similar to that which turned out to be a papilloma. At this point, I have done some research and read the articles and posts, and feel that I should have them removed. I feel worried because these seem to have come on quickly, they don't show on mammogram, and they only ultrasound where they suspect something not the whole breast. I also have been having stabbing pain in these areas. I am considering asking for an MRI, to hopefully find everything, and have it removed with one surgery. I don't want to repeat surgery again because something was missed. I cannot find much information on whether an MRI will see them well. I also hope I am making the right decision to have them out and not just doing this out of fear. Ay information would be greatly appreciated, I only wish I had the hindsight that many of you have to make this decision on. Log in to post a reply",

My excision was wire guided also, but they had a lot of trouble finding the duct on that ductogram, so Iwonder if they got it in the right place...they removed other dilated ducts also, so the discharge did stop. I guess your experience means that they can't always see the papilloma on MRI? Would they do a full breast ultrasound and would that be helpful?",

My gut is telling me that only by getting them out will I know for sure, but needed a reality check that this is not just my fear. I read your profile and my heart goes out to you for all you've been through, but it is also reassuring in your positive outlook and bravery. Thank you, I will be making that call in the morning.",
