I agree with everthing that has been said above, but I just want to add one thing.... Drink water, drink water, drink water. This helps the chemo to get out of your system quicker and then it doesn't remain in your stomach, or mouth for as long. And you won't get so constipated. Hang in there!  This is definately a life changing journey. \"Be strong and courageous\"",

If any of the lumps look suspicious, the radiologist will probably want to schedule a biopsi. If they look like they are full of fluid, they will say they are probably cysts. To be on the safe side, I would ask for biopsies, especially if any of your family has had cancer. When I went in for mammogram and knew I had a lump, I was told they wanted me to have an ultra sound that same morning. After the ultra sound, they wanted to order a biopsi. They wanted me to come in on another day-I told them I would really appreciate if they could do it that same afternoon. They fit it in to their schedule. Don't be afraid to ask questions, and to speak up for yourself. Do you have someone going with you? I would encourage that as well. I really hope they are cysts-even though I was diagnosed with cancer, my daughter has gone in twice for lumps, and they have been cysts. So, don't think the worst. Please let us know how it goes. Wish you the best, Carla",
