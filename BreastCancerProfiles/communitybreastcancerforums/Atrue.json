I chose the MASTECTOMY my mother had CANCER two years ago and my father DIED from pancreatic cancer as well two years ago but also due to the sisters on both of my parents side of the family have and had BREAST CANCER in which my father's sister DIED from STAGE 4 breast cancer.   I then went for my MRI before Christmas and THANK GOD it didn't spread but now I have decided to prayerfully get a bilateral mastectomy with IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION.  I have an appointment this week with the plastic surgeon to discuss my reconstruction options for my upcoming surgery.  He will discuss the surgery date with my BR next week to inform me of my surgery.   I will keep everyone updated on my outcome due to \"PASH\" is SUPPOSED to be a VERY RARE NONE CANCEROUS TUMOR but would suggest to EVERYONE now due to my outcome of CANCER to have it REMOVED as soon as possible because I was told by my BR that \"IF\" I would have WAITED that year as the radiologist informed me to do at the hospital when I was diagnosed with \"FIBROADENOMA\" that my DCIS CANCER could have spread throughout my body from my  \"FIBROADENOMA\" that was PAINFUL & GREW to my now NONE CANCEROUS RARE PASH that \"IS\" CANCEROUS!  ",
