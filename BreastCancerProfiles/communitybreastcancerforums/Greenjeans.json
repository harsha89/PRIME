I've had a hysterectomy, will check about removing overies. Any thoughts out there, mine being such a small ca.and getting really wide margins, Dr. took out 40 grams of tissue this time ( 34 D size breast) I fell I might be opening a can of worms.

Got very close on the first lumpectomy, went in and got really wide margins on the second lumpectomy. I'm leaning toward having my overies removed in place of taking the Tamoxifin. Hot flashes I've been having for years, it's all the other side effects, blood clots, liver cancer, ect. Jeanne",

It is very common to have to have a second surgery for clean margins.One the first one I had a needle localization and lumpectomy. I was right on the edge of being clear but the Dr. was concerned that he may have missed a trace. He removed 40 grams of tissue on the second one. Mine was 6mm,DCIS stage 0, grade 2, cribiform and solid pattern  ER+/PR+. very small, only that one spot. My 1st sugery was hell, the second one I breezed through. My husband worked in surgery for 11 years and said he has never seen anyone go in so upbeat, talking like crazy and come out the same way. My advice is to read all you can, go with you gut, be your own boss and do whats right for you. Lumpectomy was the way to go for me and I've decided,- that I more than likely will not do rads. or Tamoxifin. I have already had a hysterectomy - 3 yrs. ago- still have my overies. I had horrible endometrosis( spelling??) and have been having menapausal symptoms for years- hot flashes, night sweets. I'll get my hormone levels checked to see if my overies are shutting down or how far they are. I'm only 44 and very healthy and in good physical shape and I want to hold on to that as long as I can. No guarentees in life thats for sure.Oh and PRAY all you can if your a praying woman. God has touched my life and I thank him for that. Keep us posted this is a great site and there very stong ladied here. Oh check out the Oct. issue of Self magazine there is a large artical about BC. I have not finished it yet, so I dont know where it is going with issues of BC. Take Care Jeanne",
