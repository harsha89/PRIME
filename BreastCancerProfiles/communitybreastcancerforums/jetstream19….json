Its been along journey of ups & downs. Finding my maze through this life of bc just like my new sisters & old sisters are doing now. I was so grateful to of only had stage 1 cancer. But the arimidex has caused me so many side affects throughout  almost 5 yrs of my journey. It seems the worst of it is taking place now. I am suffering from deep depression & am on ativan to help ease them up. Its only been like the last month that I hv noticed it being worse. Has anyone been this close to being done with their therepy & are having the same systoms that I am?   I have  suffered some tragadies in my life in the last five yrs. Of course, I am Mom & problems just don't go away when you come down with bc. Here I am at the last, & I am so tempted to throw the last of it down. Of course I know that I will always wonder what if I hadn't of done that or what can happen if I do. 2 mos, yes 2mos to go & I will be done. If I may be so bold as to give advice on this part, keep talking to ur onc & not let him hv a deaf ear on the subject. Keep at him till he maybe can help you. It can be very dibilitating having deprssion along with trying to battle cancer. Doctors sometimes just look at the mechanics of the disease, & not look to close at the patient & what is happening in her life or how the med makes you feel.  Please be persistent! The medication can also make you very tired. Please tell your husband or your family & friends that if there is anything that they could do for you, especially young mothers, have them to watch your kids while you take a time out for yourself.  Be good to yourself bc sisters! You deserve it! Living with this disease can of course be overwhelming in soooo many ways! I hope that I have helped someone today.  My part of this journey is almost over. Of course it will never be completly over, but maybe alittle simpler! My prays & love go out to each & everyone of you!! Thanks for listening! Jet",
