I had a mammogram 3 years ago at 40 and skipped the past 2 years. The mammogram is done at a different building than my physical so I figured I would go get it done. I hadn't heard of calcifications before and will definitely be going regularly now! I will keep hoping you both get good news!",

So happy and hope you get the same results. As I was told, 80% are benign. They did show me the samples they took and it looked like quite a few. I was going to ask about that but didn't.",
