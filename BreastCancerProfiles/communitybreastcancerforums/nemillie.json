Your story sounds very similar to mine. I am a divorced mother of 2 (17 year old and a 12 year old). I also needed to stay employed to keep my health insurance. I was worried about the side effects of chemo and how I would manage running a home, children, and work. People, some that I didn't know, have provide meals, support, care of the kids, basically anything that was needed. As far as my chemo, I had 4 treatments of dd AC and the 16 weeks of taxatore (2 left) I take the day of treatments off, and have worked almost every day that I was scheduled. I was able to drive myself to all of my appointments and experienced very little nausea. I went in with the idea that I would not let the treatments make me sick and when I started feeling queezy I drank grape juice and walked. I am firm believer that helped me stay stronger. Hope this helps...(my ex is in Iraq...and my nearest family lives 7 hours away) You will make it!!!",

Has anyone else experienced this? I start taxatore this week...worried about more bone pain. On the bright side...I have terrible allergies. Since having chemo my allergies are gone!",
