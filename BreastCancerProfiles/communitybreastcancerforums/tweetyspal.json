I have the most common form of bc Stage 2, Grade 2 I immediately called my friends and people i knew who are already in the club. it helped. . . i have to wait until tomorrow to make mri appt and surgeon appts.  i have a bad case of the what ifs. .. what if the mri shows more cancer other places, . . what if my heart isn't good and they cant operate . . . what if i Gods will in this is not the same as the desire of my heart. . . i am 47 single with good friends and faith in God... i have a mentally ill mom i take care and want to be there for, love my job as a teacher, and my pet sitting business, and just life, i know i am going on a bit. i just feel petrified and beaten by the what ifs today .. . not sleeping is difficult . . praying helps, listening to music, counting my blessings and thinking of those who care, but i just think the what ifs are winning a bit today.Thanks for listening to a newbie.
