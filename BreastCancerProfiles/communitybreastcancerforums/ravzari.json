That, and even if I put the straps on it, it still slipped all over the place. I ended up buying a post-surgical vest from Underworks (Power Compression Post Surgical Vest) that worked a LOT better; as a bonus, since it's compression down to the hips, it also easily folds up over itself for extra compression if I feel like I want that. I also like that it has two rows of hook and eye closures so I can choose between a looser fit and a firmer fit. I'm not wearing it during the day anymore as my PS gave me the OK to not wear compression if it was comfortable to go without it at 4 weeks, but I do still wear it (only fastened down to about where it hits the end of my sternum) at night. If you're curious about it, I posted pics and a longer description in this thread: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/82/topics...  Edit to add: I found myself slouching a lot more after my surgery, I think out of an unconscious (and irrational!) effort to 'not pull anything open' by accidentally stretching or standing too straight. It didn't hurt to stand up straight, I was just unnecessarily wary of doing it and still have to remind myself to not slouch. As a bonus, I guess, at the stage of healing I'm at slouching is now uncomfortable as it bunches up chest tissue that's reforming attachments to my chest wall and trying to unswell itself so if I slouch now my chest aches and reminds me to stand or sit up straight again.",

Every few days I notice it feels a bit softer and looks a bit flatter, but it could be several months before it's completely not swollen and totally flat. My assumption is that the areas that aren't flat will feel firm to hard while they're still swollen. I'd imagine, if there was reconstruction done immediately, that the look and feel is a bit different and I don't have experience with that, unfortunately. If you get hardness with extra swelling where things weren't very swollen before--and you know you haven't done anything to overexert yourself--or it feels hot/tender to the touch, I'd recommend contacting your doctor as that can be a sign of infection. My surgeon also told me to make sure and let her know if I had a 'feeling of fullness' in the area, like my chest was stuffy or full of liquid as well.  If you didn't elect to have reconstruction, I know this sounds weird, but I found reading through FtM top surgery boards (Susan's Place has a great one with a ton of info) was SUPER helpful as that surgery is essentially a double mastectomy (most being double incision) with nipple grafts and occasionally some minor resculpting to make the chest appear more masculine or at least flat as opposed to concave, but the healing process is really, really similar to a plain old double mastectomy. Those forums were incredibly helpful for me to look through as a lot of people will post about their healing process, with questions, and will post pics of their healing process; seeing those helped me know what to expect a little better and how to manage expectations of what my scars and grafts should look like early on. While I'm not FtM, it was still a very, very similar procedure that they have done to achieve a flat chest, and it was a good resource to have available.  ",

Sometimes they're short little zaps, sometimes they last for a couple of minutes. It's annoying, but also part of the healing process and I've just learned to ignore it. For me, it's painful sure, but more on the 'annoying' level of painful as opposed to the near a 10 on the scale level. On occasion, instead of an electric feeling pain it feels almost like a mild muscle cramp which I've also been told is normal for healing as swelling goes down and what's left reattaches to my chest wall. My chest, internally, also itches on occasion, along with the zapping feeling of pain going across where my breasts used to be. Up until about midway through week 3 I didn't have any pain, but that kind of makes sense as the final stretch of initial healing is between weeks 4-6 without reconstruction and the final stretch of healing wounds can sometimes be the most uncomfortable. It's pretty common, and for most people, it goes away after a few months though I've heard some women end up with random 'zaps' of pain like that even a few years down the road, but they lessen in intensity and duration.  That said, if what you're having is a constant, high level, unrelenting pain that isn't helped by painkillers, it may be worth contacting your doctor just to be on the safe side.",

It's DEFINITELY something to really think over before making a decision, especially since two of the three options (recon--which might possibly involve surgery on the remaining breast to help make the two more matching, removing the other breast, or doing nothing and staying as is) will involve more surgery, which would obviously mean more downtime and recovery. If you haven't already, I'd highly recommend reading through the Breast Reconstruction forum on this site as there are a lot of good threads that detail the positives and not so positives of various types of reconstruction. I know there was a thread at one time for women who had recon with an implant over the muscle as well. Realself.com is also a pretty good site, as they have sections for breast reconstruction and for 'regular' breast augmentations and possibly the breast reduction/lift sections if you're thinking that might be necessary on your remaining breast to get the two as symmetrical as possible; it might be helpful to read through those reviews if you're not already, both the 'worth it' and 'not worth it' ones to get a wider idea of the possible pros and cons of what the outcome could be.",

The recon form has a couple threads about over the muscle implants, but you may need a few rounds of fat grafting as well to avoid having ripples or the implant edges showing since the implant edges are usually hidden by a combination of skin tissue and natural breast tissue (which you obviously would not have on that side). Recon is usually covered by insurance, if you're in the US, if your mastectomy was done for medical reasons and not cosmetic reasons so, basically, if they covered your initial mastectomy, they'll generally cover the reconstruction as well. Keep in mind it may take more than one surgery to make things look good & even and, depending on the shape/size of your remaining breast, they may recommend a lift or a lift and reduction of that breast to help make it easier to match the implanted side to it and, after 6 years of nothing there, you'd likely have to have tissue expanders for several months first, then an exchange to implants so it's not going to be a 'one and done' procedure. Recon likely wouldn't affect the nerve issues you're having and could potentially make them worse, so that is something to keep in mind. It's also possible the whole area would go numb which, while better than itching, may not be something worth it for you to risk. If you'd rather go flat instead of trying to reconstruct the already flat side, check with your insurance company; they may cover the cost of a prophylactic mastectomy on your remaining breast since you'd already be considered high risk for breast cancer if you've already had a tumor or tumors that were removed with the mastectomy you've already had. That's not risk free either, however; it's possible that, even after 6+ months, you could end up with the same itchiness as you already have and you likely will have numb patches. There isn't a good way to predict prior to having the surgery whether you'd have a similar outcome or not, unfortunately.  Numbness, either in patches or over the whole area, is considered a pretty normal long term side effect due to how many nerves are cut during the surgery; some repair just fine, some partially repair, and some never do. The constant itching isn't really normal though, at least, not 1+ years out; I'm guessing you've probably already brought it up numerous times to doctors though so I won't tell you to do that. You did mention pressure seems to help with it though, have you tried wearing compression tops under your shirt to see if that provides some relief? My scars and skin were pretty sensitive for close to 8 months after my BMX and I had to wear pretty tight shapewear tops to be able to even wear shirts because loose fabric rubbing on the area bounced between 'kind of annoying' and 'okay that really hurts'. If that's not something you've tried yet, it might be worth a shot.",

Since he straight up recommended getting a plastic surgeon involved to 'clean things up' after he did the actual mastectomy part, that's what I did. While that's not true for ALL general surgeons, it's definitely worth asking about. Either way, you do want to be repetitively clear that you do NOT plan on reconstruction and do not want extra skin left, as some surgeons will leave it 'just in case' if you're not really loud about not wanting that done as many surgeons just assume all women will eventually want reconstruction even though that's not something they should be assuming. Sometimes, even with a PS involved, you'll need a revision, usually for dog ears (extra bits of fatty tissue and skin at the ends of the incision line). If you're overweight, the chances of developing dog ears tends to be higher as it can be difficult to get it right in one shot. I had a dog ear on my right--and I am slightly overweight--that they excised about 9 months after my original surgery; insurance generally covers revisions to a surgery that was done out of medical necessity (as opposed to a cosmetic only surgery that you paid for out of pocket). I have pretty even scars, with the one on the left being longer as I had more breast tissue on that side, though it's pretty moot now as the tattoo to cover them up is finished and, aside from the tiny bit of the longer scar poking out on the left (which is under my arm anyway) you can't tell I have scars at all.",

I didn't do any recon, and it took about 8 weeks before I felt 'normal' again (i.e. had full range of motion and the pain was mostly gone with most movements). I didn't feel physically comfortable doing full on adult hugs until about that time; I was just too sore and stretching my arms out like that was a little painful. As long as I didn't get squeezed tightly by the person hugging me I could do loose hugs without lifting my arms much though. That's probably a bit different than having kids hug you though; I haven't got kids and am never around kids, but I'd guess after a couple of weeks if they're old enough to understand how to be really gentle, they could most likely hug you without causing discomfort once the drains are out. While you still have drains it, it'd definitely be uncomfortable to be hugged anywhere around your chest area, because drains overall are just an uncomfortable PITA to have. As for picking them up, you'd want to talk to your surgeon; I had lifting restrictions for 8 weeks (nothing over 5lb for the first 2 weeks, nothing over 10lb up until 8 weeks), then 'go slowly, starting at 10lb and if that's uncomfortable wait another week or two before trying again' instructions. Just as a weight reference, it was about 4 months or so before I was comfortable picking up our 20lb dog. After 6 months I was back to normal in terms of what I could lift without discomfort, but everyone is different and some people have no trouble lifting 20+lb after 6-8 weeks. If you have TEs in place, I'm honestly not sure, but I'm guessing someone else who has had them will have better info.",

My back and shoulders no longer hurt, shirts fit, nothing jiggles when I walk, run, or go up and down stairs, and I honestly wish now I'd saved up years ago to have them removed. Recovery was pretty easy; the drains were annoying, but not unbearable, and I didn't really need pain meds at all, even right after surgery. I'm about 4 1/2 months out and, aside from some residual swelling (which can last for 8-12 months), everything has been 'back to normal' since about 6 weeks. For me I don't regret a single little thing about having a BMX. I'm more comfortable both physically and WAY more confident in my appearance (in my head, when I pictured myself, I always had small, barely there breasts, not big ol' saggy DDs, so now being flat matches with how I always pictured myself. Bonus! ) than I ever have been in the past. Even my husband has noticed that I seem a lot more confident and comfortable as well, which he thought was odd as he just assumed a woman in general would be pretty down about losing her breasts and I was almost ecstatic that they were gone. My PS thought I was having a weird reaction to the anesthetic as the first thing I said to her when I woke up was, \"They're gone right? I can't feel any of the usual pain.\" \"Yes.\" \"Oh, thank GOD! I'm so happy, you don't even know!\" I guess 20+ years of chronic pain will do that though, especially when it's suddenly 100% relieved. Without wanting to seem dramatic about it, the pain from healing from surgery and even from the drains was absolutely nothing compared to the constant stabbing, burning pain that was always present in the breast tissue prior to my BMX; nothing touched that pain and my breasts being compressed (like in a hug), squeezed, etc...made it worse and made them almost throb for hours afterward. On pain scales I'd tell them it was around a 9-10, the pain I'd rate the post-BMX? 1-2 when in comparison to what I had before. 4 1/2 months out I have no pain at all left and it's the first time I can remember since puberty that my chest hasn't hurt. My only regret is that I didn't look into family history sooner and had them removed in my early 20s; it would've saved me a decade of chronic pain, which insurance didn't deem a 'viable' reason for a mastectomy.",

B) Choose to get fitted for a breast form that will be similar or close enough in size to their remaining breast to fill out the other side of a mastectomy bra (they have pockets inside the cup to insert a prosthesis into). In some cases, insurance will cover the prosthesis and speciality bras, so it's definitely worth checking with your insurance plan to see if being fitted for a prosthesis and mastectomy bra is something they will cover.

If you have raised/keloid type scars, however, silicone sheeting isn't likely to provide much of a reduction or improvement; keloid or raised scarring usually has to be treated either with laser treatments or sometimes with scar revision surgery, though if you're prone to keloids there's no guarantee they won't come back after a revision surgery.",

My PS told me, without reconstruction, it'll take at least one full year to be considered fully healed and most people still have soreness and swelling for at least 6-8 months after the surgery. With recon, her outlook was the same, just from the date of the final reconstruction surgery instead of from the BMX. I'd say being sore and uncomfortable 4 weeks out, especially with TEs, is pretty normal. Frustrating, but normal.",

Ah, that's what free nipple grafting is good for, if you're able to keep your nipples. It likely wouldn't work too well with tissue expanders, but if you're planning to stay flat or do delayed reconstruction, it may be an option. My breasts were too large and saggy to do a traditional nipple sparing mastectomy; it would have left me with 'permanent headlights' and a 'puckered looking AA cup', which isn't at all what I wanted. I just wanted to be flat and have a relatively normal looking chest. So, my PS and I decided to go with free nipple grafts; you can even request them to be resized if you don't like how large yours are naturally. I didn't have mine resized, however, and they look fine and were put back on where one would expect to find nipples on a chest. She's also done top surgery (which is just a bmx, usually with free nipple grafting, and some fat transfer to give the chest a more masculine contour) on FtM people before as well, so she has experience with nipple grafting. If you want to keep your nipples but can't do a traditional nipple sparing mastectomy due to breast size/sagginess, it's definitely worth asking about nipple grafting instead.",

The best way to find out is to check with your insurance company directly if you don't want to wait for the surgeon to submit authorization and have it come back potentially denied. If you're BRCA-2, chances are high they'll cover a full hysto, if you're not it's really going to depend on the insurance plan + what your medical team recommends (and even then, a recommendation doesn't always guarantee approval). One benefit of having everything removed will be it will close to negate your chance of developing uterine cancer and, if the cervix is also removed, cancer of the cervix. If you have issues with uterine fibroids or endometriosis, removal of the uterus will clean that right up as well. Depending on how they decide to do a full hysto, your recovery time could be longer; most times it's all done laproscopically as that means smaller scars and less trauma but some cases still indicate the bigger abdominal incision to get everything out, and that'll add to recovery time. You'd want to find out prior what they plan to do if you have a full hysto done. 2) Can't help you on that one; after looking into it, I decided against reconstruction and am happy flat. I'm sure others who opted for reconstruction will chime in, and you can always check out the Breast Reconstruction forum for a lot of info on various reconstruction options. 3) It will happen if you have your ovaries removed as they're what produces the bulk of the hormones; if you just had your uterus removed, but left the ovaries, you wouldn't enter menopause as your ovaries would still be there producing hormones (even if they're doing their job poorly due to the PCOS). 4) I'll have to pass on that one, as I still have my ovaries and am not old enough for menopause to hit yet. :) 5) I'll pass on that one too, as my mastectomy was preventative.

A massive bruise is kind of what I DO have under the surface, but the skin on top looks fine.

When I switched to the awful velcro tube top I got with the original mastectomy those problems stopped, so she OK'd me to wear either that or a sports bra. One problem: I got rid of ALL of my bras after my mastectomy! Figured I'd never need them again, but, man, the velcro tube top was pretty uncomfortable too due to the bunchy velcro. Ordered an Under Armor compression sports bra a size smaller than I'd normally wear (when I had the DD's I'd have worn a large or XL, so I went with a medium), paid extra for 1 day delivery and, aside from it being an adventure to get on since it's technically a bit too small, it fits nicely and is actually comfortable. Comfortable is a nice change from the last couple weeks. :D  It feels...foreign to have a bra on again though, I've been not wearing one for so long, and it reminds me of how much I disliked bras anyway! Plus, having one on makes my brain assume, \"Hey, you got boobs again!\" and I keep expecting to find them there!",

Those two things together heighten the risk for dog ears, left over fat pockets, and weird lumps of fat that didn't seem like they'd present a cosmetic issue at the time. They also make it harder to guess right the first time as to what's 'too much fat' to leave behind to avoid having concave spots. My BMX was prophylactic so I didn't have to worry about margins, they just needed to get all the actual breast tissue out\u2014and I had a decent amount of fat to work with so she could try to make sure I didn't have concave spots. I did not have reconstruction other than to have my nipples re-grafted on; the only other instruction was to, \"please not leave me concave if it's possible.\" What I have at the moment: - Left side: What looks like a tiny AA pancake breast due to extra fatty tissue. When I stand in a normal position it looks almost like it's frowning with the scar. Needs to have the excess fat removed. In t-shirts it's pretty noticeable and looks like a tiny deflated boob, which I don't really like. For awhile, I figured it was just swelling, but the swelling has mostly disappeared now and there is a lot of fatty tissue left on that side. - Right side: Small dog ear, and on the outer edge of what was my breast there are two lumps of fatty tissue. The center is flat. Under shirts that one looks weird and it is noticeable. - Because neither side is truly flat, the nipples remain slightly stretched in an oval shape. If I pull the area flat (which I can do either with a hand or by stretching my arms up in a Y shape), they go round like they should. I sent a message to my PS' office as my 6 month followup is January 9th and let her know what the issues were and that I wanted to get revisions discussed and scheduled at that appointment. I also let them know that I need the area to be as flat as possible and didn't need/want the appearance of small breasts because I plan to tattoo over the scars in late 2017, so the area needs to be flat as a board by that time. It was super pleasing that they got back to me within 15 minutes of sending the message to schedule a call; I chatted with the nurse and we went over everything, she asked a few clarifying questions, asked if I could send pictures so the doctor had an idea prior of what was bothering me (I sent those yesterday afternoon and got confirmation that they were received), and she just wanted to make sure everything was clear and in my file so we didn't forget to go over anything next month. Not really worried about a second potential surgery, as I doubt everything I want fixed can be done under local, just mostly want to get the ball going on it as the sooner it gets done the less I'll have to push back the scar covering tattoo appointment.

Word of warning though, you probably have some internal stitches as well, still hanging around at week 3, and you may feel them start to pop as you massage the scars. It's unnerving but harmless.  I should also note that I did NOT have reconstruction; if you had immediate reconstruction, I'd recommend talking to your doctor about what kind of scar/tissue massage is safe to do as I don't have an answer for that as I didn't go through that experience.",

It's still worth loudly advocating for yourself, even if it's not cancer and is just painful cysts, to have something done about it. There are drugs that exist that can help some women, though they didn't help me, and they also recommend things like cutting out caffeine, cutting out a lot of processed foods, and generally the usual \"eat well and exercise\" not realizing that exercising can be excruciating if your complaint is breast pain and wearing a bra or having things bouncing around makes it WORSE. I never even got anyone to take me seriously until I started getting, for lack of a more appropriate forum word...witchy...toward doctors about it and stopped letting them brush me off with, \"Oh, it's normal to have breast pain!\" because it most certainly is NOT normal to have painful breasts all the time. The condition may be benign in most cases, but benign still doesn't mean normal. Other doctors tried to tell me I didn't know what I was talking about and it clearly couldn't be breast pain and I likely \"pulled a pec muscle\" (man, I'm too lazy to do that :D ) because I wasn't smart enough to differentiate between pain in the breast tissue and a pulled muscle on the chest. Fun fact, I am smart enough to tell the difference. ;) Honestly, if you don't mind the idea of being flat or having reconstruction, and BC runs in your family, it may be worth seeing if your insurance covers a prophylactic mastectomy without genetic testing; mine did, and when nobody else would/could do anything about the chronic pain, I jumped hard at the fact that I had a strong family history of BC to get the OK from the insurance company for a mastectomy. Since they've been gone, I've had no pain at all. Surprise, surprise.  These were some of the sources I used when I had insurance appeals to try and use the actual primary reason for requesting a mastectomy which, in my case, was pain. I did this before I knew I had a family history and it was once I mentioned it to my mom that she told me there was a long family history of both painful, cystic breasts and freakin' breast cancer. I'll past the relevant bits below the links; don't ever let any doctor tell you that constant, non-cyclical breast pain is \"normal\" because it isn't. It may not mean cancer, but it's not at all normal. Some of the articles mention drug (non-painkiller/opioid) therapies that, for most women, can help reduce or eliminate the pain; I was one of the unlucky 26% of non-cyclical breast pain patients that didn't respond to those treatments.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16163081 \"Mastodynia is among the most frequently reported symptoms in women with breast complaints; it is usually classified as cyclic, noncyclic, or nonbreast in origin. A useful response with medical or conservative therapy is obtained in the majority of these patients. There is a subset of patients, however, who have exhausted every medical effort and psychiatric counseling and will desire mastectomy with breast reconstruction in the hope of alleviating their chronic pain. METHODS: Three patients with noncyclical, bilateral mastodynia referred for breast reconstruction options from December of 2000 to March of 2004 are presented in this article. Daily breast pain charts with a visual analogue scale for pain assessment were analyzed and recorded for all patients throughout the study period. RESULTS: Two patients underwent delayed reconstruction and had complete resolution of pain 6 to 8 weeks after bilateral mastectomy, with no recurrence of mastalgia after reconstruction. One patient underwent bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction and achieved complete resolution of her pain 3 months postoperatively. Histopathologic findings of all breast specimens revealed benign breast tissue with proliferative breast disease consistent with mastodynia. CONCLUSIONS: This modality, which includes mastectomy with or without reconstruction, is a viable alternative after exhaustion of all other nonsurgical options and when quality of life is significantly affected. Although mastectomy for the treatment of mastodynia refractory to medical therapy does not guarantee alleviation of chronic breast pain, it should be considered in these often desperate patients.\"   http://sogc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/170E-CPG-January20061.pdf This source is most frequently cited in insurance denials, but if one actually reads the study, one finds that they do not, across the board, state that a bilateral mastectomy is never recommended; the statement is that it should not be recommended as the first course of treatment, and that it absolutely should be considered after all other possible avenues of treatment have been exhausted, including the methods most commonly prescribed to treat mastodynia and mastalgia. \"A retrospective chart analysis of this latter group found that only those women who had had a mastectomy for mastalgia were pain-free following surgery\" [...] \"Davies et al. concluded that surgery for mastalgia should be considered only in a minority of women who are resistant to all other forms of treatment. \"  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14965747 \" Mastalgia is resistant to treatment in 6% of cyclical and 26% non-cyclical patients. Surgery is not widely used to treat this condition and only considered in patients with severe mastalgia resistant to medication. \"",

I've seen a few other posts around this forum where that was recommended and it seemed to provide some pretty good results. From what I've learned, adhesions form the scar tissue at a surgical site, especially in breast surgery, aren't terribly uncommon either. There's also a possibility that it's neuropathic pain too; in that case, massage can still help, but it may not resolve the issue and you may want to talk to a pain specialist about it.",

That was part of my worry too, like, how am I going to find a lump in a bag of lumps? :D As for your age, in all honesty, I was asking my parents about a mastectomy when I was a teenager mine were so painful, but everyone told me I'd grow out of it; I thought about it all through my 20s but didn't know how to ask, if it'd be covered, or if anyone would even listen and it turned out to be the 'nobody took it seriously' option that happened until I got really, really pushy about it at around 34. I would say don't wait and suffer more than you have to; I really wish I'd been more proactive in my own care in that regard in my 20s, it would have saved me living with chronic pain for 10+ years and 10+ years of keeping an arm folded over my chest so my husband didn't accidentally touch or squeeze anything which would cause more pain. He's STILL afraid to touch my chest now because of those 10+ years of, \"Don't touch me there, it hurts like hell.\" even though there is absolutely 0 pain anymore now that they're gone. Edit to add: The first time I had a FEMALE doctor do a breast exam on me, as opposed to my male GP, her first response was to stop after about two moves and say, \"Your breasts are really dense and fibrous, it feels like wood grain with knots in it.\" A mammogram kind of confirmed that, and showed that I had super dense, fibrous, cystic breasts (all benign). I did end up with a diagnosis of fibrosystic breast disease. The joke with me and that doctor was that I had 'woody breasts'. And, as much as I like my GP (he's a family friend and I've known him since I was a little kid), he has no idea what he's doing with breast exams because every time he was all, \"Yeah, that feels normal to me.\"",

If you don't like the abdominal compression part of it, you just don't have to hook it up all the way down; when I slept in it, I'd just do up the first four or five hooks to get chest compression but not abdominal compression. During the day I'd sometimes hook it all the way down just for the slimming effect. ;)  Edit to add, you can also hook it up all the way down and fold it up over on itself to get something about the length of a sports bra that provides extra compression; I did that a few times on days when things were extra achey, though I wouldn't leave it like that for more than 4-6 hours tops as it'll start to hurt your ribs with the extra tightness.",

I walked like a funny penguin from the waist up when I had mine to avoid bumping them as my arms moved. How long they stay in depends on how much fluid her body produces; when I had mine, the surgeon said when I had 2-3 days of the drains consistently putting out less than 30ml in a 24 hour period they could come out. For me, mine dropped from 37ml per 24 hour period to 20ml per 24 hour period within two days, but the surgeon then told me to be on the safe side she wanted to wait a full 7 days as, if the drains are pulled too early, you run the risk of producing and retaining more fluid than can be reabsorbed efficiently by the body (and leaving a 'standing pool' like that can interfere with tissue re-adhesion and can cause infection pockets, neither of which are good outcomes) and they sometimes have to do another small surgery to re-insert drains. After day 2 for me, mine never produced more than 14ml in a 24 hour period though. However, some peoples' bodies are different and produce more fluid for a longer period (i've read it's more common to have that happen with immediate reconstruction since there's a foreign body in the site, but I've also read that it makes no difference from other sources! Back to that 'all bodies are different' thing again. ;)). On average, most people will have their drains in 7-14 days, but for some people it can be longer. It just depends on how their body heals.  I can't really help with the diet, though I do have one friend who had a large reduction (from a GG cup to a C cup) who is a Type 1 diabetic and, while she was healing from surgery, she made certain to eat a lot of high protein, high good fat (like the fat that comes on/with meat; skin, bone marrow, that kind of thing), low carb (so fruits and starchy veggies were a very, very small part of her diet), low to no processed/boxed/take out food diet while she was healing. She also supplemented with liquid multivitamins after day 3, as well as a liquid probiotic. However, like with the drains, everyone's body is different, and everyone's body reacts to diabetes a bit differently; that and Type 1 is different than Type 2. The type 2 diabetics I know haven't had surgery, but have had the best luck managing blood sugar spikes by sticking to a low carb (and any carbs they get come from fresh fruits and veggies, alas, this means little to no bread), high protein, high fat diet. I'm not diabetic, but for healing I switched my diet to something pretty similar to the diet my Type 1 friend has, and it worked out pretty well.",

Not \"probably benign\", straight up benign. It's also likely the root cause of all the chronic pain I had in my actual breasts while they were still on me, so I'm doubly glad they're gone both because I'm high risk due to family history and because they were so awfully painful when they were around. It was interesting to find out that my left breast was 35 grams larger than the right breast, as I thought it was the opposite based on the incision length; apparently my breast tissue on the right extended further under my arm than it did on the left, so that one got the longer incision. I may have a tiny dog ear starting on the right incision, but it's still pretty swollen (only 4 weeks out) so the plan is to keep an eye on it for a few months and if it does dog ear, they'll just do a revision on it at that point. Absolutely zero regrets having the BMX done as prevention, though, as in my family if they're going to turn cancerous, it tends to start in the mid-40s and I'm nearly 37. They're going to follow up with the high risk clinic to see if I still need to come in for twice yearly checkups or mammograms (with a wand, since there's no breast tissue left to squeeze in the plates)--or possibly ultrasounds instead of mammograms or not; I find that out probably next week.

I also showed her that the weird, lumpy shapes (including the crease of the folded nipple!) are visible under a regular t-shirt, which she also found to be unacceptable (thankfully, because I sure found it unacceptable!). Her preliminary though is that the big 'bra roll' on the left and the dog ear on the right can be excised and hopefully we can get the rest of the excess fat out with liposuction instead of having to open the whole area back up.

The best you can find are non-shaped (i.e. no foam cups) bralettes/'lounging' bras in your band size, but they might still be baggy where the cups are depending on your body shape. If you have a small enough frame, those 'training bras' for young girls might also work. Sports bras will also generally fit if you get ones without molded cups; the compression style ones are designed to be flat (and flatten) so those usually work best for not having lumps or gaps, but they don't really work under something formal/fancy as the backs or straps may stick out or be obvious that it's a sports bra; that wouldn't bother me as I'm not exactly fashion forward, but others may find it an undesirable look.

The only doctors I managed to get interested in what was going on without getting *ahem* witchy with them were female doctors save for the general surgeon I had and he was amazing--I'd been worried that a male surgeon would try to talk me out of it, but he didn't once try to dissuade me stating that he could tell I'd done my research and had tried every other available treatment they knew of so he was confident that I was confident in my decision--, and they were empathetic and very curious as it's pretty rare to see non-cyclical, constant breast pain (it's common for breasts to become tender/a little painful during your cycle, after all). I got to be a case study for my PS, actually, complete with pictures and being discussed by a panel, which was pretty cool. It didn't amount to much in terms of treatment, but it was nice to know that at least the info was being spread. Oddly, my electrologist (I had undiagnosed PCOS for years and sorta grew a beard and a little bit of chest hair in my 20s, yikes!) was really sensitive/empathetic about it when working around my chest, as that required some pressing/stretching of skin to get at the hairs, and she was always worried she was pressing too hard or causing pain; I just told her not to worry about it and if the pain bothered me more than getting rid of the chest hairs--nice, long black ones too, yum--that I'd just have her stop treating that area. I wasn't sure what my husband would think, and at first he was a little on the, \"it can't be that bad\" side; however, in my case, my husband has fibromyalgia and chronic back pain because of it so I phrased it as, \"Okay, let's say you found out that all of your chronic pain could be immediately alleviated by having your testicles (i went with that as a lot of men see breasts in a sexual context before anything else) removed, would you do it?\" He didn't even hesitate to say that he would if he knew for sure it'd stop his chronic pain he wouldn't think twice about having it done, then got this, \"...oh.\" look of realization. It may help to phrase it in a way that frames the positives: You might not wince or pull back from hugs af often as it wouldn't hurt to have your chest pressed, it'd be better for intimacy because you wouldn't be so guarded or worried that touching your chest or squeezing your chest would cause shooting pain, things like that--those are also things I brought up because I'd been very adverse to any touching, romantic or otherwise, that involved me having to have my chest touched due to the stabbing/burning shots of pain that were worse than the 'normal' pain that it'd cause. Not only that, but not being in chronic pain means less complaining, and you feeling overall better and probably being in a better overall mood as chronic pain can be extremely draining.  And in the end, your husband doesn't have to approve; it's your body, and you're the one experiencing the chronic pain, he has no right to tell you that you \"can't\" do something to alleviate that pain.",

Edit to clarify: It's much,much more likely that one parent has the mutation and just isn't aware (that'd be common if your dad is a carrier as it doesn't seem to raise much risk for men where breast cancer is concerned), but there is also a possibility (albeit a very low one) for it to happen spontaneously. If you have the mutation, there is no possible way you'll be considered to not have a high risk for developing breast cancer at some point in your life; both BRCA1 and 2 mutations can also raise chances of ovarian cancer as well.

I can't speak to the cancer specific questions as my BMX was a preventative one, but... As for reconstruction results, recovery times, and possible complications, those are honestly going to vary quite a bit from person to person. Some women have great results out of the gate and only need a couple of procedures to get there, an average recovery time, and no complications at all, and other women aren't so lucky and end up needing multiple procedures to get the look they're wanting, may take longer to recover, or may end up with complications along the way. Choosing an experienced, skilled surgeon can help lower those risks, but it won't eliminate them simply because everybody's body is different, reacts differently to trauma, and heals differently. There are averages for all of that, of course, but those aren't absolutes and aren't guaranteed. However, for someone who wants to have breasts after a mastectomy, for them the potential risks and increased healing times that come with reconstruction vs. no reconstruction may not outweigh the benefit, to them, of having breasts again. For me, they didn't, and I was never terribly attached--aside from the literal part--to my breasts as they were large, kind of saggy, and I'd had fibrocystic breast disease since pretty much puberty so they were physically painful to have; in my case, the best choice for me was not to reconstruct and go flat as I didn't want the longer recovery time, I wasn't super impressed by results I'd seen with implants (saline or silicone), didn't care for the risks and recovery for DIEP type reconstruction, and didn't want to go through tissue expanders + their recovery time and risk. I'm about 2 1/2 months out from my BMX and I have not once even vaguely regretted not having reconstruction done; I love how I look, how my clothes fit, and how everything feels with no big, cystic, painful breasts in my way all the time can't see myself ever wanting implants or another form of reconstruction down the line. That said, my choice isn't necessarily the right choice for someone else. In the end, you'll want to go with what feels right for you and what you want and not what worked best for someone else.",

You can always have tissue expanders placed (even if you don't have a skin sparing mastectomy) or look into the various flap surgeries at that time if you decide you're just not comfortable being flat and want to reconstruct. Yes, that's more surgery and that does come with risk of complications or unsatisfactory aesthetic outcomes (as does any breast reconstruction or augmentation procedure), but if it turns out you're genuinely not happy or comfortable being flat or wearing prosthetics, it's still an option to take. It's not a one shot deal, so that's always a good thing.  As for the weight, the best way to have long term results is to make long term changes to eating and exercise habits; diets tend not to work because, once someone loses the weight, they often go back to their old eating habits and food choices, and stop exercising as often, so the weight comes back. It's got to be something you're really ready to change and stick with for the rest of your life to keep the weight off. The first couple months are usually the hardest, because changing and breaking bad habits is pretty dang difficult (there are so many days I just DON'T WANT to go to the gym but I force myself to drag my butt in there unless I have a legit reason not to--like I'm actually ill or injured--and just do the thing. I might grumble and grump and probably look really annoyed the whole time I'm there, but I always feel better after it's done), but after that it gets a lot easier as your changes become your new, better habits. I know, for me, my biggest issue was/is portion sizes. What I considered a 'normal' or 'reasonable' portion of something was usually 2-3 times the size the portion should have been, so I was eating a lot more in calorie content than I was burning off, which kept me heavy. I also grew up with that mantra of, \"clean everything off of your plate, even if you're full\" and \"it's rude to refuse food when it's offered\" which doesn't help as that easily leads to large portions and overeating because you feel like you have to finish and can't refuse more food if it's offered. It's been super hard to just slow down and stop eating when full if there's food left on the plate and it's taken me a LONG time to realize that it's perfectly okay to not eat 100% of what's on the plate, it's fine to refuse seconds, and there's nothing wrong with a portion size not being massive. Cutting way back on 'snack' foods (cookies, cakes, and sweets especially) and replacing them with healthier options (fruit, vegetables, nuts, etc...) helped a lot as well; I still got my snack, and I got some actual nutrition out of it instead of empty calories from sugar. In addition to that, I also discovered, after really taking honest stock of my behavior, that I eat when I'm bored. The first thing I do when bored is head to the kitchen and look for something to snack on, which is an incredibly bad habit and leads to eating far, far too much food over the course of the day. I've started telling myself, sometimes out loud, \"You're not hungry, you're bored, find something else to do.\" Even if the something else is just having a big glass of water or chewing gum or taking the dogs for a quick walk or sometimes just wandering around the house for a few minutes, it's still better than grazing on food when bored. I can't keep food at my desk at work or I'll just eat pretty much for 8 hours straight AND not realize I'm doing it! And, honestly, I'm also just lazy. Given the choice, I'd sit on my butt all day at work then go home and sit on my butt watching TV or playing video games. Being that inactive also helps pile on pounds. I got tired of that, and tired of just generally getting winded easily, so I went and got myself a membership at a gym that's conveniently a 5 minute walk from where I work; most days I go in the afternoon on my lunch break, but occasionally I just go after work as I have to pass the gym to get to my car so I have no excuse not to swing in. :D Either way, given my tendency to eat a lot and be super lazy, I had to really make the concrete decision to fix both issues long term and not just until I lost the 30lb I need to lose (at minimum!), it's got to be something I'm committed to long term and to making actual permanent changes in my behavior as opposed to 'diet changes' that I'd just ditch once I hit my goal.",

You said your doctor doesn't see anything; what sort of tests did they do? It may help them to know if it seems to happen randomly or if it goes along with being in a certain position (i.e laying/sitting or standing), while doing a certain activity, while around or working with certain things (plants, materials, animals, etc...) or whether it seems to happen at rest vs. while physically active. A lot of times random isn't always as random as it seems at first glance, so it may also help to pay close attention to or write down what you're doing and if you're standing, sitting, or laying when it happens to see if you can identify a pattern of some sort.  Either way, if the doctor you saw was just your GP and not a pulmonologist, it's definitely worth asking for a referral to a pulmonologist. ",

Nobody likes to be wrong, of course, but I think sometimes some doctors forget that they're human as well and that it's possible for them to make a mistake in diagnosis or treatment plans, or for them to assume that every patient they have is as well educated on a diagnosis or health issue as they are, so they don't bother to explain it fully and just make the presumption that their patient already knows. In some cases, it meant I had to cut ties with certain doctors and find new ones as I had a few that absolutely seemed to hate patients who questioned them (I literally had one doctor level a cold stare at me and say, \"Which one of us has the degree here?\" when I questioned his diagnosis and treatment plan--spoiler alert: His diagnosis turned out to be WRONG, which is most certainly why his prescribed treatment had no effect, and I got a proper one from a different doctor with proper, effective treatment to go with it!) or their diagnosis/treatment plans or who didn't like having to \"dumb down\" to explain something in a different way if I didn't fully understand what they were explaining to me the first time around and, to me, that's just not acceptable. That's certainly not to say all doctors, or even the majority, are like that but man, sometimes you do just run into one that's got the interpersonal skills of a hornet whose nest has just been stepped on.  And honestly, if a patient is still upset near end of an appointment, it really is on the doctor to try and find out if it's because they just received terrible news or if it's because they misinterpreted or didn't fully understand what was told to them and are having a reaction based on incorrect assumptions on their part. Saves a lot of trouble and stress down the road if they just take the extra time to make sure their patient fully understands what's going on and fully understands their treatment plan.",

After my BMX, I grew a whole mess of new lower chin/upper neck hair that hadn't been there before; it's being removed via electrolysis that I was doing anyway due to PCOS giving me me a lovely beard in my 20s, so not a big deal for me. The lady who does my electrolysis commented on me having \"a pretty good crop\" after my 2 week hiatus after surgery. Since I've been doing it for several years due to the PCOS beard, we'd been down to around 40 stubborn neck hairs that just refused to die, and after my BMX it shot up to 150 hairs in the same area! They can't grow back in dead follicles (which is what electrolysis does: kills the hair follicle), so that means the new hairs grew from hair follicles that hadn't been active prior. I also sprouted a few hairs near the incision lines on my chest and around my nipple grafts; haven't done electrolysis on those yet as I'm not even 2 months out from surgery and want to wait until it's more fully healed, so for now they get to stay. I know a few people, men and women, who've had knee replacements and, after the surgery, the affected knee grew thicker, more dense hair than they'd had previously and that was thicker and denser than their leg hair overall. The human body is weird sometimes.  Just to keep it on topic on the scar thing, I'll be starting to use NewGel+ silicone strips (the tan ones, not the clear ones) on my scar lines once they arrive on Monday. A friend of mine who had a mastectomy recommended those and said they did wonders for fading her scar.",

Some numbness may be permanent, but a lot of it will slowly resolve over time.

From about age 8 (early bloomer) to 32 I was told it was 'normal', 'caused by your cycle', that I was overreacting about what I found/felt, etc...it's really a problem for a lot of women to have their concerns dismissed by doctors (doubly so for male doctors in my experience, though I've had some pretty dismissive female doctors too) as 'overreacting' and being told something is normal when it's pretty clear it's not. That kind of treatment is also why I suffered with severe endometriosis from, well, age 8 to about 32, because everyone I saw told me that all the symptoms I was experiencing were normal (even my mom said it was normal because HER doctors told her it was normal, surprise, turns out she also had severe endometriosis and fibrocystic breast disease along with one occurrence of BC that was nearly missed because of it and her doctor dismissing her concerns at first)--until I was 32 when I got a new gyno who, after hearing my symptoms, kind of made a horrified face and said, \"HOW long has that been going on?\" followed by, \"Yeah, you have endometriosis, we can treat it with either an IUD, depo, or a partial hysto.\" (I went with depo for now, planning on the partial hysto in the next couple years). While I was happy to finally have my issues eventually fixed, when I think back on how many medical professionals just dismissed my symptoms or complaints out of hand as 'normal' or 'part of your cycle' it really does make me angry as I suffered needlessly for the majority of my life because they couldn't or wouldn't listen and take me seriously.

Most people don't overreact for no reason, it usually stems from them having some level of anxiety about what's happening to/with their body and not fully understanding what was told to them by the doctor.

Most times it's because it can be difficult to determine, especially on a patient who is overweight, how tight to make the incision stitches; too tight and you risk irritation and the wound bursting open (complete with breaking the stitches in the process), too loose and you can end up with dog ears. Most surgeons will err on the side of caution, as dog ears can be easily revised. No surgeon tries for dog ears, as they're considered a 'complication', but they happen sometimes if the surgeon leaves too much in an effort to not make the incision stitching too tight. They're much more common in patients who are overweight, but can happen to anyone regardless of weight; they're just pockets of fatty tissue and can be easily dealt with, usually just with local anesthetic, by the plastic surgeon. Mine did tell me that fixing the small one I have will make the scar longer, but I'd rather have a longer scar and no dog ear than a shorter scar and a weird little bit of flesh poking out. One side is flat and just fine, the other side has a very small dog ear; not a big deal, it's likely going to be revised in January.",

While some women prefer to try and hide the fact that they're flat by using patterns, dark material, loose shirts, or scarves, there's no reason you have to do that; I know I sure don't, I just...wear what I want. I wear them all the time, either under a hoodie when it's colder, which is most of the year here, or as my shirt when it's hot. I'll be wearing one at the gym later this afternoon. There also isn't any required reason that you have to wear a prothesis, it's 100% a voluntary choice; you can choose not to wear one if you feel they will be or find they are uncomfortable in a hot environment. Breasts are not a requirement to wear what you want to wear, which can be easy to forget as so much advertising around womens' clothing revolves around shots of the chest/breast area to emphasize how great you'll look IF you have breasts, but that's all it is: Advertising. If you want to continue to wear tank tops while flat, continue to wear tank tops! Being flat sure doesn't stop me from wearing clothes that I find comfortable for the temperature it is or that I just plain want to wear. It may be a good idea to do some subtle word shifting to get away from the implication that one has to have visible (at least in clothing) breasts to appear or seem normal, though. Normal is a highly, highly subjective thing, after all. I look normal as far as I'm concerned; anyone who disagrees can feel free to * censored ;) * right off. :). Are you having issues with your implants and that's why you're thinking of the explant? I ask because some of the language in your post indicates that you're still pretty into the, \"I will need breasts or the appearance of breasts in order to be satisfied\" camp, which is perfectly fine as it's all an individual opinion on one's own body image, and explanting may make body image issues worse for you if wearing a prothesis isn't an option (for comfort reasons or other reasons) and you still have the mindset of needing to have the appearance of breasts to feel comfortable in the clothing you want to wear. You can, of course, have tissue expanders placed again and get implants back if you go flat and decide it's not for you, but that's another couple rounds of surgery and recovery and, depending on your insurance, it may or may not be covered, so it's best to be 1000% certain that you'll personally be okay with having a flat chest before going ahead with your explant. In all honesty, if you have any doubts about whether or not you'll be okay with being flat /and/ needing a prothesis to have the appearance of breasts again, stick with the implants for now if they're not causing you trouble. Personally, I like being flat and have no regrets about not going ahead with reconstruction.",

Walking pneumonia is still pneumonia, it's the same thing, it's just a phrase used to describe someone who has pneumonia but not to the point that they end up coughing, wheezing, and almost bedridden and can usually go about daily activities as though it's just a cold. Some people with \"walking pneumonia\" don't show any symptoms of what people think of when they think of pneumonia at all. What you thought was a cold was likely the pneumonia, only it created milder symptoms in you. http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneu... explains it pretty well.  If you live with other people, they should be careful to monitor their health if they start to develop cold-like symptoms, as it IS contagious (symptoms in others usually start after 2-3 weeks) and, unlike a cold, can (and usually is) be treated with antibiotics after diagnosis.  The shoulder pain could be coincidental or it's possible it could be a side effect of the infection in your lungs.",

Silicone gel will be more expensive than dimethicone based gel, but it's a bit more effective and works a little faster than dimethicone based gels or creams. I've been using NewGel+ E on mine for about a month now; as a bonus, it also makes an excellent foundation primer (most foundation primers are silicone based--for the higher end ones--or dimethicone based anyway!) too.",

I'd guess if it's the implant + the capsule removed it'll probably be a little more invasive than just having the implant itself removed. If your job is primarily a desk job and you don't have to do a lot of reaching or lifting, 2 weeks should be okay. I took two weeks out of the office for a BMX (no recon) and while I was a bit tired at work for a couple weeks following that, I was okay to actually work. If your job is a bit more active, I'd be sure to bring that up with your surgeon and ask their opinion on whether they think two weeks will be enough.  As for fat grafting, it'd most likely be possible, but likely not in just one round. For fat grafting to be really successful, it has to be done in small amounts so the fat has a larger chance of fully developing a blood supply and not being reabsorbed or going necrotic. Even in best case scenarios, they tell you to expect to only keep, at most, 70-80% of the grafted fat (with the rest usually being reabsorbed, but sometimes going necrotic). Necrotic fat can sometimes be painful and/or leave you with hard, lumpy areas as well and the only way to fix it is surgery again to have it excised. It's not a super common side effect if the surgeon doing the fat grafting is experienced with the procedure, but it is something that can happen and something to keep in mind. They left some fat behind and moved a little around after my BMX so I wouldn't look concave, but some didn't survive and turned hard and lumpy and left me looking more like I had two deflated, flat AA cup breasts rather than flat; I ended up having a second surgery to have the necrotic fat excised and the rest they'd put lipo'd out as I decided I'd prefer to risk looking concave than looking like I had uneven, deformed breasts. Going from flat to something that looked like a relatively normal A or B cup might take 3+ rounds of grafting over the next couple of years so it's worth considering whether having a small breast is worth future multiple surgeries or not. While fat grafting is considered 'minor', it's still a surgery, and you still have to recover from both the liposuction on the donor site as well as recover from the areas that received the graft, and that does often mean some downtime (or out of work time) and several weeks of soreness, bruising and swelling. You also do have to have enough fat at donor sites, usually hips, abdomen, and/or thighs, so if you're slim it may not be possible unless you gain 20 or so pounds (basing that off recommendations I've seen other patients on RealSelf.com say their doctors told them to gain before either a breast or butt fat transfer procedure) to provide the surgeon with enough fat to harvest for the graft site.",

If you want to wear clothes that distract from the fact that you had a mastectomy, wear them. If you want to wear more revealing clothes, wear them. If you want to wear more conservative clothes, wear them. You want low cut tops, v-necks, scoop necks, etc\u2026? Great! Wear 'em! Fitted shirts? Yep! Loose shirts are more your thing? Awesome! If you want to try out new styles you've never tried before, do it! If you want to stick with what you know, great! Bikini? Go for it. One piece? That's cool too. Want to swim topless instead? Go right ahead, it's probably not illegal as you haven't got breasts to bear and in a lot of places it isn't illegal even if you DO have breasts (but be sure to check local laws first)! You want to wear a swimming poofy? Awesome, get yourself one or two. If you don't, that's great, don't get one (or two). If you want foobs to fill out your clothes so it looks like you have two breasts? Go for it! If you don't want or don't like foobs, don't worry about it, they're not a requirement for anything. Still want to wear bras or bralettes even though you've had a BMX? Go right ahead! What about lingerie? You pick out and wear whatever you want! Chances are your partner is going to appreciate it and love how it looks regardless of how many breasts are underneath because your partner should be with you because of who you are, not because of how many breasts you have. Basically, if anyone tries to tell you what you \"should\" or \"can't\" be wearing style wise after your mastectomy, eat them. Or just give them a dirty look until they stop talking and dry up from the embarrassment they should rightly feel for being so rude. Your body is your body whether you have two breasts, one breast, or no breasts, and you can dress it however you want to as long as you feel comfortable; anyone who tries to tell you what you \"can't\" or \"should\" wear based on the number of breasts you have is straight up wrong and needs to work on their manners as they're clearly lacking. It's possible I got slightly fed up with well meaning (but still rude!) people giving me 'advice' on what to wear over the past year, or saying things like, \"Are you sure you want to wear that style shirt? It just emphasizes that you're flat!\" Prophylactic BMX no recon, June 2016, due to strong family history of BC. NF1 positive. Log in to post a reply",

I was lucky enough to have a PS and general surgeon that were both on board with what I want, but I've seen SO many stories here from women who had a PS that tried to push them into reconstruction that they didn't truly want and it always ended in extended unhappiness for them until they eventually went flat. If you can't get your surgeon to listen to what YOU want vs.what they think you should want (and too many can't fathom the idea of a woman wanting to be flat), take it as a sign to start shopping around for a surgeon that will listen if you're able to do so, or get ready to double down hard on the surgeon you might be stuck with for insurance reasons to get what you want. While I'd agree that most women, in a non-cancer or non-cancer risk scenario may not want to truly be flat, a lot of women in the situation in the context of breast cancer or high risk for breast cancer just want it to be done with and don't necessarily always want to go through multiple surgeries to get a result that ends with them having breasts, and that's really hard for some surgeons to understand.  It may help if you point out to your PS that you know that it's not a 'forever' thing and that, if you decide later (even years later) you want breasts again that there are options (flap procedures, TE to implant, or possible fat grafting) that you'll keep in mind if you ever change your mind, it can help them to believe that you've \"thought it through\". And don't let them lie, you can change your mind about being flat ANY TIME and choose to have those options done. :)",
