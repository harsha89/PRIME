I started having mild hot flashes again.   They had disappeared for at least 2 years or more prior to this.  Have also been having chills which I never ever had.  My doctor called this temperature disregulation and said I could try a course of HRT for this but I declined.  (Seemed to start right after a Dec. flu).  HMMM!  Last question.  I've been on Trazodone - 50mg for major insomnia since 2004.  Just looked at some Trazodone info. and studies showed it could contribute to breast tumors (in rodents).  Apparently, 33% of human breast tumors are \"prolactin dependent\" and these are the ones that could potentially be adversely effected by Trazodone.  Just wonder if anyone has been told by their doctors not to take Trazodone due to this concern.  Thank you to all of you wonderful ladies for reading this.  Prayers and thoughts are with you all.  Log in to post a reply",

Thanks for listening to me.  I need someone to care.  Log in to post a reply",

But why I am writing is to say \"don't worry about that business trip\".  You are the priority right now.  If you do have BC, they will totally understand and will deal with that business trip -- somehow.  You need to be the priority.  And I do know from my job that there have been times where I've wondered if I will be there for certain things (due to other different scares) and how weird it is to go on as if nothing is  happening, but we have to do that. But please, put your concern on yourself.  You don't need the other stress about not telling them that you might have cancer.  Hopefully, you don't have to deal with that but if you do, deal with it when the time comes.  They will understand.  Good luck.",
