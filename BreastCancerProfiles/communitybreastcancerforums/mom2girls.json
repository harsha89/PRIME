From what I have read that is a widely used term.  She said I should come back in a month after my cylce and they will check it and see if it is still there. I am going to try and get in earlier with a doctor.  Because I am now at the point where I am living in fear of what might lie ahead of me.   Pretty much anytime I am alone I cry.  I am just so worried that something awful is about to happen. I know the NP said not to \"worry\", because I am young and have no history of breast cancer.  I of course am consumed with fear and emotion. Because I know there are so many of you who were probably told the same thing.  I wanted to go into my next appointment armed with information.  Because the way I see it is either the doctor will say, it's just fibrosystic changes or I need further testing.  I really want to be aggressive in this and would love any information about what I should suggest as far as testing.  MRI, mammogram or ultrasound, biopsy?  What if they tell me I'm fine but I want more testing to be sure in a year from now I don't  find out my \"nothing\" really is \"something\".   Will they allow me to have any tests even if they don't think it's necessary? I appreciate any adive, Jessica Log in to post a reply",

Thanks, Jessica",

I did read and hear that about caffeine and chocolate.  I also read taking vitamin E, can help reduce the lumpiness.  I am 5 days out from my period and the lump is still there.  But, I have stopped drinking/eating caffeine.  So hopefully, if it's fib. changes this will help decrease the lumpiness. It's  been about 7 months since I stopped nursing.  So you had an ultrasound and they were able to tell the lumps were fibrocystic?  Did you have to have a biopsy also?  I just have this feeling the dr. is going to feel it and say, \"Oh you're fine just fib. changes\"  and then in a year from now it'll be a different story.  But, I think that is the anxiety talking.    Jessica",

I guess I'll just wait until my appt. in 3 weeks to let the doctor know about this new development.  Thanks for any input, Jessica  Log in to post a reply",

I have heard a lot about the book mentioned above and will check it out.    As far as the pain.  It's very odd.  Yesterday it bothered me off and on all day and today nothing.  I did bring myself to check the lump yesterday and it's still there.  So who knows I guess I just have to wait and see until the 24th.  Thank you both for responding.  All of you ladies are so wonderful!
