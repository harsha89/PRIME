She said I need to have the mass they were most concerned about surgically removed for a better evaluation. She said the pathologist who did the fine needle sample found cells consistent with adenocarcinoma. But the core biopsies for the same mass were determined to be b9? But she said after consulting with several pathologists it is recommended the mass be removed for a clear diagnoses. So someone is supposed to call me to set that up. So what the hell does that mean?? How can one piece show cancer and the core not. And if their was cancer in the fine needle then that means I have cancer, right?. Why didnt she say outright i have cncer. I called to try to have the final path report faxed to me, but it wasn't in the system yet where they could, and I called the cancer center to get a MSG that I want this ASAP. I'm supposed to start college full time Monday. By this time it was almost 430, I had gotten the call leaving the vets office, my 5 yr old boxer has tumors on his leg, the vet thinks mast cell tumors, his surgery is next week. Like cancer is spreading around like wildfire here, wtf is this. I've been crying off and on, with my DH trying to tell me how cancer is so curable now, how great it is we caught it early. But I don't want to believe it, I keep thinking well maybe it's not. Then I say, well yeah of course it is and panic and cry. I am afraid to tell anyone. I don't even want to go out of the house. Is it possible it's not cancer?",

Some info on the procedure, one mass was for sure a cyst and only needed fine needle asp. And it collapsed, a good thing she said. The most suspicious mass was solid and they took several samples both with the fine needle and the core needle. She made a small incision also for that one. The other mass she thought was a lymph node and she still thinks it is, was right next to the suspicious mass and she took several samples from it too, but not as many as the other. She said she would call me herself and looked me in the eye And said I will tell you if it's cancer over the phone, Okay? I said oh yes ok please do, I want to know.

Had one call back, other breast 2 yrs ago, tech did quick spot comp and sent me home, said it was nothing. I didn't question it. Glad I didn't take that hospitals advice this time. Do feel lucky and glad about catching this early. You are right about googling and I know better. Yes going to call tomorrow, making a list of questions. So far they have been really good about calling me back. Right now I'm a little upset that sept 12th is my surg, it seems like so far away and then another 3 to 5 days they said for pathology. I'm going to go crazy waiting. This just really sucks so much.",

But I am somewhat overweight, moderate drinker, except for a few years in my youth, when I drank a lot, but then once married and having kids not at all for many years.  Now mostly wine and not every day, and actually since this started not really at all.  I have a Occipital Neuralgia type headache that requires daily medication, have been on it since 2009 and I've worried that was bad for my head.  I have what my gyn termed as one of the worst cases of indemetriosis he's ever seen, he couldn't do anything surgically, there was just too much, so had a uterine ablation a few years ago for that and it's helped me to get my hemoglobin up and made monthly periods much easier.  I also have this strange, hopefully just normal anatomy for me in the vessels in the front of my head, found when the headache started, that has to be monitored now every 2 years with a CT angio to make sure it's not forming an anuerism.    Oh and I didn't mention I was sexually abused from about age 5 until 12 by my father, so I haven't had any relationship with my parents for many years.  My mother blamed me as a child and they both denied it when confronted with it, once I was in therapy as an adult.  SOoooooooo wow, guess thats a whole lot too much info.  Sorry please forgive me for the TMI.  But I've always been afraid of this happening, the cancer.  I have ptsd, from the abuse, so also have been on and off antidepressants and anxiety meds for years, but in recent years, since my marriage in 2009, pretty much off all that stuff and happy and cruising along, until now.   Well, Im sorry if I've shared too much.  I'm going to get off this Not diagnosed thread now and head over to diagnosed.  I got a call from my BS who had been out of the country until last night when she called.  Not good what she had to say, not good at all. Thanks you guys for your support through all this.  Best of luck to everyone who is waiting and not diagnosed, I pray you all get good b9 results! Peace ",

The nurse said usually it takes about an hour and a half, but since I have 3 \"areas\" to biopsy and they want to get 3 or 4 samples, or as many as they can,  and they will be placing markers.  I should expect to be there at least 3 hrs, plus an hour of \"recovery\" and then we will drive the 3 hrs home.   I was doing really well until this morning.  I haven't cried for a few days and I was able to distract myself where there were actually times I didn't think about it.  But, I didn't really sleep last night, and now I'm a wreck.  Anxiety is maxing out.  I know it will be fine, I know they will numb me up.  I feel like the anxiety is WAY out of proportion for just this biopsy. I had to get my records together, so I went over my radiology report and that was probably a bad idea, that BIRAD 4, but I'm lucky it's not a BIRAD5 and 80% are b9, I know that.  I need a mantra...... Anyway, need to finish getting stuff together and now it's pouring rain and thundering.  It matches my mood.  I haven't checked in here all weekend, trying to not think about it.  But I do think about all you ladies and it helps that you are here and that you are all so supportive.  I've been really inspired by your stories and strength.   Thank you all.   Caryn  Log in to post a reply",
