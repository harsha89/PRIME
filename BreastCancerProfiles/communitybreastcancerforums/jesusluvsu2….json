I think they are going to try to aspirate it first and then depending on what happens with that a needle biopsy. I think I am remembering right. My lump did show on the ultrasound and the mammogram. It measured 6.4mm and they said something about (some?) features not being like a cyst, called it a suspicious lesion and mentioned the possibly early malignancy. It is very round and the dr said that was better than a starburst type shape. I really am trying to think positive. I have my moments but trying not to worry too much. I pray that you get good results from your biopsy! Thank you again!",
