My symptoms are 1 lump, it seems to be deep, hard to feel at times, and hard, no pain, Breast does itch, and I have a burning sensation in my back should blade from time to time.  My Father passed away from Pancreatic Cancer, not sure if that could be a risk factor.  Im getting scared, I am a fighter if the news is bad, but I just have this feeling it may come back cancerous.  I want a biopsy done to know for sure, I have 4 kids to live for and I need a defenitive answer...Do you all think I am jumping to fast? Thanks in advance for your input....blessings.
