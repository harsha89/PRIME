I posted an update last week, but after an ultrasound appointment with a radiologist last week I found out I am okay (no signs of cancer)! While this was going on, I noticed a small whitish bump on the side of one nipple (not the one on the breast I've been concerned about). I really didn't think anything about it, it didn't hurt, itch, or bother me, I just left it alone. I didn't have any doctors look specifically at it, but they did examine me, you'd think if it was alarming someone would have noticed it. Anyway, I was just changing and the white bump flaked off and there's kind of like, a cut/hole where it was. Didn't bleed or anything. I thought maybe this could be chafing? I've been running/working out a lot more lately- I did go out and get a good sports bra, but maybe this can still happen? I immediately put this dry skin healing ointment on it that my dermatologist gave me last week when he cut off a spot on my face (which btw, he thinks is benign too, so that's good news!). Anyway, even though I don't feel afraid, I'm a little concerned...after doing all my research I did come across stuff on Paget's. I'm not going to immediately go back to a doctor, I feel like I'm burned out after 5 doctors' appointments in a month. Anyone have any thoughts (or know of other conditions that can cause this?). Trying not to freak out here...it's not even been a week since I got my good news!! Thanks guys.  Log in to post a reply",

And, I am hypervigiliant (and hypersensitive) about so many health concerns right now. I guess this lump was a real wake-up call for me in a lot of ways, because it really got me thinking about how I've neglected my health for years now. Besides my mammo/ultrasound next week, I also have a dermatologist appointment to go get some suspiscious skin spots looked at. I also have a tendency to have a sensitive bladder and have a history of frequent UTIs, which have been better lately--except this week, I've had random pain/achyness in my bladder again and I researched this and it could be a symptom of advanced cervical cancer. Of course, I'm freaked out because I can't tell you the last time I had a pap smear. I haven't exactly been on the ball with following through with health stuff (I've been in a doctoral program, moved across the country three years ago, and have been dealing with the ever so wonderful poor economy and finding/changing jobs, etc). Anyway, I know \"googling\" symptoms is a sure fire way to get oneself worked up over nothing, but I just wanted to see if anyone else feels more stressed about their body while dealing with the breast health concerns. Once I get through my breast appointments and derm appointments, I plan on finding a good gyno practice (not the place I was going to where they were rude to me about my lumps) and getting checked out, etc. Just gotta take it one thing at a time. I'm so glad this board exists. It feels so nice to have a safe, supportive space to talk and vent and totally express yourself without worrying about feeling judged. I think most people in my life I shared my concerns think I am nuts, including my poor boyfriend who gets daily updates on my symptoms and thoughts. But, he is a testicular cancer survivor, so he's been down a similar road. In any case, I am glad for those who come to this board and share their thoughts with each other! Log in to post a reply",

I didn't expect it to be so soon, so now I'm back to worrying again. I kind of thought the process would take a few weeks. I suppose the good side of this is I will get an answer soon either way- hopefully they will be able to tell everything is okay from the imaging and I won't need a biopsy. Does anyone have tips about these kinds of appointments? They told me I'd be there for at least an hour. I know I'm going to be a mess once I get there.",

I've also learned/realized this was a pattern I've learned from my own family (particularly my father) about avoiding things and never going to a doctor (my doctorate is in psychology, hence the analysis, lol). I always just put it off and put career, relationships, etc first....I wish I hadn't learned that behavior. But now I can re-learn pro health behaviors, like going to check-ups, not being afraid, and taking care of myself by exercising and eating right. I will be sure to return and update on my progress and findings as I go. For some reason, when I'm here, even the worst case scenario doesn't seem so bad. I hope I can carry that feeling with me to my appointment monday where I am sure I'll be scared again!",

      "Content": "tealorca11 wrote: I know I've read others experience Doctors snubbing younger women (I'm 29) with breast concerns, but I thought I'd post the bad experience I had today. I had a follow up today a month after I had an initial exam for a lump I found. The doctor told me that it didn't feel too concerning, and we could take a \"wait and see approach\" and check back in a month to see if it changed, then perhaps she'd refer me for a mammogram or ultrasound. When I went in, I saw a different doctor (I go to planned parenthood for women's health issues because it's easier for me). She was kind, and acknowledged what the other doctor told her about me and her notes. She then did the exam and again, wasn't concerned...she said I have a lot of little lumps, and she found a few of the larger ones that were worrying me. Also had her check my lymph node, and she said it was a \"little\" swollen (whatever that means) but not abnormal. I told her that I wanted to get a referral to get some imaging done for my peace of mind (I had made up my mind that I was going to do that after my last appointment because I wasn't satisfied with what happened). She basically laughed at me, and told me \"the radiologist would laugh at me and ask where's your clinical judgement? 29 year olds don't get mammos.\" I couldn't believe it. I felt angry, but also embarrased, and I could tell she thought I was nuts (also overheard her laughing about it in the hallway). I happen to have a doctorate in psychology, I'm not nuts, and I'm not stupid. It's my body, and I need to take care of it! In any case, I got the damn referral. And I'm going! This sort of interaction is what turns me off about going to see doctors in general, and also scares me about any new healthcare experience. Now I am anxious that the radiologist will either be rude, or make me feel bad for \"wasting\" their time if I indeed just have fibrocystic breasts. But I want to have this done for my own peace of mind, and also because I know from you guys that it is protocol to get this testing done, and I SHOULD do it. Next week I have a dermotology appointment to get some spots looked at. Hope the doctors there don't act like asses to me. Why can't medical doctors be more like Psychologists?   Whew.

Now I live near Stanford, so if God forbid anything serious happens, I know I'll be okay! Good luck on Wednesday Diane with your test, and take care everyone!",
