      "Content": "Feb 15, 2015 03:57PM - edited Feb 15, 2015 04:06PM by labelle I was told last Tuesday that I might have cellulitis by the wound care nurse at Vanderbilt (the breast center I go to-was there to see OC and talk about hormone therapy). I showed OC my breast and she had the wound care nurse come in to examine me. Nurse told me I needed to get into see my RO ASAP as I'd just finished rads and she felt this was rads related cellulitis he needed to be made aware of and that I needed antibiotic treatment. He worked me in the afternoon and I told him what the wound care nurse said. The SOB did not even examine me-had me pull up my shirt and looked at me from across the room. Said it just looked a little red and that he'd prescribe me an antibiotic just in case, mostly seemed to just be humoring me! This was golf ball sized, bright red, tender swollen area on my breast, stretched taunt and with a fluidy feel to it, but of course he never even touched it, barely looked at it. This is at my local radiation center/Vanderbilt is 90 miles away. So I had the RADS here in town. I had horrible burning / peeling with RADs so obviously plenty of chances for a bacterial infection. This guy was monitoring my Rads throughout, as ROs do, and seeing me once a week, so he should have seen all was not well, but he minimized everything, dismissed my pain, oozing sores, swelling, etc. Saturday morning I had my husband take me to Vanderbilt's ER after 4 days of oral antibiotics and more swelling, pain, redness. Did not want to go to the local ER where they would probably turn me over to my worthless lazy shit RO. So glad I am done with him. My lumpectomy was done back in November and all seemed to be healing well until part way thru RADS. Anyway they did an ultrasound in Vanderbilt's ER, found a 2 x 5 x ? area of fluid that they figured was infection that had been walled off, no way for it to drain-portions of your infection/abscess may be walled off as well and so will need to be surgically drained . I went into surgery Saturday afternoon, spent the night a Vanderbilt, had 4 courses of IV antibiotics (will continue to take oral for several days at home), now have a large open wound my husband will be packing for me twice a day-left open to drain. It's a mess and another incision and scar on my poor abused boob, but the point is, it couldn't heal without being opened up surgically, even with antibiotics. If you are having these kind of symptoms you need medical care ASAP-if possible I would ( and did ) go to the ER associated with your breast center hospital. They set me up for surgical follow up at the breast center on Thursday-provided we are shoveled out by then. I'm in TN and we are supposed to getting slammed w snow tonight. I was so afraid they would keep me another day and my husband wouldn't be able to come to get me. Don't ignore this-yours may not be as serious as mine, but you need someone to check it out. I was told this kind of thing can turn septic, lead to massive infection, if not treated properly.",

Ultrasound shows a thickening of the skin caused by RADS per the BS and the radiologist who did the ultrasound. Both say this is not unusual, changes in the breast due to RADS for up to two years after completing treatment are within the realm of normalcy. My skin is also still somewhat darker colored in places and the pores have remained larger. Some women experience a hardening/swelling or shrinking of the breasts from RADs that never resolves itself and is indeed the new normal but they basically told me until I'm two years out I may experience changes. At my last visit the BS said I do have mild edema of the breast and suggested a compression garment might be helpful. No referral to a lymphadema specialist was forthcoming, but like Doxie, it's not a big issue for me, I have only mild discomfort (and that comes and goes), I have no problems with my arm or range of motion. The swelling makes fitting bras properly a bit problematic and it is annoying, but not noticeable in clothing. To the question of is this the new normal for you, from what I've been told the new normal won't be apparent for up to two years after completing RADs, so it may indeed get better.",

Based on my own research, I do eat flaxseed and believe it to be beneficial. Because I follow a Paleo diet, all legumes including soy are excluded. If you are trying to avoid soy in your diet, be prepared to become an avid label reader. Soybean oil is found in so many prepared foods, including most premade salad dressing and mayonnaises, However, I worry less about the properties of any plant foods, including soy or legumes, causing harm than I do about the possible damage caused by eating meat and dairy products derived from animals that are routinely treated with hormones. As a Paleo dieter, I eat plenty of meat, but it is all from grassfed, organic, hormone free sources. I eat very little dairy, but when I do, I make sure the butter and cheeses I buy are hormone free. IMO concerns about flaxseed, soy, chickpeas, etc. pale in contrast to the concerns we ought have about commercially raised meat and dairy as sources of unwanted and harmful hormones in our diets.",

Someday I'm pretty sure people are going to say what was done to us in the name of medical treatment in the first part of the 21st century was barbaric.

So today, I told him I'd pass on having that part done and he said, \"Okay, it really isn't that important in your case.\" So, why the hell did he want to do it in the first place? Crazy.

I'd want a second opinion from a independent breast center, not your GP and the radiologist at the mammogram screening center and not a surgeon who is part of your GP's medical group. A second opinion should be from a totally outside source. I'd gather up all my records, all the radiography discs, etc (because you need them and you can't trust anyone to make sure they go where you want them to) and make an appointment with a totally separate health care professional, preferably at a large breast center, before doing another thing. What is happening to you just doesn't seem right IMO.",

I spent half of last night crying, called into work today, made my husband go with me. I so did not want to do radiation and still don't, but here I am. This just sucks. My RO said not to use anything unless, until the area becomes inflamed. Basically he seems unconcerned about skin/side effects, but I don't have any choices for another RO unless I'm willing to drive 1+ each way every day and I'm not, as I need to work, at least most days. I'm slathering the area with coconut oil every night anyway-rads in the afternoon, and I shower in the morning, so there won't be anything on my breast at the time of treatment. I'm Paleo, so coconut oil is good for EVERYTHING, LOL. My incisions are healing nicely, too bad radiation will probably mess with my surgeon's good job. Ugh. I stole an idea I read somewhere (maybe on another thread here or another site) and bought scratch off lottery tickets- 24 $1 ones for reg radiation days and 6 $3 ones for my boost days. Will scratch one off every evening after my daily radiation treatments. I won a free ticket already, on my first day. Yeah! I plan to save any winners until I'm finished w rads and then cash them all in and hopefully treat myself to something in the end with my (maybe) winnings, LOL. I think it is a fun idea anyway. ",

      "Content": "Jan 24, 2015 05:20PM - edited Jan 24, 2015 05:26PM by labelle ForHisGlory, I started a Paleo diet last Feb. seven months before my BC diagnosis. I've always been fairly healthy food conscious but for some reason my body seemed to be telling me we needed a big change and pronto! Now I think I know why. With Hashimotos I felt a gluten free diet would be beneficial and from there it wasn't much of a stretch to Paleo. There are tons of good Paleo books, the Paleo Leap website is a great place to start and there are a lot of tasty recipes online for free. I don't find the diet itself difficult to stick to, no calories or carbs to count, just a list of foods to avoid (sugar, anything processed/artificial anything, most dairy, gluten, corn, soy, lentils, bad oils). The diet is lots of veggies (fresh organic) fish, seafood, meat (pasturized /hormone/antibiotic/and cruelty free) eggs, fruits, nuts, seeds, good oils. But without processed/prepackaged options, food prep is a lot of work. Glad I made the change, got used to Paleo cooking and found some easy \"go to\" recipes before BC started taking center stage around here. It you do it, I would advise you to find an healthy meat source other than the grocery store. We joined a meat CSA, once a month pick up meat from a local organic farmer (actually, they deliver to our local health food store and we pick it up there). CSA makes it more affordable than buying organic pasturized meat thru somewhere like Trader Joe's, and will join a local CSA for organic veggies in the spring. That we pick up weekly at our farmers' market. We are in TN so the veggie CSA is over/nothing is growing right now. But that was the Paleo diet. Paleo is also a lifestyle kind of thing for many, avoiding not just processed foods but chemicals in our beauty care products and homes (cleaners, soaps, detergents) doing low impact kind of exercise and getting lots of fresh air . The lifestyle changes are coming for me but more slowly. Believing in the value of anything you do makes it easier to keep doing it. I believe Paleo eating and living is worthwhile. I lost 20 lbs (and those were the last sticky 20 lbs, I wasn't really very overwieight, I'm 5'7 and went from 145 to 125) on the Paleo diet within 4 months without even trying, my thyroid medicine was reduced, cholesterol and lipids levels fell, and before the BC diagnosis I felt better than I had in years. My PC says at least I went into this BC thing primed and in great shape and she's right, but it still sucks! I was never a soda drinker, but I've read some people find club soda/sparkling water with a little lemon to taste or stevia to sweeten to be a good Paleo friendly soda substitute for their soda/diet soda.",

I think Oncotype testing has become pretty standard in helping OCs determine if chemo will be beneficial for those w relatively small tumors. Anyway, my first OC visit was mostly about what tests were needed and getting the ball rolling by ordering the tests/getting appointments made w other providers (the genetics people in my case).",

Tubular cancer is different, it's slow (so you have plenty of time to decide/learn and make good choices) almost never spreads beyond the breast and has a good prognosis/little chance of metastases. But it is rare, good studies re tubular breast cancers are hard to find, but it is different enough from reg IDC to merit its own category and conservative treatment seems to be appropriate.",

I was in panic mode most of the time and couldn't even think about sleeping without the Xanax. My PC was great about prescribing it and basically told me w a diagnosis of BC she'd give me as much as I wanted. Eventually I started getting back to new \"normal\" and stopped taking the Xanax. Sometimes we need a bit of chemical help, but you won't turn into a junkie! Not too long ago, I switched to 3 mg of melatonin at bedtime to help me sleep and I swear it works just as well as the Xanax did-in the vitamins section, no need for a script. My personal choice was to go to a large university breast center. This setting is very helpful in coordinating your care, having all the specialists you will need in one place and makes referrals to each specialist easy. I saw a local, small hospital surgeon initially when trying to decide where to have my surgery done and he said he could do the surgery, but I'd need to find and choose an OC and a radiologist and if I wanted genetic testing done, a geneticist. A large breast center basically puts your team together for you. But, if I hadn't liked my oncologist at Vanderbilt, I could have asked for another. They have several at their breast center. Just remember 2 doctors can get together and call themselves a Breast Center. If going that route I'd look for a university breast center. While the breast center was a long drive for us, both breast centers I consulted said doing radiation therapy closer to home was fine, even though my care was primarily thru the breast center. Radiation is an every day gig, and convenience becomes a bigger question if that is in your future.",

My chart showed a higher risk for recurrence or mortality from any cause with chemo than without it. As this was explained to me, that is not because taking chemo would increase my risk of a recurrence, but because chemo has its own inherent and serious health risks it would increase my risk of mortality from other causes. Heart damage and a lower immune response are a couple of the serious problems that can be caused by chemo. I lost both of my parents to pneumonia while they were undergoing chemo treatment. Yes, they were older and both would have certainly died of their cancers in the end, but chemo does open one up to a variety of opportunistic and sometimes fatal diseases and problems, hence increasing one's mortality from any cause. While the odds of chemo helping someone with a low oncotype score are low, having a low oncotype score does not decrease the odds of mortality due to chemo. When someone has a higher oncotype score, the odds of chemo being helpful outweigh the odds of of it causing harm and so the graph shows chemo to be likely beneficial (as opposed to not having it) for those with higher oncotype scores, despite its dangers. From what I can tell it is about playing the odds. My score said the odds of chemo helping prevent a recurrence were less than the odds of chemo causing me serious harm, hence the OC's recommendation of no chemo with a score of 11 and a positive node. With a score of 2, I wouldn't even consider it!",

I don't remember why, but for some reason the boost could not be done in the prone position for me either. I wasn't happy about it, but went ahead with it (the other option was to skip it, which I seriously considered given my very large margins)-I figure I still ended up with a smaller chance of damage due to RADS than most simply by electing to use the prone position for the majority of my treatment. I'm pretty sure a RADS center and RO that are capable of offering and willing to offer the prone position to minimize RADS damage to the heart and lungs will be very careful in making sure to minimize damage from the boost as well.

Prone can make a lot of difference exposure wise, especially if you are having the left breast (over the heart) radiated. I don't think it's anymore or less effective, just maybe a bit less potentially harmful. My tattoos are on my back too. I can barely see them even if I try. That''s not so bad IMO. It is also said that prone position tends to have a better cosmetic outcome.",

Even after surgery, with one node showing positive, the surgeon (an oncological breast surgeon) is not recommending chemo/ onco score of 11 only and he says lymph node involvement does not change the genetic make-up of my cancer/ non-aggressive and low grade or tumor size, 7 mm (.7 cm).

Once it was determined I had a positive node, I thought I\"d get a scan but OC said \"Nope, not unless you have symptoms in the future.\" My SIL with a diagnosis of TN BC had a PT scan immediately after her diagnosis-different OC, different treatment center. It seems to me if one were to have a progression, it would be important to find it quickly, via a scan, but OC says \"no.\" I've often thought I'd like the reassurance a negative PT scan might bring, but then I read that having a PT scan is the equivalent of 7000 x-rays, in terms of radiation exposure, and I sort of feell like I've had enough radiation in my life already and so have pretty mixed feelings about a PT or CT scan. . We aren't the only ones, this question has been kicked around on here a few times since I joined and some to get scans and some don't. It seems mostly to depend upon the OC rather than your stage at time of dx from what I can tell. Personally, I wouldn't mind having a full body MRI (no radiation) but OC says they show up too many false positives and besides there is no way my insurance company would pay for it - had a hard enough time getting them to approve a breast MRI even after a diagnosis of BC.",

And there is the question of a surgeon. If you know it is cancerous you might want to choose a surgeon using different criteria (one part of a cancer center team) than the surgeon you would want to remove a benign growth. Personally, before anyone cut into me I'd want to know what we are looking at, cancer or something else. I did not find a needle biopsy to be especially painful or hard to recover from. Knowing you have a benign growth would also allow you to put off surgery if you wanted to, to schedule it at the most convenient time for yourself rather than ASAP as with cancer.",

It might not be a great time to take up heavy lifting if you've never done it before, but if your body is used to it, I think you should be fine (no guarantees of course). Once I was healed from surgery, I went back to hauling around 50 lb bags of dogfood regularly (we have Wolfhounds) with the blessings of the lymphedema prevention people.

Usually personal preference seems to be the deciding factor except in cases where a lumpectomy isn't likely to achieve good cosmetic or health results because the area being excised is too large. Those who test BRCA positive are likely to have a BMX recommended-my BS said if my BRCA testing came back positive he'd strongly recommend a BMX (it didn't) otherwise because I had a small tumor I could expect good results (wide margins/cosmetically acceptable) from a lumpectomy and I have been mostly happy with this choice. That said a lot of things went wrong for me during RADS, but I think I'd still choose a lumpectomy if I had a chance to do it over- although I would definitely get a different RO!",

As it was explained to me, the oncotype showed my BC would not likely respond to chemo and the fact that I had a deposit in a lymph node did not change that fact. Chemo brings with it some very real and lasting health risks. If it's not going to do any good, there's no point doing it. I think anything up to 18 is considered a low oncotype score. You might want to ask your OC about what the statistical chances are that chemo will actually be helpful in your situation, if and why they think it will respond to chemo despite a pretty low oncotype score.
