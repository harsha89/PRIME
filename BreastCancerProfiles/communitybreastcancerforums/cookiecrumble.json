What side effects might I encounter with treatment. The treatment my oncologist is recommending is 2 chemotherapy drugs for 12 weeks, Taxotere and carboplatin. In addition to that there's 2 other drugs, Herceptin and Perjeta; All of these drugs are given through the port at the same time and I will continue herceptin and perjeta for 9 months after the 12 weeks of chemotherapy. He also recommends taking the hormone therapy drugs for 5 years. I don't know which one yet. I am scheduled to begin chemo in early December. I also am waiting for the oncotype DX test results before moving forward with treatment. Right total mastectomy, HER2+Score of 3, ER+100%, PgR+60%, Ki-67High, 2 right axillary sentinel node, both nodes negative, Stage 2A, 2.2 cm. Tumor focally abuts the deep margins, however, the deep margin is freely mobile over the tumor, Al other margins are widely clear. Log in to post a reply",
