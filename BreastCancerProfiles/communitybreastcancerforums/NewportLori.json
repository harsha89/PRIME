The really great news is that since I am getting neoadjuvant chemo (before surgery), we are able to observe the response on my 3 tumors.  10 days after my second tx, I had an MRI which reported that my two smaller tumors were no longer seen (one of which was 1.6 cm) and the largest had shrunk to only 35% of it's original volume.  I was told this was an unusually positive response this early to the TC regimen (although it is seen on TCH for HER2+ patients). Feel free to PM me for more information or if you would like my telephone number. Best wishes to all of you just starting this chemo journey!  I've had 3 of my 6 infusions and am holding up well.  My anti-nausea meds have worked extremely well and Claritin and ibuprofen have kept bone pain at bay from the Neulasta injection (which I give to myself in my stomach -- it's no big deal if you're afraid).  My most pervasive SEs are fatigue and taste changes (plain water tastes like saline solution - yuck!).  My tongue felt all swollen and numb for a time after my first tx, but I used Biotene mouthwash and it helped.  I still had taste changes with each tx, which never totally go away before the next tx, but no more tongue symptoms. I am extremely grateful that I also still have hair, but was willing to lose it if need be as I am at a high risk for mets.  I had a wig and scarves on standby if the caps didn't work. Again best wishes to all my unknown BC sisters here.",

In talking to my onc, neoadjuvant made sense anyway as I am borderline stage III.  Total mass of the 3 tumors was 7cm and, although no obvious lymph involvement was found via imaging, path report stated suspicion of it.  If I were confirmed stage III, neoadjuvant would be the preferred tx.  He explained that it is delivered through a still intact vascular system and that we can observe the effect of the chemo on the actual tumor(s).  Since there didn't seem to be a disadvantage to doing it, I elected to try. I'm hoping that it erradicates my tumors and any current unknown lymph involvement, potentially allowing me to skip rads.  It's good to see the postive results the rest of you have had.",

      "Content": "Dec 1, 2009 03:41PM - edited Dec 1, 2009 04:56PM by NewportLori I made it through 6 TC cycles behaving completely normally (cuddling, etc.) with my cat, who is a large, young, stictly indoors, male Bengal.  I was careful to always wash my hands after cleaning his litter box, which is something I usually did anyway.  He also enjoyed joining me on afternoon naps during chemo crash days. The biggest problem I had is that he sometimes likes to nip me (lite bite) as a show of affection when I am stroking him.  Prior to chemo, these nips were harmless.  However, my skin became so sensitive during chemo that his nips sometimes left scratches or marks that took many days to resolve.  I took him in as a foster cat when his previous owner, a 32 year old woman, died and he was alone with her body for 3 days before she was found.  The police who found the woman had animal control take him to a shelter where he stayed for 2 days before someone picked him up,  She had adopted him from a shelter only 5 months earlier.  Although he had clearly been someone's pet previously (very socialized), he was found as a stray in an apartment complex and taken to a shelter where he stayed for nearly 2 months before being adopted.  When he came to stay with me as a foster cat in early February 2009, he was very frightened, confused and shut down from his multiple ordeals.  I was determined to help him and started with love blinks (slow eye blinks when gazing at him).  He responded immediately and approached me for affection.  He reacted as though he was happy that I could communicate with him in cat language.  After that, he continued to come out of his shell and would bring teaser wands to me in a request for play.  He would also retrieve/fetch the wands and other toys that were tossed.  As he grew in trust, he began to sleep next to me and demonstrated all kinds of behaviors and vocalizations to communicate with me. When I was diagnosed with BC in May 2009, I wasn't sure I should keep him - after all, he was just a foster cat and by then seemed rehabilitated.  I placed an ad on craigslist looking to rehome him and had many interested parties.  However, one woman wrote to me and linked to an article about how pets, especially cats, can be of great benefit emotionally when going through cancer treatment.  It was then I decided to keep him.  He's been a great support through my chemo and I love him dearly. ",

Glad to hear that you already have a full head of hair!  I read that Taxotere has a 6% occurence of permanent hair loss (low but still scary). UCLA is very well respected in cancer research and treatment.  It does give me some degree of assurance that you were given the same protocol of 6 TC cycles.  Thanks again!!!",

Thank you for sharing your experience with hair loss including eyelashes and eyebrows.  Like most women I suppose, my hair has been part of my identity -- in my case since high school when I had near waist-long blonde \"Marcia Brady\" hair (I'm 51 so perhaps you can't relate to that era since you're so much younger).  One of the 2 women undergoing tx I've been in touch with chose to shave off her hair so she wouldn't wake up with it all over her pillow. As you said, the emotional impact can be difficult.  Being single,never married with no kids, I have a pattern of trying to bear my own emotional burdens, but I am realizing this one is too much for me to bear alone.  Because I have been on an emotional roller coaster since being diagnosed, I know that I need support from other women who understand -- both online and in person.

I think one of the reasons there may be some difference as to onc's recommendations for taking them beyond what is in the IV on the day of Tx could be due to which regimen we are on.  I'm on TC and the onc RN told me that the primary reason they have me take the steriod orally on the day before and two days after tx is to prevent edema -- particularly pulmonary edema, which can require hospitalization.  The anti-nausea effect is the secondary reason for giving it.  Edema is a known SE of Taxotere.  Perhaps the same concern does not exist with Adriamycin.  Just a thought.  I'm exhausted today.  Had pretty severe bone pain in the middle of the night when I didn't keep up with my ibuprofen (thought I didn't need it -- WRONG!).  I'm going to get some Alieve today as it lasts longer than ibup.  Once you get pain, it takes so much more to knock it down rather than prevent it.

Because I haven't yet had surgery (I'm doing chemo first), it was great to feel like the war against this hostile invader of my body is finally on.  Get ready for shock and awe BC!!!  We've got chemical weapons and you are toast!!! Best wishes to all the other active warriors against BC!",
