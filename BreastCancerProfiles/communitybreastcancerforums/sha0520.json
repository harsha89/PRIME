I have had clear mammograms since I have been 40 however this one came back with changes. I went for a 2nd mammogram and there was a 6 mm mass that is in the center of my breast. I am unable to feel it. I have scattered fibroglandular tissue however the spot is pronounced. The ultrasound tech said that she was seeing things associated with aging however was recommending to the dr that everything was ok however he could feel differently. He did feel differently and ordered a biopsy for in a few weeks. He mentioned the growth rate of it from my last mammogram and he just wasn't comfortable leaving it there and having me walk out. I know this is limited information but is it a good sign the ultrasound looked ok? Thanks!! Log in to post a reply",
