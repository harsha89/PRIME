It just changes the timing of things.  All that I have read on these blogs indicates that everyone here is so very supportive and knowledgable. You'll find no critcism here.  Do what you want and need to do for yourself without worrying too much what it means to others. While it is good to have passengers along as you go down this road, you are still the driver.  Robin",
