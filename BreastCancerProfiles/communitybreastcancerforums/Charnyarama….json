They dont have a lymphedema therapist as such but do a 10day treatment which involves using lymphedema  compression pump and bandaging.   the therapist she seemed very mechanical as if she is following a standard procedure...kind of like one size fits all... I dont know should I go with it or wait and find a better resource... Confused Charanya",
