      "Content": "Frisky wrote: Hi all, Welcome to Feeding Your Inner Child desserts thread. Here you will find recipes designed to provide tasty treats without the usual problems associated with the consumption of simple carbs like sugar and flour, or estrogenic ingredients. The plan is to use only wholesome ingredients that are nutritious and delicious, as it's impossible to find anything out there that's not heavily processed and dangerous for people like us, that need to stay clear of cancer-promoting junk. Please feel free to share your own recipes as well. We learn from each other... I will concentrate on two types of dessert recipes. The first is for people that like me, have insulin and sugar problems. These recipes have been designed and tested to be effective in not raising insulin or blood sugar levels. The second protocol will focus on recipes for people that have lost their appetite, are losing weight, and wish to regain it while eating more. Enjoy in good health! General Information for the those of you that have lost weight and appetite and wish to recover. Obviously, you will need to regain your appetite first, before you will be able to enjoy and benefit nutritionally from these desserts. https://www.cancertutor.com/advcachexia/ If you like me are experiencing weakness or fatigue due to cancer and/ or TX you're not alone. About 50% of all cancer patients experience some form of fatigue. Some of the symptoms I have experienced and keep on experiencing in various degrees are anything from general weakness to more serious conditions like appetite, weight and muscle loss. Twice I had to fight what they call cachexia. This condition if left untreated can spiral out of control. This happens when these symptoms become extreme, and at that stage increasing calories and eating more has no effect. Thus the need for proper nutrition and supplements that are known to get you out of the cachexia state. Almost all advanced cancer patients who have lost weight because of their cancer and they have become very weak are almost guaranteed to have cachexia (i.e. lactic acid). Another evidence, perhaps the most accurate, is a loss of appetite. While all cancer patients have lactic acid in their bodies, when the patient starts to lose weight and starts to become weak and starts to lose their appetite, due to their cancer, you can rest assured the cachexia is serious. The lactic acid cycle, commonly called \"cachexia,\" occurs for the following reasons: Step 1) Cancer cells routinely create lactic acid, Step 2) This lactic acid is released by the cancer cells and travels to the liver via the bloodstream, Step 3) The liver converts the lactic acid into glucose, Step 4) The liver releases the glucose and cancer cells are likely to pick up this glucose because cancer cells consume about 15 times more glucose than normal cells Go To Step 1 While this may seem like a harmless cycle, there are two reasons that about half of all cancer patients die from this cycle. First, the conversion of glucose to lactic acid by the cancer cells and the conversion of lactic acid to glucose in the liver both consume massive amounts of energy. Second, the lactic acid itself, while it is in the bloodstream, can block key nutrients from reaching healthy cells (i.e. non-cancerous cells). Any athlete is familiar with lactic acid. Athletes normally take pickle juice, D-Ribose, MSM and Vitamin C or other special things to get nutrients past the lactic acid blockade and thus get energy into the cells. Most cancer patients do not die from the cancer cells, rather they die from the damage to the non-cancerous cells. Thus, it is critical to get nutrients past the lactic acid blockage to nourish the non-cancerous cells immediately. Every cancer patient who thinks they may have cachexia, no matter what protocol they are on, should start taking D-Ribose immediately. \"Ribose is an essential ingredient in the formation and conservation of ATP, ADP and AMP.\" (See: D-Ribose \u2013 What You Need to Know, by Edmund R. Burke, PhD.) D-Ribose can be purchased at any health food store. Magnesium is a critical mineral at helping get rid of lactic acid. Whether the magnesium works directly or indirectly (e.g. by supporting enzyme chemical reactions) I do not know. Another area of interest in regards to the buildup of lactic acid is that many athletes prior to a strenuous workout, and after the workout, will consume MSM with Vitamin C. This combination is known to neutralize the lactic acid buildup after the workout and it stops the pain. Using the MSM and Vitamin C together, as they work synergistically, should have the same ability to neutralize the lactic acid in patients with cachexia as well. MSM and vitamin C can be purchased at the health food store. I experienced severe cachexia twice and lost up to 40 pounds before reversing it with the daily supplementation of these nutrients. D-ribose which is a type of sugar that the body produces that can be added to any food or liquid. It's tasteless and works immediately by increasing your appetite. The dose is 1 scoop (5 grams) 3x a day How Ribose Improves Your Daily Energy https://secure.endfatigue.com/health_articles_d-e/... Ribose is a simple, five-carbon sugar that is found naturally in our bodies. But ribose is not like any other sugar. Other sugars are used by the body as fuel, where they are \"burned\" by the body to recycle energy. But because they are used excessively, they are toxic. However, the body treats ribose differently and preserves it for the vital work of actually making the energy molecule that powers our hearts, muscles, brains, and every other tissue in the body. Research has repeatedly shown that giving ribose to energy-deficient hearts and muscles stimulates energy recovery. A recent study showed that in people with chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia, ribose increased energy an average of 45% in just 3 weeks. Ribose is made in your body in a slow, laborious process and cannot be found in food. We knew that CFS/FMS causes your body to dump other key energy molecules like acetyl L-carnitine. We then found that the body did the same with ribose, making it hard to get your furnaces working again even after the other problems were addressed. This was like one of those \"Eureka!\" moments where things came together. Not having ribose would be like trying to build a fire without kindling\u2014nothing would happen. We wondered if giving ribose to people with CFS would jump-start their energy furnaces. The answer was a resounding yes! Miaomix!

My first MO stopped treating me when I asked too many questions, and I suffered terribly: physically and psychologically as I waited for a TX decision. After couple weeks of silence, I end up changing hospitals and MO's, and I'm glad I did. Now I try to protect myself without the drama. I try to remain cool and collected, even when I see them making huge mistakes because I don't think there's a way out. I am already at one of the best hospitals...where do I go from there? I can only ask they don't make the same mistake. Like making sure to match the Pet scan machines, so the results are reliable. But there are no guarantees. Prayer is my coping mechanism. I pray that they know what they're doing and to be spared the horror. Obviously, if they knew how to cure cancer, all our problems would be over, but they don't. They do their best with what they got. Expensive medications that will fail at some point. There's no doubt, your loving and inquisitive presence and influence made a huge difference in protecting Dani from potentially dangerous treatments and extending her quality of life. You did a great job Mom, you got your daughter the best TX available at the best hospitals. That's all anyone could have done... Big Hug! ",

      "Content": "Jul 19, 2018 02:22PM - edited Jul 19, 2018 02:30PM by Frisky Hi all, sorry, no new dessert recipes yet, but I thought I would share this very interesting article about the role of the spleen in our immune system and how bicarbonate affects that relationship. Bicarbonate is extremely alkaline, and has recently been successfully used in conjunction with various chemotherapy agents in clinical trials. If you decide to try taking the bicarbonate, I recommend you drink it away from meals to ensure proper digestion.  The Baking Soda Cure For Almost Everything July 19, 2018 Researchers at the Medical College of Georgia have discovered a nerve center in a cell layer in the spleen that controls the immune response and therefore inflammation throughout the body. Given that virtually all chronic age-related disease involves inflammation (called inflammaging), this discovery is of monumental significance and has widespread application for virtually every organ and tissue in the body as the spleen is not only an abdominal organ that is involved in the recycling of old blood cells but is also a key part of the human immune system. The striking part of this discovery is that autoimmune reactions responsible for chronic inflammation throughout the body were quelled by consumption of two grams (~half a teaspoon) of baking soda in water for two weeks in healthy humans. Researchers say baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) calms the immune response in the spleen and has a system-wide effect. An over-active immune response defines autoimmune disorders experienced in physically remote parts of the body including the eyes, kidneys, brain, joints, arteries and lungs as well as in obesity. As researchers explain, when sodium bicarbonate is consumed it becomes a trigger for the stomach to make more acid to digest the next meal and for the overlooked mesothelial cell lining in the spleen to signal there is no need to mount an overly protective immune response that can alter a delicate balance between M1 and M2 macrophages, white blood cells that target bacteria, viruses, parasites and tumor cells.  Credit: Cumberlands University Biology Mesothelial cells line the spleen and directly secrete the nerve chemical acetylcholine. When the spleen is removed from lab animals or just slightly disturbed, the mesothelial nervous connection in the spleen with other parts of the body was cut off and the healthy effect produced by baking soda was abolished. Acetylcholine signaling represents the brakes on the human immune response. Acetylcholine signals other organs to under-respond when confronted with pathogenic germs or tumor cells. \"This is the first demonstration that orally ingested sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) can promote a powerful anti-inflammatory response in both animals and humans,\" say researchers writing in the Journal of Immunology. Baking soda \"may provide a cheap, relatively safe, effective and easily accessible and/or noninvasive method to activate anti-inflammatory nerve pathways,\" researchers emphasized. Macrophages traverse the entire circulatory system. But macrophages that reside in the digestive tract represent the largest population of macrophages in the human body. This strategic location positions them as first-line defense against harmful bacteria and other pathogens. Imagine the widespread universal application of this simple remedy in the human body. If only Big Pharma could have patented it. The polarization of one type of macrophage (M1) over the other (M2) is considered the key link between inflammation and many diseases. For example, obesity greatly increases the numbers of M1 macrophages in fatty tissue. This can result in insulin resistance (inability of cells to utilize insulin to produce energy). A giant pillar of modern medicine against age related disease is about to fall to baking soda therapy. Monoclonal antibody drugs that block the cellular target of inflammatory agents represent $90 billion in annual sales. Such drugs are commonly used to treat an advanced form of macular degeneration. M1/M2 macrophage balance is the tipping point between common and severe form of macular degeneration, a disease that robs older adults of their central vision. The red wine molecule resveratrol also addresses macrophage M1/M2 polarization, which makes it another excellent natural remedy for chronic inflammation as well. This is why resveratrol supplementation has been demonstrated to rescue patients who don't respond to monoclonal antibody drug injections. Where do we go from here? Are doctors going to drop their prescription pads and hand out samples of sodium bicarbonate? That's not likely. Let's see how modern medicine throws this sure-fire remedy under the rug this time.",

It's pure and you need very small amounts) A pinch sea salt 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 16 Fresh sliced strawberries for garnish (optional) Whipped cream or full-fat yogurt (topping optional) Directions: Preheat oven 325 degrees. Butter a 9 inches spring-form baking pan. (a pyrex will work as well) Melt the chocolate and butter together in a double boiler and stir till smooth. Add the vanilla. Beat the cold eggs and salt at high speed with a whisk attachment until creamy and the volume has doubled. Fold the beaten eggs slowly into the chocolate mixture using a large rubber spatula. Keep on adding and folding till the two mixtures are completely integrated and even. Scrape the batter into the pan and smooth the surface till it's even. Set the pan in the center of the oven. Bake until a thin-glazed crust starts to form, approximately 25 minutes Cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate overnight to mellow and firm. (I usually eat a piece right away- it's amazing even when lukewarm) 30 Minutes before serving, remove the sides of the springform pan and cut into slices. If desired, lightly dust the cake with powdered sugar and top with strawberries. To slice, use a sharp, thin-bladed knife, dipped into hot water and wipe the blade clean before each cut.

How's that possible? you might ask...well check out this revolutionary and super yummy recipe for a Frozen Key Lime Pie. This dessert needs to freeze overnight to set properly, so hold your horses and don't serve it till it's ready. Of course, I wish I could follow my own advice... So here we go...  Ingredients for the crust 1.5 cups almond flour 1/2 cup chopped walnuts 1/4 cup of ground sunflower seeds 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon pure stevia powder 3 tbsp. Butter cut into pieces 1 tablespoon coconut oil 1/8 teaspoon sea salt Although highly nutritious and delicious, making this crust is a lot of work, so if you want to use the highly processed, high-carb, and nutritionally deficient commercially produced graham cracker crust, please go ahead...I won't judge you, but it won't be low carb or healthy. Ingredients for the lime curd 1 teaspoon pure stevia powder 2 whole eggs 2 egg yolks the juice from 10 key limes the zest from 4 key limes 6 Tablespoons butter The pie filling: 2 cups lime curd 2 cups whipping cream 1 teaspoon vanilla Directions for the crust: Heat oven to 350 Cover the bottom of a 9\" springform with a round piece of parchment paper Place all the ingredients for the crust in a food processor and pulse till sticky Pour the mix on the parchment round and spread evenly. Press it down with a fork or spatula till even and well distributed. Bake crust for a few minutes till golden brown. PN: Seeds and nuts keep on browning long after you have removed them from the oven, so keep on eye anddon't wait too long or they will burn. Place the crust on a cooling rack and don't touch till it's completely cool. Remove the parchment and place the crust back in the pan. Directions for the Lime Curd Place all the ingredients except for the butter in a double boiler, and continually whisk while cooking at a low heat. PN: if the heat is too high will you will end up with delicious scrambled eggs. After 5 minutes, increase the temperature to medium-low and constantly whisk until the mixture thickens (about 8-10 minutes) Remove from heat and whisk in the butter. Let it cool completely before proc Pie Filling: Whip up the cream. Add the vanilla and stevia, mix well. Fold the lime curd in the whipped cream with a rubber spatula. Fill pie crust. Chill overnight. Take the dessert out 10 minutes before serving.

Unlike the functional doctors that I've used before my diagnosis, that although can prescribe, they do so only when necessary, due to the inevitable SE of all medications, they are trained primerelyto prescribe medications. Worse yet, whatever knowledge they have is by specialty. But we all know the various systems in the body are all connected, and should therefore be treated as a whole. The functional doctors prefer instead to use non invasive medical treatments that focus on the optimal functioning of the body and its organs, by involving systems of holistic or alternative medicine. When I couldn't eat and was losing weight, I consulted twice with the Integrative Specilistat MSK, but I soon discovered to my chagrin that she had no tools to help me get over my cachexia, so I'm not surprised that Dani didn't receive any support in that department either. They just don't know.... I'm currently trying to reverse the fatigue and overall malaise induced my my last TX. KarPC and Exbrn welcome! Enjoy the recipes, may they contribute to good health!",

Thank you Bestbird for initiating it. I'm somewhat in the middle ground, I recognize that I HAVE to undergo the tests and take the mostly useless and damaging medications since there are no real alternatives. At the same time I foolishly believe that I\u2019ll be the lucky one and they will work for a very long time. Studies, statistics and the experiences of the majority of women on this board, however, point to similarly drastic results. I'm currently on xeloda and I'm not sure I will choose to undergo additional chemotherapy. Like all of you, I hope there's a real breakthrough by the time the X [ which I adore] stops working. I have been however protecting myself (liver, kidneys, brain) as much as I can from the devastating effects of the hormonals and current chemio with alternative TXs that I\u2019m familiar with and believe in, and so far so good. But we all know that situation can change on a dime. I do feel better and stronger now with x, then when on letrazole and ibrance. I have been proposing to my MO at MSK to be scanned less frequently, but they have their rules and they have to make money. At some point I will have to make a decision regarding my futureTX's, but of course, I hope that day never comes. I learn so much from reading and partecipating on this board. Thank you all for sharing your insights and experiences, may you be blessed with a long and pain free future. Bestbird...thank you again for the knowledge youshare...   ",

A few application and he could see the tumors literally dissolve in front of the camera. The best part is to listen to the testimony of people he cured. If he could reach it, he could cure it....I contacted him about my MBC in the bones and he said that he couldn't help me because he didn't know how to administer the solution into impossible to reach places... I greatly admire that doctor and his honesty, Conventional therapies also don't necessarily reach the bones, and in addition it can't be measured like they do with other types of cancer. It looks as if cancer cells have a consciousness and intelligence that so far outweighs the best among us. That\u2019s why is so important to lean from people that are clear about the protocol they used, of course,to cure their own particular cancer. I think Simoncini is a genius, and history will eventually vindicate him. This is the reason I'm so excited about the fenben therapy, but it's just one part of the blockade, we need to block all the cancer pathways to cancer growth simultaneously to win this battle. That's the key to curing cancer as I understand it today....",

This morning I woke up in great shape! After couple weeks of increasing de-habilitating pains, on Friday night, I figured out that those problems were not structural, but were caused by the lactic acid the cancer cells releases. I decided to try to neutralize the acidity with 1/2 teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda in a large glass of water before going to bed. Woke up the next day feeling A LOT better...continued on Saturday morning with another dose of bicarbonate. That afternoon I had an appointment with a acupuncturist and decided to walk over there although I was greatly fatigued and still wobbling from a sciatica type pain in my left leg and a very painful right arm that was too weak and painful to lift. Left the acupuncturist and found myself walking without any pain in my lower back, something I'd been putting up with for the past two years, regardless of the fentanyl patch I wear for that purpose. The sciatic pain was greatly reduced, but the problem in my right arm continued unabated. On Sunday morning and in the evening drank more bicarbonate in water and woke up this morning clear of any residual pain and wobbling sensation in my left leg. My right arm, however, is still weak so I've applied a lodacaine patch to it that seems to be helping. Maybe this pain is structural in nature and will need another type treatment to heal.... I thought some of you might find this useful when those mysterious aches and pain show up. Palliative care team was ready to prescribe Gabapentin last Thursday. Glad, I told them to wait....",

The antimitotic agent taxol was tested for toxicity towards fungi from different taxonomic groups and found to be particularly active against oomycete fungi. In germinating zoospore cysts of the oomycetePhytophthora capsici the mechanism of action of taxol was shown to involve inhibition of mitosis, presumably resulting from an effect on microtubules. Various taxol analogues with deleted A-ring C-13 side chain substituents were tested for toxicity towardsP. capsici andAphanomyces cochlioides to provide insight into structural features required for activity. The importance of the side chain was shown by the much lower activity as compared to taxol of analogues lacking all or part of the side chain. The effect of stereochemistry at the C-2\u2032 position on fungitoxicity towards oomycetes was similar to that reported previously on mammalian microtubule assembly.  ",

Many cancer patients lose weight while undergoing chemotherapy and radiation...since my diagnosis four years ago, I became cachexic twice and lost quite a bit of weight...I found a way to stop the downward spiral, but it happens frequently and it can turn deadly. Anyway, what I'm getting at is that we don't know, if the people in the other success stories, lost weight as well, because they lost their appetite, which weakened their stem cells or not. This is an observation we should communicate to Joe....he could then ask those other people and arrive at a deeper understanding of what supports or blocks the therapy. Regarding Jane's book, I'm still reading it, but I complained about the lack of the chart she used when she was being interviewed, and promoting the book....if she doesn't respond, I'll make sure to warn other people on Amazon. Although we are all different, metabolically speaking, all cancers grow by using those same pathways, and she talks about how she blocked all of them at the same time. Don't forget, the whole idea is to weaken the cancer stem cells from every angle, which is not done with conventional TXs. Im convinced, that my cancer was triggered by the consumption of too many proteins and saturated fats, because a year before diagnosis, I was told by my doctor to reduce the carbs in order to lower my blood sugar levels. That, and a combination of major stress factors. So now I'm eating lots of vegetables, good fats, low glycemic fruits, small amount of imported cheese ( which I might have to give up) small amounts of complex carbs and seaweeds and many supplements as prescribed my MO Nicholas Gonzales, oncologist to the stars, two months before he died of an heart attack! I outlived my first MO! Unbelievable! Can't make this stuff up.... Snooky...that's an amazing story! I'm so happy for you and your mom! Tell her how much we care!! Cure-ious thank you for the info regarding the glutamine...I want to also apologize for the confusion in my communications. I finally realized that when you talk about the CDK2/4/6 PATHWAYS, you're referring to the GENETIC treatment of cancers, while every time I refer to the pathways, I'm referring to the METABOLIC treatment of cancer.....simply because we know that the genetic path is not going to save our lives. I believe we need to use the conventional therapies in conjunction with what we can learn from the people that survived against all odds. After all we have nothing to lose and much to gain....",

The book is a cliffhanger...she now realizes she had not been taking the berberine, she suspects this oversight had allowed the cancer to feed through the glycemic pathway and voila two months later bloodwork shows all is well again... but her immune system is still low...she switches the barberine\u2014a powerful anti microbial in addition to its sugar blocking capacity\u2014 to Gymnema Sylvester and discovers she can use Cimetidine to help rebuild her immune system and eventually more research leads to the benefits of Metformin...as a IGF1 and mTOR suppressor. This is great new for all of us rejected Afinitor lovers out there.... But, Hold on to your seat...something tells me it's gonna be a bumpy ride....many more pages to go... We're now at her first and simple chart so pay attention: Berberine or metformin blocks the glucose and carbohydrates pathway. The Lovastin blocks the cholesterol and therefore the Fat Pathway. The Dipyridamole blocks the Protein or Nucleosides pathway. Once starved you give weakened cancer cells a deadly blow with intravenous Vitamin C, ozone therapy and the Etodolac medication. She eventually develops the METRO MAP that includes many more pathways for the various types of cancers...a freaking genius...that's what this woman is!",

As it turned out, I saved 50% even from the $ 8.20 packages. I measure the grams myself...but the issue remains, sooner or later the FDA will interfere, and Merck might raise prices and require prescriptions. I might be paranoid, but I have developed a keen ability at predicting the near future...for example I urged all my friends to buy Beyond Meat Stock when it went public...did they listen? Of course not, but you can imagine their dismay when the stock within a week gained 300% and on a down day, like today, it's up.... I also told them to sell AAPL a week ago before Goldman Saks came out with their warning yesterday, after it had declined 10%already....aapl will suffer more than the all the farmers combined if Trump doesn't capitulate PRONTO! He can't win... Thank you for posting that positive story about a MBC patient! In within our heart, let's all start singing that famous Gloria Gaynor song...I will survvviiivvveee....I will survive! Yeah yeah! Joe always remarks about the power of positive thinking and I do too...it affects our immune system, everything in and around us is alive, conscious, and listening....

Maybe because I sense no enthusiasm or excitement in the voices or faces of the people involved either. Instead only deep concerned serious looks and somber tones usually reserved for funerals, or a plunging stock market... Actually today I had a lovely nurse give me the list of SE, which indicates this medication is quite different from the ibrance I took two years ago, and more like an oral chemotherapy agent. NOT the improved Ibrance my mo sold me on....not at all! What to expect? Nausea every 12 hours when I take the pills...fatigue, hair loss, inability to eat, constipation, and low hemoglobin....a suppressed immune system, you know, exactly what make my brain scream: Whaooo I really needed this! I feel so much better now! as I puke my brains out and find it hard to get the strength to get out of bed and get to the bathroom on time.... The payback you may ask? So far lowered CANCER MARKERS! For God's fkng sake! My cancer progressed into my liver while under the best of care....need I explain more as to my lack of enthusiasm? And those dismal results were with approved drugs!!! Cureious, I sure hope you're right...nothing would make me happier than to survive the trial and give everyone great news....but from the somber tones, the withdrawal of important, pivotal, intelligent information....the fact that I will be only the second person at MSK to join this trial, does NOT bode well... But of course I could be completely wrong....which would be a first for me, so only time will tell....I truly hope to be completely off track on this one... I will be positive and bless this effort and everyone's part! Meanwhile...God help us all...but there's no way in hell Im going to suffer for months on end...at the first sign of dangers to my health, I'm out of there... Wait it gets better...When I asked if I would be able to take less pills in the case of severe sickness, they said that I should call the hospital, and they would call The Pfizer guy\u2014try to reach him on the golf course, while dining at Morimoto, or while in bed with his wife\u2014to ask him, what I should do... now, I ask you folks....do you think I'm the kind of woman that has EVER waited for someone else to make an executive decision? Especially about my body? What the heck would he know what I'm experiencing from where he is? And why would he care about my wellbeing, which could undermine his priorities? The Faslodex is to be added to part b of the trial...no mention of blocking CDK12 at this stage of the game.... ",

So I took the two pills again and at the first sign of nausea I took zofran, dealt with the chills by using two heated pads and took an ibuprofen as I started feeling the aches come on...so far so good...I have nothing too dramatic to report....and in one hour I'll go out and see how I'm doing energy wise... Hopefully the taking all these medications will amount to a positive outcome....

Aren't these the creatures that are known to feed off the living till the host dies?...and isn't an amazing coincidence that cancer takes away our strength, forcing us to passively lay there mostly in pain, so it's job of growing can be facilitated? If we had the same energy we once had, it wouldn't be able to grow and thrive as it does. Do you remember when Z used to urge everyone to move and stay active? She knew we needed oxygen to fight back and create an unwelcoming environment!! But how can we do that, when even the medications we must take further weaken and sicken us? Are we, any different than those ants that get invaded by cordycept spores, that forces them to behave in a weird manner till they are immobilized. Than, as the ants die, cordycepts mushroom grow out of their bodies? What I like about this protocol is that except for the Fenben, I was already taking those same supplements\u2014I take a lot of various supplements\u2014but, I had been wanting to take some form of antifungal medication for a very long time. The problem was getting a prescription and the horrible se of associated with the powerful antifungals in addition to the horrible SE of chemotherapy. This protocol, if it works, brilliantly resolves all those problems. Over the counter, and in such minute quantities, no SE to speak of so far....so that's very exciting to me. I see it as the most beautiful solution to my problem and the answer to my prayers....",

I wish I didn't have such a profound nausea regarding mark Zuk and his company, but I doubt I'll be able to get over my resistance. I contacted Randy the pharmacist to get information about the function of the CBD and pricing, I also referred to \u201ca group\" without being specific, so I'm glad they know about our participation. Im going to contact Joe's people via email. I would like us to work closely with his group, because the more people are involved, the more reliable the results of our \u201cclinical trials\". We have the exact same goals: survive this dreadful disease, and help the rest of humanity escape an inevitable fate. Let me remind everyone that 1in 2 will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime, and what we know is that 30% of stage 1 and 2 patients will progress regardless of the radiation, the chemotherapy, the mastectomies, and the 10 years of hormonal therapy they painfully undergo. Which proves\u2014to me\u2014there's no science involved, just luck for those that don't relapse. I personally, don't have time to wait for the FDA and the cancer institute to wake up out the deep sleep they're in, get their heads out of their ass, and save the day....so let's join forces, as we have nothing to lose. We shall continue with our conventional treatments which is part of the protocol anyway. We shall make informed decisions when the complimentary supplements interfere with what we're individually taking, and hope for the best. Yesterday I did lots of reading on the RSO and CBD oils, and basically, there's no consensus on its effectiveness, or worse yet, no way of knowing what's in those bottles. I would love to try the RSO, but can't possibly turn my luxury co-op apartment into a lab, and wouldn't know where to get the right type of grass he mentions which is very expensive to start with. I will continue to smoke a little of the grass I already have everyday. The relaxation I experienced yesterday was no doubt extremely beneficial, as it turned off the adrenals that have been consumed by the nonstop stress I trust Joe and Randy with the quality of the CBD, as to its necessity, that's TBD...but I'm willing to try",

Meanwhile, I hope Celebrex changes the results you're getting and you can continue on your current treatment. Please keep us posted...we learn so much from each other's experiences. I have decided to not proceed with Doxil, till I get the genetic makeup of the liver biopsy....meanwhile I'm hoping that as with the bones, the pet scan mistook a lesion for inflammation. This girl can still dream... can't she? Novagirl I wish I could help you...I'm new to the whole CBD vs RSO use in cancer therapies, I'm sure someone more knowledgeable will pipe in....maybe if you read the exchanges on Joe's Facebook page, you might learn how it's working with other people that are on your same TX.",

I think I figured out, why Joe Tippens succeeded so easily. When he was being treated at MD Anderson with radiation and chemotherapy, they end up frying his esophagus and the poor guy couldn't eat for months and he lost half of his weight.... now based on Jane's research and success story, cancer feeds primarily on sugars and glutamine...the problem is that although we can eliminate or reduce sugars, it's impossible to eliminate glutamine because it's found in most foods, and we need foodto survive. So....I deduct that by the time Joe started his protocol after his forced starvation, his cancer cells were already very weak\u2014the guy had by then lost 125 pounds\u2014this allowed the fenben to deliver the coup de gras to his cancer cells.... This also jives with current cancer treatments protocols promoting fasting, that Z was following, based on MD Luongo theories and experiments. Of course it's very hard to willingly starve oneself for long...therefore the dire results of most cancers TXs.. The good news is, I will soon be testing my theory, because the drug I'll be taking during the clinical trial is known to cause a lack of appetite, nausea, and vomit...i believe I'll lose some weight. I had great anxiety about this, but now instead I see it as a benefit, as long as it doesn't make me cachexic, of course!",

What I understood from Janes's story\u2014and I'm not through reading the book. I needed to take a break, the weather was too beautiful today\u2014is that antioxidants shouldn't be taken while undergoing chemotherapy. She specifically mentions Glutathione\u2014a precursor to NAC and theVitamin E. What we know from Joe Tippens research group, is that taking antioxidants worked for him and the other success stories. In the interview, Joe keeps on referring to the Fenben as being pivotal, so doing without might be okay anyway. Maybe we should follow our individual instincts about the antioxidants, and in three months compare notes. We can thus learn from each other's experiences. We can then offer Joe's group, our findings so that our results can be included and correlated with theirs, and pretty soon will hopefully understand more about the importance of all the various elements. I urge everyone to keep a simple diary of what you take, how much you take, and how often. With everyone's personal experience and active participation we will gather tons of useful knowledge. We will win and survive! We must!! Being turned into Soylent Greens is not an option!! Ps: Berberine or Metformin both block the mTOR pathway. Green tea, curcumin, resveratrol, block the Glutamine pathway. To block the fatty acids pathway take baby aspirin and metformin or berberine. I'll add more as I process the information",

This therefore suggests the positive effects of antibiotics on cancer patients. YNdorian do u live in Argentina? Doxycycline plays a very important role in killing stem cells. I posted a link to md Lisanti findings, a famous British researcher that discovered its potential as a anti cancer drug.

Santabarbarian I never said Jane was against antioxidants....what I said was that she wrote that she shouldn't have been taking certain oxidants while undergoing chemotherapy. PERIOD! Her story is about a constant search for knowledge and survival. She doesn't start with all the answers...she arrives at them through her long journey. The interview you saw, was given long after she had put the pieces of the puzzle together. We have to put together our own by using as much as we can from what she uncovered For example...till page 208 she's been touting the positive effect of aspirin, till she discovers that a NSAID such as ibuprofen causes apoptosis BUT not aspirin....she is totally surprised and so am I ince I've been taking aspirin with my allergy medication. YET, aspirin is still listed numerous times on her current map....obviously, if she knew how to cure all cancers, there wouldn't be any need to debate.. I'm the first one, to take every possible antioxidant, and my list of supplements is not that dissimilar from yours.... Some people have shown concern about taking the antioxidants listed on Joe Tippens protocol....shouldn't they be doing what they see fit? Who is in a position to instruct others on what's good for them when we're allhanging by a thread? We are all grown up, and maybe starting by accurately reading what's posted would do all of us a lot of good... be well and keep up with the therapy...all you're doing makes a lot of sense to me....I'm so happy you have a doctor on your side that will help you with the off label meds. You'll become a great source of knowledge....so keep up the good work",

We and cancer need Carbs, fats and proteins to live, BUT simple sugars and carbs raise insulin levels which only helps feed the cancer stem cells metastasize along that pathway. Obviously diabetes and obesity is not helpful to us. So we have to stop eating ice cream and cookies, the potatoes and cereals etc etc. I have to give up pasta and focaccias....and the sweet fruits...keep on eating green and colored vegetables, and low glycemic fruits. I have lost 6 pounds in one month without even trying... Bad saturated fats and proteins from diseased and hormonally fed animals kept alive with antibiotics create inflammation, which helps feed cancer cells when the glycemic pathway is blocked. So we use only clean and good source of proteins and fats in small amounts. First we weaken the cancer cells with proper diet and supplementation, then we block the various pathways with the appropriate medications\u2014 that vary depending on our individual cancers\u2014then a low dose of chemotherapy or massive doses of Vitamin C kill the weakened stem cells that are the only one capable of spreading the disease. Healthy cells can feed and grow on a clean diet. This is what I've gotten so far.... The end of Jane story is that one of the oncologist that had rejected her suggestions, is now running an indipendent cancer clinic in the center of London, where a metabolic treatment to cancer is being administered. So all'swell that ends well.... The biggest problem with the book is that she never mentions doses. And as we all know, according to the Greeks: Measure is All....we're gonna have to figure out the measurement on our own... One more thing...6 weeks without treatment and all my aches and pains are gone, my energy is great...I'm starting to feel like my old self again...it's such a wonderful feeling...like being at home after years of wondering in the wilderness....let's all pray that Joe's protocol works beautifully for all of us, so we can all find our way back home... meanwhile I\u2019ll start figuring out how I can get the off label medications right for my cancer, just in case Joe\u2019s protocol is not enough....",

      "Content": "May 4, 2019 12:40AM - edited May 4, 2019 12:49AM by Frisky Okay folks....Joe has updated his blog to answer questions that I had asked his pharmacist regarding the use of the CBD oil. This is what he wrote. CBD I have had many people ask gazillions of questions surrounding the confusion around my recommendation to take 25mg of CBD per day. Let me attempt to clear things up a bit, at least from my perspective. First, I am not recommending CBD for pain or discomfort or nausea. I am recommending it as a \"separate fight against cancer cells\" Second, while I am not (as part of my regimen) recommending THC or RSO, I am not opposed to the use of THC. In fact, a 1:1 ratio of CBD to THC might be very beneficial to some people as the CBD offsets the hallucinogenic effects of THC to some extent. I chose not to actively recommend THC for two reasons: (i) there are just so many people in the masses that either don't approve of it or don't understand it or simply can't get it, and (ii) contrary to many ardent and fervent THC evangelicals, I \"personally\" believe the right full spectrum CBD is equally as potent in negatively impacting cancer cells and I believe recent research bears this out. Many people get confused about the term Cannibus. Cannibus is the genus and Sativa, Indica and Ruderalis are the species. Many people are confused thinking Marijuana is Cannibus and Hemp is something entirely different (Hemp is Cannibus too). Typical Marijuana plants are Cannibus plants bred for high THC levels. What is referred to as hemp today is Cannibus strains bred for very minimal levels of THC. Both plants produce broad spectrum CBD (Cannabidiol), which has no psychotropic effects by itself. Generally speaking, CBD oils have less than .3% THC in them. The term HEMP has morphed into simply any Cannibus plant that is very low in THC and not produced as a psychotopic drug. The reason high purity, broad spectrum CBD producers synthesize low THC hemp is simple. The extraction methods become more complex if elimination of THC is required as a tertiary step. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a different and major constituent of the Cannibus species. There are 113 different cannabinoids isolated from cannabis, including non-psychotropic: CBG, CBC, CBD, CBE, CBL, CBT psychotropic: THC and iso-THC. A full spectrum CBD sans THC oil would be one that contains a broad spectrum of 6 cannibinoids that are non-psychotropic. I recommend a high-purity level broad spectrum CBD oil that picks up as many of the cannibinoids as possible. People always ask, which brand? which CBD oil? That is almost impossible to answer as all processors are different. What you need to endeavor to achieve is 25mg per day of broad spectrum CBD. Some products are low purity with as little as 3mg of CBD per ml. dropper (requiring 8-9 droppers full per day). Others have high purity and 25mg per ml. dropper (requiring only 1 dropper per day). I have purchased high purity THC as well, and if you are so inclined, I would recommend working your way (slowly) up to a 1:1 ratio of CBD:THC such that the psychotropic effects of the THC are minimized. HOWEVER, I want it to be perfectly clear that I personally believe the right broad spectrum CBD alone will work within my regimen. I personally buy my CBD from the Randy the pharmacist linked above. He gets his from a high tech laboratory that only sells to pharmacists. So there you have it....It looks as if we have to add the freaking oil!! Small price to pay if it works! What say yee? Unless we find our own sources, these are the prices the pharmacist attached to his email... ",

      "Content": "May 4, 2019 09:01AM - edited May 4, 2019 09:33AM by Frisky Last night I read as much as possible about the difference between hemp oil and CBD oil and what they are used for. They are quite different and CBD oil is non hallucinogenic if it doesn't contain THC. https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317221.php From medical news I gathered that CBD oil has many proven benefits against major disease, as far as cancer is concerned this is what it says: Some researchers have found that CBD may prove to combat cancer. Authors of a review published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology found evidence that CBD significantly helped to prevent the spread of cancer. The researchers also noted that the compound tends to suppress the growth of cancer cells and promote their destruction. They pointed out that CBD has low levels of toxicity. They called for further research into its potential as an accompaniment to standard cancer treatments. So, in my mind, Joe is right and CBD oil will be part of my regimen. The next question to resolve is what brand? Can we save money or is the price quoted fair? A search on amazon and the web indicates that what's available over the counter is ONLY hemp oil...so that's that. So it's up to everyone of you to decide if you should use the CBD or not. A mixed consensus will be good, because in three months time, we can look at all our pet scanresults and determine if it's essential or not... Right now, I think I\u2019m gonna take it....heck if it\u2019s essential it\u2019s a small price to pay",

      "Content": "May 18, 2019 10:13AM - edited May 18, 2019 04:11PM by Frisky hi all! I've been reading Jane McFalland's book, which I find very helpful regarding the clearing of some major misconceptions about the role of antioxidants while undergoing conventional treatments. She explains the reasons\u2014something that none of my three MOs could do\u2014as to which ones, and why we shouldn't use them during specific TXs. That alone is very useful information for someone like me that likes antioxidants and will be soon undergoing the equivalent of ingested chemotherapy. Yesterday, I spent the whole day at the hospital where I underwent various tests, in anticipation of the intake of the untested drug that I will start taking next week. I just checked the results of the labs, and to my surprise, 6 weeks WITHOUT TREATMENT, my cancer markers have barely budged upwards, AND all the various blood markers that were off, are now within range. That means that we can all recover from the side effects of the TXs, if if they have't already damaged major organs, and being without any tx might not be the end of the world, as I feared This is a small consolation, of course, because soon, I'm pretty sure, my heart, immune system, liver functions, and kidney will be terribly off, to the point where they will be monitoring my blood and vital signs every two hours! I want to apologize to the converted... but although this is the state of the arts, it doesn't make it less insane! It's very hard for me to ignore that the emperor is prancing around naked....BUT, I shall persist and find consolation and hope in the therapies of those that have survived this dreadful disease and can help me understand why. I find great relief and optimism in that knowledge. I have no doubts that cancer is a metabolic disease that affects our DNA. How do I know? Because we are ALL FATIGUED, we are all rubbed of our energy, so we are forced to lay there while and our bodies turn into a food source to something that acts very much like a parasite. Some of us, had cancer growing for decades and didn't know it...till the symptoms were too much to ignore and the actual tumor was palpable. Placing the focus and TXs on the broken DNA, is like treating all the various de-habilitating effects of diabetes-ie. heart diseases, gangrene, kidney failure, high blood sugar levels, and blindness separately. But once insulin was discovered, all those diseases could be managed with ONE MEDICATION. Some people can manage their diabetes by changing their DIETS! No medications are needed when we give up the typical American diet. Obviously, thaa beautiful thing for patients, but a nightmare for the pharmaceutical industrial complex. I believe when and if, they uncover THE CAUSE, it will be the same for all cancers, and likewise, people will learn how to live and managed it without medications, but there will be also addicted people, (the misguided majority) that will prefer to continue to consume carcinogens and undergo the various treatments. As an indication of how stressful I find conventional TXs ( and I LOVE all my doctors, nurses and support at MSK, which is the equivalent of a county club for cancer patients ) when I got home from the hospital, around 6pm yesterday, I ate something and went straight to bed and slept deeply for 16 hours to recover from the stress.

I totally agree with you. What I got out of it, is an explanation as to why the current thinking and modalities fails us 99% of the time: (we do have couple long term survivors to look up to) That which does not kill cancer stem cells makes them stronger. That the free radicals and dead cancer cells toxicities generated by the chemotherapy will kill us first, long before it kills the cancer stem cells, which inevitably rebound stronger and more aggressive than ever. Declaring a war, without understanding the enemy is the height of stupidity. Aggressiveness without knowledge leads to repeated failure, which is the only reality we can count on...Trump's policies, so far, offer anounobstructed view of what happens when power and ignorance get mixed together. So we must try to think outside the box, and use the therapies that the cancers survivors have generously shared with all of us, in combination with traditional TXs, as they did, to improve the odds.. May God help us in our quest! May we be victorious and help others till this disease is no longer a nightmare for the large percentage of humanity.",

All my bones and muscles, from my cranium down to my feet, feel still as if they were racked on some medieval torture machine...the pain and discomfort is immense and unbearable. I'm feeling intense pain and weakness especially in my femurs, feet and hands that undermine my ability to take care of myself. In less than 24 hours, this drug has destroyed mystrength, well-being, and wholeness I had achieved with acupuncture sessions I'm supposed to go through this ordeal again in 6 hours and I have not recovered from the previous session 6 hours earlier... Assuming that this drug brings forth the second coming of Christ, no one is gonna wanna hang around to see that happen. It just doesn't make you want to live feeling like this. I'm going to continue the protocol today, to ensure that the SE experienced are consistent, and then I will request a dose reduction. This type of torture is not for the living.... I wish I had better news to report... Also, no sign of needing a bowel movement yet.... ",

I figured: What do I have to lose? Will wait after the first infusion to start... Contrary to the clinical trials available to me, and based on these anecdotal evidence, I really believe these combinations of things might get to the root cause and not just the symptoms.... I won't use the cbd oil because it's very expensive, I'm not in a lot of pain, and I'm not sure it plays an essential role... I watched the video you posted, and continued to The Ted talks on the subject....one thing is certain: cancer cells are very smart, are capable of mutating and finding all sorts of pathway to the nutrients they need to survive....they are amazing resourcefulcreatures...sort of parasitic miniature Aliens that take over our bodies, in a slightly less dramatic fashion than in my favorite Hollywood movie....",

They know nothing about the pharmaceutical interaction of supplementation because there's no money to be made from the use of natural compounds. We are forced to take the same carcinogenic medications that further destroy our health, our organs, and speed up cancer mutations and growth, as did many generations before us, nothing much as changed. One woman with stage four breast cancer was saved by immunotherapy, at that rate....we'll all be dead... We have gone to the moon and back, we have the ability to talk to people across the world, to borrow books without leaving our homes, but the overall survival rate of stage four is the same as it was 50 years ago, and when someone survives they don't even understand why...

Blocking the formation of the marrow in the bones is not natural, in fact it's a terrible idea. I believe the SE of this drug are damaging. This totally explains the lack on enthusiasm on the part of everyone involved on this trial. It's a Pfizer thing...I don't think the MSK doctors really believe in its efficacy. All questions are placed with the Pfizer rep. MSK is facilitating this experiment but are not really involved They already know people are struggling with the dose...they said so yesterday....and when asked about efficacy....they went silent...not a good sign....I intuitively sense that patients are dropping out of the trial in large numbers...",

I want to share this beautiful poem that I'm sure you're already familiar with. It continues to lift my spirits especially now. I could not find anything though, about the source of this man's enlightenment. Desiderata By Max Ehrmann © 1927 GO PLACIDLY amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism. Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.",

We can't expect oxidative results by the ingestion of small amounts of antioxidants\u2014like I have been typically doing based on my own integrative oncologist recommendations. The proof? I recently progressed with a lesion to the liver, thus both my supplements and the conventional TXs failed to protect me. On the other hand, I didn't progress for four years, maybe due to what I was taking, and I didn\u2019t follow 100 % of his protocol, which included intense daily detoxification routines. So I have only myself to blame. I'm sure that you can continue to benefit greatly while under the care of a smart oncologist such as Md. Block. I wish there was someone of his caliber here in Manhattan. There\u2019s MD Chang, but he charges by the minutes, which is a major turn off, I don\u2019t care what he has to offer Can you please share with us the amounts Md Block recommends? As we all know by now, quantities are very important for curative results \"The best known prooxidant antioxidant at this time is intravenous high-dose vitamin C. While vitamin C at regular oral doses has an antioxidant effect just like any other antioxidant, if it is given in high doses \u2013 like 50 grams a day, much more than you can take in supplements \u2013 it turns into a prooxidant, and appears to kill cancer cells.\" The other conundrum for this group is that no conventional or complimentary doctor claims they can cure cancer, while the two individuals we follow managed somehow to survive. \u201cwe found 7 randomized trials in which glutathione was given intravenously to cancer patients receiving chemotherapy to reduce chemo side effects. In most of the trials there was some improvement in side effects. In none of the trials did the patients who received glutathione have worse survival or tumor regression in response to chemotherapy than the control patients.\u201c See no mention of a miraculous outcome...

Unfortunately, some of us MBC patients, don't have the luxury of waiting for Godot and more decades of failures as the big pharma try to figure out how they can squash all competition with their immense greed and well known ineptitude. Some of us have still a strong desire to live and can clearly see the emperor when it's naked, no matter how disconcerting it might be.... It's also obvious from your questions that you haven't read Joe's blog...I confess that I've had to re-read it about four times, in order to digest all the useful information. To this date, he has had so many success stories\u2014across every type of cancer, including stage four pancreatic cancer\u2014 four people are volunteering collecting and compiling those stories. He has also acknowledged that it doesn't work for everyone. BUT like he wisely says: when you're stage 4 and your doctors can't help you, what do you have to lose? And the beauty is that when it works, it does so regardless of what conventional treatment people might or might not be undergoing...so it's all good, Philly we thank you for your good wishes...and wish you also the best, no matter what road you take. Ohhhh.... one more thing....MSK has just called and changed my schedule to start next Friday. I'm beside myself swimming in happiness. Apparently, my wonderful MO, has accepted the fact, that starting me on an untested drug with unknown horrible side effects on a long holiday weekend was unwise after all...triple yeahhhh for emotional intelligence Berkshires here I come!

However even if there are no change, or negative changes I will continue to take the FZ but in different combinations, such as taking it everyday, or taking it on an empty stomach for maximum effect... Also, I would add all the off-labels medications that block the various pathways simultaneously I wonder why, our MOs don't constantly rotate the various treatments on a monthly basis. This would preclude the cancer cells from adapting, mutating and metastasizing, because they wouldn't know what pathway would be blocked next. In this way we would never run out of TXs options since we would be recycling them at infinatum... What say yee.? ",

At 12.15 I felt a cold coming on: dripping nose, sneezing, head in the clouds, and chills....even though I was under two warm blankets. At 1.15 I ate some vegetables, I decided to go get a decaf coffee to warm up, and that's when without any warning, I had to rush into the nearest bathroom where I threw everything up....three nurses rushed to my rescue....they reassured me that nausea and throwing up was to be expected. I told them losing a few pounds wouldn't hurt me...we alllaughed... At 1.45 still feeling queasy, I dissolved my first sublingual Zofran....immediately the nausea stopped, I walked around and I noticed my energy was still good and my head had cleared up. Now I'm finishing up that dec coffee with a bunch of graham crackers....the chills and nose dripping have subsided. More upcoming blood tests till 8.30 pm At 10.15 pm, I will take two more pills, but this time I'll take the zofran one hour later, just to be on the safe side....

I share your frustrations regarding the lack of real progress in our war against cancer and the need for effective therapies that don't mame and bankrupt our families along the way. Current cancer therapies are a perfect example of 'The Emperors New Clothes.' We are not supposed to notice how these drugs are outright dangerous and useless. From the lack of early detection, to unreliable blood tests and carcinogenic medications, to the pseudo breakthroughs that resolve nothing. Our cancer therapies defy common sense and logic, and when they work, doctors don't know why nor can they replicate it....so here we all are, slowly or quickly dying, and we better be grateful, hopeful and behave. After all...what choice do we have? I don't remember who once said: This too shall pass!...hopefully I will be because a cure or more effective medications are finally discovered... ",

A new cancer vaccine trial is now underway, as of March 27th, that is fundamentally different from any cancer vaccine trial held until now. Not only is it different, but it's also a lot simpler, its preclinical results on solid tumors is near a 100% complete response rate, it's cheaper, and the two components of this new vaccine approach are already approved. The combination isn't yet, but because the components are, final approval for the combination could come as soon as two years from now, according to trial leader Dr. Ronald Levy. This is despite the fact that human trials are only now beginning phase 1. This info was published by a financial investment news site, and since Stanford has no stock to sell\u2014at least not yet...\"Success of this trial and approval could be a negative for other cancer immunotherapy companies, but watch out for whoever acquires this if it succeeds. However, since this particular vaccine only targets solid tumor cancers, ( can someone explain why they would choose to do clinical trials on lymphoma patients? Instead of saving the lives of people like us with solid tumors?) even if results on humans are as good as those on mice, there will still be plenty of space in the cancer immunotherapy space to attack other diseases. Should I curb my enthusiasm?",

I'm so sorry about the physical pain and psychological stress you're suffering. It's terrible and cruel for your MO to treat you this way. I was in a similar predicament one year ago, before I changed hospitals. My first MO wouldn't answer my calls and I was without a plan or therapy a month. I know how you feel....it's a horrible limbo to be in. I truly hope it falls into place for you now that you've met a local MO that you like and that's also good, I hope he can make that phone call and get a consensus so you can start working with him without delays on getting the taxotere and/or the TACE TX you want. That will give you time to find the right immunotherapy trial for you, if an alternative plan is needed later on. My current MO and her team turned everything around for me, I'm positive it will happen to you as well. I'm sure you'll start to feel better and stronger at every level once you get the care you need. I will be sending comforting and healing thoughts your way... Regarding pain....couple things have worked for me in the past\u2014apart from the Tylenol, the oxicodone, and the usual Advil which you shouldn't take\u2014before they put me on 20 mg of fentanyl patch, I took6 capsules daily of omega 3 fatty acids by M.D. Perricone. ( these are the real thing) Taken two at the time with meals. They are very powerful anti inflammatories and they also protect the heart. Specifically for the liver I would use a warmed up Castor Oil pack. I know...I know...but they really work to remove toxins out of the body, and there's something very comforting about doing something for yourself that's healing and non toxic. I used them when I had the most horrendous bone and flankpains.The natural compound found in that oil is the most potent antiimflammtory on the planet and the active ingredient in many medications. Castor oil packs have been shown to help liver detoxification naturally, break down kidney stones, support uterine and ovarian health, improve lymphatic circulation, increase blood flow and reduce inflammation. Castor oil has strong immune-enhancing effects that support and improve the lymphatic drainage. You can use abdominal castor oil packs to significantly increase the production of lymphocytes\u2014white blood cells that help produce antibodies to fight invading pathogens. The lymphatic system also impacts the circulatory and digestive systems in helping you to detoxify, support heart health and heal digestive issues such as diarrhea and constipation.",

I've tried to educate her, but she goes by the book and won't listen, and I fear other doctors will do the same. I'm grateful for the Metformin... So according to the A1c I am not even prediabetic, which contrasts with my readings after two hours which I consider the only reliable way of knowing how the body is handling carbs. My diet and the Metformin allowed me to manage them well, around 120 two hours after eating, now I have to eat no carbs whatsoever to get those numbers, because the medications bring the BSL way up before I even touch the food....I made an onion pie the other day and my BSL were over 200 very bad...

With my cancer load and possible progression, my lack of energy as I recover from the devastating SE of the prior therapy, do I want to be on a trial that's testing how much medication would be sufficient? Wouldn't I likely be progressing while they are figuring all of that out? Do you think this could be the right therapy for anyone at Stage four? My gut tells me to stick to something proven to work. Another hormonal or Xeloda. I need something that allows me to function. My mind is being turned to mush. I can't concentrate and write anymore. Are there positive aspects regarding this trial that I'm missing? Thank you all for your help. Grateful Cat!

Taken with ibrance can extend the TX effectiveness from months to a year. I never felt any pain from the administration of the medication in my upper buttock and MSK did not warm up the med, although it's recommended they do that by the manufacturer. I had Michelle, always the same excellent nurse administer it. Afinitor caused a constant and annoying dry cough. I also got winded easily and sometimes there was a rasp in my breathing. Some patients have permanently lost the use of 50% of their lung capacity. It's a well-known problem. Glad it's over...and you want to know something really weird: in clinical trials, Afinitor was unable to extend what they call survival time. Hospitals must benefit greatly from prescribing it. It's a medication originally created for people undergoing organ transplants, to block organ rejection. NO, I'm not kidding...can't make this stuff up!!",

Like you've assessed, the lesion needs to be dealt with no matter it's nature, but a short respite and regrouping before you embark on the next phase is a great idea. Try your best to relax and to fortify yourself with good nutrition, feed your adrenals most of all. But be wary of adrenal supplements, the really effective one's unfortunately turn into estrogens. Instead, reinforce your brain capacity and your stress response with cholesterol rich foods\u2014like organic poached eggs\u2014served with a dash of sea salt, and foods rich in Omega 3 fatty acids, like wild salmon, and chia seeds. Stay away from stimulants, they further drain the adrenals. Ill be thinking about you,and praying for a prompt and successful outcome. Im still fighting high blood pressure, I was stupid enough to eat at a Chinese restaurant with friends, and to eat the leftovers the next day, provoking a relapse. I'm still greatly fatigued. But since my brain is out of the fog, I am starting to slowly remember what I should do to support my body nutritionally.

There might be clinical trials soon to test Metarrestin. ( what a great name ah?) A compound which \"significantly inhibited metastasis\" in mice grafted with human pancreatic, breast, and prostate cancer. The treated mice also lived longer than untreated mice. Metarrestin destroys a little-understood structure inside the nucleus of cancer cells that is known as the \"perinucleolar compartment (PNC).\" Tests on laboratory-cultured cancer cells and cells sampled from human tumors have shown that \"PNCs selectively form in cells from solid tumors.\" Also, in previous work, Prof. Huang and her team had discovered that the likelihood of cancer spread was greater when tumor cells had more PNCs. This led the team to wonder whether attacking PNCs might reduce cancer spread and improve patients' prospects. In this study, the scientists used \"high-throughput screening followed by chemical optimization\" to assess which compound, from a list of at least 140,000, might have the greatest power to destroy PNCs in metastatic cancer cells. They whittled down the list to 100 compounds, and then they identified one that destroyed PNCs in metastatic prostate cancer cells. A modified version of the compound became metarrestin, which \"significantly inhibited metastasis\" in mice grafted with human pancreatic, breast, and prostate cancer. The treated mice also lived longer than untreated mice. ",

You give us the hope we need to continue fighting while waiting for some sort of breakthrough, and thank you Cure-ious for reporting news from the front lines. Im grateful this morning. There's some progression in my bones but all the organs are still healthy. I was suffering from pangs on the right side and flack and suspected liver involvement. I have finally reached a place of great physical, mental and emotional well-being, a good balance between tamoxifen and the rest of my life, but I'm afraid that will be disrupted soon. Tomorrow I will find out if there's something else I can try before moving on to Xeloda. Mom, in addition to the brain food you will be taking, may I suggest you support your adrenals, that are probably depleated by the constant stress and loss of beautiful Dani. Pure liquirice is one way of supplementing. I get mine from Italy, it should be pure, not the sugary concoction they sell here. Amazon has many choices, one is called Nipitz liquirice pellets.

Better than taking steroids. I take my pellets in the minimum amount to get a much needed response. Since I am on anti estrogens, and have been feeling extremely depleated, I'm taking a calculated risk, but let me tell you, right now I am sitting on a bench at the tip of Manhattan that I reached by biking here. This used to be a daily ritual that I greatly enjoyed and that I had to give up. I simply was too fatigued physically and mentally to even bring my bike downstairs. Today as I easily biked down here I felt normal, like my old self again. Something I had not enjoyed in three years. For me it's worth it. Tomorrow my MO will probably put on Xeloda, and in couple weeks, a day such as this will be a far-away dream again. Ashwaganda is approved by MSKCC for adrenal support. I take that too, but I get an immediate response from one tiny licorice pellet. But thank you for bringing up its estrogenic effect. I realized only as I biked that I should have placed a warning for everyone else. I have a cowboy mentality, I have been taking only 10mg of tamoxifen daily because on 20 mg i was becoming a depressed catatonic mess and I figured 10 was better than nothing hartrish, congratulations on punching those TM down to a pulp.

      "Content": "Jun 4, 2018 04:29AM - edited Jun 4, 2018 05:28AM by Frisky Z\u2014 I think those recent findings are relevant because it could lead to finding the cause also for breastcancer. Some scientists think there is a connection between cancer and a yeast or fungal overgrowth known as Candida albicans -- and sugar affinity is likely the common denominator between them! For years, researchers have known that bacterial and viral infections caused several types of cancer, so it may not be so farfetched to stretch causation to fungal overgrowth. And from there, we have another powerful argument linking sugar and cancer. For example:  The rise of cancer rates over the last 80 years could be due to the modern carbohydrate-rich diet. Carbohydrates in the form of processed white sugar, refined flour, high-fructose corn syrup and other foods with high-glycemic counts feed the yeast fungus so that it grows rapidly and disrupts the normal balance of good and bad flora, lowering immune response Over the years, many researchers have documented the co-existence of cancer and a specific fungal overgrowth known as Candidiasis ( Candida albicans ) with correlations of 79% to 97%. At least 10 other researchers suggested a causal link between Candida and cancers of the larynx, lung, esophagus, tongue, intestine, pancreas, and lymph system. Cancer and Infections Research has long shown that infections by microorganisms can contribute to or even cause cancer. In 1994, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) as a carcinogen, and since then it has been increasingly accepted that colonization of the stomach with H. pylori is an important cause of gastric cancer.In 2003, Danish researchers linked the Epstein-Barr virus the cause of mononucleosis, to a malignant lymphoma known as Hodgkin's disease. Human papilloma virus (HPV) is known to cause cervical cancer and some oral cancers. In 2012, scientists at the University of Liverpool identified a type of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria that is linked to the development of colon cancer . And Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a proven cause of about 80% of liver cancer (primary hepatic carcinoma). Maybe, just maybe, candida creates an environment in which all sort of viruses can thrive. Ultimately what makes this very upsetting, is the reality that even if this correlation was conclusevely proven, we still don't have any means of fighting candida, can only be managed, and maybe stage four means is systemic. But could changing our diet and supplementing with naturali antifungal unknowingly help our plight? I don't know, but it might be worth a try....",

I have to confess my utter ignorance regarding the science. But I'm happy to feel your enthusiasm and I'm hoping you're right about this possibly becoming the breakthrough we need. My own research is leading me to other conclusions and I'm currently experimenting on myself by persuing a lowcarb, antifungal diet replete with probiotics and Metformin. It might not reduce the cancer load, but I figure it should at least reduce the chances of dying from an opportunist infection during an emergency in a hospital or while eating out at a restaurant. I'm just happy to see confirmed that a low carb diet in combination with an antifungal ( Metformin) makes cancerTx more effective. I\u2019m currently on xeloda.",

The advocacy group Global Action Fund for Fungal Infections estimatesthat fungal diseases cause between 1.5 million and 2 million deaths every year. Many of these occur among people who develop fungal sepsis in hospital. Some fungal diseases can be extremely serious and, particularly for those with compromised immune systems, even life threatening. People living with HIV; cancer patients; people who are admitted to hospital; people who are critically ill after trauma or surgery; and premature babies are among those most at risk. Some fungal diseases are very difficult to diagnose because the available laboratory tests don't pick up all true cases of disease, laboratory tests are not available or because fungal diseases can be mistaken for tuberculosis. Another concern is that doctors may not consider fungal diseases when they see ill patients. If you're admitted to hospital and have a urine catheter or a drip in place, ask every day if you still need the catheter or drip. Removing urine catheters and drips reduces your risk of developing an infection in hospital. YEP Folks! Can't make this stuff up! We should take fungal infections more seriously.

So much dismal failure over the years is causing dissociation from reality in the medical community. So they have developed wonderful coping mechanisms by studying and discussing the patterns, contents, and the drippings of various spilled milks. They enjoy analyzing the chemistry and DNA of this milk vs that milk, they work very hard on containing the spills, while forgetting to concentrate on understanding and explaining why the milk spills in the first place. I was very pleased to read that your wife is NED but not surprised since she is on Herceptin, a TXthat can be a lifesaver for the majority of patients that post on these boards.

I was doing very well pain wise till I stopped X, so I hope that what the pet picked up and what I'm experiencing is in reality only inflammation...",

      "Content": "May 3, 2019 09:25AM - edited May 3, 2019 09:45AM by Frisky Okay folks...I got to the bottom of why we get aches and pains in between TXs.....suspenseful music playing.... As you know, I have been using lodacaine patches in addition to the fentanyl without much relief. I was experiencing horrible sciatica type pain and weakness in my left leg that caused me to wobble and to reduce my usual activities. I also experienced a shooting pain in my right arm, that rendered me incapable of lifting even a glass of water. I had to postpone my Doxil treatment to next week, I felt so vulnerable, miserable and scared. I had in addition booked a session this Saturday with a Chinese acupuncturist that had helped me in the past manage the same type of pain. And then, last night, I finally figured it out.....I realized that cancer releases lactic acid in our bodies which makes our whole system very acidic. Although the pains that I was feeling seemed to be structural and of a nervous nature, they were in reality similar to a burnout after a workout, which explained why the analgesic medications were not working.. Solution? Just a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda in a big glass of water that I sipped slowly before going to bed. Results? When I got up this morning no acute pains and no wobble, just fatigue. Bicarbonate is the most alkaline substance out there. Of course alkaline type foods like fruits and vegetables would resolve the problem as well, but it would take a looooonnnngggg time in comparison to the bicarbonate. So, needless to say...I'm extremely happy and content with myself....the pain after just one teaspoon is now at a 3 level instead of 8, This morning I added another teaspoon to a bottle of water that I will drink throughout the day.... So there you have it! I hope this solution works for you as well...  ",

That sense of being depleted, worn out, running on empty has to do with the adrenals. Strong adrenal are very important for a healthyimmune system. The body can't use the aminoacids from the meat and turn them into food for your adrenals without the salt, and vitamin C. So maybe a grapefruit or something you like with Vitamin C eaten at the same time. Stress, sugary snacks and stimulants deplete the adrenals. This nutrition should restore your strength, courage and confidence we all know you have plenty of and prepare you for the next TX, which we all hope will take place asap. Sending lots of hugs....",

I told him how easy Faslodex was for me and if I could take the pill format instead. He said that he would look for a clinical trial and he did, because I have the ESR1 mutation. I wanted to stay on the hormonal longer, but I didn't know at the time that they were still in phase one. But now I'm scared... Now I feel that I would be better off getting a TX that's proven, although as we all know, we do react differently to the same tx. I feel I'm progressing. I have constant pain in the irradiated area in my spine, and overall aches and pains. Problems remembering, extreme fatigue and high blood sugar levels. An overall sense of malaise that's no doubt caused mainly by the currentTX. I will definitely try lowering my A1c with the type of fast you're suggesting. I shouldn't be hard because I normally have an early dinner anyway and go to bed early. JFL\u2014 thank you for your input. I look forward to gaining some strength by switching out of the hormonals.

Faslodex was the easiest treatment for me, while Afinitor the worst. MO wants me to do an early Pet before he prescribes X, but he graciously told me to stop taking Afinitor. I explained that I wouldn't go back on it even if the PET shows no progression. Afinitor was turning me into a zombie....For ESR1 people such as ourselves, Faslodex is the key...but I was on the syringe format already. Mom, thank you! That was quite a compliment if I inspired you to bake!! And thank you for the warning and for sharing Dani's experience with her clinical trials. I would undergo one if the payoff was big, but testing another medication that postpones the inevitable by a few months while I'm progressing wouldn't be wise. MJH--the A1c was normal the last time it was tested, but my meter and symptoms point to a different reality. I have more appetite than usual so I'm gaining weight especially in the belly, all sign of insulin resistance. I'm also constantly fatigued, with aches and pains, inflammation in my feet, and these of course, could also be SE from my TX. I don't take insulin, only 1000mg of Metformin twice @day with meals.

Anita\u2014 Afinitor can work well for some people, unfortunately I was not one of the them. At 5mg it was practically useless, at 7.5 the SE quickly accumulated to make me very feel very sick. I developed a cough, major fatigue, aches and pains all over my body, and my mind turned into mush. I lost my short term memory drastically.... and I have the AKT1 mutation, which means I should have greatly benefited, but my quality of life was so compromised, I asked my MO to switch me to something else, and now I'm slowly repairing all the damage with various natural supplements. I hope you're can benefit without the SE",

I have gotten my high blood pressure under control by increasing my potassium and magnesium intake, and in the process I have eliminated widespread aches and pains. I guess it's true what they say about the benefits of alkalizing the body. But I'm still struggling with great fatigue, that I believe is caused by the tamoxifen.

My brief experience with various TX have shown that when the meds make me very sick it correlates with it failing. or more likely the dose is too high and is a poison to various systems.

I was on 7.5 mg and the SE made it impossible for me to stay on it. I suffered from a constant dry cough, extreme fatigue, debilitating aches and pains, extreme mental fog, high blood sugar and high blood pressure. No mouth sores because of the steroid mouthwash, but that caused insomnia and weight gain so I had to stop taking it. Lowering the dose will help, but the SE are accumulative. It's taken me three weeks to clear the SE by taking massive amounts of brain foods, minerals and vitamins.Im waiting to get results from pet scan and meet my new MO to find out what my TX might be. I wish you well....but be careful, especially if you have breathing problems, it could lead to a permanent diminished lung capacity. I m shocked to read about the loss of Kaylynne. She was supposed to start a new treatment, and now she's gone. I'm finding hard to understand how our bodies can give up permanently so quickly",

Were you ever diagnosed with insulin resistance? or did you do the ketogenic diet based on your desire to just lose weight? I agree the ketogenic diet is not right for fighting cancer, and honestly I don't see how it's possible to restrict carbs in the long run. I used to aim for between 20 and 30 grams @meal, without counting the carbs in the vegetables, but lately the daily consumption of fruits \u2014my favorites\u2014 has wrecked havoc on my system. Although I can control sugar levels with Metformin, I know my insulin levels are toxic because of the cravings I suffer from, but I know what to do...eat green vegetables instead and good fats, a little protein, manly sardines, imported lamb from New Zealand, Wild salmon and clams for the iron. Imported aged cheeses made with raw milk Reduce my homemade focaccias and breads no matter how many organic and sprouted grains it has. I'm a bread addict, and I know I'm intolerant to it, but sometime I can\u2019t resist. What do you think? Am I on the right track?  See what I have to deal with...  ",

I agree that cutting simple sugars and carbs would be of benefit in the management of cancer and that this theory is better than the genetic approach with its useless poisons, but it can't possibly be the solution because it's unsustainable. We know from Z's experience that it works because Z is still in great physical shape and can afford to loose the calories without major nutritional collapse. But how many cancer patients are strong enough and physically capable of willing to undergo starvation for four days to weeks at the time. It's an immense sacrifice if we accept the fact that sooner or later we will need to eat regularly, therefore refeeding the cancer. Ultimately isn't malnutrition and infections what kills the cancer patient, and not cancer per se, as cancer needs us to remain alive for it to survive In my humble opinion, this is a step in the right direction, but not a definitive solution, because similarly to chemotherapy is unsustainable and it doesn't kill the cancer it just starves it, and we know that cancer keeps on mutating into something more formidable and more systemic as the various therapies fail. The solution is Immunotherapy. Making our immune system strong again. Restore what we lost, what went wrong in the first place by eating a proper diet, detoxing, and taking medications that deal with the real nature of cancer, which is still TBD. Like you, I too believe that MO don't really know what they're doing. I'm having an interesting time right now asking questions to my new MO that denies even some basic well known facts about cancer. I haven't decided yet if he lies to protect me, or if he's in denial and that dissociated from reality. He runs clinical trials, and could therefore have his head so far up his &$#%% that he\u2019s forgotten the basics So may God help us, them, and the researchers as we all wade aind try to shed light in the midst of so much ignorance. May we all live long enough to see some real breakthroughs.   ",

The gastroenterologist at MSK couldn't help me with the relief of my symptoms and digestive problems. What I realized was that the accumulative SE of ibrance had wiped out my stomach ability to produce hydrocloric acid, had destroyed my bio-dome and bile duct. All my digestive problems resolved when I started taking a supplement called Bio-gest is made by a company called Thorne. It contains a mix of everything the body needs to digest and assimilate the food that we eat. The tummy aches, gas, nausea and diarrhea return everytime I forget to take the bio-gest even when I eat fruit. I hope it can resolve your digestive problems too.",

I have successfully followed her protocol to deal with the destruction of my biodome by cancer drugs a few times over the last three years. Anything that supppress our immune system is destroying the balance of our gut bacteria necessary for digesting and assimilating what we eat. There's a video on youtube you might find useful where she explains in details what happens, she also has a comphrensive web site. As cancer patients sooner or later we will all have to deal with IBS and leaky gut and much worse depending on the grade of the damage. Bone broth is the best remedy to heal a leaky gut. Stomatitis is the visible part of mucotisis, the sores and the inflammation don't end just in the mouth, they affect our whole digestive system in various degrees all the way to our anus. Some of us are more vulnerable in this area, than others, BUT the fact remains that we are 80% made of bacteria, the largest part of our immune system resides in our gut, when we take drugs that suppress our immune system we are messing up our biodome and it\u2019s ability to digest and assimilate Foods and protect from infections.

You've been doing the right thing by fasting before and after chemio..although I have to admit it's quite a feat you've been pulling off. If I understand it correctly, the study indicates that a patient with liver cancer would benefit greatly by the reduction of ingestion of fructose. https://www.futurity.org/fructose-in-the-liver-can... In the study, Shen and his colleagues found that certain metabolic genes became more active in liver metastases than they were in the original primary tumor or lung metastases. One group of metabolic genes stood out in particular, those involved in the metabolism of fructose. This struck the researchers because many Western diets are rich in fructose, which is found in corn syrup and all types of processed foods. \"When cancer cells get to the liver, they're like a kid in a candy store,\" says Shen. \"They use this ample new energy supply to create building blocks for growing more cancer cells.\" To feed on fructose, cancer cells need to produce more of an enzyme that breaks down fructose, called ALDOB, a trick they can quickly learn from the liver itself. Once the cancer cells figure out how to rewire themselves to gorge on the fructose, they proliferate out of control and become unstoppable. Besides providing an insight into how cancers thrive after metastasizing, this discovery can lead to new therapies specifically targeting metastatic cells. For example, Shen says that avoiding fructose by eating natural, non-processed foods and providing drugs that block fructose metabolism could potentially halt the growth of cancer that has spread to the liver from other organs. And because new drugs targeting fructose metabolism have recently been developed by pharmaceutical companies to treat metabolic diseases, such crossover treatments may not be far away. Since I know, I got to have something sweet and decadent once in a while, and can't stand the processed junk out there, I have been developing low-carb desserts that are free of flour and use pure stevia powder as a sweetener. These are desserts that a diabetic can safely eat. I've been trying to prevent diabetes and so far Metformin has been enough to keep my blood sugar in check, i'm grateful I don't have to give up natural sources of fructose such as strawberries, blackberries, apples and pears I have been eating, since doctors insists they are good for our health, but I now wonder if cancer cells can really discriminate between the natural source of fructose and the other kind. As far as diabetes is concerned sugar is sugar no matter where it comes from  ",

No cravings or overeating guaranteed! Low-carb doesn't have to mean high protein (proteins turn into sugars as well) only good fats and fiber (as Z wisely counsels with her complex carbs recommendations are safe) For me it means the best, nutritious, wholesome ingredients and spices that are known to be very good for us as they are anti-inflammatory and nutritious withoutraising insulin or sugar levels. Enjoy in good health! BTW, when I asked my Mo yesterday if there was a correlation between diabetes and cancer he said no. None had been found. In that case, he said, everyone with diabetes would have cancer and that is not the case. However, for those of us with an insulin problem, feeding diabetes while fighting cancer couldn't be a good thing. Miaomix Alternative Apple Cake Paradigm.

We're on the same road: trying to satisfy our needs without having to compromise our precarious health. Regarding your question about the wisdom of mixing Apples and chocolate, the reason it works is because there are so many nuts and seeds involved in the mix, and as you know, they LOVE the company of chocolate. This cake is a symphony of flavors and nutritionally a complete meal in itself. It's satisfying to the body and soul JFL enjoy in good health. Here's some staggering facts and statistics regarding the relationship between cancer and malnutrition. According to the oncology nurse http://www.theoncologynurse.com/ton-issue-archive/2013-issues/october-vol-6-no-9/16012-malnutrition-in-patients-with-cancer-an-often-overlooked-and-undertreated-problem Abby C. Sauer, MPH, RD Patients with cancer face many challenges, including eating well to maintain a good nutritional status and avoid weight loss and malnutrition. Research shows that the majority of patients with cancer suffer from nutritional deficits, and up to 85% of patients with certain cancer types experience some form of weight loss and/or malnutrition during their cancer treatment.1 For some patients, the nutritional deficits can progress to cancer cachexia, a specific form of malnutrition characterized by loss of lean body mass, muscle wasting, and impaired immune, physical, and mental function.2 Poor nutritional status and weight loss can lead to poor outcomes for patients, including decreased quality of life, decreased functional status, increased complication rates, and treatment disruptions.1,3,4 Fortunately, early nutrition intervention can improve patients' nutritional status and help patients to maintain body weight, maintain lean body mass, better tolerate treatment, and improve quality of life.3,5-8 Therefore, all healthcare professionals who care for patients with cancer need to recognize the signs of malnutrition and provide early and effective nutrition intervention to improve outcomes. The incidence of malnutrition and weight loss in people with cancer ranges from 31% to 87%. Patients with cancer of the lung, esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver, and pancreas are at greatest risk. ... Furthermore, up to 20% of patients die from the effects of malnutrition rather than from the cancer itself. ( I believe the rate to be much higher, they are in denial because they don't have solutions. If I hadn't resolved my own digestive system collapse I would be nutritionally deficient, add to that a supppressed immune system and the results could be a fatal emergency room visit) I've had to fight cachexia twice since diagnosis and at some point dropped more than forty pound. As you all know it's very difficult to resolve it by eating food when food is what the body rejects. By using sound nutrition which precludes overeating, both paradigms can be satisfied, as it has been well documented by Zarovka's research, that reducing food intake and starving the cancer can also be beneficial at times, especially if too much of the processed and high fructose typehad been consumed.

I was already on Faslodex shots in combination with Ibrance before moving on to Afinitor and Tamox. So I don't think my MO is going to retry that combo and although the Afinitor has knocked one of my TM by 25% the SE are too many and I can't take it anymore. Uncontrollable high blood sugar is what I'm currently experiencing while on 2000mg of Metformin. But A1c is normal, so MO doesn't take that into account, but the inflammation in my body is telling me it's a serious problem. I'm afraid to lose my eyesight and damage my heart, plus I'm gaining weight. I can't function like I used to... In that report on Fas and Afinitor, they were giving people 10mg. I am on 7.5mg and I feel like dying...5mg doesn't do much... All considering should I turn it down? Should I move on to Xeloda instead? What say yee....",

I would ask your MO, since the two treatments are equally valid for your mutation, why not prescribe the FAS/ ibrance combo? It's a rational question and you should get a rational answer. If that fails, tell her that you know that inthe order of prescribing, Fas usually comes before Afinitor, anyway. Afinitor is usually the last hormonal, targeted therapthey call it, administered before moving on to chemotherapy. Follow your gut, but try to turn your MO into your friend and ally. They lose so many patients, is it surprising they are so sensitive to disagreements? Okay...I have some good news and a weird one to share. By taking the phosphatidylserine twice I day, I have recovered my ability to think and remember, and I'm back to writing my book...my favorite activity.... Then here's the weird one...I was waking up with these weird headaches, and tension in my neck and shoulders, that were quite disquieting. I suspected it was high blood pressure. I measured, and sure enough, the numbers were so high, I'm surprised they didn't break the glass on the machine. I started to immediately take potassium chloride in half the recommended FDA daily dose, and voila' in two days no more headaches when I wake up and BP is starting to come down considerably. Then, today 48 hours later, after taking two doses, suddenly, my terrible lower back aches and pains where my two vertebra had collapsed and I had kaphoplasty miraculously disappeared. I just returned from a long walk around Washington Square Park, and I'm no longer in constant pain. I won't have to wear the fentanyl patches when they arrive. Now I have to concentrate on recovering my strength, I'm still severely fatigued. So alleluia for having enough potassium in our bodies. According to the FDA the minimum daily dose is 4700 milligrams, that means 12 bananas or 7 heads of lettuce...who can eat all of that? No wonder heart disease is so prevalent, potassium counteracts the effect of salt, which we need anyway to keep all the engines on. ",

We need to conduct surveys with the long term survivors on these boards. They are the true geniuses that have accomplished the impossible and beaten the terrible odds. As a cancer patient that is forced to take drugs that are only postponing the inevitable, but make me very sick, since they interfere with my immune, mental and digestive systems, I'm predisposed to wanting to defensively expose myself to the smallest amount of medication possible. So I might not be objective Here's some facts about greed: Newly approved cancer drugs cost an average of $10,000 per month, with some therapies topping $30,000 per month, according to ASCO, which discussed the costs of cancer care at a recent meeting. Just a decade ago, the average cost per month of new drugs was about $4,500. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/02... And here some statistics about results:Overall cancer survival has barely changed over the past decade. The 72 cancer therapies approved from 2002 to 2014 gave patients only 2.1 more months of life than older drugs, according to a study in JAMA Otolaryngology\u2013Head & Neck Surgery. And those are the successes. Two-thirds of cancer drugs approved in the past two years have no evidence showing that they extend survival at all, Prasad said. The result: For every cancer patient who wins the lottery, there are many others who get little to no benefit from the latest drugs. \"We are very concerned about the push to get more drugs approved, instead of effective drugs approved,\" said Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, who said the last game-changing breast cancer drug, Herceptin, was approved nearly 20 years ago. Leftfootforward, stopping the TX when you did because of the SE probably helped protect your heart from further damage. It was actually a fortuitous event. May you continue to benefit for many, many decades to come. As a long term survivor, you're one of my heroes",

Time to rejoice for Judy Perkins, may she be the first of many. although experts caution that the treatment has only proved itself in one woman and that the clinical trials are needed to see how effective the therapy could be in other cancer patients.

Doctors who cared for the woman at the US National Cancer Institute in Maryland said Perkins's response had been \"remarkable\": the therapy wiped out cancer cells so effectively that she has now been free of the disease for two years. The doctors treated Perkins by injecting 80 billion of the carefully-selected immune cells into her body. The therapy was given alongside pembrolizumab, a standard drug that can help the immune system to attack cancers. Tests after 42 weeks showed Perkins was completely cancer free. She has remained so ever since.    Z\u2014 how is this procedure different from the one you underwent in Japan? Was it just the lack of keytruda?did she get the keytruda because she was estrogen negative?",

A groundbreaking clinical trial on whether diet could boost the effectiveness of cancer drugs is set to be launched by one of the world's leading\u2026  The patients will be treated with a licensed drug, Aliqopa, that has previously been shown to have limited effects in such patients. However, recent animal studies, including a paper this week in Nature from Mukherjee's lab, suggest its effectiveness could be significantly boosted when combined with diet changes aimed at lowering insulin levels. \u201cTo achieve this, patients will be put on a so-called ketogenic diet (high in fat, low in carbohydrate, normal protein). \"If you combine them with a diet which [keeps insulin low], all of a sudden these drugs become effective,\" said Mukherjee, referring to the Nature study. \"The diet really works like a drug.\" In some cases, Vousden added, what might intuitively seem correct \u2013 giving patients on chemotherapy a sugary drink, say \u2013 might not be the optimal way to boost calorie intake. \"We want to champion the idea that you give dietary advice based on hard evidence,\" she said. ( no shit! Sherlock! can't make this stuff up folks!) Maybe one day, hopefully soon, they will study the effect of ingesting processed sugary foods on the growth of cancers. Meanwhile if you don't want to wait, you can achieve the same effect by taking Metformin or Berberine, the natural over the counterequivalent. https://www.diabetes.co.uk/news/2017/dec/metformin-shown-to-have-cancer-fighting-powers-98119731.html   ",

The interview is with a famous NY oncologist that reveals how many years ago his friend, well know MD Robert Atkins, was convinced that he could treat cancer patients with his famous ketogenic diet, but he was unsuccessful and had to shut down the cancer treatment program. MO Nicholas Gonzales was my first MO. Educated at Cornell, he worked at MSK as a bone marrow transplant specialist before starting his own private practice. Unfortunately he died unexpectedly from an heart attack 2 months after I started seeing him, but he had by then given me a precise and individualized dietary protocol that I still follow.... Basically, he told me that I could eat everything I wanted, except processed foods, but NO meat and coffeewhatsoever. Everything I eat has to be organic, and after further research I now eat primarily imported foods because the FDA has no guidelines for the amount of mycotoxins in our food supply, and in my humble opinion that's the root cause of ALL cancers, since they feed various mycotoxins to creatures to induce cancers. Like cancers, mycotoxins contamination's are impossible to eliminate without our own distruction....sounds familiar? BTW...Taxol is a very powerful antifungal..... He also prescribed a large amounts of supplements that were specified just for me. I gave this information to Zarovka, at the time when she was following Luongo and starving herself before and after her chemotherapy sessions....I don't really know what exactly killed that beautiful soul in the end, but it's obvious that low-carb was not the answer in her case. Low carb is very good, however, for a slew of other serious health problems, so it can be overall beneficial....I get my carbs from fruits and vegetables...legumes but almost no grains. No alcohol. I've recently discovered Beyond Meat hamburgers and I'm in heaven...they are better than the real thing without the growth hormones, mycotoxins and cruelty. The founder is a conscious human being and I trust him, his foods and his mission....Good Luck with whatever your research leads to....  ",

I don't want to give up on X, I want to make it work for me for years, your experience is so reassuring and I'm so happy to know that it worked for you so well for so long, but I'm very worried because my situation seems to me very peculiar but maybe it's not. I'm currently on 4and 4 one week on one off, and have been on it for three months. When I started I was on 3and 2, than 4and 3 and now 4and 4. My MO instructed me to not take any antioxidants and I therefore stopped taking NAC which I believe was offering my liver some protection. The high levels ofTM throughout have not changed much, but since starting X my ALT and AST have gone from normal throughout the 3 years diagnosis to 8 fold higher. My platelets are suddenly also out of whack as well. Otherwise I'm not suffering from any other side effects, in fact I'm feeling better than ever energy wise, mentally and emotionally. I love the one week on/ off type of thing My pet scan is scheduled for next month, but I'm afraid to continue taking the medication at the current level. I can't expect any help from my MO because he saw those same ALT and AST level yesterday and said nothing, he was concerned about the platelets. I have realized by now that MO's take it for granted that there will be collateral damage but because they can't control it, they tend to be in denial of negative consequences. However, according to the American Cancer Society\u2014a bastion of conservative thinking\u2014serious and life threatening effects from TX include renal and liver failure, heart disease, and blood clots, and it's the combination of these damaging consequences to the body which often leads to the occurrence of a secondary cancer, and this is what truly scares me. So far the collateral damages have been the destruction of my disgestive system and a broken back, I would rather not add the loss of my liver. The question for you and the rest of the community is what I should do till the results of the pet scan come out a month from now. Stay on the same dose or reduce it by 25% since the maximum dose has not affected my cancer markers, but then we all know that TM are not reliable. I'm thinking on taking the NAC again, detoxing the liver naturally, and going back to coffee enemas twice @ day, which is a real pain in the neck and see if I can help the liver get rid of all those dead cells and toxic residues that it's finding so hard to eliminate on its own.... What do you think? Is it wise or unwise?Thank you all for your insigh and support on this matter.",

So, since I love to eat sweets and I\u2019m diabetic, I learned about nutrition, and created a series of delicious yet healthy desserts that solve that problem, so I could have my cake and eat it too...so to speak...so sharing it with others made sense.

It's good because finding another link can be seen as another step closer to understanding what makes cancer tick and how it can be cured, and bad because people with diabetes have one more deadly disease added on to the list. \"Cancer and diabetes are two of the worst health problems in developed countries, and there's a link between the two. For cancer, half of the story is still genetics. It's only recently we realized there is another half that we missed, which is the microenvironment,\" study author Prof. Mingming Wu said. Basically, the research explains that how cancer will grow and spread is highly dependent on the microenvironment where it is, and the elevated blood sugar in people with diabetes can help it move around more easily. This happens through a process called \"glycation,\" which is the change that happens around collagen fibers caused by diabetes. The researchers believe more work needs to be done. Moving forward, the researchers aim to differentiate the mechanical and chemical impact of glycation in the metastasis process, which is when the tumor cells start spreading.  I can't believe that they're arriving at this conclusion NOW!! Let me tell you, we're gonna need A LOT of positive thinking if we're to survive so much ignorance and lack of common sense!

Steve Jobs left to his own devices lasted fourteen years with liver and pancreatic cancer, but sadly died following a liver transplant, the same can't be said about David Bowie and some of the Rockefeller's and Koch's brothers ...if all these wealthy and powerful people, with all the money and privileges couldn't survive this disease, it leads me to believe that cures are NOT willing being held back, I would guess it's just sheer incompetence. Maybe, the answer is right under their noses, but they keep on looking in the wrong directions. After all diabetes causes all sorts of diseases: it affects the heart, the kidneys, the eyes, the loss of toes...yet it's caused by just one very simple problem: lack of insulin that can be corrected with a proper diet if need be Kattysmith....thank you for the info, sending you more vibrant wishes of success with the TX. I will ask my MO at MSK when I see him next if they are participating",

They llower blood sugar levels for those people that are not on Metformin.... Obesity, insulin, and cancer are linked. That suggests a mainstay diabetes drug might help cancer patients. http://www.philly.com/health/cancer-metformin-insulin-obesity-diabetes-20190109.html Starting 50 years ago, population-based studies found that diabetes increased the risk of numerous types of cancer, and worsened the outlook. But an \"association,\" as scientists call it, just raises a red flag. Beginning in the early 2000s, studies of diabetics showed that those who had taken metformin had unusually low rates of certain cancers \u2014 in some analyses, the risk was halved \u2014 and lower rates of cancer death. Chronic inflammation and sex hormones also seem to contribute to the interplay of obesity and cancer. But insulin, produced by the pancreas to regulate blood sugar, is most consistently implicated as a culprit in cancer development and outcomes. Many types of cancer cells grown in lab dishes, particularly breast cancer cells, produce an abundance of protein \"receptors\" that receive signals from insulin and a closely related hormone called insulinlike growth factor. This signaling network helps malignant cells get and use glucose, and may activate pathways that drive cancer cell growth, proliferation, survival, and metastasis, the deadly spread to distant tissues. \"It also appears that insulin [signaling] may stimulate normal cells that are involved in cancer progression,\" such as smooth muscle cells that form new blood vessels needed by tumors, said the ADA/ACA joint report. If malfunctioning insulin promotes cancer, could improving the hormone's function inhibit cancer? And could normalizing insulin help cancer patients even if they don't have diabetes? Obese patients' high blood sugar \"may impact tumor growth by providing cancer cells with an abundance of fuel,\" explains a review article coauthored by Ryan Dowling, a biochemist at Princess Margaret Cancer Center in Toronto. \"I don't think anybody expects that metformin will have a drastic or long-term effect on cancer by itself,\" said Fox Chase Cancer Center oncologist Daniel Geynisman, who is conducting a trial of metformin in prostate cancer that has come back after conventional treatment. \"The question is, can it augment our standards of care \u2014 not to mention helping with\" insulin resistance. On that note, I'll be further reducing my intake of simple carbs and will take my Metformin regularly. Although I have already been off all sugars and processed foods for the last few years, I can't resist a delicious sandwich once in a while.",

      "Content": "May 9, 2019 05:26AM - edited May 9, 2019 07:23AM by Frisky Is anyone participating in this promising clinical trial being conducted at MT Sinai? It does sounds too good to be true, since it's intelligence is in direct contrast to the stupidity demonstrated in the shocking article I posted above. Researchers at Mount Sinai have developed a novel approach to cancer immunotherapy, injecting immune stimulants directly into a tumor to teach the immune system to destroy it and other tumor cells throughout the body. The \"in situ vaccination\" worked so well in patients with advanced-stage lymphoma that it is also undergoing trials in breast and head and neck cancer patients, according to a study published in Nature Medicine in April. The treatment consists of administering a series of immune stimulants directly into one tumor site. The first stimulant recruits important immune cells called dendritic cells that act like generals of the immune army. The second stimulant activates the dendritic cells, which then instruct T cells, the immune system's soldiers, to kill cancer cells and spare non-cancer cells. This immune army learns to recognize features of the tumor cells so it can seek them out and destroy them throughout the body, essentially turning the tumor into a cancer vaccine factory.( ain't this grand?) \"The in situ vaccine approach has broad implications for multiple types of cancer,\" said lead author Joshua Brody, MD, Director of the Lymphoma Immunotherapy Program at The Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. \"This method could also increase the success of other immunotherapies such as checkpoint blockade.\" After testing the lymphoma vaccine in the lab, it was tested in 11 patients in a clinical trial. Some patients had full remission from months to years. In lab tests in mice, the vaccine drastically increased the success of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, the type of immunotherapy responsible for the complete remission of former President Jimmy Carter's cancer and the focus of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Medicine. A clinical trial for lymphoma, breast, and head and neck cancer patients opened in March to test the vaccine with checkpoint blockade drugs. Because the combined immune therapy was at least three times more powerful than either checkpoint blockade or the vaccine by themselves, researchers are extremely optimistic about how effective this may be in patients in this new trial. The in situ vaccine is also being tested in the lab in liver and ovarian cancer. Cure-ious, what say yee? Is this as good as it sounds? Or should I curb my enthusiasm? These are the clinical trials and approaches that get me all positively charged and hopeful about our collective future. ",

I'm so happy to hear that! https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-04-treatment-tumors-cancer-vaccine-factories.html Question: when they say checkpoint blockade, does it mean that all the pathways the cancer can use to grow are blocked simultaneously I have a friend that works there, I'll try to find out more about it, and maybe even call them to see if they have slots and if I qualify. Mt Sinai is where I was first diagnosed and treated. However, I would find leaving MSK stressful. MSK is like a country club in comparison. I never have to wait more than a few minutes and the lounges are very elegant. MSK staff is intelligent, they are trained well. Also, I never have to worry and deal with my insurance company. They fight and get paid, no matter what, no matter how long it takes! So there's comfort in that...At Mt Sinai everything took hours of waiting, they were extremely disorganized, staff was overworked and tended to display an inappropriate attitude. Tomorrow I'll find out more when I sign the papers, but my next appointment will be at the end of May. When I asked what phase of the trial I would be joining, mo replied 1B, as if too say it's just one phase, since all the other aspects of the drug have been approved already. Ormaybe, MO decided to wait for the genetic results to see if there are new mutations that can affect the choice of tx. Or it could be simply a washout period.... Will update tomorrow...  Leftfootforward, I'm so happy you're stable! Congratulations on those great results ",

I can lift and use my right arm and my left leg without any problems, it's nothing short of miraculous, considering the amount of Lodacaine and fentanyl patches I was using without getting any relief. God bless that Miss Chen! I'm also experimenting with half a dose of Korean red Ginseng for energy, since I got a green light from MSK. I was surprised by how delicious this concoction is, and I can see how it would be easy to drink the whole box....and then some...watch out I might turn into super Miao.... At times, I totally understand the need we all have to utterly disassociate from reality. We learn to disassociate early on, in order to survive the various forms of abuse and neglect of our infancy needs. Children that lack this ability, don't survive. It's a very important coping mechanism. The problem is that even after we're all grown up\u2014and have more control of our lives\u2014we find it hard to give up that numbing dissociative state. That's why psychotherapy is a very long and most of time useless process. It's very hard to wake people up when the psychotherapists are asleep themselves....but that's another story.... The movie The Matrix is a wonderful metaphor for this dissociative state. But now and then, like Neo soon found out, it's preferable\u2014although very painful\u2014to wake up in order to actually live. The alternative was to remain unconsciously attached to a machine while thinking you're walking about and eating a juicy steak, which is what one of the characters chose to do. And that's fine too..to each his own....nothing wrong with using whatever we have at our disposal to feel better about ourselves....free choice is such a wonderful concept, and positive thinking is a very powerful tool we can all use to heal ourselves Many great poets and philosophers have attempted to make us aware of this situation, Plato beautifully stated that what changes is not real, but in my view, no one did it better than Shakespeare with Prospero's monologue at the end of The Tempest. Enjoy! Prospero: Our revels now are ended. These our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits, and Are melted into air, into thin air: And like the baseless fabric of this vision, The cloud-capp'd tow'rs, the gorgeous palaces, The solemn temples, the great globe itself, Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve, And, like this insubstantial pageant faded, Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff As dreams are made on; and our little life Is rounded with a sleep. ",

Yesterday, coffee was added to that list\u2014but they knew it was a huge problem 10 years ago. Over time, depending on our exposure and personal vulnerabilities, these viruses, indigenous to the human body, change our DNA and affect our immune system's ability to recognize the problem, since in a balanced gut these creatures serve a very good purpose. Finding a vaccine, in my humble opinion, is the way to go...and this morning I read this interesting article on the subject. Amazing results are coming out of Stanford University. Experiments conducted on mice with a vaccine caused 97% of ALL CANCERS TO BE DESTROYED! When they start experimenting on people, I will be the first to enroll...for me this is the way to go.... Let's use the therapies available to stay alive as long as possible, hopefully, we will get to finally experience real progress being made against this terrible disease... We can do it! https://inhabitat.com/scientists-are-launching-human-trials-for-a-cancer-vaccine-that-cured-97-of-tumors-in-mice/",

Ass pinching and grabbing is one the characteristics of a big sporcaccione, so watch out! But the food is good! You'll have a ball! Right next and above Il Posto is the High Line, a long stretch of abandoned railroad tracks that have been successfully transformed into a beautiful an elegant park. You can see the west village, the meat market, and all of Chelsea while strolling the High line, among the thousands of people that visit it everyday. Hopefully it will be in bloom at that time, however, Manhattan doesn't become green till late May. Close to Il Posto is the entrance to the Chelsea Market, a huge food shopping center. The Food Network broadcasts from that building. Maybe we can meet there for an authentic Italian gelato and then stroll the high line. I'll PM you about that. You'll love Chelsea, don't forget to stop at La Bergamote, an authentic French Patisserie located on 9th ave and 20th street for one of their Napoleons or whatever strikes your fancy. They are made daily. Out of this world! My friends and I instantly regress and are transported back in time, to when food was still real, When we didn't have to worry about how all the chemicals and preservatives of heavily processed foods are slowly killing us. I live nearby, at the cusp of Chelsea near Gramercy, the Flatiron and all the Villages. Slightly west of 5th Avenue close to the Union Square farmer's market...where's else would you expect an Italian to live in Manhattan?

My situation will become clearer when I take the 7.5 mg, check onthe results and get to know my new MO. He is very active with all the trials.

And less than 20 grams @serving from sugar and carbs it's pretty, pretty good...it amounts to 1/2 egg, 30grams of dark chocolate and some butter @serving. Recipe for Flourless and Sugarless Chocolate Cake-16 portions This cake is deliciously decadent and intense-but filling. You will experience immediate satiety and no cravings, guaranteed! 500 grams 72% bittersweet chocolate (trader joe has the perfect 500gms confection imported from Belgium) 1-1.5 sticks of organic unsalted butter cut into pieces 8 cold, large organic eggs 1 teaspoon of pure stevia powder (buy from Bulk Supplements on Amazon. It's pure and you need very small amounts) A pinch sea salt 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 16 Fresh sliced strawberries for garnish (optional) Whipped cream or full-fat yogurt (topping optional) Directions Preheat oven 325 degrees. Grease with butter a 9 inches spring-form baking pan. (a pyrex will work as well) Melt the chocolate and butter together in a double boiler and stir till smooth. Add the vanilla. Beat the cold eggs at high speed with a whisk attachment until creamy and the volume has doubled. Fold the beaten eggs slowly into the chocolate mixture using a large rubber spatula. Keep on adding and folding till the two mixtures are completely integrated and even. Scrape the batter into the pan and smooth the surface till it's even. Set the pan in the center of the oven. Bake until a thin-glazed crust starts to form, approximately 25 minutes Cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate overnight to mellow and firm. (I usually eat a piece right away- it's amazing even when lukewarm) 30 Minutes before serving, remove the sides of the springform pan and cut into slices. If desired, lightly dust the cake with powdered sugar and top with strawberries. To slice, use a sharp, thin-bladed knife, dipped into hot water and wipe the blade clean before each cut.

I got home exhausted but very happy, and even took a shower before collapsing. You know...another way to feed the adrenals is to eat fatty, cholesterol rich proteins, like eggs, with a good pinch of sea salt and a rich source of vitamin C at the same time, that will do it, but nothing beats the little licorice pellet. I've started taking also couple drops of Lugol's solution iodine in the morning. That's been also pivotal in getting my old self back again. Thank you for sharing your positive review of X....I'll be less fearful tomorrow. Let me know when you visit Manhattan, god willing we can chat while we have coffee together at the bench,",

This article is a lot easier to read and very upbeat From Immunotherapy, a Flipboard topic For George Coukos, one of the world's foremost experts in immunotherapy, this is \"an extraordinary moment in human history\" when the word \u2026From his mouth to God's ear....   Last but not least...the most interesting and innocous treatment of all that corroborates the work of an Italian MO and surgeon called Simoncini. He has been injecting baking soda and successfully treating people's cancers. He says cancer is a fungus, a form of candida...and isn't interesting that candida is indestructible\u2014 can only be contained\u2014and is what will ultimately consume and will remain of our bodies? That ultimately, what we will leave behind will be a pile of well fed funguses? Simoncini says that candida is always present in large quantities at the site of many types of cancers...In his view, a tumor is nothing more than your body's attempt at protecting itself from Candida. however the medical establishment sees that as a coincidence. No one is really paying attention to the fungus colonies and asking what are they doing around tumors. And what a interesting coincidence that both cancer and candida thrive on sugar...and the symptoms, such as fatigue, are also similar. I may be partial to this theory because Simoncini is Italian, and for the last forty years I was unsuccessfully treated for candida overgrowth. So, one thing I know: candida is as impossible to destroy as are cancer stem cells. Thank you for allowing me to indulge in this bit of heresy.... the content of the article below is to blame.... To be on the safe side I just added a teaspoon of baking soda to my glass of lemonade, it actually adds flavor to the drink...although as per Simoncini the baking soda has to be injected directly at the site of the fungus colony ie the tumor or circulate in the blood. Shooting bicarbonate of soda in patients is used regularly in hospitals to treat many serious diseases. Who knew?  https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321970.php  Baking soda could help to boost immunotherapy. Within tumors, large portions are deprived of oxygen. Scientists know that these hypoxic regions tend to be the most resistant to treatment.If a cell is unable to access adequate oxygen, it slows down and enters what is known as a quiescent state. Back to greek....The molecular switch mTORC1 is responsible for assessing the situation before telling the cell whether or not it should divide.If mTORC1 is not present, the cell's internal processes are shut down. Deep within tumors, mTORC1 activity is almost non-existent. When a cell enters this quiescent state, cancer drugs are much less effective. So, the researchers wanted to see if it could be overturned. They found that, when mice were given baking soda in their drinking water, the acidity of the quiescent regions of tumors was reversed. Once this had occurred, lysosomes were sent back toward the nucleus, mTOR was activated by RHEB, and cellular processes were switched back on. Dang explains what the scientists saw after mice had consumed baking soda, saying, \"[T]he entire tumor lights up with mTOR activity. The prediction would be that by reawakening these cells, you could make the tumor far more sensitive to therapy.\" Cancer immunotherapy has been demonstrated to be less effective in acidic conditions because T cell activation is reduced, so this finding could have important ramifications. Acidity's role in cancer progression and treatment is a fledgling area of research, which means that much more work will surely follow. Dang and his team plan to continue their experimentation, focusing on how acidity impacts immunotherapy. BTW...all alternative protocols are in agreement over the need to alkalize our bodies and reduce acidity for optimum health. That's why eating loads of veggies is so important  This video talks about how to strengthen our immune system, so we can prevent deadly fungal infections when being treated in a hospital",

From my uneducated and humble perspective, I'm hoping for a paradigm shift in the fight against cancer. I fear they all seems to be looking so close, they are missing the big picture. Diabetes used to be a deadly disease, with all sorts of horrible health problems, until someone figured out that the lack and proper absorption of insulin was the culprit for all those symptoms. That is true for every person that is prediabetic or diabetic. The mechanisms\u2014a diet rich in simple carbs and sugars\u2014and solutions\u2014stop eating so many carbs, and excercise, or inject some insulin\u2014are clear and the same all over the world. insulin injection alllow people to live with diabetes. I believe the solution for all cancers lies similarly\u2014in the lack or abundance of something\u2014that makes us sick. Which can be fueled by the barrage of estrogenic factors and the hundred of carcinogenic chemicals in our food, water, soil, and air. Maybe some of us are more susceptible to this barrage of carcinogens. It has been scientifically proven, based on the rate of the growth of cancer cells that a 1cm tumor takes 10 years to grow. So it leads me to believe that some of us become exposed and suffer from whatever is lacking or abundant in our lifestyle throughout our lives, and hormonal factors contribute to it's growth Let's not forget that today 1in 2 people will be diagnosed with some type of cancer in their lifetime, and that ratio is getting only worst, so I truly hope they start looking at the causes and stop working on extending life by months at the cost of so much suffering, especially for all of us that are at stage four, but of course if any one of those geniuses with their noses into the subatomical look of cancer comes up with \u201da cure\u201d I\u2019ll be very happy. I would love to be wrong. ",

      "Content": "Jun 3, 2018 09:11AM - edited Jun 3, 2018 09:59AM by Frisky good morning everyone! Blainej\u2014 thank you for your explanation. i measure my BS two hours after a meal and try to achieve around 120 but it's impossible if I eat a carb rich meal and don't take 1000mg of metformin with it. When I measure in the morning, sometimes I'm around 100 but a lot of times is a bit higher. Afinitor wreaked that delicate balance and I was measuring around 200 two hours after the same type of meal and 130/140 before I ate anything. That was the number one reason to ditch Afinitor, it was so destructive to my system. I too use fats to curb my sugar cravings. The one you described is very powerful, but my favorite is a glass of frozen tiramisù that I make with eggs, stevia, and imported mascarpone cheese, flavored with vanilla beans and dark chocolate shavings. That provides a level of fullness and satisfaction that is hard to achieve otherwise. The eggs have to be separated and beaten into airy frothy frenzy that turns the concoction into the richest ice cream known to mankind. The ration is one egg to 2onces of mascarpone. Z\u2014 thank you for all that information and reference material about cancer and nutrition. I will look at it carefully. You're absolutely right about the danger of the insulin spikes, but unfortunately for some of us with insulin resistance it's kind of too late. The difference between simple and complex carbs no longer makes much of a difference in keeping insulin and sugar levels low. It's question of quantities, therefore the wisdom of intermittent fasting, and measured amounts and carbs in relation to fiber and fats. I take 600 mg of NAC daily to support my liver, in addition to around 60 other supplements as prescribed by the infamous MO Nicholas Gonzales before he left this reality, does anyone knows if I shouldn't take the NA? This naturopath MO has conducted a study on the effect of sugar on cancer patients. https://natureworksbest.com/blog/2014/05/27/sugar-feeds-cancer-growth/  Consuming sweetened foods (other than stevia sweetened foods) made a significant difference in patient outcome across both all stages and all types of cancer among patients presenting to our clinic. Therefore, we recommend that the diet of cancer patients not contain sweeteners other than stevia. ",

A sugary diet can drive fungal infections. Most fruit has antifungal vitamins, like vitamin C, and is loaded with fiber that counteracts the negative effects of sugar. Humans are supposed to eat fruit we are not supposed to extract fructose from fibrous plants or refine flour into a cocaine-like substance, except too much sugar is not appropriate when our bodies have been invaded by sugar loving fiends.. the real problem in my view is that99% of processed foods have added sugar, I've been experimenting lately with the introduction of antifungals as an adjunct therapy to xeloda. I'm basically ingesting liquified raw garlic with my salad dressing, adding drops of grape seeds extract and ground flax seed to my drinks, or adding coconut oil which contains caprylic acid and taking various probiotics at other times, since I discovered that afloxins are common contaminants of our food supply, and guess what they give mice when they want to induce cancer? Aflotoxins!!! You can't make this stuff up. And what do all the alternative cancer treatments throughout history, I've discovered have in common? They unknowingly made use of various powerful antifungals like curcumin. From the MSK website: Curcumin: To prevent cancer. Several animal studies suggest that turmeric prevents colon, stomach, and skin cancers in rats exposed to carcinogens. A Brazilian research team investigating the efficacy of Curcumin against 23 strains of fungi found that Curcumin was able to completely inhibit the growth of Candida albicans, as well as a number of other fungal strains. The researchers also tested Curcumin using human cells, and found Curcumin was able to stop Candida from adhering to the human cells. In fact, they found that Curcumin was even more potent than the commercial antifungal drug fluconazole. (Rarely prescribed as it damages the liver) Another study examined the effect of ascorbic acid on the antifungal properties of Curcumin. Although ascorbic acid has no significant antifungal properties of its own, researchers found that using it alongside Curcumin actually made the Curcumin more effective. Even more remarkable was that the Curcumin was 5-10 times more effective against Candida albicans when it was used in the presence of ascorbic acid! This suggests that certain vitamin C supplements may help to make curcumin even more effective against Candida. When I asked my MO if it was okay to pursue an antifungal diet while on Xeloda, he said to not overdo it and to not take any Curcumin....interesting don't you think? why would he tell me to not take it, if as they claim, natural supplements are useless and it doesn\u2019t interfere with the capecitabine? https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/aflatoxins Fungi are formidable and hard to destroy adversaries when they systemically invade the human body and put down roots. Like cancer they love to feast on sugars and likewise mutate, spread, and fight back when under attack.....hummm..... CelebrateLife, may you get good results!",

For the past 30 years my company designed and produced scenery for well known TV shows like Today on NBC, Saturday Night Live, four Super Bowls, Wimbledon, local and national sets for the news and sports divisions of the various networks. In the process I won five Emmys and the more prestigious Gracie Award for an innovation I contributed to my line of work. Maybe becaus of the drinking freely available at those shows, I could never gather the courage to get up when my name was called and would send the producers to accept on my behalf. After I attended the first one, I simply stopped going althogether, I was always a contrarian with an attitude, so it fit my personality well and there was always someone desperate to sit in my chair. Now 13 years after I retired, I look at my old profession as if it was from a past life. I love writing now...perfect while living with MBC. Enjoy the event! Big hug",

Read the full story Allison, MD Anderson Cancer Center's chairman of immunology, conducted research that's led to a class of drugs that unleash immune system brakes.

I worry so much about what years of these medications are doing to our remaining functioning organs, but on the other hand we don't really have a choice...do we? I'm currently experiencing intense pain in my left leg, buttock and lower spine and the possibility of a femur fracture without impact, after getting good results from a pet scan only a month ago....these are side effects usually associated with Xgeva, a medication that's supposed to protect our bones. To top it all off, I found out that if they stop the medication my blood could get flooded with too much calcium which can be lethal.....plus my bones will get brittle again.... When I asked my MO how we could PREVENT a fracture, he prescribed X-rays....which would not prevent anything, as the fractures occur unexpectedly. I checked the report from the clinical trial on the Amgen Website and they offer no solution either. If someone knows a way out please let me know.... Cancer treatments defy logic sometimes ...they are simply too unpredicable and inconsistent to be called scientific...IMHO... Sending you JFL, and all the others suffering from unexpected changes my best wishes for a smart and successful solution to all our current predictments...Be well",

I instinctively reached for a pinch of sea salt when I ate breakfast this morning...and I am feeling much better. there have been a large number of studies that point to persistent stressful conditions as the start of a chain reaction that blocks the production of melatonin and produce inflammation that, they believe, leads to the development of a terrain conducive to cancer growth and mTor overactivity. Of course there are also additional environmental, dietary, and genetic factors that contribute to its various formations and development in the most compromised parts of the body. I myself keep stress to a minimum and eat mostly imported recognizable foods that I cook myself from scratch. I distill and then carbon filter all the water that I drink and use in my cooking. When I eat out, I go to only 3 restaurants that I have inspected to have the cleanest kitchens and intelligent staff. That's how much I have grown to distrust our way of life. If they have allowed asbestos in talcum powder, that negatively affects the health of babies for years, full knowing the consequences....well....I rest my case.... So, although I'm sure you're already doing this, whenever possible try to shield your wife from stresses, the ups and down of everyday life. You might want to consult also with a functional doctor about adrenal support. Fighting cancer drains our adrenals....which leads to inflammation, which leads to conditions favorable to cancer growth...etc etc...  ",

Tomorrow morning I'm meeting my MO to go over chemotherapy options. Can you help me chose which one to start with? Obviously, I'm looking for the one that's less likely to damage me permanently.

They recommended that the visible part of one of my teeth that had a root canal be cut down, but my enthodontist found and repaired instead, a small cavity that had developed, so I'm still using that tooth.

The Korean ginseng is different from the American one which is estrogenic. There was research conducted at the Mayo Clinic that said it was safe. I started reading my dossier....The study drug IS THOUGHT to work by blocking growth signals in cancer cells, and the goal is to shrink the tumor mass. No mention of stopping stem cells from creating more metastasis, which should be their only goal This study will focus on finding the right dose\u2014 which is an oxymoron since we are all different and what works for one patient will kill another...but what do I know? some of the expected SE are : Diarrhea, vomiting, weight loss, loss of appetite, dehydration.... whaooo, that's exactly the sort of minor inconveniences that cancer patients need in addition to the hell they are already experiencing on a daily base to stay strong. Right? Thus, I have deducted, that this \u201cmedicine\" suppresses the immune system located in our bio-dome\u2014which I've been patiently restoring after the devastation caused by the my first intake of ibrance. They believe that this drug MAY benefit people....based on the results on cats and dogs. Can someone please explain, how reducing our ability to eat, digest, and assimilate food, helps our case or those poor cats and dogs? What about the devastation to our functioning organs? This is nuts!! Another major worry is what I consider the underlying faulty rational that continues to still plague these studies\u2014 regardless of the half million Americans that die from their uselessness every year....which boils down to: let's see how much medication a patient can take before the SE are unbearable. Instead of thinking: let's see how LITTLE medication can produce good results. As we all learn from these boards, more medications don't necessarily correlate with better outcomes, because we're all different, and the contrary is true. Some wise Greek, thousand of years ago, stated: Measure is all! That statement is considered to be the wisest maxim to live by. I believe, that if they knew what they were doing\u2014and these medications were really effective\u2014they wouldn't have to bombard us with massive doses. Oh...and among the numerous warnings of what can go wrong, apart from liver, kidney, heart and blood damages that can be permanent.... is dying.... I want to apologize for my negative spin this morning, at times such as this, I feel like a sheep waiting to be taken to the slaughterhouse or one of those frogs that unknowingly dies as they raise the water's temperature.... A lack of viable alternatives, doesn't make these treatments rational. We must insist and fight for a cure, the reason why people are living instead of dying from AIDS is because they fought hard and demanded results.....it seems to me, that we're happy with crumbs! Thank you for allowing me to honestly vent my concerns and fears this morning. In a few hours I'll see my acupuncturist and as fatigue, aches and pain leave my body, my mood will soar and my distrust will dissolve.",

I was on Letrazole for couple years, then moved on to Faslodex and Ibrance for eight months and for the past two months I've been on Tamoxifen and Afinitor. I realized when it was too late that Ibrance causes stomatitis, I thus suffered from diarrhea, flatulence, indigestion and nausea for a few months. My MO at MSKCC sent me to see their gastroenterologist that unfortunately couldn't help me. I have since resolved my gastric problems by ingesting, before I eat anything: 2 capsules of hydrocloric acid from Thorne. 3 ox bile salts from Douglass Laboratories, 4-5 capsules of pancreatic enzymes, and various other digestive enzymes and probiotics. I have since eliminated Imodium and the nausea medication. My appetite is back to normal. Z- I don't know if this information is helpful to you, maybe you're already taking a bunch of digestive Enzymes, but I know what you're going through, and I felt I had something to contribute that maybe helpful to you and others with cancer medications induced stomatitis. You're all great women, and I feel fortunate to be able to read your stories, your victories, and your struggles. Now I'm ready to share my own. May God bless us all",

I'm taking it at the insistence of my MO, whose judgement I greatly respect. Since I was diagnosed I have gone through a number of MO's and primary physicians because I disagreed with their protocols. While I was busy debating without any theraphy the cancer progressed and two vertebras collapsed. So I learned my lesson. Right now I'm not ready to lose the goodwill and sympathy of the whole team at MSKC over Afinitor, I'm just being extra careful to not let the SE get too far. I didn't take it the first month, but I was told to take it when my tumor markers went up on Tamoxifen alone. (which was my choice) After the first week I developed a dry cough, so I stopped taking it (two days) till the cough cleared. The following week I developed strong pain in my right flank and liver area, serious side effect so I stopped taking it for another two days till I felt better. This week I developed an itching and rash that's being treated with a cream they prescribed. This time it was my MO that insisted I stop taking it for two days. I want to stay as long as possible on the hormonal, for obvious reasons, but I'm also psychologically getting ready to move on to xeloda next, and I already got a prescription for hand and foot desease ready. In couple weeks I'll be getting a pet scan which may confirm what I fear: that at 5mg afinitor simply is useless and at 10mg is very dangerous. Starting chemotherapy will allow me to qualify for the Immunetheraphy clinical trials being conducted at MSKCC, which is what I consider a better choice for me. I just don't believe in the suppression of the immune system and the compromise of major organs...but such is the state of healthcare...I wish we had more options. Best of luck with your decision. ",

It takes usually a month before the gut starts healing, the problem is that we need to continue taking the necessary cancer medications which impede the healing. therefore it's important in order to digest foods to supplement with various enzymes. Right now I need all of them, from hydrochlic acid, to bile salts, to pancreatic enzymes and of course probiotics. Afinitor this week peeled off my upper palate, so I stopped taking it for two days and increased the magic mouthwash swishing. If it did that to my mouth, i believeit's doing that to my intestines.... It's unfortunate that as we are stuck between the rock and the hard place... Md Myers mentions Lglutamine as the number one aminoacid that repairs the gut quickly, however lglutamine according to MSKCC also feeds cancer, so it\u2019s better to use the beef bone broth instead.",

This new found knowledge could result in more appropriate medications available to more patients based on the cancer type instead of location. Our current cancers treatments remind of the parable of the elephant, where everyone is so close they believe onlywhat they can touch. So for some the elephant is a leg, for others is the nose, or the tail...but only the wise from a proper distance can see the elephant in its entirety.... May researchers, big pharma, the FDA, and our doctors finally transcend decades of utter ignorance, and poisonous therapies, and get giggy with it!

I envy your ability to still digest large quantities of fruits. I second everything you've doing to minimize your exposure to estrogenic, dairy, and contaminated foods. In addition i distill my drinking and cooking water, and than I use a carbon filter to remove the chlorine the distillation process leaves behind. It's amazing how different my water looks and tastes after all of that. Of course I supplement with minerals to replace what's eliminated from the distillation process. Yep! I'm that kind of person too...:-)) But since I'm predaibetic, eating large quantities of fruits is out of the question. That's how I end up with an insulin resistant problem to start with. Unless a person has a very active lifestyle\u2014two hours of bycice riding @ day and walking around Manhattan didn't make any difference in my case, plus diabetes runs in my family\u2014two many carbs are nowa poison to the system.

There's an ongoing clinical trial that uses one of these pills with another med that my new MO said is very effective with minor side effects. He is leaning on Faslodex instead of Xeloda right now. He will base his decision on the results of my blood work today, if there\u2019s some dramatic changes he would want to keep me on the current treatment.

      "Content": "May 1, 2018 06:34AM - edited May 1, 2018 11:06PM by Frisky Dear Scwilly, Sorry about the problems that high bilirubin are creating. Hi bilirubin levels are related to gallbladder issues and problems absorbing fats. Therefore, reducing the ingestion of fats should be beneficial. However, a quick scan of your dinner indicates you were not eating a lot of fats last night. Therefore you need assistance with the assimilation of foods in general and fats in particular. But, please notice, I'm no expert on these matters, I will be sharing only what I have learned that is currently working for me. My digestive system had been greatly impaired from the ingestion of cancer medications for the past three years. In my case, I had tremendous nausea, vomit, and diarrhea. I simply couldn't digest and assimilate foods anymore. If the stool floats, it's a sign of improper assimilation. I went to see a gastroenterologist at MSKCC but got no help. So what resolved all my digestive problems was supplementing with various digestive enzymes before eating any meal. Than I discovered a product that contained all those various ingredients in couple caps and now I rarely have nausea, (only after taking a med on an empty stomach) or gas, stomachaches, and diarrhea. Before I eat ANY thing I take two Bio Gest capsules, a product made by Thorne. It contains all the digestive enzymes, hydrochloric acid, bile salts and pancreatic enzymes the body needs to assimilate food. This is the description of the product: For individuals who need a more broad-spectrum digestive aid Thorne Research offers Bio-Gest. Bio-Gest contains HCl pepsin pancreatin and ox bile which are important for those who need support for protein and carbohydrate digestion and fat emulsification and absorption.* Hydrochloric acid secretion in the stomach does several positive things. It assists protein digestion by activating pepsinogen to pepsin it renders the stomach sterile against ingested pathogens it inhibits undesirable overgrowth in the small intestine and it encourages the flow of bile and pancreatic enzymes.* Hydrochloric acid also facilitates the absorption of a number of nutrients including folate vitamin B12 ascorbic acid beta-carotene iron and some forms of calcium magnesium and zinc.* Numerous studies have shown hydrochloric acid secretion in the stomach declines with advancing age. Overuse of antacids can also lead to low levels of hydrochloric acid in the stomach which can result in poor protein digestion. bile is what the gallbladder produces to digest fats. In my humble opinion, a low-fat diet and digestive aids are what could be of benefit to you. I wish you well ",

Ingredients 1 3/4 cups almond flour 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon pure stevia 1/4 teaspoon sea salt 6 refrigerated tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes 2 teaspoons finely grated orange zest 1/4 cup dried currants 1 large egg 4 to 5 tablespoons heavy cream or half-and-half Directions Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, stevia, and salt. Add the butter and work it into the flour mixture with your fingers or a pastry blender, until it resembles a coarse meal. Stir in zest and currants. Mix. In a small bowl, beat the egg and 4 tablespoons of cream. Add to the flour mixture and mix with your hands until the dough just comes together. (If the dough seems dry add the extra tablespoon of cream.) Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Pat the dough into a 6-inch round about 1-inch thick. Cut into 8 equal sized wedges. Space the scones evenly on the prepared baking sheet. Bake until golden brown, about 12 to 15 minutes. Serve warm. Note: For a richer, darker crust, brush the tops of the scones with heavy cream and sprinkle with sugar before baking.

It's up to us to ensure we are on the right trial for our needs. The suffering is inevitable since some of these medications are totally useless to some of us. Let's hope they soon figure out why MBC doesn't respond to Immunotherapy....and why stem cells get out of control in the first place.",

I hope you get another home run if you get on it again...currently, there are clinical trials that are testing a pill version of it. I hope it's approved ASAP. Before I forget....I wanted to share something with those of us that are losing our minds on cancer TXs and keep on forgetting things...Today, while talking to my sister on the phone and complaining about my poor memory, I happen to remember a supplement I had used successfully in the past, whenever I felt my lucidity and memory capacity declining. As we spoke, I popped one of the pills and voila' the effect was immediate. Like a strong wind clearing the cobwebs that were entangled in my brain and memory bank. The supplement is basically brain food and is called Phosphatidylserine (PS) Is a phospholipid that contains both amino acids and fatty acids. The omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA work synergistically with PS to provide the building blocks for healthy cell membranes. The human body can make phosphatidylserine, and it obtains most of what it requires from foods. In my case, however, it wasn't obtaining what I needed from food, so I took a 100mg pill and now I'm good to go! Yeahhh....Now I feel as if I'm strong enough to tackle any problems... https://draxe.com/phosphatidylserine/ ShetlandPony--that's a great idea...I will start that thread. All the recipes are already part of a cookbook I will be publishing after I finish writing something else I've been working on. But considering the needs of our community, I will have to create an additional paradigm. Recipes for our sisters that are losing weight and don't feel like eating. Get them out of the cycle and recycle of lactic acid in the blood that induces cachexia....I've done it for myself in the past, but now it's going to be quite a challenge because I won't be able to test how well the recipes work. I'm going to need volunteers.... Anita, that\u2019s a beautiful photo...you\u2019re so lucky to be able to travel that far. I\u2019m very happy for you....    ",

I would think that if it's only the reduction that makes a TX ineffective, then, an increase should reverse it as well. Scout, please let us know the results of your scan. We can all learn from each other's experiences when we decide to take less medication. Z's had already gotten amazing results from her reduced dose, but she also fasts for days before and after.

I can see the wisdom of doing a fast mimicking diet now from many perspectives, especially if we're not undernourished. After a period of indulgences with increasing amounts of fruits and breads which have made me regular again, I'm going to greatly increase my probiotics, my vegetables intake and include natural antifungals to curb the cravings for simple carbs.",

It specifically mentions: Carbohydrates in the form of processed white sugar, refined flour, high-fructose corn syrup and other foods with high-glycemic counts feed the yeast fungus so that it grows rapidly and disrupts the normal balance of good and bad flora, lowering immune response, and aren't these the same culprits that are also involved in other horrible diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer which they call type three diabetes? In view of some of these findings isn't logical why your modified starvation diet would work so well during TX? There's just too many coincidences. I will continue to investigate this angle because it empowers me while continuing my current standard TX that as we all know wil fail me at some point. Just today fresh off the presses: A new study funded by the American Cancer Society has found that colorectal cancer rates for Americans between 20 and 29 years old have been rising at a surprising rate. The cancer typically affects adults over the age of 50, however since the mid-1980s, rates have been dropping for older adults\u2014ages 50 and over\u2014but rising in younger populations, and rising fastest for people in their 20s. As the researchers explain, \"specific, unhealthy dietary elements, like high\u2013glycemic load carbohydrates, may trigger a cascade of detrimental health effects beyond caloric content.\" So there you have it...one could also call it the feed thecandida diet....",

I weigh 185pds and I think dosage has something to do with it. It could also due to the fact that the lower doses did not affect my TM in any way. Except for the liver toxicity and low platelets, I am not suffering from the typical SE associated with this drug. In fact I have more energy than ever, I think it might something to do with the ingestion of a few drops of Lugol solution in the morning, and the antifungal diet, conducted against my MO skepticism and disbelief.

My pain level has increased in the past two weeks, to the point were I'm limping and wobbling when I get up, but it gets increasingly better after I start walking. My lower back pain, shoots into my left hip joint and down my leg, weakening the whole shabang....YET, the results of the MRI of the whole spine couldn't be any better. No new lesions, no compression and no danger to the spinal cord...so WTF? What I am to think? I have added a lodacaine patch to the area, but it doesn't resolve the mystery Have you ever experienced anything similar? How did you resolve it? Thank you all in advance....",

Recent pet indicated progression in bones and it found evena lesion in the liver, but the MRI of the whole spine couldn't find any progression or structural problems that would warrant radiation.... The results of the liver biopsy should clear things up...",

After 2 teaspoons of bicarbonate and one umeboshi plum last night, I got up this morning without pain and the smallest wobbling due to fatigue....and what's even weirder....my lower back, where they performed khyphoplasty doesn't hurt as much, and that area was painful all the time! The fun part is going to be getting a reaction from my palliative care team on Monday, that was ready to prescribe gabapentin.",

As she heard all my woes, she nodded her head fixin on what to do next...so, Bless her heart, after finding all the sensitive spots that made me scream like a wet hen, she started sticking needles...she then stuck two that vibrated in the worst spots, turned on a heat lamp, and left the room. About an hour later, when she was done, I went downstairs and found myself walking down fifth ave galloping at a fast clip, instead of feeling worn slop out like before I got there. I walked free of all pains, head held high, just like before that damn letrozole broke my back!. Needless to say the khyphoplasty they did....didn't amount to a hill of beans....if I had my druthers, and if the creek don't rise, I reckon I would go see her every day....Heavens to Betsy....today I was happy as all get out....",

      "Content": "May 7, 2019 11:06AM - edited May 7, 2019 12:15PM by Frisky Grannax we have the same mutation ESR1 and I got 9 months out of it...it usually works for 4, but as you know, there are many women on this board that have been NED for YEAAAAARSSSSS, I wish the same to you and everyone else that's starting out on this wonderful tx. Yesterday, I woke up feeling great, but after running couple errands I had a relapse and barely got home on my own, exhausted and in pain all over again. So now I'm too scared to undergo Doxil on Friday. Do I need additional fatigue, aches and pains, when my right arm is limp and my left leg can't support me properly? Would it be wise to walk around in contagious hospital settings with a deeply compromised immune system while my heart is under attack by the tx? I don't think so! I hope MSK doesn't kick me out for canceling twice...but I don't know what else to do. I want to wait till I review the results of the liver biopsy and the potential new mutations, then propose a different approach: weaken the cancer by simultaneously blocking all the pathways it uses to feed with off label medications and natural supplements, before giving it the coup-de-gras with low-dose chemotherapy....I'm sure at this point in my proposal I will be kicked out of my doctor's office for heresy. Cure-ious et all....what do u think? Am I making any sense? Would the right to try, signed into law by Donald Trump, cover this contingency? Thank you for your patience in indulging my sincere although deeply terrified emotional state. ",

      "Content": "May 7, 2019 01:38PM - edited May 7, 2019 04:20PM by Frisky I got my answer! My MO called, listened, and told me he will be looking at clinical trials, but doesn't want to wait for genetic results due in 3 weeks! So that tells me, that basically, they don't have new therapies they can count on, that target the various genetic profiles. The state of the arts is stil afinitor and Faslodex. As I expected, he dismissed my suggestions to block the various pathways all at the same time with off label medications and supplements. Update....MO called me back two hours later with a fantastic offer that I couldn't refuse....a new generation ibrance clinical trial taking place all over the country that he's conducting at MSK, he thinks I qualify for\u2014f I can keep my blood sugar low....ibrance as a mono therapy....huge amounts of money at stake, as you can imagine. yesseereebob I answered....I know how to lower and keep my blood sugar under control...will reduce carbs intake, take my metformin and barberine pronto, add to it chromium, and gymnema sylvestre, and for good measure absorb some of that good old fashioned turkey tail mushroom extract! I'll have my BS levels below 100 by Friday! Oh yeahhhh....from sadness to hopeful all in a day's work....I ducked my encounter with Doxil for now... Thank goodness, my MO understood how scared I was and found a solution. He's truly a great guy, a mensch, a huck of kgnasu as they say in Poland....God Bless him! ",

They think I will be acceptable to Pfizer, the sponsor. Basically, it's a phase 1 where they are working out the dose and the efficacy. The goal? They want to prescribe ibrance as a mono therapy, in a similar fashion as Abemaciclib. The good news is: no diabetes, ( like I thought) no loss of heart, liver, kidneys or digestive function are expected. Just the usual: fatigue, diarrhea, no immune system, aches and pains, and possibly hair loss, business as usual.... I signed without reading because if I did, I probably would have chickened out...basically Doxil made me do it! Also, we don't need to wait till the end of the month because a month has already passed from my last capecitabine intake...I will have to give them two weeks of undivided attention, and then it's once @month. Two months later they will run tests and if I haven't responded it's over! As you can imagine, I begged my mo to consider my case for immunotherapy, as soon as they have a treatment that works. He said: my name is up there, but at this time nothing is working! Glad the weekend is coming...I'll be in the Berkshires with a bunch of fun people, cooking, eating, and laughing! Good wishes to all ",
