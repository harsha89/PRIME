My wife has been diagnosed with lobular carcinoma in her right breast and lcis in her left. There is on going debate as to if the lymph nodes are involved and she will be having a sentinal biopsy at time of surgery. She has elected to have a bilateral mastectomy (any thoughts on this) with immediate reconstruction. Because she is slender (she told the surgeon she will see him every week if he keeps saying things like that to boost her moral) the only course of action is for implants (I suppose for me the slight silver lining to all this is I get to choose her new breast size......!!). My wife is very much into naturopathic healing (she has been consulting one for the past few weeks in preparation for surgery on the 11th dec.) and was wondering if anyone had used honey and vitamin e for scar reduction. Any thoughts or experiences greatly appreciated. Dx 9/24/2007, ILC, 5cm, Stage IIIA, Grade 2, 1/8 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

My Naturopath Doctor has had me on an intake  of Co-Enzyme Q10, Resveratrol and Thymic Protein A. I was wondering if any of you ladies have experience of these treatments (or any others), if they aided in your chemo regime or perhaps suggestions which you found eased you through your chemo. Any thoughts? Thanks. Dx 9/24/2007, ILC, 5cm, Stage IIIA, Grade 2, 1/8 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Dec 2, 2007 11:35PM - edited Dec 2, 2007 11:40PM by vanchic Hi, Thanks for the info so far.....I do agree with you iodine re;- getting hold of all the records, we have done just that as we have found that we had to be a squeeky wheel to get what we want. Having had a suspicious mammogram my wife was given an ultrasound assisted biopsy appointment that was THREE MONTHS away!!! (The Canadian system is good and for everybody but sometimes painfully slow)....I phoned every hospital within 200Km and managed to get her an appointment within 4 days. Having had confirmation that cancer was present we were told that she would need an MRI....the appointment was another three months away (not enough scanners or trained staff) once again this was not acceptable to us and we arranged for a private scan (which could be done within 24 hours) I was phoning every clinic every day and by luck we managed to get a cancellation which was a few days hence (so we cancelled the private MRI and saved $2500). I have taken it upon myself to get all the results etc and we have personally delivered copies to the relevant clinics etc (for anyone from Canada reading this I cannot emphasis how important this is as it can take weeks for files to transferred from one specialist to another) to speed up the process......I did do an epinions search on Mederma and bio oil and the results were not too encouraging. That is one reason we wanted to explore honey  as I used it on quite a nasty burn on my face and it healed up amazingly with virtually no trace and research seems to indicate that it may have the same properties for scars and flesh wounds....I was just curious if any one had actually used it.........Oh, and vanchic is my wife's alias not mine....:) Best wishes for tomorrow and the future shrink.....",
