My dr said I have breast lymphedema and to see an occupational therapist. My dr also said he never saw this in someone that didn't have any lymph nodes removed. Saw the OT and she said it was not breast lymphedema. Has no idea what it is - never saw it. Going for breast MRI and ultrasound of arm. I asked the OT if it could be an indication of cancer, she wasn't sure. Did anyone experience this without lymph node removal? I appreciate any feedback. Log in to post a reply",

I had two lumpectomies (they left a clip in so I had to have the 2nd one). The OT I went to was a therapist at the Hospitol trained specifically for lymphedema. My oncologist and the therapist are baffled I have this and never had any nodes removed. I had radiation 10 years ago with no after effects. They did an ultrasound on my arm and said there are no blood clots but they don't know what is going on. I am going for an MRI in 2 days. I'll post the outcome hoping it can help someone else  Thank You again!",
