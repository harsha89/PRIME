      "Content": "AutismMamma wrote: Back in July I found a lumpy area on my left breast. I went to the dr. that day to get it checked out. About a week later, I went in for a mammogram and ultrasound. The results of that were negative, and the radiologist recommended an MRI. It took weeks to get the MRI approved by my insurance company and I had the MRI last week. The next morning, my dr. called me and said the results were back. My left breast has a suspicious mass, the shape and structure is what is typically seen in malignancy. Birads 5. I need a punch biopsy. Additionally there were areas of concern in my right breast as well, in the same location as the mass in my left breast. This was given a Birads 4, and the recommendation from the radiologist was an ultrasound, and if the ultrasound is negative, then they want an MRI-guided biopsy. I got these results on Friday. In speaking to my doctor, he was pretty candid with me. He's been my doctor for 15 years. He said that he's concerned, and he would be surprised if the biopsy was benign. He said the reason for the punch biopsy is because up to this point, everything is pointing to IBC, and the punch biopsy is the best way to see that. He said he wants me to get this done as quickly as possible because, while breast cancer is very treatable, IBC tends to be very aggressive. Since this has already been ongoing since July, I tend to agree. But, then, I did a little research on IBC and it seems like the symptoms progress much more rapidly than they have with me.. I literally woke up one day with a dimpling and lumpy skin change. But in the 2 months since then, it's not changed a whole lot. It's gotten bigger. This abnormal area has doubled in size. But I see stories where people wake up one morning and their entire breast is red or itchy or doubled in size. That's not my experience. I have had some itching in both breasts, near the nipple, off and on, and a small amount of discharge. But I feel like if it was IBC, I'd have more changes by now, no? I have an appointment on Wednesday at the breast center for a consult, and then they will schedule the biopsy and ultrasound. I guess I'm wondering what to expect from here. I will meet with a surgeon, and then they schedule the biopsy? How long does this take? How long until I get results? How long before I can just put this behind me and not think about it anymore?

      "Content": "AutismMamma wrote: I've posted a few messages that haven't gotten a response. I've found a lot of help though, through searching older posts. My journey started July 27 when I found a weird lump and puckering of my skin in my left breast. After mammogram and ultrasound didn't see anything, I was sent for an MRI. Throughout the process I've been informed that the \"lump\" I originally found is not a lump at all, but skin thickening. It's grown since I first found it. It's about 17cm long now And 5.5 cm wide. It was concerning on the MRI. BIRAD 5. Last week, I had a skin punch biopsy in two areas. I'll get the results next week. While she was doing the biopsy she also found another lump. A real one this time. In the right breast. Also found in the MRI was concerning areas in my right breast. The radiologist said that both breasts look completely different in the MRI, so much so that they believe one of them is \"bad\" and they just don't know which one. They wanted an ultrasound. I had that yesterday. While there, they didn't find anything so I'll have an MRI guided biopsy in a week or two. The surgeon that met with for the biopsy warned me that things don't look good, but they don't look bad either. She said with so much going on in there, they're just trying to find the cancer. She said there's a chance everything will come back benign, but she's not hopeful. I also have a strong family history of breast and ovarian cancer. She wanted me to think about a bilateral mastectomy and ovary removal just to be safe. I don't want to think about it. I'm alone with my thoughts a lot and I don't like that. But talking to the few people who know doesn't make me feel good either. My husband feels like he's always saying the wrong thing. I want to be hopeful. He wants on talk logistics. What will treatment look like? Can I work? I don't know yet, and I don't want to think about it yet. I just want to enjoy this last week in case it is the last one I have with out cancer.

      "Content": "AutismMamma wrote: Hey guys. I'm brand new and just needing a little support. I'm a mom of 2 boys. My oldest is 14 and has some mental health disorders. My youngest is 8 and has autism. I have a husband and work full time as a real estate agent. I take good care of them but myself not so much. I'm overweight. I smoke. My sister had bc 2 years ago. Chemo. Radiation. The other day I was getting out of the shower and noticed a puckered area on my left breast. I thought maybe it was from my bra or lines from the way I slept. That it would resolve itself. I felt my breast and noticed a rather large area that was hard. Not tender. I have rather large breasts (42 I) and so there's a lot of breast tissue. The area that was puckered felt different to me. I called my doctors office and they got me right in for an appointment. My doctor wasn't available so I saw a different doctor I've never met before. The doctor did an exam while I laid on the table. She said she didn't feel anything concerning. To follow up in 6 weeks. But when I sat up, she saw the puckering and felt around again. She said I needed to go in for an ultrasound and mammogram. The area is on the top of my breast. I told her that I'm a Realtor and often wear clothes without pockets so when I'm showing houses I keep my phone tucked in my bra at that spot. I asked if it could just be pressure from my phone. She said that was unlikely but that it's also a very bad idea to keep my phone there. She didn't ask a whole lot of questions. When I got home I did some Google research. Looking for symptoms. To tell myself I'm going to be fine. My left breast often gets itchy. And it's an itch that I can't seem to scratch. Like it's below the surface and scratching doesn't help. I haven't noticed actual discharge but my nipples are inverted and I have noticed over the past month or two a strange crust like crusty boogers almost in the little crater of my nipple. Again only on the left side. I thought maybe it was lotion or powder that had dried there. I'm nervous. I told my husband, and he's been quiet. I told him if my boobs were trying to kill me I would have no problem cutting them off. He said my boobs and my hair are his favorite things and I would have to choose. Because he doesn't want me to lose both. He was joking. Nervous like me. Just joking to keep it light. But I worry about those things. I haven't told the rest of my very large family because I just don't want to talk about it with them. I don't want to hear it will be okay. I don't want to have to update my entire family or answer their questions. I guess I don't know what I want. I was told another office would call to schedule my ultrasound and mammogram but I haven't heard from them yet. I don't know how long that takes. I don't know what I'm looking for. Just support I guess. I want to know other people have gone through this and it was okay. Waiting for this appointment is killing me. I want to yell at people. I get frustrated. That my mind is so consumed with this and they have no idea. But at the same time I still don't want to talk about it. Log in to post a reply",
