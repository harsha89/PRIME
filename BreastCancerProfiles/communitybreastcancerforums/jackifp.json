I teach, and yesterday was first meeting all summer, the whole district (maybe 200 total) meets for breakfast and intros of new staff. I walked in with cap on, saw a friend who knows, sat to talk, took a deep breath...and took off the cap. All was well, lots of hugs, none of those pity looks I want to slap. Kept it that way the rest of the day. Guess I'll do the same on Tuesday with the kids. It's high school, and I would at least have taken it off to show each class just to short-circuit the gossip mill. So thanks!",

It causes less bone pain because the dose is smaller, thus the bone marrow isn't pushed as hard to produce those emergency white blood cells. Neulasta is so named becomes it \"lasts\", and is a heavy, one-time dose so you don't have to go daily for shots. Apparently, Medicare will pay for people to give it to themselves if they live far too from a center to go daily; Blue Shield won't do that, cuz I tried. The Claritin is not an \"official\" drug to ease bone pain from Neulasta - may not be needed for neupogen, since the dose is smaller. When I asked my onc and nurses about Claritin, they shrugged and said they'd heard it, too, and that it couldn't hurt. Somewhere I read Stanford is gearing up a phase I trial for it, but I can't find any more info on that.",

Still, compared to some of you, I am counting my blessings and sending many more on to you with hopes se's will ease up. Bkj66: carnivores rarely get that there are ways of supporting blood counts without red meat. Beans, particularly black beans: 1 cup is 24g protein, 12g fiber ( think get rid of constipation) , high in iron. Lentils are excellent, too. The trick is whether or not your an accustomed bean eater; if you were raised a carnivore, the onc is probably correct that your body will do its best rebuilding eating muscle. Candice: big hug,girl.

Oh, yeah, down to one very old pigeon, who has someone avoided the hawks that think I had pigeons just for their hunting pleasure. And in my high school classroom are my snake, walkingsticks, toad, tarantula, turtle, and geckkos...DH does the plants, I do the animals. Mostly, I've been able to do it still, except for a few rough days here and there. We'll see how the poison affects me as I hit TCH#3 this Friday...oh, and I did have human children...just added them to the menagerie, is all. They grew up just fine. Hugs to all of us with the coming week's adventures in the poison chair!",
