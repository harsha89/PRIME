I think our concerns persist that if the FNA indicates non cancerous and atypical cells, why should the excision be any different. I understand performing a biopsy on the entire mass would produce an accurate finding, but seemingly, the FNA is unreliable in correlation with the findings of the excision biopsy.",

Before I proceed, I need to state that my wife recently discovered a lump in her breast and recently had a mammogram and an ultrasound performed. I think I'm much more worried than her.Â Initially, mammogram indicated calcifications and the ultrasound did not reveal anything. The doctor asked my wife to return for a biopsy. The pathologist revealed that the maamogram did not indicate anything, however, the ultrasound revealed the lump (2cm). A biopsy was administered and the doctor explained that the biopsy did not indicate that any cancerous cells. The doctor indicated that the results showed that the cells are \"atypical\" and recommended removing the lump for an additional biopsy. Initially we were relieved that no cancer cells were detected, but now were more worried that cancer cells can still be present. Can someone please explain the correlation between the needle biopsy that did not show cancerous cells and the excision of the lump for a biopsy? Is the needle biopsy accurate in determining cancerous cells? Log in to post a reply",
