I did not get pain from Neulasta and have had few side effects except bad mouth and throat sores the 3rd round of AC so overall my side effects not so bad BUT the bone pain ugggh it has been one week today and I still have mild pain....only 3 rounds to go I will make it I am definitely losing my eyebrows and lashes on Taxol.  Get my counts today to see if I need Neulasta.  MY white count was always good on AC but I had Neulasta.  If my counts are good no more Neulasta,,, Hang in there everyone.

I feel much better.  As many of you know I had started with 4-5 positive nodes so I was stage 3a and they went the neo-adjuvant route.  I also turned out to be BRCA2 positive.  SO - I had my bilateral mastectomy Aug 20 and coming along well.  My oopherectomy is scheduled for Oct 1. I still have that to go through as well as radiation to get through and then 6 month wait for reconstruction.  They were able to get great margins and leave my previous implants in so those will be swapped after my radiation and I am all healed and then I go on Arimidex. I am really happy with the order of everything and may decide to get the nipple tattoos after the recon down the road, but still trying to get through the rest of all of this. I have kept up with all of your posts despite the lack of posting myself!!!  I am amazed how much hair I have in 30 days NOT enough to go without a wig yet but certainly in 2 more months  Iwill be ready to go!!! Thanks for all of your spport.  I still had a 5cm tumor DESPITE  dose dense AC and Taxol....but they got it all and they had to take 29 nodes and there were 4-5 pos on my PET in March but only ONE left in the path after surgery so I am VERY hopeful.  Hope you are all doing well and on the road to feeling \"normal\" or our \"new normal\" You all have truly helped me make it through chemo MORE than you will ever know.  Sharing all the bodily struggles (constipation) sex....hair...side effects...courage to keep on keeping on with treatments and mostly the funny stories and shared incidents of \"chemo brain\"!!!!

I had my instant reaction to all of this, my age, my first mammogram caught this, and I am late stage, but I think there was a bit of shock involved not to mention I was so busy with my job and ALL the different DR appts...mammograms, ultrasounds, biopsy, mugascan, bloodwork, pet scan, oncologist, surgeon.....I really had no time to process feelings I was on auto-pilot I was EXTREMELY fortunate and was able to manage Neulasta pain with Norco, Nausea with Emend, Zofran, and Compazine.  I did have general flu feelings - all manageable.  Really the worst was bloody noses.  Chemo dries you out and I live in Northern Nevada (near Lake Tahoe) so it is dry but I got the Ayr saline gel that helps A LOT and some constipation due to the Norco and anti-nausea meds....even though I had boosted my fiber intake 50% but overall pretty good. I now find myself losing all of my hair.  I have the cut scheduled for Fri AM right aftger chemo 2 Thurs afternoon and it is barely holding on and I feel like such a big BABY that this is the hardest part.  Went wig shopping yesterda and they are not as natural as everyone tried to convince me. I work in sales and sell to CEOs and CFO's and I am just not able to do the scarf or hat thing.  I can work through this, my company is superior in accomadating me. I am only 41, not married, and really could not survive without working - economically.  All of it is so OK so far and funny tastes in mouth, exhaustion, pain, losing my breasts, all of it I can take but 6 months without hair nd trying to not hate the face that looks back at me is wrneching emotionally.  I really never realized i card about my hair that much and really took it for granted but now that is will be gone I am just overwhelmed with emotion.  Even once it is cut I am not sure I can leave the house or even look at myself in the mirror... I guess it is just a bad day and I am trying REALLY hard to shake it off Thanks for listening Lesley ",

I do not believe it is a misery loves company I think you just really do not know until you have walked a mile in the shoes.  Even at times I have had to check in with all of you even though I think I have the GREATEST team of docs & nurses treating me.  I love them and some of you may remember Mark works in oncology so this group of folks were my \"friends\" before they started treating me, but still none of them has personally experienced breast cancer. I have rambled long enough but I did want to share that my tumor was over 5cm when this started and I had several nodes involved.  Went in to see the Onc and have my counts checked yesterday and he said complete clinical response no palpable tumor or nodes.  Which was GREAT news.  On the other hand when I said, \"Does that mean I do not have to do the last 2 rounds....\"  Of course the answer was no! I had neoadjuvant chemo since I was 3A multiple nodes so I still have surgery the end of Aug and since I am positive for BRCA still going forward with the bilateral then I will have the oopherectomy then radiation so this whole process will not be over until say the holidays for me, but I cannot wait to have the surgeries and get the pathology back with no more cancer in my body and clear margins......

My concern for you is the drive.  They have great meds to help minimize nausea and pain but they do make you tired and for the pain you may get a mild narcotic (hydrocodone ) which helps when needed and Atavan but I cannot imagine having to drive that far with that in your system and I am an A personality too but chemo does fatigue you. If your job is mostly on the phone and email see if they can accomadate you is my suggestion.  For most people (like us) feeling as \"normal\" as possible is helpful.  I think being able to still work has really helped my mental process getting thru this.  Without my work my mind would spin out of control dwelling on cancer.  That is just me.  Also months away in sales can cause you too lose momentum with your pipeline and I would be obsessing on that.  Everyone is different I am 41 years old, my oncologist definitley felt in my case as long as I could work and my company accomadated me it was in my best interest from a mental health standpoint.

Judy, if you are doing the flaps where they do not move muscle I can personally tell you that I was able to lift my arms and wash my own hair faster than when I did the silicone implants and if any of you tried implants and they failed this has hurt far LESS than the two infected silicone implants I had. It is still surgery so you will be a little fuzzy and sore, but compared to the other things we have been through it is worth it if you are committed to having \"breasts\" again. I say it that way because I have a few breast cancer survivor friends who have opted for no reconstruction and I feel it is completely an individual choice. I am a peer navigator through the hospitals here and just because I want to put myself through all of this I am very aware it is not the choice for everyone and I completely respect each person's position of what is right for them. We all have the right to feel good in our own skin after what we have been through, whatever that translates to. Have a great day and weekend ladies! Lesley",

True you will not be running marathons. : ). I am about 9 weeks now and I would say for a good five weeks I have been back to almost normal life although I cannot quite get to 5 miles walking yet and I could do 2x that prior. Since they did not move muscle if you do a DEIP versus older style flaps involving muscle, you bounce back and are not in a ton of pain. The first week or two is not a picnic but I still even went to a restaurant I could get out of bed to eat with the family. You are just a bit more fatigued. I have 2 boys 12 & 9 and I still did laundry just only carried small handfuls at a time. The BIG key is just cook a bunch beforehand and freeze so you have meals that do not require a great deal of prep! I know it is SO frustrating when dates get changed. You get your ducks in a row in terms of help but mostly you get your mind prepped for medical \"stuff\". I love my DRs and I have a \"tentative\" date for my stage 2 of Dec 14 trying to get this all in before the end of the year, BUT insurance will not approve more than 30 days in advance, WHICH makes booking flights and hotel around the holidays SUPER tough....I am reluctant to book flights in case they change my date which they have done.....hang in their ladies it will work out in the end and this is the icing on the cake of this whole process.

It is a process, coming to terms with my new normal.  Like most of life there are trade-offs. Of course I certainly wish it had not taken cancer to get here, but when I am with other women my age with kids talking about squabbles in their families and lots of things that seem really important to them but really are the petty little things I do just sigh(to myself) with relief.  I would never minimize other people's challenges.  For example in the past if my sisters were squabbling or my sister was really mad at my mother for something like babysitting more for one sibling's children than anothers or just day to day \"stuff\" she could call me and get me all worked up, but now I just release all of it.  I do not take on other people's stress and problems.  I probably never should have anyway, but I have matured and grown.  THAT part of the new normal I embrace!!!! I hope the previous post did not come across negative.  I just had a friend tell me she hopes that she never has to walk the road I walked but if she ever does she hopes she can do it with half as much positive attitude, smiles, and grace as I did.  Made me cry.  I think I just feel more safe being vulnerable with all of you.  Any woman who has never had breast cancer that might someday, I try probably too hard to be a hero, because I would hate to think that any of my whining or moping would be what someone would remember if they were diagnosed down the road and they would be afraid because of me.  I guess I always wanted women, if they, or one of their friends were diagnosed, to be able to say that they knew this woman Lesley who was 40 with stage 3, traveled a tough road and she got through it, so can they.  Make sense????",

Check with your team for what you can use topically because there are mixed opinions on that too. I did radiation over 30 regular treatments and then a few boosts. The actual process is a breeze, you just lay there very still for a minute then you leave. Basically it takes more time to get undressed and dressed than the treatment. It is a pain, not physically, because it is usually 5 days a week so more inconvenient than anything. As the treatment progresses, after 20-25 treatments you do feel a bit tired or fatigued later in the day and I did take a nap the last couple weeks. My skin held up really well just getting a bit red like a bad sunburn at the end. I never blistered or turned black, I did get a little itchy.

Judy I am sure you will find a way back to some sort of \"normal\". You are always so positive so everyone deserves some downtime to recharge the batteries!! Amy, I would go bananas if I had to start menstrual cycles again after almost 4 years of none or even the illusion of them. While I did not like going through all of this at 40 I will say that has been one of the more pleasant aspects of breast cancer. I love not having cycles anymore and if I am going to have all my estrogen shut down and gain weight etc cycles would seem insult to injury. I hope they sort you out! Titan you make me laugh!! Happy anniversary. Helen I just wish I lived closer and could give you a real hug and take you out for Valentine's Day. You have had some unfair setbacks. I really hope after your surgery things improve a bit. We are over half way done with the pesky AIs have they told you if your hair will recover once you can stop taking them?? I know feeling lonely is tough, but I just always try to remember being with the wrong person is rough too. Don't give up hope though! Geri, sorry you are still slogging through the dental nightmare. I am soooo with you I bring clothes home and return waaaay more than I ever keep but I just try to focus on how great I feel saving money! Then I just focus on scarves shoes and purses. I can always use accessories they always fit and make me feel better. : ) Florbo - so happy your tumors are shrinking and chemo is working. As for feeling bad about aesthetics vs health/life....well you are talking to the wrong gal here! I have put myself through ridiculous numbers of surgeries, more than 6 to regain some semblance of \"normal\" and i have at least one more but taking a good 9 months off. I need to enjoy life and recover. 2 straight years of surgery every three months or so is too much. In between radiation and reconstruction I started to feel a bit normal but then all the surgery set me back. BUT that is not meant to talk you out of it - truth be told the closer I get to a semblance of the old me, the better I feel. Do what you need to for your own mental satisfaction. Saving your life is important but being able to feel ok in your skin and have quality of life after you save your life is important too. It is different for everyone but do not feel bad for wanting to regain whatever you feel you need. It is not vanity it is a way to cope and move forward when so much has been lost! Hugs!! Lesley",

Last Friday I had an MRI of brain and CT of the rest of my torso. We met with the oncologist and radiologist and it appears I am a walking miracle. Despite 5-6 areas lit up on my bone scan they tell me now I do not have bone mets. That was the worst week of my life. I am super grateful of course and false positives with spots on the skull and rib is unusual. The look on their faces was crazy. I don't think too many people with stage 3 breast cancer and 5-6 spots lit up end up without Mets. So sorry to worry you ladies unnecessarily. I will try hard to keep checking in Helen!!! Lesley ",

I was 41 when diagnosed and my first chemo threw me in immediate menopause. I was BRCA2+ so I had to have ovaries removed so we decided to put me on Arimidex not Tamoxifen. Well I had a HORRIFIC time with it. Really bad joint pain, hot flashes, bad hair and I gave it 6 months but I literally could hardly walk across the room in the morning or after a 3 hour car ride. It did get a little better when I started moving. BUT I felt like an 80 year old arthritic woman. It WAS a quality of life thing for me. I accidentally forgot it on a three week trip - really, honestly, an accident and I am very organized almost to an OCD level : (. Anyway I felt great pretty quick so I was going to just STOP. After a very sad heart to heart with the oncologist and statistics that were pretty astonishing, I decided the numbers were too big to ignore so we switched me to Femara. That was just about 2 years ago. I don't LOVE Femara, but it has not been nearly as bad. I had a friend who could not tolerate Arimidex either and Aromosin (sp?) was more tolerable for her as well but she still had significant hair thinning with it. My hair cane in pretty thick when it came back and is drier than it use to be and thinner on Femara but not as bad as Arimidex. Sooooo if you have not tried any of the other AIs you might see if you can change.....you never know : ). I am now 6 weeks post SGAP and I am so happy Helen and Judy, so if you really want to do it I think you will be happy too. I have my stage 2 set for Dec 14. I so look forward to stage 2 & 3 and cannot wait to get nipple tattoos after 2 years with various \"barbie doll\" boobs : ). It will be the icing on rhe cake. This 2 years of chasing successful reconstruction and the clinical trial I did left me in breast cancer land more than I wanted, it has been a pain so I really look forward to completing this and really getting back to \"normal\" life. Funny the one year wait after radiation felt more \"normal\" than the last 18 months EXCEPT I was BALD which is NOT normal : / Now I have hair but since Nov of 2010 I had expander put in on radiated side, two failed exchange surgeries, emergency removal, now SGAP, and Dec 14 stage 2. So that is 6 surgeries in 24 months so I have averaged 1 every 4 months. Hard to ever get back in shape before I got knocked down again. 2013 will be my year : ) I do REALLY love my new chest so much warmer and natural feeling than those implants. I had implants for vanity before breast cancer and I liked them, they were not cold because I had my own breast tissue over the top. That was not my experience post BMX. Helen and Judy, I recommend the DIEP thread and even the one called NOLA in Sept even though you are not going to NOLA others post and there is so much great advice, experience, and info. I would have been lost without rhose gals! Sorry this is so long and hope everyone has a terrific week! Hugs Lesley",

Compression garments and drains are a nuisance and in the Mexico heat being covered from my knees to my neck isn't so terrific when it is 82 degrees Fahrenheit and humid. On antibiotics so can't be in the sun and well sand is sand, it gets everywhere so when you have huge fresh incisions going where there is sand is not so great. I am 11 days post-op so not super mobile either, but, I know in a few months I will be super happy. If you had all seen the massive hole in my chest after the second failure and infection, I lost so much tissue it was not a standard mastectomy scar, so for me this was necessary. If I had to see that every day getting out of the shower, I just could not take it. Nice flat scars I could have managed but what I had was pretty garish and just would not have been ok for me psychologically. Thanks for asking!! I hope you all feel better whether your challenges are physical or emotional. Happy birthday Chevlev!!! If any of you want to connect with me on Facebook, because I am on there a lot : ). I am Lesley Tobin Nygaard! 2013 will be our year ladies!! For those of you considering reconstruction I hope my griping about post op pain does not discourage you. It is still TOTALLY worth it. It is typical post op pain from what I have had done. I have been lucky and not had any complications, failures, etc. The hardest part is the psychological part I just want to not feel like a \"patient\". Be normal even if it is definitely not the old normal. I kissed that goodbye long ago. I am super grateful to be alive EVERY day, but I admit with all the surgeries and the Femara when I sometimes see people at an event or wedding just dancing and having fun I have a brief moment where I feel sad and angry and even a bit of envy for what I lost. It has been so long now I don't even remember what just waking up and not feeling like I am 80 when I JUST turned 45 30 days ago today feels like : (. This too shall pass! Have a great week ladies!

I know or at least I have heard some ladies have luck with implants after rads, but I do not personally know of any, only failures, contractors, pain, etc. I would like to hear from someone who has had 30+ rad sessions and implant success over 7 years. If there are not many or any I wish women would not choose this at all. It \"seems\" an easier option but I lost so much time and had 4 surgeries I could have avoided... Have a great week ladies!

Helen, well as we all know too well there is nothing to say but darn it.  I really wish you the best of luck at getting moved up the list for a quicker appointment.  You have had some rough times and it is not fair. All this sure changed my life.  Some people get cancer and if they were cautious prior to diagnosis are inspired to get out and live more.  In my case I was pretty adventurous, whitewater kayaking and rafting, rock and ice climbing, mountaineering, and racing 40ft sailboats.  NOW I went the other direction.  I have been laid up in one way or another for the past three years that I am MORE cautious.  I don't want to get hurt and be laid up...crazy huh.  Since I was BRCA positive I did have the double oopherectomy too and then the crazy reconstruction odyssey so 9 surgeries since Aug 2009.  I guess what I am trying to say is I wish I could literally fly in and hug anyone having any challenges health wise.  Cancer forever changes us and takes pieces of us away.  It does not just end when chemo ends and we all have varying reactions to Tamoxifen, Arimidex, Herceptin, whatever longer term therapies we may need to keep the beast at bay. Not being negative, our lives can go on and we can reclaim quite a bit of our old self, but it really is never the same at a level that no one who has not been through it can understand, we probably never anticipated it ourselves.  The term new normal is true but one I still on certain days find difficult to accept, but certainly better than the alternative!!! Hope you all have a terrific week!!!",

It is forever life changing but I just try really hard to focus on the fact that everyone dies someday and in a way cancer can be a gift (granted not a good one!). BUT we get a chance to live with more intention, our frailty is more tangible, say what we need today to those we love. We all \"know\" we will die but it IS just more real to us. Most people do not get that chance. Of course I certainly have my angry days where I feel none of this - especially right after coming out of a fitting room!!! : )",

As a result I had a good deal of time post op and decided to go back and read each and every post from the last 18 months or so. I was never a big poster, but a terrific lurker. Suffice to say it was a very emotional Sunday for me because I learned that in my absence Lena has left this earth. While I never want anyone to suffer,I have to confess that her postings got me thru many a rough moment. I was diagnosed when I just turned 41 and thought I was hitting my sexual prime and finally had a partner to enjoy that with after an 11 year empty marriage. Of course my treatment threw me in immediate menopause and I lost both breasts including nipples due to my BRCA status. I had a very high sex drive and my breasts were a significant part of my sex life. I was not one of the lucky ones that other places took over. I am still with my great partner, but the weight gain, body image, constant surgeries ( my choice) to capture some of what I once was and ZERO hormones - I have had ZERO sex drive for the last few years. I frankly never think about it anymore and when it comes up I mourn and wish for my old sexual self. Lena's postings were my ray of sun in my dull sex world. 50 Shades of Grey has nothing on her in my eyes!!! There have been many highlights in my life these past few years and I promise to share those in a follow up posting!!! It has not been all surgery and disappointment. You were all so important to me during a really major point in my life!!!! Today, Aug 20 is the 3 yr anniversary of my double mastectomy. That is when they considered me cancer free. I had neo-adjuvant Chemo and my port was put in in April and my first infusion was late April and I actually posted if I should join the May group....I have stopped by and read here and there but not for over a year.... I will always have enormous gratitude that I was part of you wonderful ladies. The regulars were so great and I know several of us lurked more than posted and the fact you have all kept together and kept in touch is a testament to what you have done for those of us that just wanted to \"read\". I feel a bit guilty I did not pipe in more because I am pretty witty and insightful too. I do wish I had been there a few times for Lena this past winter. Thank you for 3 years of laughs, tears, and u conditional support. This is the only place I have really ever been able to come where someone really GETS IT! Hugs and much love to all of you! Lesley",

I ended an 11 year marriage about 1-2 years before my diagnosis. My tumor was pretty large so I am certain I probably already had cancer while married. No family history so no mammogram before 40. As for regular self-exams....well it is easy to be distracted when you are not in a healthy, happy relationship. I have always said it really is better to be alone than be in a relation ship and be lonely. This is especially true for us women who are natural caretakers. I am sure you have often put your choices and needs/wants on the back burner. So the silver lining is you no longer have to do this AND sometimes when you are just living your life and pursuing your dreams things just happen. I will be thinking of you as you start this new chapter. It may be rough at first, but remember you are a tough cookie!!!!! Have a great weekend! Lesley",

My friends husband said I looked the happiest he had seen me in years and that was at 5AM with hip drains and a compression girdle, so THAT says something. : ) The 5AM is because they have a big hot air balloon event here every year and they live right by the launch area and have a breakfast party every year. I had never gone but i dragged the whole family on a Saturday AM. We were all happy we went it is really pretty to see the balloons all lit up in the darkness. They scheduled my stage 2 for Dec 14 and I will have hip drains again but they say only a week or two. We are trying to get away for Thanksgiving without the kids and before my next surgery to reconnect. It has been a long 3 years with too many surgeries etc for me so I will be healed good from stage 1 and I think it is just what we need.

I am still in the middle of it and what I affectionately refer to as my personal \"Great Race for New Boobs\" is still in full swing. Before my bone scan a few weeks ago (I was on a clinical trial with Zometa so at the end of the trial you get the scan). I worried that I put myself thru all this surgery and may have missed time I could have enjoyed and not constantly recovering and running to Dr appts. I know I am cancer free courtesy of the CT with contrast to get my Aug SGAP and the bone scan so I am pretty confident I will have a good 5-10 years minimum. Hopefully many more ; ). I have had 3 surgeries already this year with a Stage 2 4th surgery still to come Dec 14 for my SGAP. This is a bit long, but I think my New Orleans (NOLA) SGAP DIEP group may think I am crazy because we had planned to go to Cancun or Cabo for a week at Christmas. I am going to ask your opinions. Stage 2 is mostly cleaning up from Stage 1 a lot of lipo and nipple reconstruction. Stage 1 was the big flap surgery and was 12 hours. The next surgery is only 4-6 hrs My surgery is Dec 14 and we wanted to leave Dec 22. I am on the West coast so the trip to Cabo 8 days post op is shorter than the trip from NOLA back home, does that change anything? We were planning on going for Christmas, we have no family out here, we would be staying in a very nice resort I will probably have to do less there than at home for Christmas and I have a 13 and 9 year old sons and strapping husband so I will not be lifting any bags. I hate to disappoint the kids... They did not get the summer trip I promised them because I had to have emergency surgery to get the infected implant out, we could not get the infection under control. I know it is crazy to think about, but on the other hand I am certain if I am home I will be cooking, loading the dishwasher, decorating, etc etc whereas if we go, no cooking, no clean up, no laundry...does that change things?

Cancer sure gave us all different perspectives than we had before. I am so thinking of Amy this AM. I hope her Dr feels things look good and can provide her some peace of mind. I know nothing is certain without a pathology report, but we all know only too well how rough the waiting can be. Geri Helen Titan Judy thanks for keeping me in the loop on all that you are thinking and feeling! You are all so wonderful in your comments. Judy you have a beautiful heart. Geri I am so glad YOUR heart is responding to your meeds and your comment about the Onc made me laugh out loud! So sorry for all tour side effects Helen. I think I told you I switched from Arimidex to Femara but it has been a solid 3 years since I can remember what it feels like to get out of bed and just feel normal or perhaps NOTHING, but it never happens.... My first 50 or so steps are excruciating every morning. I was 41 at diagnosis and 44 now and I swear I feel 80. After the day progresses and I am moving it gets better but the joint/foot pain is rough. Some days I think I will fall but thankfully I don't. It is hard to forget I agree Helen. So while I \"try\" not to think of statistics I understand what you say Titan. My breastfriend - local woman I became friends with in \"real\" life I met on here, is triple negative. She was three rounds of chemo ahead of me and older than me, BUT she not only acted as a big sister she took a lot of the fear of the unknown out of it for me. We are still friends and I will be in debt to her forever. Sorry I digress I guess what I can say from being close to someone is that while I understand the additional therapy and the comfort that may seem to provide, there are still many that die from this disease any way. I have seen vegetarians marathon runners supposed healthiest of healthy folks lose the battle while a smoker survives. I am not suggesting smoking : ). I have seen women diagnosed stage 1 er/pr + her 2 - get fast recurrence and pass and I have seen women here live with stage 4 for a decade. What I have decided is it is a crap shoot and Bo one REALLY knows. So I do know the triple neg stats and I admit I would not trade places, but the truth is my triple neg friend who is 15 years older than me definitely has had a better quality of life the last 2 years and may even out live me, at which point you might ask yourself was that extra therapy worth it? If that is how it turns out I would suggest it wasn't. You just never know so we all have to make rhe best choice we can for us. I know a fee women who stopped taking the AIs or Tamox. I did for a month and I felt GREAT dare I say normal. But being BRCA2 positive like Helen and stage 3 the Onc put some numbers on the table that were too staggering to ignore. Same deal as all this recon I put myself thru. I just hope I get 10 more years. Well ok I would like to make it to 65 to spend SOME of the 401(k) I saved hee hee but honestly I have 3 more years of Femara and then I hope I have a good 5 years of nothing medical.... I decided to go on the trip. I would not have for stage 1 with the flaps and all, but at this point I will have had flaps for 4 months they are part of me for life and I LOVE them. I don't even consider them foobs granted no ducts or lobes but not fake either....they are 100% my tissue and that is not fake : ). Stage 2 is lipp lipo lipo and nipples so worst case one of the nipples won't hold butb3 months ago I had none and no hope of ever having any due to all RAD complications. Sorry this is long and hope I did not offend anyone. We all have lovely aftermath of cancer of varying degrees. I have gained 25 lbs I cannot seem to lose then FINALLY did last year only to have a complication and 3 more surgeries and gain it all back. I have a closet full of beautiful classic clothes that don't fit and I go between tearing it all out crying and never leaving the house to leaving it and hoping....I recently purged a lot because I work from home and just dont need as much, but some I just can't part with...

Thanks for the kind words Judy.  I think there was a short one year after radiation and before my reconstruction odyssey I felt it a lot less but of course was NOT enjoying my new shape.  Then the summer of 2011 I got my weight back to where it was BC (before cancer) so I could fit in my old clothes, I had hair I was feeling pretty darn good about things and THEN whammo the impants they were a rejecting so the 5 surgeries in 15 months has taken it out of me  :(  Two were big, 12 hrs and the last 7 hrs so if you have surgery every 3 months and it takes 6-12 weeks minimum to start to feel normal I have not been normal for 15 months.  Right when I would start to feel normal I go under the knife again......... Then a few days ago someone from the DIEP/GAP group just finished her stage 2 about 2 months ago just found out she is stage 4......she was diagnosed stage 1, then had a recurrence or second in the other breast.  Just scary because you have CT scans etc to do flaps so she was fine.  I was stage 3 then my stupid brain starts WHIRLING and I would be so sad if I spent the last two years chasing breasts and not enjoying life and then end up with metastatic disease.  Sorry not trying to bum anyone out just venting frustration. I very rarely think of recurrence just once a year on my \"cancerversary\".  Then when I had all this surgery and the CT was ckear AND my clinical trial was over and I had a bone scan I knew I was in the clear 3 years. Onward and upward it does not good to wallow in stress and negativity I do believe that contributes to poor health. Hugs Lesley",

All at the ripe old age of 41. I had JUST done a pretty rigorous 10+ mile snowshoe in the Sierras, I did not feel the least bit sick and things in my life just seemed to be falling in place after leaving a 12 year loveless marriage then BAM my life changes drastically. I did all of that treatment had 2 attempts at reconstruction infect and fail and just tried a third time not even 3 weeks ago. I was so worried because clearly my odds are worse than 2b. I started recently, as I approached my 3 yr anniversary, of worrying what if I spent the last 3 years of my possible 5 I have left attempting reconstruction and going from surgery to surgery....I mean if you are constantly having surgery, 8 in the last 3 years, it is hard to ever get back to \"normal\" life. One of the \"gifts\" of all this surgery is I got a CT scan so I know I am clear there. I also volunteered for a clinical trial and had to have A bone scan TODAY and chewed my nails all day worried about bone mets but I JUST found out I am clear. ALL clear. No cancer anywhere. So PLEASE, I know it is hard and the unknown really IS the worst. Take a deep breath, get a puppy, and focus on living, this is NOT a death sentence. It does get easier when you know what you are dealing with and what your action plan is. Typically chemotherapy is anywhere from 2-4 months depending on what type. There will be a decision at some point to do neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy before surgery) or surgery/mastectomy then chemotherapy. They usually give you 3-4 weeks in between so you have strength to tackle each step. Radiation can be 4-6 weeks but actually radiation IF you need it takes it out of you because it is 5 days a week where chemotherapy is once every 2 or 3 weeks depending on your regimen. I am here if you want to chat at all. Still recovering from my surgery so pretty much layg around reading books and watching movies so if you want to chat on the phone just send me a message! I remember being where you are, but attitude is everything. I faced my possible mortality, I had to, but I also refused to accept the fact that cancer was going to be the way I was going to leave this earth. You have to feel what you have to feel but remember for e ery statistic that takes a life there are many statistics of survivors and you have JUST as much chance of being that statistic as the other. : ) Lesley",

I had 8 dose dense (every two week infusions) of ACT so the first 4 doses were the Adriamyacin (red devil) and Cytoxan. Everyone said the red stuff was killer and I certainly did not like it and got my horrible mouth sores hence the mouth rinse I mentioned. But to s of people said the Paclitaxol /taxol (I know I spelled that wrong) which was the second 4 rounds was suppose to be so much better. So I was all excited when the AC was over. I can tell you I was pretty tired and I'll and did not find the taxol easier so I was disappointed. My point in sharing is you just never know! The effects being cumulative they speak about are mostly fatigue and maybe the lovely constipation. But amazingly once you are through it starts to improve pretty quick. Nihahi maybe you did not get to enjoy the constipation we did : ). I think that is mostly due to all the newer anti nausea meds so you probably felt way more nausea than us ! I just had stage 1 of an SGAP Aug 14 and stage 2 Dec 14 where they did a number on my abdomen.

Mostly I just wanted to pipe in that I was diagnosed right when I turned 41 and no one in my family ever had breast cancer or any cancer to speak of. As everyone has said the waiting is the hardest part, it is true, even harder than treatment because there is so much anxiety in the unknown. That is also why breast cancer.org is so awesome you can chat with others who have traveled before you. Everyone is different but at least hearing from a loving human who has been there done that really eases that fear. In any case I had to have a full node dissection. I had a few positive nodes but my tumor was large AND I ended up having BRCA2. I had a double mastectomy and full node dissection. I have had a couple major injuries despite my best efforts to baby my potential lymphadema arm. I have been super lucky I have no lymphadema and o know someone who just nicked her hand gardening and she has it. We are the same age same basic diagnosis and treatment...so it is anyone's guess and I truly have gotten to a place where I just don't fret over things I literally cannot control- took time to get here and likely one of cancer's \"gifts\" if you will. In any case despite the full node dissection and large tumor I was still only stage 3 I will not even tell you not to worry until you know your srage because it is next to impossible not to. The only other thing I can say is treatments and targeted therapies improve every year so even if the worst occurs the longer you get the better a chance for a cure. There are people with bone and/or brain meta that love 10 years with good quality of life so you will have options and support if it comes ro that BUT it may not! As for the hair all I can do there is offer hugs and support that was the hardest part for me. It is tough but yoh can get through it. The up side is you don't haveto shave for a while, and you can get ready fast. : ). It does actually grow back although I despised when people said that to me, especially people who did not have cancer or alopecia. I give the alopecia gals serious credit, theirs never does grow back..... Happy to answer any questions and thinking positive thoughts for you! Lesley",

In other words, I feel sympathy for people who have options...if you are on the border should you do chemo or rads or should you pass. It would be so hard to know what is right if you have a choice so in some ways I was lucky, stage 3 left no options, hit it with all you got. As I said I am 3 years ot of stage 3 totally clear scan last Fri I was grade 3 and had 4-5 positive nodes before chemo. I expect to live another 10, 20 years, hopefully long enough to blow through my 401(k). I am only 44 : ) Thinking of you and you have hope! Treatments evolve everyday. I hope every day they make progress and if I hit stage 4 in 10 years maybe by then there will be a cure or new targeted therapies that buy me time and quality of life. It is true that we are all dying every day but once you have cancer you are just much more are of it. That sort of stinks but on the other side of the coin you can choose to live with much greater conscious intent! Big hugs Lesley",

These tests are necessary so you know where you stand. Good news or bad news at least you can make informed decisions. Once you have cancer it is not uncommon to assume every headache is brain mets or every persistent aching joint is bone mets - that is a total normal thought process. You are NOT a goner at stage 3. I understand you are not a fighter, and no one likes to be poked and prodded like a lab rat, trust us we know this feeling well. What I do think is that if you don't find out what you are up against then you might be agonizing for nothing. Meaning stressing yourself uneccessarily which is not healthy. For the most part cancer is not super symptomatic and painful so you may have another treatable and not life threatening ailment but you need the tests to know. I wish I was closer and could go with and hold your hand. Can you contact your Dr and see if they have peer navigators who can go with you? I am in no way trying to minimize your agony over all of this so I hope it does not come across that way. What I do think is you have life left in you and it seeps out the cracks when you are not feeling overwhelmed. : ). I do not know you well, but what I think I can tell is you would be really disappointed if you let fear prevent you from getting answers and don't get the tests only to find months down the line you had something that was very treatable had you bit the bullet and faced your fear. Use your EMLA and get the bone scan tomorrow. One day at a time one foot in front of the other. There are plenty of women on the Stage IV thread that do not choose treatment/fight based on their stage etc and you will get support no matter what you decide so I am not telling you to be a fighter but you should at least know what you are up against so you can make an informed choice. Sending you as much strength and courage as I can through the Internet to get through these tests. I know you are scared, I do think life has a way of presenting wake up calls that force us to face fears and we find ourselves stronger than we ever thought when we get to the other side! Lesley",

      "Content": "Sep 7, 2012 09:15AM - edited Sep 7, 2012 09:16AM by Lesleyanne67 In my early years as a nurse on the IV team, one of our responsibilities was to start all the pre-op IV\u2019s using 18g catheters. Because of the large gauge size catheters we were inserting, we would use buffered Lidocaine 1% to numb the site prior to IV insertion. If the patient is allergic to Lidocaine, we would use bacteriostatic 0.9% Sodium Chloride (normal saline) instead. When we used bacteriostatic normal saline to numb the site prior to insertion, patients appeared to have the same pain less  level as those whom we have used Lidocaine on. I always wondered if it really worked as patients did not complain of pain during the insertion at all. Then, I was told that the skin stretching with the wheal created by the intradermal injection of bacteriostatic normal saline decreased the skin surface causing less pain upon insertion. Now, there are recent articles (see suggested articles below) stating benzyl alcohol, the preservative in bacteriostatic normal saline serves as the local anesthetic, numbing the site. At that time, it was not routine to use intradermal anesthetic prior to IV insertion, it was reserved for insertion of large gauge catheters. Today, in an effort to decrease pain and promote patient\u2019s comfort during painful invasive procedures such as IV insertion, most hospitals and healthcare facilities routinely use intradermal anesthetics prior to IV insertion. Nurses vary in their opinions and beliefs on the use of intradermal injections prior to IV insertions.  Even with evidence, some nurses don\u2019t routinely offer to their patients or use intradermal anesthestic.  Aside from intradermal injections, there are several methods available to achieve this purpose, including topical creams, dermal patches and iontophresis.",

It is sort of an individual thing they are getting better but A's to why some develop it and some do not they are actually really not sure. I am just 3 years out. I do not have LE. BUT here is what has happened to that arm in the last 3 years. One of my kitties got his rear leg stuck in a chair back jumping off the kitchen counter and was hanging upside down WAILlING. Could not free himself and j went to his aid without even thinking. If I had a picture of my shredded arm. Poor guy was do freaked it was all jaws and claws even though I was trying to help, which I did. In any case major scratches and bites that broke skin. I got antibiotics. I did not get LE About 6 months later we are on the golf course and my then 11 year old step son hit his golf ball basically sideways and backwards full force and the ball hit ME of course in my possible LE arm. Huge golf ball size hematoma Next I havexa basal cell on my arm and you guessed if RIGHT arm it had to be excised and stitched... So EVERY one of my major arm related incidents in the last year, A's fate would have it, was on my potential LE side. I had a friend going thru chemo sane as me basically same age, same chemo, rads, stage, node involvement. We met going thru treatment. She does get a scratch gardening and she has LE....by all accounts her trauma to her limb, less than mine So hoping for 2 things with this story. One I hope my bad luck inspires you to realize you may not get LE AND based on the other gal's story help you realize that it is somewhat out of your hand so why fret over what you have zero control over. I know if is stupid, but I like the simple saying, \"it is what it is!\" Lesley",

I was diagnosed 3 years ago, stage lllA. You can see in my tagline. I have 2 step kids (boys) that live more with me more than with their mom. They are now 12 & 9. They were 6 & 9 when I was diagnosed. Their mom remarried and had a daughter with her new husband and they have sort of moved on with their new family and left the boys behind. VERY sad. She never takes them on her vacations and we take them on all of ours. Although this Thanksgiving we are going to go without them. I think we need that since the last three years have been so focused on my treatments and surgeries : ( I wish I had more I could say to you. I know you feel a bond to the first people that reach out to you on BCO because you are so fragile in the beginning. What I do know is there is nothing I can say, other than I am sorry, and send cyber hugs. You are always welcome on this thread. I will echo what some other people have mentioned about looking into the stage lV group if you have not done so. Only because even though I had late stage cancer with positive nodes, I was still not metastatic and there are feelings and considerations involved with that diagnosis that I think are hard to address unless you are in the same \"club\". I can be sympathetic and listen and feel awful for you but there are many ( unfortunately) younger women with young kids in that group and their support and understanding could be invaluable. Right now my main wish for you is no pain, good response to your current drugs, and the strength to get through those days that you want to cry and scream at the top of your lungs about how unfair this all is - which you should totally allow yourself if you have those days. I know other people have mentioned but there have been many stage lV gals who have managed to keep a lid on things for 10-15 years and see their children graduate and/or marry. I hope this for you. Therapies change all the time so the goal right now is to hang on until the next drug comes along and hopefully get a good response with minimal side effects. This can be done and still have a good quality of life. Remember you did not choose this or cause this so if at some point you can no longer endure treatments you did the best you could and you did not let anybody down! Be gentle with yourself!

      "Content": "Sep 29, 2012 04:24PM - edited Sep 29, 2012 04:30PM by Lesleyanne67 I saved my braid albeit a thin braid I did not cut until almost 2nd chemo and I was thinning but I dod not cut until it started coming out. Then this is crazy if you knew me I am pretty conservative, I had it cut sort of almost buzz longer in front. BLEACHED platinum and some pink put in the front. It didn't even last a week, but I thought when will I ever have a chance at 41 to be that crazy again - never I am totally with bear cub on the cold caps. I don't want to offend anyone who uses/used them, but one of the places breast cancer can metastasize is the brain. My oncologist will not allow them, PERIOD. Cancer is a rapidly dividing cellular structure as is hair, nails, and the cells inside the mouth. This is why chemo impacts these areas heavily, it is fundamentally created to impact rapidly dividing cells. I am not a Dr or and expert, but I listened to the information and much as I DESPISED being bald, I want to be alive and not have to repeat chemo so I wanted to hit it with everything I had, none of those nasty little bugger cells hiding any where in me I understand the feelings too well. I go nasty at one point with all the people telling me not to make \"too big a deal about the hair, it will grow back, yadda yadda...\". Well I understand their point that the chemo will save my life and losing hair is a temporary by-product of that life-saving treatment, I still have to look at myself ithe mirror every day. I was heartbreaking, I will not lie. There were months I wanted to cover all my mirrors, I just did not look like me. Bloated in the face or puffy is a nicer word, from the steroids, and bald. I feel GREAT 3 years out and cancer free and look nothing like that beast that looked back at me in the mirror. It is harder to recall myself that way, the more time that passes the less I can recall it vividly. : ) BUT I digress, this may tarnish the heroic image you all have about me but i was MILLISECONDS from carrying a razor shaver every where (WITH NO GUARD ON!!!) I went and just buzzing a huge stripe through EVERY person's head who said it was just hair and it would grow back....REALLY, then they should not be at all upset about the 2-3 inch strip of missing hair on their head, should they, I mean they are not even totally bald, and it WILL grow back, they said so themselves.... Sheesh the whole hair thing just came up again because I had bi-lateral SGAP surgery 6 weeks ago and soooo happy would do it again in a heartbeat, but when I went to the hairdresser last week we found what I consider a large bald patch maybe 2 inches wide and 4-5 inches long and even a full 5 weeks after surgery not even stubble....I guess this can happen after a 12 hour surgery even if they move your head in surgery etc : (. Easy to hide and in many cases it eventually comes back but in some cases NEVER...WHAT??? Sorry for the long rambling rant. : ) Hope you are all well and I read all the time I just don't post all the time, but I am keeping up with all of you and pipe in when appropriate. Benny, you will be changed from breast cancer, but as I told you before maybe an even better version of yourself. I agree that you could be tired from all the emotional trauma and stress. You just have to give yourself time. You may not have the physical strength to do all you want to do right now, but you will get back to those things in time. I am in Sales and type A, anally, obsessively organized and di it all type person, so I did have to learn to slow down. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Many women return to everything they did before, assuming they still enjoy it and consider it a priority and some get in even better shape and are STRONGER because they value the life they fought for even more. It is unfortunate timing that you just got a horse. My family has had many horses. My sister still has an American Saddlebred and does dressage, not my thing, but more power to her!! In any case I think everything happens for reasons. This horse may be exactly the friend you need at the pace you are today and it is my guess you will forge an amazing bond even if it is not the way you would approach things if you did not have this temporary setback. (not minimizing your diagnosis, you just cannot do what you would ordinarily do right now and it may have hidden benefits.) I have gone down roads, literally, that I did not want to be on due to traffic, detours, who knows and then I find a cute place to eat or shop, that had I gotten to go the way I really wanted I would have missed the experience of. My favorite cat passed during my chemo. She was 17 and I moved West from Chicago 6 years ago. She was my only family from Chicago with me and i wanted her to make it through my whole cancer journey. She just could not do it. I have a cute pic of her cuddled in bed with me on a \"bad\" day bald but I had a cap on. I cherish it. I would be devastated when ever I lost her but she was my little piece of home and family, not to mention the chemo, cancer, et al made me more emotional. My point in telling you this (my step kids) talked me in to 4 yes FOUR kittens, shelters here were over run, and I have the greatest bond with those kitties. The one male used to come and lick my bald head. Long story and suffice it to say I did not necessarily enjoy the sandpaper tongue on my sensative scalp, but I know it was his way of trying to care for me and comfort me by grooming me, he is sort of the group leader and did this for the other three too. I have such a connection to him now and I believe you and your new horse, Diamond, will form your own version of this through this process. Animals are so perceptive! Hugs Lesley",

      "Content": "Dec 10, 2012 08:57AM Lesleyanne67 wrote: Benny I just saw your post when you were having a rough time a couple days ago. I wish I had seen it sooner. First I can only echo the sentiments about your experience in the store. I did have people say several insensitive things during my journey. I went through the agriculture inspection station - we have these in California, and it was one of the days when I finally had some hair so I went without a hat or wig but it was basically shorter than a buzz....the attendant said have a nice day sir. I LOST it. I had makeup on and I did not think I looked like a sir. For some reason it just really hurt me that day. I wanted to rip his manhood off, figuring since he \"thought\" I was a sir I needed it more than he did..... Hee hee Funny the things that can be upsetting or hurtful when I look back now. But here is what I really want you to know. This whole cancer treatment is a process. Part of the reason those of us a few years out come back is to help then ladies in the \"thick\" of it is to pay it forward. Someone did it for us and let me tell you, I was 41 and stage 3a. I had days when I wanted to quit treatment or thought i would die. There are good days and bad days and there is no exact formula for what days will be good or bad. Everyone is different and responds or reacts different. That is why all we can do is share our experience to take some of the fear of the unknown out of the equation. Ease apprehension and stress, show that you can make it through it. Why make it through it, well that I guess is obvious. But anyone who tells you treatment is anything other than \"sucky\" is lying. Everyone of us given the choice would NOT do chemo. I HATED being bald, I cried, I hated people telling me it would grow back....ugggh, I told you how I wanted to carry a buzz clip and shave a strip on people who said that : ). BUT the alternative is worse. I did NOT want to die at 41. Not treating my stage 3a with chemo, well maybe there would be a miracle, but the likelihood was I would never have a shred of normal again if I did not at least try. So this is temporary, a very horrid temporary, but I can promise you there will be days - later, where you will feel normal-ish. I say all this despite the fact that I have personally had a rough road the last 2 years with my attempts to reconstruct after radiation. I put myself through all this by my own choice and even knowing fully informed the possible risk of attempting silicone implants in radiated tissue...but it was a faster recovery, less time off work, and heck it DOES work for some people....now I have had 8 surgeries in 2 years....so I do NOT feel normal because I have had 3-4 surgeries a year and constantly recovering. Failed implants due to infections that are extremely painful. I had surgery in August that took 12 hours and I head back for a stage 2 I knew about THIS Friday. I don't share all this so anyone feels badly for me, and this is not a out me, it is about you guys, what I am trying to really say is take it one day at a time. I know that may seem simple or trite, but the truth is it is a process. If you have chemo, surgery, radiation, it will take a good year of your life. Then if you have to delay reconstruction you have to typically wait a year for radiated tissue to \"heal\". So it is a process and you need to give yourself the OK to feel what you feel and not feel bad about ANYTHING you feel. Don't compare where you are in relation to anyone else. Dosages are based on your weight and height, so how you react will not be the same. Some people struggle everyday throughout their treatment and I even knew someone who ran a half marathon (I did not want to hear about her anymore and told my \"friend\" who thought that was encouraging it made me feel weak and inadequate so she could keep THAT sort of heroics to herself, wink wink)....AND there is everything in between and there is no right or wrong, it is a PERSONAL journey. If you feel sick 20 days after, do what. Don't beat yourself up. I just allowed each day to unfold and accept it for what it was, good or bad. It is what it is was a daily mantra. : ) So Benny, I know it is rough, and I know you want to reclaim your old self - THAT is exactly why to see this all through no matter how bad it gets, it IS the best hope you have to reach that goal. You can do this. I never did say it would be easy, but it will get better. It might be worse before it gets better, I can't promise you have seen the worst yet, but maybe you have!!! A friend from high school was diagnosed a year ago and we spoke and I basically told her there is going to be a whole year of your life you will wish you could forget. I wanted to cover every mirror, when I would catch a glimpse of myself, well I just looked nothing like me. Puffy and bloated from steroids, bald, I was one of the lucky ones who gained weight instead of losing it, and I had always been tall and thin with long hair, it was REALLY hard. I am vain I admit it. I am STILL not myself yet, but i WILL get there. Seriously I am a type A control freak so the best lesson in all of this for me was realizing I really was NOT in control and when I surrendered trying to control what I could not and live in the moment, even if that moment sucked big time, I could make it to the next day. I think of you all the time. My last chemo was June 30, 2009. I did the dose dense A/C/T every 2 weeks. I can't believe I made it through, but I did. You are a tougher cookie than you know and my opinion is there is NO such thing as big girl panties during chemo. Feel what you need to feel. If you are angry and you need to break something - go ahead. If you want a huge pity party and want to lay around in your PJs and cry all day- do it. If you want to eat bad, deep-fried food- do it. There are no rules right now, whatever it takes to make it to the next day AND don't judge yourself. Don't feel bad that you are not you, or you can't make it to the barn, just do what you can when you can, period. It is freeing really, trust me, just let go for the next year, it really is the only choice you have : ) I hope this does not come across \"preachy\" it is really just a big permission slip! Sending big hugs and wishing not just Benny, but all of you in the eye of the storm, as minimal side effects as possible!!! Happy holidays.",

Constipation let me tell you, I know they mention it as a side effect but I was going to write an ENTIRE book about this, unless you have experienced cancer constipation first hand there is just no way Drs and nurses really get it. This is not your standard constipation...maybe that will be the book title : ) All the rest of you ladies, I am keeping up with your progress.

When I had my double mastectomy 3 years ago I had 2 drains in each breast for a total of 4 I dragged around for 2 weeks : ( After that I think I have had no less than 5-7 breast drains over the last couple years due to all my attempts at implant reconstruction on the radiated side that failed, all the way to this last surgery, SGAP, hip flaps, again 2 breast drains but those were only in a week, but get this 2 hip drains that were in a MONTH. I am just one week free of my last hip drain, ahhhhhh So I share that because I think I have more \"hole\" scars from various drains than anyone I know, do I can relate to the nuisance drains are. : ) This too shall pass, you are doing great! I had my kitty nurses helping me too. I have 4 so yes I am a crazy cat lady - wink wink You can do this! There are so many wonderful women who have gone on to live decades after their treatment, so you will be back to climbing ladders, riding a tractor, and throwing 50lb bales of hay before you know it. AND you will be even stronger than before, not maybe physically, but mentally/psychologically cancer tests your mettle, puts things in perspective, in a good way. It is a natural part of the process for most of us. As a social worker you will get it, but you will definitely no longer sweat the small stuff and lots of things become small stuff. We are all dying every day from the moment we are born, but a cancer diagnosis puts us in REAL contact with the fragility of life, good and bad. We are just more aware, which for many of us that felt pretty darn good before we get the news, is difficult to wrap our brains around. It is a process, and it is what it is. One of my favorite quotes after my divorce ( I was married for 11 years ) and it had even more meaning after cancer was life is a journey not a destination. I try to enjoy each step, learn the lessons, and really take it one day at a time. I know it is a bit cliche, but it helps to remember I don't have all the answers in every moment and that is OK. I like who I am and who I am is not a single piece it is the sum of all the parts and even cancer has had a hand in who I am today. Of course I do have a part of me that wishes I never had to deal with this, but I just try to make the best of the cards I am dealt because I don't like the alternatives : ) Huge hugs Lesley",

Chucking bales of hay 3 weeks out is likely not well advised so just take it slow. Sometimes you just have to get firm with folks. I did two things right away with people: 1) I told people I absolutely did not want to hear about people who died of breast cancer PERIOD. I already know people die of breast cancer and staying in a positive head space would be a critical piece of my healibg and survival - no exceptions 2) I told people I wanted ZERO unsoliscited advice about how this person or that person treated their cancer PERIOD. I trusted my medical team I needed to believe in my course of action and there was no room for second guessing or shoulda woulda coulda. That was it I just laid the ground rules with EVERYONE right away and if people could not abide by those 2 simple things I just did not associate with them. You DO need love and support right now not negativity. Some people just don't k ow so I made it easy on them I set the ground rules. That and I did not want folks to minimize the hair thing, but I already ranted about that. Carrying clippers and waving them menacingly at folks with hair and a roll of duct tape in the other hand to temporarily restrain them can be very powerful, wink wink Have a great weekend ladies. Be gentle with yourselves Benny no slinging hay. I had that same pain after a surgery weeks out just from swinging a golf club ; ( Oh and I almost forgot. Susan G Konen in my town this weekend and they hosted their first ever survivor dinner Wed for Survivor and one guest. It was very lovely and they had us stand for years of survival. The amazing woman who founded our group is an amazing speaker, THREE time cancer survivor, breast twice and one other different cancer she dis not specify and she is in great shape THIRTY years after her first breast cancer - Thoss are the stories I want to hear and focus on!!!!

So if it makes you all feel better today I have a HORRID sore throat.  I think it is sympathy pain for all you gals!!!!  Actually I think there are so many winter bugs and I now have one.  Let me tell you how fun it is when I cough!  I had a 7hr surgery 13 days ago for my reconstruction and they did a number on my tummy.  I have an incision that encircles my entire torso, yep goes all the way around my body like a belt and the tightened all the tummy muscles so everytime I cough well if you have had a c-section or abdominal surgery and coughed you can imagine....... This too shall pass.  Hang in there Benny.  I think the tough part of going thru this in winter is your immunity is down you have never had chemo before so if you catch a bug it is hard to know if everything you feel is chemo induced or could be the lovely addition of cold/flu bug.  I am SUPER encouraged you have no fever this time and I know it is uncomfortable, but you ARE doing it, you ARE getting thru it!

Many places won't but it makes you numb even better than EMLA. It is bacteriosratic saline they put in the spot first. Then they can \"dig\" around a little with no pain for you! I am an impossible stick very finicky veins. I had ALL nodes removed on the cancer side so for Lymphdema reasons I cannot have needle or blood pressure on that side so they have only one arm to work with. Not sure they have those Got Milk Ad campaigns in Canada but the whole nursing and lab team came in with their lab coats one time and flashed me and they all had \"got veins\" t-shirts on. It was funny. I had a port put in for my chemo so if you have to go the chemo route you might get a port which takes all the poke anxiety away. The port does not hurt and was a god send. I did a three year clinical trial after all my treatment and it was an IV infusion every three months.... They took my port out at my mastectomy so I had to have IVs every time I missed my port. So pulling for you tomorrow. I just had a bone scan LAST fri. Goes super fast, the poke part. Then you just have to wait around for the stuff to get in the bones.

It will serve you well in this process. I also think if you have been under a great deal of stress those \"symptoms\" don't disappear in a matter of days. I would venture to guess you are still sorting all of this out in your head so the headaches and ears ringing could be stress, medications, etc. I am certain the tests are accurate, so I am sure you are clear, but understand the natural worry. What was crazy for me was once chemo and surgery and radiation was over they sort of send you on your way. The end of \"active\" treatment ( so not the 5 years of AI's I am on Femara blech) was bittersweet. I did not love chemo, surgery, or rads but I knew we were doing SOMETHING....so when it all ends and you are on your merry way I was sort of like are we sure we got it all, that's it??? Three years later I still have moments but they get less and less and I am trying to imagine my big release of all the tension!! You will get there! Thinking of you today Lesley",

Nihahi I actually had an SGAP (hip) 12 hr surgery Aug 14 and had darn hip drains for over a month....Dec 14 was my stage 2 and he did a number on my tummy to make the front and back match.  You get sort of a mini butt lift when they cut those football shape \"chunks\" for lack of better work out of the butt/hip/flank area to make the new breasts.  I LOVE them FYI  : )  I did not have enough tummy for the DIEP so the ab work was just so the front was pulled up to match the back.  It was pretty rough.  2nd surgery Dec 14 was 7 hours.  I am mostly standing up straight but still sore in the tummy he tightened the muscle while he was in there and truth be told THAT hurts.  All the other skin stuff doesn't hurt too bad.  They were not able to do the nipple recon and since I have gone through as much as I have I do want to do the final step. I am pretty upright but still quite sore one month out but in 10 days I can resume exercise but they did fat grafts so I am not suppose to use chest muscles for another 7 weeks... It is a process! Have a great weekend ladies!!!",
