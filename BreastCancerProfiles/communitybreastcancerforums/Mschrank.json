I just can't seem to find any explanation or symptoms that seem to match mine. I don't have any significant mass or rash. Just one large sore boob I'm so over it my son cannot lay on me without it causing major discomfort. I'm getting really embarrassed by it as it's getting extremely noticeable and falls out of my bra ðŸ˜ž I am sure it's nothing major but I want to be sure that I get some answers and cancer ruled out. My left arm /pit is hurting also but I always blamed it on the port which they removed from that side and put on the other so not sure if it's related. I know only the doctors can diagnose me I am shy once I'm face to face with them but I'm hoping to be sent to someone who specializes in breast issues!",

I have to travel two hours to see my genetic specialists for my other condition and when i asked my pcp to give me prescription he told me he only heard of Fabry Disease ( the illness i have) in school never seen or heard it since so he would not treat me for anything to do with my condition. Thats why i have decided to go back to school for nursing I hope to be a good nurse for others who have been through terrible times with medical issues. It is sad when you have to fight the doctors to get answers or help. He basically told me if the mammo is fine we dont need to worry and i am thinking the same thing like what? deal with it are you kidding me let me punch you in the boob every day for the rest of your life and see how you like it haha thats how it feels to me. He also said some women have one breast bigger than the other which duh i already knew that but not this big of a difference i mean really it can cause some issues for a woman. I guess we will just wait and see what the radiologist say. He called the radiologist and asked him what he thought he should order as far as test go, he at first mentioned MRI then decided he would see what the radiologist say and go from there. They recommended mammo if mammo shows anything they will do the US that day. So guess we will see I will let you all know tomorrow :) hope you ladies have a great day and are not getting any bad weather stay safe!!",

Not gonna lie I freaked out a little bit earlier as I have not noticed any rashes so I started thinking maybe I really am in the clear. I decided to take a pic underneath the affected boob as I can't really see well and the place that hurts has a light pink area there I've never noticed. Like you all say it's very rare and I'm just going to mention it all to the radiologist",

I did tell him Fabry itself causes inflammation so I have been online researching and have found some Fabry women have had issues or cancer. But I think mine is probably more along the lines of small fiber neuropathy as that can cause swelling and pain atleast that's my next thing to rule out I suppose so I'm going to see a neurologist and see if they can't help me maybe. On a lighter note man my boob is sore now after that pressure!! Lol",

I am just hoping that maybe I can get some advice on what steps I should take any advice is appreciated greatly! Some background information I am 25 I had my son may of 2013 he will be two soon :) I did breastfeed for 3 months after month one I got mastitis which was horrible got antibiotics and pain meds kept breastfeeding. I also have Fabry disease I have a port which is accessed every two weeks (not related just figured i would mention). Well recently a few months back I noticed my left breast was tender and growing larger I figured maybe it was hormonal so I let it go. I finally showed my husband how much bigger it was at this point my left breast looks two times that of my right one and is still tender. Went to my pcp he gave me antibiotics thought it was mastitis which I thought was not the case since I know how that feels but at that time I did have a port on that side so I dismissed it thinking heck maybe the port is causing this somehow. Well the port was removed and placed on the right side that was done March 5th my pcp had ordered an ultrasound here at a local hospital which I hate going to as I live in a small town where you hardly would want to send an animal too. Anyhow the ultrasound tech made me feel stupid said oh you have really lumpy bumpy dense tissue its not a mass like the doctor thinks she barely glided over my left breast did not even compare the two whatsoever told me cancer does not hurt and that I am too young she doesnt know why the doctor sent me. So when the doctors office called to say test was negative and they wanted to know how I felt I said im fine because that tech made me feel so stupid. Which I am really used to being that I am diagnosed with a very rare disease already I am pretty used to uneducated doctors and being made to feel crazy know all about that one!! So here I sat thinking you know maybe this is all hormonal. Now i set an appointment for tomorrow with my pcp I dont know if I should tell him i am concerned about IBC or not I mean my left breast is out of control and my veins looks terrible in it i almost wish i could send a pic to someone it just looks terrible If its not IBC I just want to be sent to someone that could help me my breast is so big its embarassing and this nagging pain just lingers in that one area ugh just ready for it to be normal again. Sorry I know this is long just kind of wanted some perspective i suppose. My symptoms are Left breast doubled in size randomly, nipple looks like its getting bigger on that side and the place where it hurts has a big vein that has been popping out. The left breast feels extremely lumpy whereas the right just feels normal and squishy also the left breast looks like a little reddish but so does the right sometimes so i dont think much of that! Should I call and ask to be seen by a specialist? Thanks for listening. Have a great day! Log in to post a reply",
