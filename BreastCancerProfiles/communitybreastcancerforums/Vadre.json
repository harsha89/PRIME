I have learned so much and been held so close by this strong group of women that I don't know how I would get by without them.  You are so right: this is a 'metastatic storm.'  This is one safe place to be for cover and protection. I have come to think of it as a circle of sisters, holding hands and supporting each other. Welcome to the circle.  I was diagnosed three and a-half years ago. At the time I had two out of college (boys), one finishing college and one finishing high school (girls) and one in middle school (boy).  Our plan has always been to be honest with them. As I learned from my wise Mom \"Never tell them anything that you will later have to tell them was a lie.\"  At the time of my diagnosis I SO wanted this to not affect/change their lives. That just isn't possible. I have she'd many a tear because of this truth. I was afraid they would make decisions based on my diagnosis and come to regret them. Since then I have been in awe of their strength, their support and the loving choices they have made. My oldest daughter & I are in the midst of planning her wedding! My younger daughter has finished a couple of years of college and is taking a break to figure out what she wants to do. Both girls have decided that they need to be closer to me. They are both in the process of moving to Richmond (One hour, door-to-door) so that they can be closer to me and their little brother. It isn't the scene I would have imagined but it is so lovely to feel their love and support of me and each other. I guess I have learned to sit back (a little!) and let them figure things out. If you stay in this together wonderful things can happen, screw Stage IV!  Didn't mean to go on so long! Sorry.  At any rate, I'm glad you have started treatment. I share your desire to be 'doing something!'  It will continue to 'hit' you but you sound strong enough to hit back!  Don't be afraid to ask for some medicine to help with the overwhelming feeling. Xanax is my pill of choice. Welcome to the circle. We are here for you and are thinking about you in these days as you get things sorted out. Peace, Virginia",

Decide what you need to do for you!  Taking care of your brother or supporting your Dad or Mom can be part of that narcissism if you want but YOU get to decide. How much energy do you have and where do you want to spend it. It's tough to remember that we're never going to change anyone else....we can only change how we are going to respond to them.

One thing that was true, and that I had to grow up to grow out of was the belief that there is a right and a wrong answer to each question. I have had the tendency to approach many life choices as if there are only two possibilities. I have come to understand that, between 'this answer' and 'that answer' there are almost always several more possibilities. You are definitely at a difficult crossroads in your life. The choice you describe is a shitty one!  Between reaching for the goal/life you have worked for and dreamed of while ignoring your health and turning away from your work which has brought you a hard earned sense of security and pleasure in order to take care of yourself and possibly live longer and in a less stressful way. I hurt for you as you face the reality that your life-goal may not be particularly good for you now. Sometimes I hate this \"new normal\" about which we all speak.  I told the story about growing up with two answers to every questions because your description of your options sounds SO much like me. It's A) Do what I want, which is probably bad for me or B) do what is probably good for me but is certainly not what I want.  So I ask, are there possibly some in-between choices? Is it possible to turn down this new job but not leave all together? Or possibly ask about taking on some of the new tasks which might bring some of the challenge you wanted without adding too much new stress.  I'm sure there are many options. You must be very good at what you do or they wouldn't be interviewing you.  I know there is a \"get busy leaving or get busy dying\" way of thinking about a Stage IV diagnosis but I think there's a lot of living in between point A and point B. I hope this makes sense and helps just a bit. I also hope that you sleep easily tonight. Virginia",

I don't know for sure how you experienced it, but I imagine it would have been terrifying for me.  I haven't had dreams about dying that I remember. I have had a bunch of nightmares in which I know that I HAVE to do something important. Sometimes it's clear that the thing I have to do will \"save\" me or make things better. The bottom line is that in all of these dreams something stops me from doing what I need to do. Most recently I knew I had to run to get to somewhere/someone safe. I couldn't run. I just couldn't. My legs hurt and they felt so heavy. I just couldn't get them to work right. My family was all there trying to get me to move - telling me to run but my legs hurt too much. I couldn't move. When I woke up my legs were really aching. I took breakthrough pain meds and lay there quietly while they took hold.  As I retell this dream I guess it was about dying. My family pulling, encouraging me. I needed to get moving or keep moving and I just couldn't anymore. I was so afraid when I woke up. Knowing that the reality was that at some point I just wouldn't be able to do it any more. At the time I thought \"it\" was just some task. Maybe \"it\" was living. Maybe I was dreaming about the time when my body wouldn't be able to help me live anymore.  It's amazing that, even while we sleep, our minds are trying to work out and make sense of the craziness of MBC. I had not thought again about my dream. I have been thinking for a while now that I need to find a therapist or someone I can talk with to better cope with the stress and fear of living with and dying from MBC. I think my dream is reinforcing that need. If I'm trying to deal with all of this EVEN in my sleep, maybe I should give my psyche a break!  Thanks again for posting, LizLemon. You helped me figure something out. I hope this is helpful to you. I hope you have pain-free, sweet dreams tonight!",

I know that docs need to be careful about \"users\" but I think someone who is Stage IV is a different thing!   I have had two Oncologists,and two GPs (I moved a year ago).  They both have been very upfront that a patient with a metastatic BC is in a different category where pain medication is concerned. My Insurance case manager said the same thing recently. If the Insurance company agrees than you know it's true!! I think that pain and pain management are a part of our life from now on. I can't function if I am in pain or if I am tense about not having my pain meds. If my doctors were giving me difficulty about pain meds I think I would need to change docs. It is difficult enough not to feel \"weak\" for relying on pain meds without someone whose job is to promote your quality of life making you feel worse!  I'm sorry to rant but I feel strongly about this!  You are the one who knows if you are in pain. Your doctor needs to be someone who trusts your judgement!  Fear of pain and real pain can be mostly controlled. It should not control you! Peace, friends!",

Sometimes I just need people that understand my situation listen to me so that they might, gently, say \"Hold on, is it possible that blah blah blah?\"  I also need some strong people standing behind me. I know that I need to talk to her, whether or not she is really going to understand. I really, truly do not want to hurt her but every time she makes one of these comments I end up in knots for days!  It just hurts me as a sister and leaves my hold on my energetic, positive outlook tentative at best. I also need to talk to her (I will actually probably write her a letter) because my DH, who usually leaves me to deal with my sister as I feel is best, is not going to be able to hold his tongue very long. Very basically he doesn't like to see me hurt, but more seriously in his mind is that he does not like me having to deal with unnecessary pain and craziness now. He really believes, as do I, that part of managing my cancer, is managing the negativity iin my life!  He is close to stepping in as my protector here. I am not afraid to. Let him do that if needed but I would like to avoid things being said that can never be taken back!   Your observation about baiting me is very insightful. We are on a spur of the moment little trip with our DS and nephew. A few days in the sunshine on Kiawah Island in SC. When you said baiting a lightbulb suddenly went off in my head about how often these episodes happen when my DH & I are doing something special alone or with our children. Her relationships with her. Husband and kids aren't what I think she hoped for.  The thing that is saddest for me is that I so wish that I was able to support and be supported by my sister rather than feeling I need to protect myself from her.

Those comments are so inappropriate and hurtful, whether you are sick or not. I can't begin to understand why people think they have the right to ask things like that....maybe they are just dumb!  Sometimes I wish I could think of something funny but sarcastic to say that would catch people off guard and, at the same time, tell them to mind their own damn business!  Maybe try \"Yeah, after my mastectomy he's been nagging me about my weight. I talked to my doctor who put me on the Cancer Diet. Maybe you'd like to try it?!\"  I am not a mean person and I don't like to offend people but come on.  As grown ups we all just HAVE to pay more attention to the world around us and special attention to people's feelings there is just too much hurt in the world to make things worse with carelessness!!

It makes me calmer to know that people \"get it.\"  It helps just to know someone will leave a caring message.  The piece that I left out in my original post that makes this so much more complicated and painful is tha my sister (who is five years younger than I) has Stage IV too. She has mets to her bones and liver. With several large tumors in her liver.  While we should be able to turn to each other for compassion and understanding it is as if we are in two different worlds. She has chosen alternative treatments for the most part and seems determined to have my situation be worse than hers and that I be reminded of that.  Of course there is a lifetime of sibling nonsense under all of this but knowing that doesn't help. While we have a large and loving extended family, both of our parents and our brother are gone. It's just us. She has mental health issues that should probably excuse all this.  I know all these things in my head. My heart is another thing.  Thanks for caring and not telling me I'm being a Ninny.  Virginia",

I struggled for a bit: do I keep checking in or signing off for good? Some days I find such strength and support here. Then I remembered what I have to remind myself over and over again: one day at a time! If it's too painful I can sign off and stay off for days or until tomorrow whatever works.

I don't know if you have considered a little support in alleviating that fear and anxiety? I began takin Xanax as needed shortly after my diagnosis. I take it PRN, not on a regular schedule. There are times when I start worrying or living in fear, as you put it, and it just spirals. I can't slow down my thoughts. The fear or anxiety just gets bigger and bigger. The Xanax helps me come back to center and be more peaceful. It also helps me sleep and we all know that getting good sleep is essential to living with a positive outlook.

I posted a sorry about having used the word \"terminal\" to describe my prognosis. I recounted that my Aunt called me later to suggest I not use that word as it could be upsetting to other people. I posted this on \"S**t people say\" because, at the time, it was difficult & upsetting for me to understand that making other people comfortable was my job in that situation. I thought that \"S**t people say\" might be a place where I would find understanding & recognition of my situation.  I understand that \"terminal\" is a hard word and that there are many words which leave room for hope and time and other positive things.  I don't use the word very often, at the time I used it partially because of its seriousness but that isn't really important now.  The response to my post was to suggest other words I might have used. Words which were less stressful to other people. Words that members of our \"Stage IV Club\" have found helpful to describe our diagnosis. I didn't ask for help finding better words, I know there are better words. I certainly didn't hope to, in essence, be told that my Aunt was right, I could have used a better word.  When we express frustration about comments referring to \"being hit by a bus\" or \"at least you're loosing weight\" we aren't asking to be reminded that these people love us, that they don't mean to upset us, that they didn't really think about what they were saying, that they didn't really mean that. We are asking for understanding, support & fellowship.  I thought long and hard about not mentioning this. I really don't like to upset people or seem bitchy and self-centered. I don't want to make anyone feel uncomfortable but I actually considered not coming back to this feed because I felt so misunderstood. That seems particularly ironic, since the whole point of this particular conversation is to find understanding and support when people's responses to us and our cancer diagnosis leaves us feeling misunderstood and even dismissed.  I apologize if I'm being too sensitive. Especially if that means I upset one of you in the process!  This has just been a particularly difficult theme in some of my family conversations. While wanting to remain positive and hopeful it is really important for me that people understand the reality of my diagnosis.  It hurts to have my fears dismissed because \"they are doing such amazing things in cancer research.\"  I need those who care about me to understand the whole picture. That is what led me to use the word terminal in the first place. ",

On the outgoing flight had been so much carry-on that I was separated from my stuff by rows & rows. The flight attendant suggested that I board with the \"special needs\" group in order to board early to assure I would have my luggage close. She was also sweet and put me in the row with extra leg room. There was a man standing in the First Class line who took offense at the fact that I was boarding before he was. He kept making \"under his breath\" comments about \"The 'sick' lady in line in front of me.\"  He was being very rude and I was really uncomfortable and close to tears. It had been a wonderful but exhausting trip and I was a little upset about how much more difficult travel was for me now.  The man made a comment to the attendant about the Airline needing a more strict set of guidelines so people didn't take advantage of special seating.  My sweet husband finally couldn't take it any more.  He turned to the man and said \"My wife, the mother of our 13 year old son, has terminal breast cancer. We don't know from day to day how good she will feel or, indeed, how long she will live. I think she would pass any test for Special Needs before you would pass any test for having Class at all let alone First Class.\"  A small group of people standing around started to clap. I, of course, kissed him soundly!  When it came time to board the plane my son stepped back and offered to let Mr Rude the chance to board first. The guy guy at least had the class to turn bright red and let Scott go first. It was all so embarrassing and upsetting. Everyone else made up for it though. People bought us a couple drinks and the Airline gave us a voucher for an upgrade on our next flight. The Flight Attendant winked when she gave it to us and said \"We didn't figure you wanted to sit there on this flight!\"  If he hadn't spoken up I wouldn't have met all those nice people which made up for how horrid Mr Rude was. ",

I've come a long way since then and I try to focus on the friends that I can really count on and the activities that really help me enjoy life. But, to be honest, I can still be sad when I think of Leslie.  I like to think of this group as a circle of sisters, holding hands and supporting each other. I hope that helps, even though others can still hurt us.  Hugs, Virginia",

They have worked hard in the three years since my diagnosis to learn the right things to say and how to best help me out. I have probable also learned that sometimes, when they don't use the exactly right words, I have to hear the love behind the words. So much of this is new to all of us. We have to let ourselves grow up together.  Having said that, I think I would go crazy if I had to make excuses for everybody, and be understanding and accepting etc etc all the time.

You said that you didn't want her pity. Well, you see, I don't think you had her pity. In order to pity someone you have to care about what is going on in their life. Clearly this Churchlady doesn't have the ability to pity because she is so busy thinking of herself! \"I am so glad... I don't have... I had colon cancer...\" See, she didn't really need you there for that conversation! I pity her because she thinks about herself so much that she doesn't see how much good in people she is missing! All of that aside....she was an ass to say those things to you. I hope that you vented and stomped your feet until you were ready for some ice cream! PS. There is a thread that I really like. I think you might like it too! https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topic/7... Lots of venting, no judging!",

The doctor's didn't expect him to live past infancy but my Mother who was an RN managed to help keep him alive until he was eight. As long,as I can remember I knew that my little brother was sick and that he would die from being sick one day. I understood, long before I really understood, that his illness was the reason for the many things in our family life that was different from my friends. When I was older and thinking about having kids of my own I asked my parents how they decided what to tell us and when. My parents said: \"We decided that we would never tell you anything that we would later would tell you was a lie.  It was so important that you could always trust that we were telling you the truth.\"   This is the rule I have used in talking to my kids when I was diagnosed. My youngest was 12 yo at the time. It doesn't mean that I have to give him every detail, but I can't lie. I won't pretend things are fine if they aren't. I answer his questions honestly. He asked the very first day if I was going to die from this. I had promised him his whole life that I would never lie. I told him \"Yes, I will die from this.  But my doctors think that won't be for a long time.\"  As we have lived through these past several years, to include one brief period when my MO though I had serious mets to the brain and suddenly only had a year (which turned out not to be true.) I have never told him something that I later had to tell him was a lie. I think this has helped all five of my kids. They are afraid of what the cancer might do but they have never been afraid that they won't know what is happening.  I'm not telling anyone else what to do or what is best for your kids. I'm just sharing our experience. I appreciate how honest and open you all are. Going through this is hard, watching my children grow and knowing what I might miss is hell. Having y'all to share that with is such a help.",

We know that it is sometimes impossible to watch our children without thinking about leaving them.  All of us with MBC and children share the pain of bringing cancer into  lives.  They should be thinking about summer vacation, ice cream, boys/girls, fun.... Sometimes the wrongness of it all is overwhelming. Add to that pain and the anxiety of things constantly changing and it's almost completely overwhelming. When I am overwhelmed, like you sound right now, it is so easy to be consumed by the darkness. Just remember that you were right here, in this same overwhelmed place this time last year and yet this has been a wonderful year!  I am not trying to be Pollyanna like so many who don't understand the meaning of \"Stage IV.\"  I promise that I know the reality. I, too, am facing right now the fear of having to give up a tool from my bag of AI tricks. I'm not suggesting that you should pretend that everything is OK. Just remember that you faced this darkness before and found a little pill and the inner strength to give yourself a good year, a year where: \"I almost feel like things have kind of gotten back to normal.\"  The little pill helped, I know. Having SE mostly under control helps too. But mostly I think it was your own determination to care for your children and give them a life not focused on the darkness of cancer that gave you that year. Yes, it is possible that the Scan will show new activity and you will have to give up your Femara.  But don't forget that there are more tricks in the bag and, as your MO said, there are a couple of amazing treatments just on the horizon.  You asked for help, inspiration, experience. Well, there is lots of it here. Many women who, like you,  have faced a Prognosis that sucks, looked it in the face and still managed to watch a Tball game like it was all that mattered in the world. I can't say anything that changes our reality.  I do think that there are some really exciting discoveries coming, but those may or may not help us with the next six months or a year. What will help is remembering that you found the strength, deep down in a place you didn't know existed, to make this last year a happy one. I believe that you can find that strength again.  I have become hooked on the show \"Game of Thrones.\"  I'm not one of those crazy fans who dresses up and pretends I live in the Seven Kingdoms or anything, but I really like it. I know it seems ridiculous to answer your sadness, pain and fear with a quote from a TV show, but we get our inspiration where we can. There is a line that comes up from time to time that sometimes helps me get out of bed or just sit and watch TV with my teenage son. It's not a false promise or a magic pill but it helps me sometimes and I hope it helps you now.  \"Today is not the day that I die.\" We can't live our lives years or weeks at a time. Just one day at a time. You have done it before and I think you can do it again. You knew you needed some support and you found it. You are a strong, loving mother. You are \"almost\" in the same spot you were last summer.  You made that be a good year and, one day at a time, you can again. I've gone on and on. I will be thinking of you and sending loving strength your way as you wait, yet again, for more news. Just remember how strong your love is and that \"Today is not the day\" Virginia",

My youngest ds (16 now) never wanted to go. He agreed to go one year, had a blast, didn't want to go again. I think letters are the answer. I wouldn't encourage phone calls...hearing a voice, particularly a crying one, just makes it too difficult. Cheerful letters from home help so much. My daughter has been a Camp Counselor for 5+ years. She always said that the cheerful letters which said \"I can't wait to see you and hear all the fun things you are doing & learning!\" were perfect.  We have five kids, ranging from 27-16. Since my dx I have found, over & over, that they need a kind of permission to live their lives and have fun even in the midst of Stage IV. One way to give them permission is to model that behavior yourselves. Mention in a letter that you took the chance of an empty nest to go see a movie that they wouldn't have liked or something.  Or maybe even help them be glad they are away by telling them how much Dad misses them doing their chores! As hard as it is to believe, you will make it through these weeks. Having them home, scratched, sunburned and bug-bitten will come faster than you know!! Giving you a squeeze of support! Virginia",

We were building our retirement dream home when I was diagnoses. We are so in love with this area. Such beauty and so many wonderful, historic, natural, fun things to do. Cancer has slowed our life down, but we are still loving being retired here. If you come back this summer it would be wonderful to meet! Finding this site has given me such perspective. I have been measuring my coping, progress, depression etc all against the general BC community. Not a fair comparison. Being able to know that others feel and think the way I do and are still living their lives is a tremendous help. What a blessing.  The \"saying\" that keeps coming into my head this winter as the cold grey weather has added to my depression to leave me feeling immobile is from my father. Dad died shortly after I graduated from College. When I was younger and was feeling overwhelmed by something my DDdy would look at me with his wonderful blue/grey eyes and tell me \"Everything is going to be OK.\"  I always understood that he meant this in a long-term, big picture way, but somehow it gave me comfort today.  We've got snow & ice again today, but yesterday promises me that Spring is on it's way!
