      "Content": "May 23, 2017 03:05PM - edited May 23, 2017 03:15PM by Nancy618 I wasn't told anything about anti-oxidants for radiation...was told that was only a concern with chemo. I take vitamin supplements that have A, E and C in them as well as a drink from Young Living that is full of high anti-oxidant juices. I specifically asked the MO nurse today if I should stop taking it for radiation and she said she'd run it by the MO, but didn't see any reason to. However, I forgot to ask the RO nurse today. Just to be on the safe side, I'm going to quit taking it during radiation, but I'm going to continue my vitamin supplements that I've been taking for years, as they are the normal recommended dosages, none over 100%. I found this from the NIH: . With few exceptions, most of the studies draw positive conclusions about the interaction of antioxidants and radiotherapy. Although further studies are needed, the preponderance of evidence supports a provisional conclusion that dietary antioxidants do not conflict with the use of radiotherapy in the treatment of a wide variety of cancers and may significantly mitigate the adverse effects of that treatment. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17761641 But then I read other articles which says they DO interfere with radiation. Just going to stop the supplement until radiation is over (and the 2 weeks after) and hope it keeps. The damn stuff is expensive!!!",

Unless they would tell me to do that tomorrow, but you'd think they would have mentioned it today. I was also told NOT to use any creams on the area at all. Use only cornstarch. Although, they said IF I needed anything, they had samples they could give me. Said there was no scientific evidence that they help. Interesting! I'm a bit concerned about the bra....they aren't EVER comfortable for me, especially at the band area, so I'm looking for something else. I looked at the Softees and while they look nice, with warmer weather coming, the long length may intensify my hot flashes, as I have already started on AIs (which is a whole OTHER story). AND the price is prohibitive unless someone has had excellent experiences with them and convince me that I should buy one. I still have my surgical bras and the nurse said I could use those, but they seem a bit tighter than I think I would want. Any help with a bra would be greatly welcomed!",

They are Hanes Cooling Comfort. They too pull up or go over the head. I bought them one size larger and hoping that they will be comfortable. There's NO wide band at the bottom which is my biggest concern. I saw another bra that looks just like the Genie, but I didn't buy it because it was 98% nylon. My onc nurse told me to try to get a cotton bra as it will be more comfortable. The Cool Comfort is 58% cotton 36% polyester and 6% spandex. It feels very soft to the touch and is VERY lightweight.",

I've spent an hour just now looking online and I'm just so confused! I also don't want to pay $50 for something that's probably going to get stained. But I googled \"playtex unwinder\" and it came up with absolutely nothing. So many people say they wear no bra, just a camisole with loose clothing over it. Well, it's going to be warm weather before I'm done and the weeks after when we will be at our cottage. I don't think I'll be wearing layers! Unfortunately, I am not all that small breasted, so I think camis or tank tops are going to be only acceptable at home. I found some sports bras, but they pull up and not sure with my shape that will be doable! And front clasp closure, I'm not sure if that may be irritating. So, you can see I'm quite conflicted!",

I can now see the perfect rectangle that was my radiation field, where I could never see that before. I'm not too uncomfortable, but I did use some Miaderm on it this morning and still using cornstarch. What throws me the most though is that the breast is noticeably smaller and the nipple is at least an inch higher than the other. It looks really odd in some clothes. Does that stay that way??? Peetie: Thanks for recommending the Cortisone 10, it's working! I tried some other generic ones I had and it didn't really help. It's still a little itchy, but the bumps are almost gone.",

Pineapple and frozen bananas work well to both sweeten naturally and provide some thickness. I add spinach which I can't even taste, but maybe you wouldn't care for that. I use a cup of plain Greek yogurt. Watch the amount of sugars in whatever yogurt you use. And also the other ingredients. I also make smoothies with various berries, either singly or mixed together. The frozen mixed berries are good to use as they are not only high in antioxidants, but also they will make the smoothie thicker. I don't add extra protein as there is quite a bit in Greek yogurt. I do add ground flax seeds or hemp hearts for omega 3s. The cornstarch is used on the whole breast to keep it smooth and it will also \"soak up\" any moisture which is good in the summer months. That's all I've used really. I did try Miaderm cream and another one made for the cancer center I go to, but neither really did anything the cornstarch wasn't doing.This weekend I broke out in an itchy rash over the up quarter of my breast toward the center. RO said it wasn't unusual and to use hydrocortisone or benadryl cream on it as needed for the itching. Only 2 more boosts for me and I'm done!!! I was lucky enough to only need 20 total treatments. The surgical area is feeling a bit tender and irritated today. Usually, whatever I feel after treatments goes away overnight. I forgot to start my Arimidex today!!! Will start tomorrow.",

However, I've got a different issue with pain. I'm 6 weeks post radiation and I've been having pain the last couple days under my incision and in my armpit. It's not a sharp pain, but more of a persistent ache and kind of a stretching feeling. If I lay on my back, just the gravity pulling down on my breast makes it hurt. I can also feel a very hard area underneath the incision running the length of it, but sort of rounded. When I stretch my arm over my head, it also hurts, as does the area under my armpit. I'm thinking I should be totally recovered from radiation effects by now. I see my MO next Tuesday and I still have to make an appointment with my RO in September. I don't see my surgeon until November. I'm hoping I get some answers from the MO or at least a direction of where to go, because the pain is making me cranky. The good news is that the Arimidex is giving me fewer SEs than the Letrozole did. I'm still having massive hot flashes, but they are lessening in number. I've also been sleeping better. I guess I just have to accept that I can only sleep 6 hours a night...which is tons better than the 4-5 of very interrupted sleep I was getting. My hips are hurting, but I don't think much more than usual. I have been taking Ibuprofen at night, which I know shouldn't be done long-term, but if I don't, I don't sleep either.

I plan on doing LOTS of resting and recuperating. Which leads to a question...for those done with rads, how long before you were able or told you could go out in the sun. I love to lay on the air mattress in the lake and go for pontoon rides and would prefer not to have to wear tee shirts! Stella5Bear: Congratulations on your report. Very encouraging for us who are going through treatment. Badomettp: I was a little apprehensive before treatments started, especially the day of \"staging\" where I had to lay still for 45 minutes. But once the actually treatments started it was a BREEZE! For me, the only SE that really has been debilitating is the fatigue, and I'm told what I'm experiencing is minor. I just don't have the stamina that I used to, nor the strength.I had #17 of 20 treatments today and the first boost. But I went out this morning and hoed my garden by hand and cut the dead peonies off the bush and while I was tired and sweaty, I was able to shower and drive myself to treatment and back with no issue. Usually by the end of the afternoon is when I really hit the wall and I just am too darned exhausted to do anything. Dinners have been pretty meager and whatever I can manage to slap together. I got some bras from Meijer that are the most comfortable. Hanes, I think, mostly cotton, sports bras. I also got some Fruit of the Loom sports bras from Amazon, but they aren't quite as comfortable. All you need to \"worry\" about for treatments, is wear something 2 piece, because you'll be given a robe and take everything off from the waist up. The treatment for me takes less than 5 minutes.

I just wish everyone around me understood that. Along with the fatigue comes depression, I guess. I am extra sensitive to comments both good and bad. I went to Zumba yesterday which totally kicked my butt. Came home so exhausted and my hips so sore could barely waddle. I spent the rest of the day in bed because of an insensitive comment made to me about it. Ugh. I just can't deal with more stress or negativity right now.",

Fatigue, new medication, and I thought of one today while taking a 2 miles walk. (I'm not really fatigued, I'm just using it as an excuse not to do things!) For 3 months, I've been BUSY, and various health professionals have been watching over me, have had lots of appointments, friends have been extra attentive and kind, always asking how I'm doing. Now that rads are done....all of that is pretty much over. It's sort of like \"letdown\" after a big event. Now we have to figure out what the new norrmal is and get on with our lives. Sound crazy???",

But as long as I have to keep seeing the MO, the RO and the BS, I'm not really done. And there is always the niggling thought...they didn't see the DCIS on mammogram or MRI, just the IDC. So, how do I know I don't really have DCIS in the left one too? I try not to think about that! And I try to suck up the AI side effects because that's supposed to keep it in check if it is there. I was told no swimming if the skin was peeling or open. My BS and MO \"guessed\" at 4-6 weeks. I had 4 weeks. I think it's up to the RO after they look at all the information and the pictures they take. MJ: I am SO itchy!!! It's 6 days since the final rad and I'm going crazy. Nothing is helping the itching. Cortisone 10 does for a little while, but not for long and I don't want to put it on more than twice a day. And my breast is a bit pink, but the area above where it meets the chest is a funny brown color, the breast and the area under my armpit feels like a sunburn, and my incisions are an ugly dark reddish brown. Do the incisions ever lose that color? I would be very self conscious wearing a sleeveless blouse or dress. Chloe: I have no experience with what you describe,but I sure can see why you would be concerned. Just off the top of my head I am guessing that this is a reaction from the radiation. Please don't get ahead of yourself until you see the doctors tomorrow! Leaving on Thursday for 3 weeks at our cottage where there is little or no cellphone coverage and no internet or wifi unless I can use my phone as a hotspot. So, if you don't see me around, you'll know why. Hang in there!!!",
