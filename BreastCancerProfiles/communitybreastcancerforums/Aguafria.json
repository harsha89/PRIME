      "Content": "Aguafria wrote: hello, A little back story...last week (feb 8th) I went to my PCP for a sinus infection. 2 or 3 days later I notice a redness spot on my breat. Doesn't really itch but just appears over night. I blow it off for a couple of days attributing it to some kind of reaction to amoxicillin. On Friday, it's still there and has stayed the same. I call my doc and she gets me right in. She's stumped and calls her partner in and she can't figure it out either but thinks it might be cellulitis. We also both see some dimpling on one side of the breast. So off the the pharmacy I go, and get another antibiotic. The next day my doctor called me again, asks how it's doing and its stayed the same. I have no other symptom of cellulitis except for the redness of my breast. I get my mammogram and ultrasound on that Monday, results come back in all good. There is hardening of the tissue but the radiologist says its from the redness. I feel a little better but not 100% relieved. Meanwhile my doc days that it would be a good idea to see a breast specialist. So I'm looking online and I see that MD Anderson (Gilbert AZ) is right down the road from me. I make an appt.at the undiagnosed breast cancer clinic and had it today. Both the nurse practitioner and the doctor said I should stop taking the antibiotics and they schedule me for an MRI but it's not til the freaking 29th because of \"insurance\" we have BC&BS, you would think we would know sooner. The surgeon also said she would like to do a biopsy but wants to do that after b/c she doesn't want to skew the results of the MRI. They had all my medical records beforehand, etc. if this is IBC, I feel like they are so slow. Anyone have any advice? I'm thinking that it's ridiculous to wait that long. On their website, it was kind of portrayed they I would have answers within 24-48 hrs. And now I wait for 10-11 days. I'm going to maybe call my insurance tomorrow to see what I should do as well. And maybe the hospital too. Help Log in to post a reply",

So I wake up this morning (after a restless night of sleep, lol) and definitely notice that my left breast feels a little heavier and not so soft as the other one if that makes sense. I'm not one to freak out about every.single.thing but I do notice a difference. As a sidebar, my SIL was diagnosed with breast cancer last year and she is a wealth of information. I called her yesterday and she talked me down off the cliff, thx god! Anyways, she ended up texting back that saying her and her husband both thought it was crazy that it was going to take that long for an MRI. (I can literally see the mayo clinic in Scottsdale from our bedroom window and jokingly told her I was driving there demanding an MRI ;) I call Anderson this morning and told the RN on staff what was going on and the doctor called me in 20 minutes. Low and behold, my MRI and biopsy is now scheduled for this Monday! :) I feel better better now but still get those dark and just ugly thoughts but thank god for good support:) I know I'll fine this weekend. Honestly, it's like I have this gut instinct. Partly, it's because I just see that red spot on my breast just staring at me. Ugh. Thank you all for letting me vent. It feels better to write it all out",

I'm just glad they moved it til Monday Ok, I have to laugh. 15 minutes after I posted this the billing dept calls me and tells me that we owe about 2700.00. (Our deductible hasn't been met for the year so we were expecting about 3k. I'm glad they called beforehand to let me know :",
