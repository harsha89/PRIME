I have another appointment set up for Friday, hopefully they have everything then so I can stop freaking out and focus on school in a few weeks. I tried asking the woman who was during the ultrasound if she saw anything, but she said no. I have a feeling, however, they're just supposed to say that to you? She was taking a few pictures, of course, which concerned me, so it seems to me like she either must have seen something or there're just routine spots to take the photos at. Either way, thank you!",
