It is not on the surface and i only noticed it due to having a very small red lump (what looks like a blood blister) on the surface of the skin. I am due to have a mammo and ultrasound on Monday with possible FNA. . There is no history of breast cancer in my family. I am 49 years young. What were other peoples outcome with similar lumps. Would like to add the pea sized lump isn't near the red lump Debs Log in to post a reply",

There is a benign calcification inner aspect of the left breast at the 9-10 o'clock position. U/S RB was clear U/S LB:The small palpable nodule corresponds to the calcification, possibly a small calcified fibroadenoma in the LB or possibly even a small sebaceous cyst. It is superficial and subcutaneous in nature. My GP said that a possible result isn't good enough and she wants to be 100% sure all is ok. I'm not too worried about it to be honest but there is always the slight doubt when it's only a possible result. Thanks for the well wishes xx",
