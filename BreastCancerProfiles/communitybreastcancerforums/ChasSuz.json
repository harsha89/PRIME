    "Content": "ChasSuz wrote: Hi All, Though I was dx in April, I am new to the boards as I've been waiting for test results this entire time. I just got Mammaprint results yesterday and it doesn't look like I can avoid chemo, as I'd hoped based on being ER+, PR+ and HER2-. Though I look healthy, and am an avid runner, pescetarian, all around health junkie, I have autoimmune thyroid disease, have had several flares of autoimmune symptoms and indicators that the docs could never figure out, and currently have inexplicable low platelets. They went from 150 on April 23 to 56 last week when I was being screened for a clinical trial. I see the hematologist on Thursday, but my guess is autoimmune. I mean, I'm under just a BIT of stress right now, right? I also have migraines, have had pneumonia half a dozen times, including being hospitalized at 20, AND had c. diff about 12 years ago. I'm very concerned about the effect of chemo on my body with all of these underlying issues. All of the docs say, \"oh, you're young and healthy, you'll do fine.\" Is anyone in a similar boat who can give me some real talk, and maybe measures I can put in place to minimize the damage?
