    "Content": "worriedspecialneedskidsmom wrote: The core biopsy could not find my lesion (detected on MRI) since it is not detectable on Mamm/US and they don't think they can do an MRI one given how little tissue I have. So, they are putting a marker in by MRI and scheduling a surgical biopsy. This has been drawn out due to all the complexities. My anxiety increases by the day. I know it is not fruitful, but I cannot help it. I am an anxious person by nature. Are psychomatic symptoms (tight chest, pain near core biopsy incision, tingling arm, back pain, etc.) fairly typical? I don't want to ask my BS, because she told me last Jan. to stop worrying (which was wrong since I had an existing lesion that just had not been found and would not have been if I had not requested an MRI instead of mamm/US). Thanks for any input re the symptoms Log in to post a reply",
