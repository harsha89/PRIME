    "Content": "DawnWings wrote: I have lumps in both breasts. One of them in my left breast is large. It around the size of a marble, very hard and round. The other ones in my right breast aren't as hard but they're not really soft either. I've had a had a large amount of caffeine the last year. I've slowed way down, but I was drinking 2-3 cups of strong coffee and one whole Dr-pepper a day for months, before slowing down this month to around half a cup a coffee a day. I am only 26 and I know this is a young age to have breast cancer, but I think I have several risk factors. My Grandmother died of lung cancer. I live with two smokers, and my cat has been spraying around the house for a couple of years. Is exposure to urine a risk factor? (I won't go into all my personal business, but the cat issue is not my fault, and she has a appointment later this month to get spayed.) Log in to post a reply",
