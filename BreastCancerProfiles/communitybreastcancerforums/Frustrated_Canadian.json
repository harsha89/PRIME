      "Content": "Frustrated_Canadian wrote: As I have mentioned in my previous posts, I had my original mastectomy in January 2011 due to a two year chronic infection.  That has now cleared up, but found more cyst in the remaining breast, and finally got conformation that my mastectomy for the left side has been scheduled for December 22, 2011. I have mixed feelings, I can talk a blue streak about getting it done, and I am not worried about getting it done, people do not understand, but my BS and I both feel that it is better for me to do this, then wait for a cyst to get infected and start the two year infection train again.  I'm now having anxiety about this surgery, and going through all the feelings I went through previously.  We were planning on going to our house in Baja leaving on December 24, 2011, but that has been put on hold, as I highly doubt I'm going to be up to it two days out of surgery. Gosh, so much to do and get ready both at work and at home.  We have four children so forgoing Christmas really isn't an option. Sorry to post here, I always feel guilty as I know I'm very fortunate compared to other women, in the fact that I do not have breast cancer, but losing both my breasts is still a very traumatic experience for me. Any other near Christmas mastectomy ladies around?

What did other women do?  Did you get a prostheses, or just go natural?  At a lose here, don't want to out put the money, but at the same time, don't want to look lopsided.
