The doctor said he got it all but I noticed immediately when the swelling from the biopsy went down the same lump was still there. I called and asked if it was possible he biopsied the wrong place and was told that it was unlikely and microcysts can come back quickly so it would be fine to just come back at my 3 month checkup. So fast forward June, I went in for another ultrasound and they noticed my lymph node under my arm also was swollen so the doctor said let's just do a lumpectomy so you dont have to worry anymore. So this past Wednesday, July 18th I had a lumpectomy. He told me that the mass looked very benign to him when he removed it but then called today and told me there was a surprise... he said there was some adenocarcinoma. I didn't ask a lot of questions since my kids were in the car with me but after looking I see that covers multiple types of breast cancer. He is supposed to be sending over my pathology report but I haven't gotten that yet. I have a appointment August 1st but he said they need to do more testing and asked if I could come in sooner. I cant since I'm in the car headed out of state until July 31st. Is it stupid of me to go enjoy this vacation for the next weem instead of making a u turn so I can be seen sooner? I'm literally horrified that its had 6 months to spread. I just really want to connect with others right now. Has anyone else had a cancerous tumor for so long before removal? I have 5 young kids and my son needs lifelong care from me... I'm so scared. Log in to post a reply",
