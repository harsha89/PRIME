As with many of you my wife's journey is too long to tell in brief.  I see everyone lists the therapies and other details of their conditions.  Is there a format to it or just list them and you format it?  I also do not see many husbands involved in these discussion groups or social media postings.  Am I just missing it or is it just taboo? I will post more later.",
