Haven't taken any Claritin yet - is that must or just a suggestion for possible SE? I too am a teacher. I'll be done with A/C before I go back. All four Taxol cycles will be during school. I do plan on working but will play it by ear. Have a great weekend ladies! Stay strong.",

What a mental mind game. I'm supposed to see the onc in the morning. Anyone have any idea what this might be? I'm so sad/mad.",

Still not sure what that means but now I have to see a cardiologist for more testing. My onc may change me from AC-T to TC. From what I've heard and read it seems like TC would be better. I know the A is more aggressive - but the long-term heart risk scares me. And it sounds more appealing to have 4 cycles every 3 weeks. Rather than 8 cycles every other week. Anyone have any opinions/ideas? I'm just so anxious to get moving! It was very hard to have today pass without a treatment I've been preparing so much for.",
