When I arrived, the tech had a question about which protocol to use since I'd had a mastectomy, so she called the radiologist on duty (not on site...at a different clinic). The breast radiologist was not there, and this radiologist refused to answer the question without me having a mammogram and ultrasound first (even though I'd had a mastectomy). To make a long story short, 2.5 hours of the techs, clinic director and this radiologist literally shouting back and forth, having to go back to my MO to cancel the MRI request, order an ultrasound and mammogram, have everything reapproved by insurance, they finally did mammogram, ultrasound, and MRI. The report came back with left and right reversed as far as where the problem area was, and the breast tissue came back as fatty.....I do not have breast tissue. The report from mammogram was copied and pasted and used for the ultrasound report too.So.....like any other occupation, there are bad apples. The clinic director where I was personally apologized, bought me lunch., etc. I did follow up with an immediate letter to the clinic director and breast radiologist, who both apologized (in the phone call, the exact words were, \"I'm sorry he got in a pissing contest with the other doctors\" which is exactly what happened......egos do get involved sometimes, as seems to have happened in your case). Despite that, it took 3 requests to have the report amended to reflect the correct breast. So.....what I would do, is what you did as far as taking your business elsewhere, but I would also write a letter/email to the Clinic director and ask for an explanation of what happened. Ask what provisions are in place to assure women are notified, as they should be by law in your state, that they have dense breast tissue, and I would also let the referring doctors know your experience. If they get more complaints, they may refer people elsewhere. Do know that 99% of radiologists are great. Sorry you found someone in the 1%, but it sounds like you're in good hands now.",

I am soooooooo hoping that the rest of you get your drains out very, very soon. I am running a low grade temp, but I probably overdid it today, so I will lay low tonight. I also had an appointment with a lady at the hospital who showed me a whole lot of wigs that would be lovely...on my grandmother. They just were not my style; hey were the type my grandma wore, and were gorgeous on her. They are just for someone more sophisticated than me. I did get a look at the hair color samples though, and that helped me to order a really cute one on line. I have naturally wavy, completely unruly hair which is in a ponytail 95% of the time. Any change will be big! I have always wanted to straighten and highlight it, so I got a wig in a style I've been to chicken to try on my real hair. I am excited to see it. I also bought some hats with hair, and just need to make sure I am not wearing one anywhere they will be playing the National Anthem. My nephew died in combat last year, so I am sensitive about people not removing their hats. The lady insisted I try on scarves and turbans. I just love the on others; they are so pretty; they just are so not me. It took me a while to convince her to stop showing me different ones. I told her I would feel more comfortable in a fire helmet over my bald head than in a scarf. I do worry about my wig blowing off in our windy winters, but I'll have to wear a hat then. Hoping everyone is having a good day,, that drains come out soon, and that everyone's pain is well managed.",

Lisa, I sooooooo hope your drain output keeps decreasing.  I seriously think of you every day!  Getting Fridays for chemo was a fluke, but I am really grateful  MO asked Wednesdays or Fridays...and I had to make an instant decision.  I added days in my head and figured out on Wednesdays, the second treatment would fall on the date of a HUGE event I am responsible for planning at work.  I immediately said Fridays!  I later realized how convenient it would be to have DH be around all weekend, and then have the kids at school when the worst side effects hit on days 3-5.  Sometimes things just work out.  As far as the intercourse question (I used to be a middle school health teacher...no question is off limits here!!!), I think you have to use condoms because some of the poisons...eh, I mean drugs that are so helpful to us in killing our cancer cells, could be transferred.  I'm not sure if I'll have the energy anyway...time will tell!!!! Poodlemum: I hope your issues resolve and your pain is under control. Babs and Pam:  Good to see you back! jbdayton: So sorry to hear about the radiation and the setbacks that will cause.  Uuuuugh.  This waiting game is just about the worst part of the ordeal.  I hope the time passes quickly, you heal nicely and that all goes complication free through the rads and final surgery. As for me, what a difference a week makes.  Last weekend I was weepy and throwing myself a pity party.  Today, I finally went out for a run (slow jog, but let's call it a run for the self-esteem boost).  I ran a mile, walked a mile, ran a mile, walked a mile, and ran the last mile.  It felt soooooooooo good!  I came home, showered, got the mail and one of my wigs finally came!!!!!!!!!!!!  It is a little blonder than I thought.  I did order it with blond highlights because I thought it would be a good way to find out if I'd like highlights to cover my gray when this is all said and done.  I think I just need to get used to it.  I put on a wig cap and showed my kids.  They LOVE it!  My youngest told me it was nicer than my real hair!  She speaks her mind and doesn't say things to be nice, so I think it must look decent.  I sent a picture to my DH and son, who aren't home, and both gave it a big thumbs up!  I've also had so many people tell me that they are coming out to the bar with me on Weednesday to celebrate my last hour with hair.  These aren't even people I told...they just heard through the grapevine and want to come for support.  Bad times just bring out the best in people, and I realize that all of these people are going to be there, and none of them care whether I have hair or not.  It means the world.  It's so nice to just be back in my happy place, and ready to hit this chemo! I hope everyone has an absolutely fabulous weekend!",

I sometimes think I should make a list of things to not say to someone who has cancer...\"stay positive\" would be high on that list. While we all try to stay positive, we have cancer!!!! This is not easy, and we all have our high highs and our low lows. Every time my mother tells me to \"treat it like you have a cold, and you will be fine\"...I think it is a good thing she is 900 miles away ( and she wonders why I do not want her to visit too often). I think I would offend almost all of my friends and family if I published it, so for now, I keep it on my iPad, so I remember it and do not say something on the list to others in the future. Thanks for sharing the article. When will you get answers on your chemo, and the plan moving forward? You and Lisa have had to go through so many delays, I feel for you both. I am hoping all moves forward for both of you with no more unexpected delays. Lisa, I hope you can get some answers and relief in regards to your pain. I also hope you can be put in touch with a LE specialist who can address the LE. And do not even worry about what they write on the ER form... they are just so dumb with what they write sometimes. My daughter once had a spot on her leg that was over 2 inches long that looked like a second degree burn...HUGE blister. But she had not burned herself. The doctor said maybe it was a bug, and wrote \"bug bite\" on the sheet. I happened to have her with me when I stopped at work later that day, and our medical director was there, took one look, and said, \"that is from a blister beetle\". Needless to say I have never been back to the initial doc, but seriously...bug bite??? I had a dermatologist write a similar thing for my son, who was referred for something. From our medical software, I know we have a very limited number of choices when writing a few things like that, and that's where some of those dumb things come from...some software designer with no medical knowledge. I am veering way off topic now...must be tired. Good night all!!!!!",

It has a different mechanism of action that all of the others. You deserve relief. You also deserve to have an easy time on Taxol, so I hope that one is easier for you. Wrenn, i hope you get some sleep! I am so glad to hear you are sill doing well. I ended up having to go to ER last night because I ran a temp...again. It is annoying because they could have drawn my labs earlier in the day before my temp got quite so high, and they chose not to. At any rate, the ER of course did all of their tests. The x-ray tech, bless her heart, had never seen tissue expanders. I wish I could have video taped her asking questions about what was in my chest, and trying to figure them out, if they were removable, etc. It was comical, and pretty entertaining, to be honest! Luckily between the Neulasta and the steroids, my counts were high, so I got to come home. It has taken them 4 rounds, but i think my Mo finally believes me when I tell him that I run a fever from days 3-10 after chemo. The prior response was, \"well, no that does not happen.\"",

I am just really excited that they are doing all of the surgeries at the same time. It took some serious negotiating to get that done. Don't ever be afraid to ask for what you want. I am also really happy that chemo does not seem to be in the plans... for now. They are going to do frozen sections of the areas they excise to check for cancer; just as they do with the lymph nodes. That way they will take only what they need. Mayo recommended that, so I got the doc here to agree to that. I absolutely love my new MO here, so all is falling into place nicely. Just an extra little surprise detour in the road.",

It was so nice to be back in uniform and be with the guys at work, even if just for a class. I am still waiting on my wigs to come. The guys from work and I all decided that next Wednesday is the day...I will shave my head. Pre-emptive strike because it will stress me out so much waiting that it'll make me pule. I need to not be worrying about it during chemo. One of the guys from work texted me tonight. It said, \"I can't wait until next week. We'll all be hungover and hairless together.\" Those guys rock! I won't be hungover since I do start chemo on Friday, but I plan to have a margarita to soften the blow (another reason I a doing it in advance). I am really, really hoping my wigs come in, and that they look nice. I realized at my son's cross country meet this afternoon, that it is the last meet I will attend with hair. Yikes. I did also order some bandanas and skull caps. I have a couple other softer workout caps fro Nike that one of the guys at work bought for me. Hopefully it'll feel good. I'll let you know when I do not have hair. Tomorrow, it will be back to the tomatoes...I have a ton of sauce to make! I wish you all lived nearby so I could give you some!",

I have taken detiled day by day noted, which is helpful in remembering what helped...and what didn't. I had terrible heartburn this morning, and it was helped if I held pressure and kind of squeezed my chest. Lo and behold, I had to reschedule one of my fills for today, and the extra pressure that exerted actually helped!!!! It seems so \"wrong\" that it almost made me laugh.

I am not exactly sure of my last chemo. That's kind of crazy. My MO originally scheduled me for 6 rounds, which would make January 3 my last. When he put me on that regimen, we did not have biopsy results back from my surgery to know that I was node negative, so he was being very aggressive. He also is involved in a clinical trial comparing 6 TC with AC+T, which I did not qualify for because my tumor was a tiny bit too small, so I think he threw me on 6 to see how people do on 6; I get the distinct impression he has had very fee people on this. 4 rounds is currently the standard in most cases. With 6, the dose is not decreased to spread it out over 6; it is just 2 more. I have been doing lots of reading...as always...on long term effects and such, and obviously, though small, the risk of things such as leukemia are present. To make a long story short, I have a very good friend who has had leukemia (and she died last night, so it is hard for me to type through the tears, sorry if this is error filled), and I wanted to know the risk benefit of 4 vs 6...at what point does any potential decrease in BC bring about an increase in other problems that outweigh the benefit? Being very strong estrogen and progesterone positive, clear margins with surgery, and node negative, I thought this was a valid question. Before I could even bring it up, the MO asked, \"you are doing 6 treatments right?\" I thought it was odd that he had not looked at the chart to know, but it did open up the discussion. I suggested running the oncotype test. If it comes back quite low, then we may stop at 4, which would make Nov 22 my last. Anything else, and we will likely go for 6, which would make Jan 3 my last. I am counting on January 3, so I dod not get my hopes up, but I will not know until I show up the day of chemo on the 22nd and meet with him. It is odd. He always seems to ask what I think we should do, and then he pretty much just agrees or disagrees...mostly agrees, and goes with it. On the 22, I will not tell him my opinion, I will ask him if his wife was sitting in this chair (I am the same age as my MO), what would he recommend? I want to do as much as necessary to decrease my odds of a recurrence! I have had awful heartburn, a lot of pain, a raw throat, and generally really annoying fatigue, but in the whole scheme of things, that is very minor, and I do know that my body has tolerated these well. The great thing with hats this time of the year up north...it is winter...everyone is wearing hats! Good day to all.",

Lisa, I make smoothies with ice, bananas, frozen pineapple, a little frozen spinach, oranges or mandarin oranges, apples, and some ice. No dairy...very soothing on the mouth and throat.  I have had better weekends. Yesterday I had the chills all day, and generally felt rotten. My temp gradually rose all day, and Ibuprofen did not make me feel better as it had all other days. In the evening, my temp rose beyond the point where you \"call anytime, anywhere, no ifs, ands, or buts.\" The on call doctor called me back in about 30 seconds, and had me go to the ER. My white counts were critically low, so they admitted me for some IV antibiotics. I will be here for a few days. I feel much better today and my fever is gone. There is no infection anywhere, which is great...no sinus infection, no pneumonia, no nothing. They just have to wait for my white counts to go up before they will send me home. They will give me Neupogen today. They have not given it or Neulasta at all; MO wanted to see how I would do without it. I think he may reevaluate that now! So for now I just wait for my bone marrow to kick it into high gear. Go marrow go!!! Enjoy the rest of your weekend! I feel really good today. I am just bored! ",

Every one of those curveballs bring with it a new set of decisions, and every medical professional feels they need to offer their opinions on those decisions. Those opinions often differ, and with doctors, sometimes their egos get in there too when we ask questions. It can lead to sooooo much uncertainty. I think you have done fabulous. As you think of concerns and questions, be sure to write the, down as soon as you think of them, so that all of the can be addressed. 10% is a huge reduction. Being on TC, I can say that my wounds have been slow to heal, so a little extra time to make sure you are healed and not at risk for further infection would probably be beneficial. These chemo drugs are strong. If the extra week or two of healing allows a few stray cancer cells to multiply, the TC will kill them. That's what it is there for. A week or 2 delay would be much better than none at all, and hopefully your MO will be able to see that. It will also give your whole body a chance to recover. I think if you are feeling healthy and stronger going in, your body will deal with the side effects of the chemo much better. (((HUGS))) There are no easy decisions, but you are plowing through this and I know you will continue to do so.",

One thing I have learned working with lots of doctors i. lots of different settings is that there are some doctors that have big egos. They are usually brilliant doctors, but they know it, and if something suggested does not fit into their perfect box, they do not go for it. That is why it is so important to do your own reasearch. At the end of the day, they go home to their family. We go home to deal with our wounds, side effects, etc, and ultimately we have to deal with them. I'll give some examples in my experience today below. I met with my MO today before my chemo ; the first thing I wanted to bring up was why he is doing 6 rounds instead of 4, and what the risk/benefit would be. The last round, I saw the physician's assistant, who could not answer any of my questions. His first question to me was, \"Are we doing 4 or 6 rounds with you?\" I resisted the urge to say 4! I said, \"you planned 6, but I would like to discuss it.\" I said that I felt like we did not have all of the available information necessary to make the decision since we did not do the oncotype. When we decided on 6, we did not know that my lymph nodes were all clear; pathology was not back yet. I suggested that I was thinking if it comes back low, we look closely at side effects to see if 4 or 6 would be better. If my side effects are not bad... meaning things like neuropathy, which could be permanent... then we could go-ahead with 6, but if I am getting more muscle weakness and neuropathy, we would look at 4 since that could be devastating to my career. I said if it comes back moderate or high, then we try hard to get all 6 in. He thought that sounded like a good plan!!!! The odd thing is I asked at chemo number 1 if we could do oncotype to decide 4 vs 6 and he said, no, \"we only use that to decide whether or not to do chemo, not to decide on the number.\" I am sure he does not remember that conversation, but I am glad that he is going for it. It is also interesting that initially he seemed against various vitamins and such, but each time I ask about a few more, he says, \"absolutely that will be fine.\" I did not mention that most of them I have already been taking :). I had read that chemo can contribute to osteoporosis, so I have been taking vitamin D and calcium recently (since I have been hypocalcemic in the past). I asked to see all of my blood work results today, so he showed me them...low and behold, my calcium numbers were low (which no one mentioned) but had come up. I asked about the low number, and he said, \"you ARE taking calcium and VitaminD aren't you?\". Um...no one told me to!!!!! I was glad I did it, but I did research it thoroughly first. Crazy appointment, but I came out much more confident.",

That means in less than 2 weeks, those AC infusions will be in the rear view mirror. I know the side effects will linger for longer, but glad that the end to that part is in sight for you. I am glad that your MO has a plan for you, and I hope the ginger helps. Wrenn, I had to take steroids the day before, the day of, and the day after chemo. That is the standard with TC. It is to help prevent swelling, among other things. It does make it hard to sleep though, so hopefully the ativan will help. Tomorrow night, you will be done with 1/4 of your infusions. Babs, great news about your infection clearing up. I am so glad to hear that. Poodlemum, I jope they can get your wounds under control. That sounds scary. Jo, I agree about the incredible support here. I do not know how I would have gotten through this with out everyone here. I was planning on 6TC because my gut feeling was that my oncotype was going to be high. It actually came back low, so when I showed up for my 4th TC, my MO said that 5 and 6 would give me no additional benefit, but would certainly do more harm. So Friday was my last chemo. I felt great Friday and Saturday. I even felt good this morning. Right now, I feel like I have a horrible case of the flu...typical day 4 for me...just came earlier. The neulasta is making me sore too. I have not taken anything yet, but will take some Advil before bed, which will help. We're in your pockets tomorrow, Wrenn. You've got this!",

I sometimes log on and find 3 pages of new posts! I have learned a lot there. Usually when I reply, it is with an update, or one of the questions that stuck in my head. With so many posts, it is hard to reply to them all. I do find people having similar concerns though, and have found the information very useful. By the end of this week, you will have one chemo down and will be that much closer to the finish line! I am so happy to have gotten one done.

Because I had such an early stage tumor with no lymph node involvement and a low oncotype last time, and treated it aggressively with BMX and chemo, followed by tamoxifen, they all kept saying the same thing...\"this should not have come back, these just don't come back, not this soon.\" The tumor pathology is different this time so none of them can say if it is a local recurrence or a new primary in the same spot. I don't think we'll ever know. I have a PET scan on Friday. Next Wednesday I have further excision of the area where the cancer was, to check the skin and muscle and make sure the margins are clear. They will do another sentinel node biopsy then as well. I then will be having my ovaries out. because I failed on Tamoxifen, I need to go on an AI. After a month to heal, I will begin radiation. Unless surgery shows spread or node involvement, or the PET scan shows something, they are not going to do chemo. That's the plan...for today. It seems to change every day!",

Though I hate the thought of chemo, my gut feeling has been from the start of this recurrence that chemo was needed or I'd be stage IV in 2 years...not a doubt in my mind...and my gut feeling has never in my life been wrong. So the positive node was actually a good thing in that it was my ticket to getting the treatment I know I need. Late Wednesday night, I sent a message to my MO and told him not to send out the Oncotype because my node was positive. Thursday night I got a message back from him saying they don' t know if it was a node, or residual tumor and they're sending it up to Mayo for testing. Residual is crap...my tumor was by my reconstructed nipple. The node/tumor/whateverthehellitis was high up in my axilla...over 6 inches away. So...MO did send initial tumor out for oncotype testing. Surgeon called Friday night to tell me that the other 13 nodes taken were all negative. He said no sentinel node was identified based on the injections, so he felt around and when he felt a hard area, he got it out. It was in the area of the nodes, but when tested, they could not find lymph tissue. So here I am almost a week later. I do not know if I have a positive node, a second tumor, what the ER/PR/HER2 is of this other thing, and no treatment plan.  I see BS tomorrow and have 12 questions (so far) on my list, including whether or not the margins are clear, whether or not the area between the tumors needs to be tested for microscopic areas of tumor (which is suggested based on my research), and whether or not there could be other areas. This new cancerous thing did not appear on ultrasound, MRI, CT, or PET...yet there it was. I can't help but wonder what else is lurking in there. I then see MO on Friday. I have been compiling research on Progesterone loss in local recurrence (means poor prognosis without aggressive care) as well as in multicentric tumors, which also indicate a more aggressive situation. Hopefully, I will be able to make my case for more aggressive care. Please pray my MO is on the same page as me. I am hoping to have the decision made even before the 2-3 week wait for the oncotype results.",

My theory with the stress of chemo was that I was not going to worry about what COULD come, I was just going to deal with what DOES come. That is much easier since most of the side effects listed do not happen to the majority of people. I also read about 100 blogs between the time I was diagnosed and the time of my surgery and the one thing I gathered from them was the importance of activity. That is why I told my self no matter how busy I am or how rotten I feel, I was going to at least walk. It has helped me immensely. I like to listen to music, so pretty much get lost in my music on my walks. I always feel better after my walk than before.

I have found myself sometimes following her negativity, but I honestly think one of the best things to come from this cancer was that I decided the negativity stops here. I've had such amazing support, and have had so many positive things come about. Some days I just have to look a little harder for them! Chemo 2 was as uneventful so gar as chemo1. I hope that continues. So far, just nasty taste, slimy tongue, and sore throat. I can deal with all of that. One thing I found very helpful is that I kept a journal last round every day about what my symptoms were. That is so nice to have this round as a reference, and was very helpful when meeting with the doctor today. I have already started it today for this round. Unfortunately I did not start it until day 2 last round and I forgot to note that the steroids make it impossible to sleep. It is very clearly noted next month to take Benedryl at night so I get more than an hour of sleep!!!!! I did that the other days 2-3 on steroids last time and it helped.

Love hearing such great news! Well, I did it. My goal before starting chemo was to be able to still do the Race for the Cure. I did it today in 31:32. I was really tired all week, so I was not sure I was going to be able to, so I was really glad to have made it. It was extremely emotional. I was not prepared for that. I am not sure if it was the 10,000 people there for one cause, if it was hormones, if it was because I was in pink and not white this year now being a \"survivor\", or what, but I had tears literally streaming down my face for the majority of the run. I am still not sure if they were happy tears, sad tears, sore leg tears, frustration over chemo tears, or what...probably all of those. I think my team raised close to $1,000, which is great since the only fundraising I did was one facebook post and an e-mail to about 10 friends! I am blessed to have such generous friends and family.

It is such a good distraction from all the cancer stuff. When I am at work doing this project or that, I don't even remember I have cancer! It just is not on my mind. My kids are handling it great. They all came in this morning. Apparently they woke DH up this morning by pummeling him with stuffed animals. They. then all made \"party\" pancakes. They made pancakes and could put whatever they want on them...sprinkles, chips, anything goes. I cannot imagine what the kitchen looks like. DH is a great cook, but not a good picker upper!!!! The girls have a swim meet this afternoon...just time trials, so they are texting me their times. :) I am thankful to feel good. I just need some neutrophils so I can go home. Hopefully Neupogen will do the trick!",

Wrenn - You are doing awesome and are such a positive force here.  I am glad that your meds are helping.  One foot in front of the other will get us all across the finish line. Jo - I will send you a PM with the info. So far so good for the chemo.  I had a long wait to see the MO first; they were way behind.  Then he forgot to sign the orders (we are all really good at waiting aren't we???), but once everything was finally squared away, all went fine.  I had a bit of a bad taste in my mouth, and the cytoxan made my nose feel weird, but they were both short lived.  I iced my hands and feet, chewed on ice, and wrapped my self in a blanket to stay warm!  I have not had any other side effects yet, and am hoping that continues, but I know that days 3-5 are worst and the low blood counts come a few days after that.  I hope everyone has a great weekend!",

Lisa -  I iced my hands and feet 15 minutes before, all during, and about 15 minutes after the Taxotere infusion.  It is supposed to help minimize peripheral neuropathy.  I am also taking vitamins B6 and B12 for that.  I really need to NOT have numb fingers when this is all said and done because of my job.  It also can help to reduce nail loss. My chemo nurse, when going over side effects, said \"good; I am glad to see you are already addressing and trying to prevent the neuropathy; I wish the doctors suggested that.\" (Of course I got the idea here and then did my own research).  I chewed ice to help prevent mouth sores.  The ice constricts your blood vessels to reduce the amount of drugs that get to those areas.  The chemo room itself was very chilly, and I am always cold, so I did bring a fleece blanket, and they had other blankets too. It is getting cooler in Iowa too.  My wig kept my head warm.  Outside, I have been wearing a halo wig and hat, which I really love.  It is really comfortable and warm, and it looks just like my previous hair.  My scar is healing a little better.  I go back to PS on Friday, which is near when my counts should be the lowest, so that will be a good time for him to evaluate it.  If it is going to get worse, it will by then, and we can address it.  it does seem like it is healing...just slowly. Also, the PICC line is a central line, that is placed in the upper arm.  It terminates in a large vein towards the heart, and is usually put in guided by ultrasound.  I do not know if it increases lymphedema risk or not. Wrenn-  I am having 6 TC treatments, each 3 weeks apart.  I am not sure why I am getting 6 instead of 4, other than it seems to be the standard with this doc (they actually do not use TC that much...I had to bring it up, and he did like the idea.  They are using it in a research trial here, comparing it head to head with AC-T, but on more aggressive/advanced tumors...that may be why their protocol is 6).  It seems that about 90% of the people on the TC thread are getting 4 rounds.  The day lasted longer than most others will.  I first had to meet with a person about a research study.  That was about 9:45.  They then drew blood.  I was supposed to see my doctor at 10:20, but it was much closer to 11, becasue they were behind.  I then went upstairs to chemo room.  The doctor had forgotten to sign the orders, so that resulted in more delays.  They then got the IV started and rain in steroids and antinausea drugs.  That took about 20 mintues.  They then started the Taxotere, which ran for about an hour 15 minutes, or an hour and a half.  The Cytoxan then ran for a half hour, though they said they somethimes slow that down and run it over 45 minutes...depends on the nurse.  They ran in about 50 cc of fluid after that, disconnected the IV, and I was on my way.  They did spend a little time at the beginning explaining the proceures and side effetcs, so future visits will be quicker.  I was on my way n=home at 2:15.  The best thing that has helped me mentally and physically is to get out on a walk every day.  It really clears my mind! I hope everyone is having a great weekend.",

Babs- I am sorry to hear about your sister-in-law. Wrenn- I am so glad to see you back!  I am happy that you found a new surgeon.  I hope you are on a better road to recovery and that you'll recover quickly.  The trial that ndgrrl may be referring to is one they were going to put me in comparing TCX6 vs AC-T.  I did not qualify for the trial because my tumor was 1m too small, but I am doing the TCX6.  Most people actually just do TCX4...wish I was doign that, but I'll just have to dig deep and get through those last 2 when the time comes. Poodlemum- I hope you are having a better day today!!! Honeybair- I hope you are getting some sleep! JennH8- It's good to see you back, though I am bummed for you that you need chemo.  I am also on TC.  I have TCX6 instead of 4, so you will start after me and finish before me!  I have had one treatment so far nad found the side effects to be manageable.  I have continued to walk 4-5 miles each day and have not had any vomiting. JennH8, Lisa, Wrenn, and anyone else who may do TC, there is a board on the chemo  boards called Starting TC February/March 2013.  Even though it says Feb/March, it has continued and just adds new people as we begin.  It has been a lifesaver as far as questions.  Come join! For me, I still have done pretty well.  I am feeling great one week out from chemo.  My biggest issues have been a raw throat which makes it a challenge to eat (though I can eat) and abdominal pain, which today also included blood in the urine.  I went for a urinalysis today to check for  a UTI.  I was supposed to call this afternoon to get results.  I called 2 hours ago and the nurse has not called me back...go figure.  One of the side effects of Cytoxan can be blood in the urine because of bladder damage, and I am more concerned about that than infection...but they did not even mention that!!!!  If they don't call me back, I'll probably call again on Monday to have a little chat about that.  I wish I had asked more assertively about it when I was there today, but I had not double checked my facts before I was there.  I actually was there to get a vaccine as part of a clinical trial, and discovered the blood in my urine while there...interesting timing...so I did not have time to do my \"research\".",

For the past 3 years, I have taken a supplement called Epicor because they offered it to city workers at half price. It is the first supplement I have ever taken; I am not an alternative medicine type of person. It is a yeast derivative. It is made in my city, and the story behind it is basically that there was a company that made a variety of products, and their insurance company noticed that workers at one of their plants were never sick. Their sick time was about 25% of the other plants. Long story short, they did a bunch of research and now make it. I would research it and clear it with your MO, like anything. I used to get pneumonia 3 or 4 times per year... had it bad once which put me at bigger risk for recurrence, and being a firefighter, I am exposed to lots of junk...anyway, the only time I have had pneumonia since taking it was once when my supply ran out. I am not getting Neulasta, and so far, so good...knocking wood!!! I usually kick a cold in about 2 or 3 days while taking it. I am hoping it keeps me healthy through chemo. We'll see. Time will tell.

At least they gave me a choice of weekends, so I could choose one towards the end of the cycle when I am feeling good.",

PS told me that he \"thinks\" the lumps are fat necrosis, but that since he can't know 100%, he thought it was a good idea to see BS (who I already had scheduled an appointment with as a routine follow-up).  BS also said that it is \"probably\" fat necrosis, but that it is in the area of the cancer, which means he is not going to wait on it for too long.  If it is still there in 3 weeks, I am to call him back for further tests.  He called it \"concerning\" but not \"alarming\".  I hate the waiting game.  I hate cancer.",

I am sorry you had to have them, but glad that you are on top of things and got this quick-growing beast removed. Lili, How are you doing? Wren, Feeling any better? Babs, Healing OK? Everyone else???? How's everyone doing????? I had follow up today with BS today about the lumps that came after fat grafting. He explained his rationale for not ordering ultrasound based on the fact that the fat cells in the lump would look like other fat cells on ultrasound. He first said that the lumps were fat necrosis and that the biopsy showed lipocytes. I politely corrected/questioned him (since I had asked for copy of my biopsy results and knew it said lymphocytes).  He did go and double check my biopsy results and said that they were in fact lymphocytes and not lipocytes, and said that since I am thin, maybe my lymph nodes are more on the surface. Um.....just on one side???!!!   He still did not see a value in an ultrasound, but said he would send a note to MO and have him make the final call. Moral of the story is if you do not have a copy of all of your biopsy results, get them in your hands!!!!! I now will have to work on MO to see if he'll order the ultrasound. I think he may do that. He'll see more value in having a baseline than the surgeon, who said we could always remove them if they are bothersome, but did say it was better to wait and see. I tried to explain that I was not wanting it to rule out anything now since the fine needle aspiration was negative, but so that we have a baseline, so if there are changes over the course of the next 6 months or so, we have something to which to compare it. Since there are several lumps, I do not trust my fingers to remember which are new and which are not. He thought we'd be able to.  He thought that based on my tumor stats and treatment, my risk of recurrence was really low. I wanted to scream...my risk of BC was even lower than that statistically, but here I am! I didn't...by that time I decided that I would see what MO has to say..................I think (hope) he will be more open minded to it, especially since his PA asked if he had ordered one previously..........I see him on Wednesday.  Wish me luck!",

This started about 2 weeks ago, and has been fine for several days, but it worries me that it is hitting so much earlier this time...yikes! I did talk with MO about 4 versus 6 treatments. 4 is standard for most, and I am node negative and he has me scheduled for 6. I just wanted some risk/benefit info on 4 vs 6. He agreed to order the oncotype on the tumor (at my request). If it comes back low, we will decide based on side effects if 4 or 6 would be best. if it comes back moderate or high, we will go for 6. That was my request and it sounded fine for him. That makes me much more confident that the treatment will be appropriate. I will not know the results until my next chemo day. I am planning on 6; if it ends up being less, then that will be an early Christmas present. I jope everyone is feeling well, healing well, and has a good weekend.",

I had multiple tumors my second time. I remember reading that the standard of care is to base treatment on the largest tumor. I also recall reading that many experts disagree because they feel, like one of your MOs, that it underestimates tumor load.

I am due to have my port put in March 31, and start chemo either the same day, or April 1. This is my second go-round with chemo. My Sept 13 chemo pals saw me through chemo with my sanity intact, and I recovered both my energy and strength and have run a few half marathons since then (I will remind myself of this over and over during the next 6 months). My Sept chemo crew are still some of my greatest friends. I hope our April gang can support each other in such a way. My cancer came back in February with a tiny lump where my first tumor was. Sine the excisional biopsy came back positive for cancer, they did further excision a few weeks later. In surgery, they found a second tumor, over 6 inches away from the first, hiding out in the soft tissue. Apparently my body likes to make cancer. This meant a second trip to the chemo bar. If it gives me lots more years with my 3 kids, I am all for it! So, April friends, sorry you have to be here, but since you're here, join us, tell us about yourself, and share what preparations you are making for chemo. I got my wig yesterday, and my coworkers and I are having shave-fest 2 on March 30. There will be good days and bad days, but more good than bad.

Be sure to suck on popsicles and/or ice 10 minutes before, the whole time during, and 10 minutes after AC. It can help prevent mouth and throat sores. Theprincess, if Zantac does not help the heartburn/sore throat, ask for Protonix (Pantaprazole), which is stronger. If it is beyond those, it may be a sore which has become infected. They will typically put you on an antibiotic, and often and antifungal too since thrush infection can happen in the throat during chemo and can be a challenge to get rid of. A local friend had that happen. lemonade, let MO know meds are not working. Maybe you need a different antibiotic. I sure hope it clears soon. I have labs this morning and appointment with MO immediately after. Hoping my counts are good. Considering how good I feel, I really think they will be good. Today is hydrate, hydrate, hydrate, hydrate, hydrate. It is getting to be sun tea season. I just bought a bunch of the huge tea bags for that...I got decaf ones. Hoping it tastes good to me this round. It's always such a crap shoot about what will taste good! ",

It took 4 days for my counts to rebound getting Neupogen every day while in the hospital. They hung at the same spot for 3 days and then skyrocketed up. Linda, Welcome! Sorry you have to join us. You have found a great group of gals to plow through this bumpy road with. Don't assume the worst with chemo. You may do very, very well. Life goes on during chemo. My mom had BC 20 years ago. Thankfully, she is a survivor. Meds have come so far since then. Assume you will do well. You seem to have a great MO who is on top of things. Perjeta is the newest thing for HER2 positive, and it has made a huge difference. Gingerchi, I hope they get your port issues resolved. How terribly frustrating. Arlene, great list. I do break a lot of those rules, but in general, I am very, very careful about what I eat, I drink a lot (including lots and lots of decaf tea), and exercise is my sanity saver. My neutrophil count was below where they wanted it, and below normal, but it was at the exact low cut off where they will stretch things to allow chemo. He thought about delaying it, but I pleaded and he agreed to go forward with it. Unfortunately he is off the week of my next chemo so I need to see someone else. I am bummed because that's when I will get instructions for Taxol, premeds, etc. I think I will just have to e-mail him all of my questions so I get his instructions and not the ones from the doc I see next time. Glad I get to continue on schedule with the AC. If I get a Taxol delayed, no big deal, but I want to get these ACs out of the way and move forward! Hoping my counts do not continue on their present free fall. Other than Neulasta and delaying or reducing the dosage, not much else to do! They are not reducing dosage this time either...glad about that. I hope everyone is having a good day.",

Yesterday I was exhausted...today (day 6) I worked in the garden for hours, littleblue, Look up hand foot syndrome. AC can cause burning. I ice my feet after every walk and run to help prevent it.

Order pizza and beer, and let others help...remember that people do want to help. clarm, thanks for checking in. The reminder that this is a temporary life detour is a good one that we all need to hear from time to time. Round 3 went pretty good for me last week. The IV fluids did help keep my BP from dropping quite as low. Thursday night through Saturday were my rougher days...queasier this time, and general blaah feeling. Not as bad as it could be, so thankful for that. Thankfully, I was still able to do education presentations at work, get to my kids' events, and get basic things done around the house. I was just more queasy and dog tired by the end of the day. I was lots better by Sunday though. I found out last night that DH is going to be out of town on the day of AC #4. But he never told me. I only found out when DD came home beaming about an award she won and a lunch ceremony the day of that chemo. I was beyond pissed that he did not tell me (I still am, as you can probably tell). I was able to move my chemo to 8 AM. My friend who is bringing me to chemo is dropping me at the lunch and another friend is bringing me home from the lunch. That friend will get my DD from school to the lunch (her daughter is going as well). It takes a village sometimes. It just irks me that DH never bothered to tell me he's going to be out of town, and that I had to make all of these arrangements on my own.  ",

Are you taking Claritan for the bone pain? It's recommended to take the day before Neulasta, the day of, and for several days after. I have spring allergies, so I just take it every day. When is your next chemo? You've found a great group of gals here.  Gingeel, I hope round 2 goes fine for you. I like feeling normal on my good days too!

Stool softeners, Metamucil, prunes, etc...I use them all and they seem to be effective during that first week. ksusan, Great job on the treadmill walk. Wow! thisizit, Glad the port insertion went well. Fran, You put into words how we all feel so eloquently! Rpayton, Ouch on the hemorrhoid! Agree we are superwomen. People have no idea. Lynne, What an exhausting day!!!!! Yes. Spell it out for him again. In writing if it works better. I think when I used the word cruel with my husband it finally hit home. Lemonade, No negative spirit brought. We all need to vent now and again and this is the place to do it. We all have good days and bad, and sometimes it helps to see when others are having bad days too, because you know that you're not alone in how you feel. And then you read about someone else's really good day and see that the good days are right around the corner. We're all here to pat each other on the back on the good days and accomplishments and carry each other through the storms. Littleblue, Men are just so clueless sometimes. Glad you are sleeping in your new house! Andrea, Hope your cold eases soon. I had shaved my hair, but the stubble really came out quickly about 15 days post first TC infusion. It was holding firm still on day 12, started a little more on day 13, but by 15, I came out quickly. A good cry every now and then helps. I hope you can get some rest without criticism from your husband. Busy day here. I have to work an education event at work at 11:30, so will get my walk/run (more walk than run) in before that, get my kids to/from their various events in the afternoon, make an early dinner, and then go to a 3 hour FD training tonight. Hoping I have energy for it all; I can tell my hemoglobin is slipping a bit lower. I've been trying to eat lots of iron rich foods hoping it might boost it a little bit. I am pretty sure the only thing it is boosting is my cholesterol! Wishing everyone a good day. It's hump day. Halfway through yet another week in this marathon called chemo. We're getting it done!",

Just a brief post here and there today.  I'm at work...nice way to spend Mother's Day (typed sarcastically). Just thankful to be healthy enough to work though.  Tomorrow is labs and visit with MO's PA; MO is off tomorrow.  I have never met his PA.  Praying lab results are good enough for chemo.  I want this last AC done and over and in my rearview mirror forever.  Hubby is gone most of next week and I have to prepare for and organize several events at work over the next 2 weeks, so I am praying #4 is kind to me and that I stay healthy.  I also have had some blood in my urine this week...as I did last round during the second week, so I will be glad it's my last Cytoxan.  It can occasionally be a side effect of that drug, and I vaguely remember having it in 2013 too. Littleblue, I like that song \"Don't Back Down\".  I also like \"Brave\" and also \"Roar\".  What other songs do you all like?  I do sometimes specifically listen to these when I need to hear them.  I also like \"It's Gonna be Okay\" because it was the first song I saw performed after I was re-diagnosed and was having a really down day.  I added the song posted last week to my playlist too.  I think I need to put those on a special playlist and name it kickass (for kicking cancer's ass).",

Days 1 and 2 were no different from any of my previous infusions, except for a little bit of the big D. I think I had that going in though, so it likely had nothing to do with chemo. Day 3 yesterday was fine in the morning. I did stuff around the house and got some programming stuff done at work. Around the middle of my infusion (2:00ish) I started to feel pretty rotten...just more nausea, exhaustion, low BP, low grade fever, and started getting back spasms from Neulasta). I did drag myself out for a 3 mile walk, and get my kids picked up, but then I pretty much crashed on the couch all night. Thankfully, for me, evenings are worst and days are good. I woke up this morning feeling fine. I have kept up with Zofran and have not had nausea today. I did a school program for a couple hours this morning and did an hour of shopping for a lunch thing at the FD tomorrow. I just got back from a 4 mile walk, and I still feel good. I think I was probably more dehydrated yesterday than I should have been; I did not keep up on fluids well; if I had, I might have felt better. So far, I do not feel at all like yesterday, so I am hoping I can feel good a bit longer today and that my days will be good all weekend. I can take a couple of bad evenings. I have always felt pretty much back to normal by Sunday, so iI am looking forward to the AC side effects being in my rearview mirror for good hear really, really soon! Andrea, Glad you enjoyed the concert. I love bits of normalcy in all of this!!! I am a U2 fan too! Addie, Zofran can cause headaches. Hopefully they found something that works for you that you can tolerate.",

I have gone to the store a few times now with just a ball cap. The hair loss is one of the toughest parts of this, and summer months are more challenging than winter months. I hope that you can find something that works for you. Praying your next AC is gentle on you. thisizit, you look fabulous! Love the wig and you are one of the lucky people who can totally rock the bald took too! (Not lucky to be bald, but lucky to have nice head and features to look totally awesome bald). We seem to have a lot of women in our April group that look great both bald and in the awesome wigs we've seemed to find... and the other cool hearwear too...guess we're just a fabulous bunch of gals.

Lynne, I think you need to sit down with your family, explain how it's going to be for the next next few months, and set some ground rules. I purposely made my parents leave before my first treatment because I wanted to get some firm routines established. When my folks are here, they let the kids do anything and they do not hold them accountable for anything. I knew from doing this before that I needed to get everyone in my family to pitch in. If your family does not help, then let DH know he can spring for someone to come in and clean for the next few months. One of the best things to come out of chemo last time was that my kids all now do all of their own laundry...and they continued to do so after treatment. I help them now and then, but they pretty much do it. If you need to have your MO talk to hubby, do it, but your family needs to get with the program and pitch in. Either that, or you need to stay in a motel and relax on your bad days. I am sorry you are having to deal with that. You do not need that additional stress.  I hope everyone who had chemo this week has minimal side effects. Everyone deserves to have a restful weekend.",

I am sure some side effects may come later, but right now all I have is fatigue (because I could not sleep last night due to steroids) and I developed a rash today...not bad; it looks like I got a sunburn, but I do not have a sunburn. mysunshine, please stick around and ask away anytime.

I also like to read inspirational quotes and listen to upbeat songs (which I do on my walks each day). A few hours after I got the diagnosis about my recurrence, I was still pretty much in shock/zombie mode about it all. I went to a show choir performance...my first one...my son was in show band. I got there late, but just in time to see my son's group. His group came out and the first song they sang was one from Glee \"You have More friends than you know.\" I had never seen Glee or heard the song before. All I know is the phrase muttered over and over in that first song was \"It's Gonna Be Okay. You have More Friends than You Know.\" I immediately took it as a sign that it is all going to be okay. I put that song on my phone, and I still listen to it every single day. If you've never heard the song before, search it; it's on Youtube.",

I am on Taxol now. No more \"yuk\" feeling that AC brought. I am exhausted...more than before, but that may be because I have not slept well for a couple nights, or it may be the cumulative fatigue...maybe a bit of both. I have a little bone pain today, but not bad enough that I've even taken Tylenol yet. I am also on day 4. Days 3 and 4 are usually worst on this, so if this is the worst for this round, it is not bad at all. Days 1 and 2 I noticed nothing at all. Littleblue, I was my wig in cold water with wig shampoo about every week or every 2...depending on how mu I've worn it. I was warned not to overwash it. As far as scalp care, I just use regular soap or a tiny bit of regular shampoo. When it annoys me and breaks out, I use some type of exfoliant...probably not recommended, but I hate the breakouts and it helps. ksusan, great response by your partner! Allicat, Karen, and sheshe, glad to see you back. I hope you all start feeling better. Stacy Mc, Welcome to Taxol. I hope all goes well for you on it. AJ, Congrats on finishing AC! Andrea, Your wig looks nice! Swissm, I haven't heard of anyone on kadcycla. Is it similar to herceptin? Rockerwife, I hope the extra shot does the trick. Vanmama, glad you could get your treatment in. gkodad, ask about dose dense versus weekly...the MO should be able to go over pros and cons of each with you. usually it is just personal preference of the doc. Mine did not give me a choice. Has anyone else had blood in their urine? My MO did a urinalysis a couple weeks back and it was clear except for the blood, but I can still tell there is some blood there. It looks like day 2 or 3 after AC because of color, but it is blood and not \"A\". I know it's from the Cytoxan which can cause bladder irritation...just hoping it goes away soon. I will ask MO at next appointment how long it usually lasts. It's not enough to be worrisome; I just want it to stop. All is fine here; I just wish I had more energy. I am exhausted and need my mojo back by 0700 tomorrow morning! ",

Rockerwife, love the pix!!!!!!!!!!!!! Andrea, I did well on TC. Side effects were more annoyances than anything horrible. I had some pain days 3-5, but took Ibuprofen which helped. I got a fuzzy tongue around the same time, and all food tasted like dirty gym socks mixed with pond water. Blah. I did exercise each day. The biggest problem for me was that my (former) MO refused to do Neulasta \"because I was young and healthy\" and would not even let me come in for a blood draw when my temp was borderline. I developed a neutropenic fever after round 3 and was hospitalized. Several of our April gals on Taxotere have had a similar experience. Taxotere is known for causing neutropenic fevers, so make sure you get Neupogen or Neulasta. You may have to advocate hard for it. A lot of us have learned the hard way how hard you must advocate for yourself. TC is very doable. You can do this!!!!!!! AJ, So glad you are doign well. You are 1/2 way done with AC! slv, I have always had a rough time falling asleep, so now the first week after infusions, I just sleep on the couch with my ceiling fan going to help ward off night sweats and something boring like the weather channel on TV. It distracts me just enough from all things cancer, that I sleep very well. Not sure it'd help, but thought I'd mention my quirky get some sleep method! Wishing everyone a great day. I am off to get my lymphedema sleeve redone. They measured terribly off last time and I can't even get it on. When she used rubber gloves to get it on, my hand turned blue. She tried telling me it would stretch out. Not a chance lady! Remeasure and make a new one! From there, I am headed to a local City park to take a nice walk. MO knows how much I like to walk and told me I HAD to get to this park this time of the year. Apparently it's beautiful. I am excited to check it out! For there, it is off for fluids. Good thing since my BP dumped a day early this time and is already very low. No time to be slowed up by low BP...I have kids' concert and track meets to get to! Thankful for my MO who so strongly pushes getting fluids and just generally cares about how I am doing!",

Take Claritan the day before, day of, and several days after Neulasta to prevent bone pain. TC usually causes little to no nausea. You can do this.",

Turn to page 45. Read the first sentence. It describes your life today.\" I never do those things. But I did. The sentence was \"He comprehended this slowly.\" So.... earlier today, after being totally mad at DH for not telling me he was going out of town on chemo day, I looked at his schedule at the fire department. He works full time at a college, but is on the FD part time. He was working there 3 nights next week (AC #4 week)...in addition to going out of town for a day and a half...basically was going to be gone all day and night all week. Suffice it to say I lost it. I sent him a scathing e-mail and then totally lost it on the phone...pretty much said it was disrespectful and cruel. Needless to say, he is at least cutting back on his hours and will make sure I know about future out of town trips, rather than just springing them on me. So when I read \"he comprehended this slowly\", I totally laughed for about the next 10 minutes. It totally summed up my morning. DH is a brilliant man, but sometimes lacks a little common sense and needs to be reminded that parenting and cancer are both team sports...not individual ones. Thankfully after laying into him and getting it off my chest and then a very long walk, I feel a thousand times better. Karen, I hope things turn the corner soon. Will your MO let you come in for fluids? It really did seem to help me a bit since my blood pressure seemed to plummet on days 3-6. Maybe you can call and ask. If not, I hope there is at least something worthwhile watching on TV to distract you from all things cancer. Feel better soon! Sue, I get those daily texts from a friend who lives far away. I know she means well and feels helpless, but I agree... while I appreciate knowing how much she cares, sometimes I don't always want to give a play by play. Asking the worst so far is really odd though. Who wants to focus on that??!! I think your response was spot on! ",

You look fabulous! I hope you are feeling a little better today and can get some rest this week. Alibeths, I hope all goes well on Friday. Lynne, Love the comment from your coworker...and the comments from friends and family who do not realize it's a wig...totally makes you more confident going to places like the store, etc knowing that you look like everyone else. My eyes have been tearing constantly through AC. I need to wear sunglasses more because of the light sensitivity. I keep forgetting. MO has reminded me. I think I will put them by my keys. Thanks for the reminder (I am horrible about wearing them). Fran, Glad your eye cleared up. Karen, Hope AC goes well on Friday. My eyes have been watery, but are not tender. Keep an eye on them and call MO if something does not seem right. Don't mess with your eyes. My MO checks my eyes at each visit, though his PA did not. ((((Little blue))))) I hope today is better. fmmbw, Are you feeling better with the new meds????? Sheshe, I did not know that photo was of you in the wig. I have to say, we all have the most awesome wigs. Everyone looks so great. There are so many wigs that look really \"wiggy\" and everyone's looks completely real. We just really know how to rock the wigs, ...and scarves, hats, and commando. Love, love, love the comments on the picture!!! Dizzyparkmom, I hope your counts stay good and fevers stay away this time. thisizit, Thrilled that you are doing so well. I had someone trim up my wig too, which I know really helps. It is much quicker in the shower these days...the wig is simple. My day so far: AC.....check. Awards luncheon with daughter (which took a village to get her there and me there...and creative chemo scheduling) ... check. 4 mile walk ... check. Vegging on the couch icing my feet (which I do after every walk to prevent hand foot syndrome)... in progress. I will post a picture of DD and I from the awards. it was windy, so my \"hair\" is a little messed up. Happy to move on to the next phase in 2 weeks.     ",

I can do some, but miss it on the days I can't. Allicat, so glad the folliculitis is clearing up. I am so very happy you can attend your son'sgraduation. Life may not be perfect during chemo, but it does go on, and we need to live and get to events and such when we can. So glad you can make it. Enjoy! ksusan, check...one more checked off and in the history books. Hoping you feel good in the coming days. Lynne, I do think things like phone headpieces and even glasses mess with wigs a bit. In time, you'll be able to feel the little tabs and know if it is in the right place. Mysunshine, I hope all goes well today. It is always so nice to get that first one behind you. My MO gave me antinausea meds in my premeds and then told me to take Zofran as soon as I got home. He the. said to set my phone alarm for every time I was due to take it. I have done that religiously and it has helped. Getting fluids now. Good thing because BP was low, low, low this morning. This is the second busiest week of the year for me as far as planning public education events. I have 2 big events I coordinate...one on Saturday and one on Wednesday. Once I get through Wednesday, my stress level will decrease tenfold!!!! I did make it t work for a few hours this morining, and will plod through the rain to get my walk in this afternoon. I actually kind of like walking in the rain ",

I am not planning a KCA 3 by the way...we are jus going to have a party every summer after this so we do not need cancer as an excuse to have a party. ksusan, Glad you are on the upswing! So I was looking closely in the mirror today and if you look closely...like really closely...like almost need a magnifying glass, you can see a little peach fuzz coming. It is about 1/16 inch long. Prior to today, any little hairsthat grew were dark (normal color) and would fall putonce 1/4 inch long. The peach fuzz means real hair will soon fill in. I know Taxol will keep it thin, and some may fall out again, but I did not have fuzz until 4-5 weeks post chemo last time. Excited to maybe be 12 weeks ahead of that. Happpy day!!",

I am a ponytail girl. I know that fresh fruits and veggies are not recommended during chemo. Right now those are the ONLY thing that tastes at all good, so I am eating some anyway, just washing them thoroughly. And after 5 years of trying, we finally were successfully able to grow blueberries. No one else was home when I picked a cup of them, so I ate them all myself. Yum!!! I'll share the next time I pick.

I've got a few other things in my pile too. Lynne, I hope you continue to feel better. Princess, I have not heard of that juice. Is it good?? Dizzparkmom, I hope AC #4 goes well. So glad you'll be done with that now. Addie, So glad you are feeling so good after Taxol #1. Hoping #2-12 go equally as well! Positive spirit, It's nice that you have 2 MOs that communicate. It shows they care more about you than their egos...and that is key! Sheshe, Hope you get results today! And I hope you get good news! So which chemosabes head to the chemo bar this week? I am there on Tuesday. I usually go early in the morning, but I switched to the afternoon this week to go when my friend goes. I've known her for several years and our daughters are good friends. She had a little abdominal pain in March, went to the doctor thinking she had a gallstone; they did an ultrasound and told her to call her husband...cancer all over her liver and spots on her lungs. How life can change in an instant. Her biopsy a few days later showed neuroendocrine tumors. She has chemo every 3 weeks. She was supposed to have 6 rounds. This is 6 of 6. They just told her that they may now do 7 or 8 rounds. I can't imagine how that is weighing on her. At any rate, we'll hang out together there. It's nice to see a familiar face there. ",

It's like a bad trip through a time tunnel of old injuries; I get to revisit them all...even ones I'd long since forgotten about! Luckily my pains do not last too long; the pain was much worse on Taxotere. The time after chemo is more stressful than the time during chemo. It is nice to stay in touch afterwards because we all do \"get it\". ksusam. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Raspberries! Bloody noses. Every day. That's the latest from my chemo grab bag.

Addie, The steroids help with nausea, so since they decreased them, you may need to hit the antinausea meds sooner. Staying ahead of the nausea is easier than catcing up. Hoping you have minima side effects; glad another one is done. Love the lei! Hoping for minimal side effects for everyone in the chair this week.

I have people ask me if chemo is just taking a pill each week. Working in the healthcare field, I forget that stuff I consider everyday knowledge is different from others. I also grew up with my mom having had cancer along with 3 other moms on our street (all but one have daughters who have cancer), so I guess I just grew up knowing what it's all about. Littleblue, Triggerfinger is when your finger \"locks\" in place or \"snaps or \"catches\" each time you bend or extend it. I like your idea of people should say! I had to get some things done at work this morning and I know it was obvious to others. One of the guys simply said, \"I'm headed out to do chores. I'm just going to say a prayer for you. A special prayer that your day gets better. I appreciated that. Woodburns, After TC, I developed carpal tunnel and cubital tunnel and a trigger finger, and have had to have all surgically corrected. I am apparently predisposed to it. They want to correct my other elbow too, but I think I'm done with surgeries for a while. AIs make people more susceptible to trigger fingers. Stacey, Do you get breast exams each time? My MO has not done one yet, but I came to him within days of my surgery. Lynne, I only get the \"You look good comments\" when wearing my wig. Apparently I look much better in my wig than my ball cap. I do know that, but I am all about comfort right now and not looking good. I like your comeback. RPayton, I hope everything works out at work. Mysunshine, the fatigue is definitely cumulative, especially as your blood counts drop. Your energy will return afterwards though. I've had a rough couple of days. It mostly is related to dreams, though today was a day everything that could go wrong this morning did (luckily my day improved). About 3 or 4 times in my life I have had really, really vivid dreams about health issues. Every time they have come true. When pregnant with my daughter, I had something called vasa previa. Unlike placenta previa, this is rare, and if you rupture and are not delivered within minutes your bay bleeds out. I had to fight to be admitted. I finally was, but kept having recurring dreams about rupturing. One night I had a really vivid one down to the doc who was present. The next night I ruptured and hemorrhaged (and that doc was present). Thankfully they did a crash c section in time. In 2013, about 2 months before found the lump, I started having dreams about BC.On the bright side, I signed up for AFLAC cancer care as a result of my dreams. I was diagnosed a few months later. In January of this year, I kept having recurring dreams of being back on chemo and doing AC then Taxol. Here I am. This week I started having recurring dreams about my funeral...down to who is there, where it is held, songs I had asked the pastor to have them play, etc. I have always had a sense that I was going to die young. I figured it'd be something at work or a freak accident until this BC stuff happened. I've always been able to picture in my mind my son and oldest daughter graduating, but I can never get a picture in my mind of my youngest graduating, which leads me to believe that I won't be around for that. I am hoping for the first time in my life that my vivid dreams do not come true. I would just like to see them all graduate. Anything beyond that is icing on the cake. Anyway, it's just made me sad. It will make me start writing some life tips for various life stages, etc for my kids. I have not told hubby or kids this and I will not tell them. I will watch the weather channel tonight when I go to bed. I am hoping the distraction will help me dream of something else. I try to live each day and not focus on recurring again, etc. I just wish I could make these dreams go away. On a brighter note, Taxol 5 was uneventful. My hemoglobin is on its way back down though, so I'm hoping that starts to come back up again; it does explain my fatigue the last 4 days.",

I am due to have my port put in March 31, and start chemo either the same day, or April 1. This is my second go-round with chemo. My Sept 13 chemo pals saw me through chemo with my sanity intact, and I recovered both my energy and strength and have run a few half marathons since then (I will remind myself of this over and over during the next 6 months). My Sept chemo crew are still some of my greatest friends. I hope our April gang can support each other in such a way. My cancer came back in February with a tiny lump where my first tumor was. Sine the excisional biopsy came back positive for cancer, they did further excision a few weeks later. In surgery, they found a second tumor, over 6 inches away from the first, hiding out in the soft tissue. Apparently my body likes to make cancer. This meant a second trip to the chemo bar. If it gives me lots more years with my 3 kids, I am all for it! So, April friends, sorry you have to be here, but since you're here, join us, tell us about yourself, and share what preparations you are making for chemo. I got my wig yesterday, and my coworkers and I are having shave-fest 2 on March 30. There will be good days and bad days, but more good than bad.

Today, a week later, I alternated running a mile and walking a mile for 10 miles. What a difference a week makes!!!!!! You WILL have more energy in a few days. I figure if I can do this now, I can just walk the last 3 miles next week, and poof...I'll be done! When I finish my hashtag shirt, I will post a picture.

It's just in the last year that some started adding carboplatin to the T on triple negatives. TC can be Taxotere and Cytoxan which is used in earlier stage cancers because it's considered a little less toxic. TC as in Taxotere Carboplatin is used with Herceptin when the docs want to avoid Adriamycin because Adriamycin and Herceptin can both affect the heart. The protocols vary place to place and honestly vary based on parts of the country. Different countries have different protocols too! Princess...uuugh. So sorry you had a reaction.

Best of luck to anyone else headed to the chemo bar for your cocktail today...one more in your rearview mirror! I am spending the day in my garage prepping for neighborhood garage sale.  House is so much easier to keep clean (cleaner anyway...it is never totally clean with 3 kids, a husband and a dog) without all of the excess clutter!  Just thankful that I feel good enough to participate in the garage sale this year; I was not sure I'd be able to!",

If counts are too low, it's cousin Neupogen is given, which does the same thing, but is not time released. Last weekend when I had my low, I was soooo afraid I would not feel better until chemo was over; I was thinking this is it. This is how I am going to feel fro the next 6 weeks. Then poof... I felt better within a day or 2 and was out for a my long walk/run with 5 days, feeling great. I am hoping you'll be feeling really good again really soon. SueH, Good question. The first of my new tumors was right at the spot of my original tumor. Even though the pathology had changed, it was still considered a recurrence. Then in my re-excision surgery they found a second one (SURPRISE) hiding up in the soft tissue near the pec muscle/armpit area, which was not visible on any of the imaging. There were no breast cells found by pathology at all on this second one, which left them all scratching their heads. They still do consider it a regional recurrence though. It's pathology was similar to, but not identical to the other recurrent tumor. Mt theory (which has no scientific basis, but is the only thing I can figure out) is that when they did the original vacuum biopsy in 2013, they were in and out of that tumor and jamming that needle all over the place. I am guessing as it passed through the cancer that it drug some cells with it to other areas. I think it left some right below the skin (recurrent spot number one) and up higher (recurrent spot number 2). That is the only way I can figure the cells got up there, with no cancer in between. Since I was node negative, I did not have radiation last time; that probably would have blasted them. I will be getting radiation this time to hopefully blast away any stragglers this time. godad, So odd that Taxol takes hair, yet hair starts to grow back while on Taxol. Bizarre. Littleblue, Boo on the beastly yeasties. Hope it clears quickly. Yay for the hair fuzz. The fine white fuzz comes before the \"real hair\" and once it comes, it tends to stick around. Princess, I hope those counts come up before Tuesday so you stay on schedule, and that the fevers stay away. ",

AC 4 hit me the hardest too, but after days 3-4 which were the hardest, I turned the corner and felt better and better each day. SueH, I am happy. I am tired, but not as exhausted as I thought I would be. Alternating walking and running, walking the uphills and running the downhills, and just doing it for fun made it really enjoyable. The cool teperatures and winds from the north helped too (the run goes north to south, so the wind was pushing me along the whole way!!!). Final time was 2:39.45.

It sounds like some thing they should know about. The house sounds exciting. When it comes to moving, you be the director in the director's chair pointing everyone to which room stuff goes in. Friends want to help...enlist all of them. I worked the night shift, but at my job, if we do not have calls, we can sleep after 9. We had a quiet night. I got paid to sleep all night. I love my coworkers. We all just banter back and forth, have fun, and it's just a really positive place. It is fun to go somewhere and completely forget about cancer...even if just for one night. Even if I am up on calls, I am taking care of others, which is a nice break from being taken care of. Mamajen, Keep an eye on those burning spots. Could be a mild case of hand/foot. I have been icing my feet every day after my walks to try to ward it off. Allicat, Love the pics!!!! What a special day with your daughter. You turned something which could be so negative into a very special memory. I think my night at work gave me a great moral boost. After church this morning I met a friend, who's been my running partner for the past year. Lately, we've just been meeting on the weekends. We walk on my chemo week, and alternate running and walking miles on my non chemo week. For some reason, I felt just great today. The plan was to run a mile, walk a mile, twice, and then walk an extra mile at the end for a total of 5. I felt so good, we just kept alternating running a mile and walking a mile for 8 miles! I have not gone that far since my half marathon in October. After 6 I told her I wanted to do 2 more, because I knew after more chemo, it will probably be 6 months or more before I can run that much again...I wanted to take advantage of feeling good while I do. I was also taking advantage of the 60 degrees and sunshine. It was a picture perfect day and I enjoyed every second of being outside. Tomorrow I have labs in the morning and see MO immediately after. I go for chemo Tuesday morning. I have been scheduling my chemo days with my friend Jenny who's been battling breast cancer. She is on her very last Taxol Tuesday and will be done. I made her some Oreo balls and will bring a balloon and flowers. I am soooooo happy for her. It reminds me that as frustrating as chemo is, it is also temporary. It is easier having gone through it before knowing that my energy did return, my hair did return, and life got back to a new normal. I am looking forward to that in a few months!!!!!  ",

My pain was not even bad enough to take Tylenol. My DH has some traveling to do this summer and I told him to go ahead and go. You do not get neulasta unless doing dose dense, so blood counts can be an issue with time. If they are, they give daily Neupogen. The further they fall, the worse you feel. My hemoglobin fell again, so that explains why I've been a bit more tired. Don't plan to be sick...plan to be well and feel good; you probably will feel good. Lynn, My premeds were similar.

It's much cooler than my wig, though a little itchy. My hair is still trying to make a comeback, but it'll be a month of 2 before there's more than fuzz there.

Lynn, Down towards the bottom of the discussion groups there is a type of freecycle where people offer wigs and headwraps. Our hospital also has bins of donated ones. Ask about that. My daughter gave me an Under Armour hat for running for Christmas last year, well before knowledge of my recurrence. It is soft and has elastic inside which makes it fit closer to my head and not blow off. This is important since I have a tiny head. That is what I wear for my daily walks and sometimes to work when not on calls. I love it. Alibeths, I am going for fluids tomorrow since my BP dropped so low last time. MO told me any other time I feel I want fluids to call him in the morning and he will schedule me for them the same day. He highly recommends going in for them a couple times and said it helps a lot. thisizit, Sorry about the Taxotere reaction. Take advantage of that steroid high while you can before the crash hits! Ferrovera, Welcome!!!!! So glad you've found us, but sorry you have to be here. In my Sept group, we had a gal from Australia, and 3 from Canada. I love hearing about the different treatments different places. I think side effects are similar no matter where you are. You've found a fabulous group of women to share this crazy journey with. Raise me up, I hope you are feeling good. Good luck with the shave. If you can shave it silly first or have friends over, sometimes that helps make a dreary occasion more fun. KSusan, I think things do get more challenging with time, but not always. I think the keys for me are walking every day...especially now that it is warmer out, and trying to keep as normal a routine as energy will allow. When I am just laying around on the couch, I can get depressed. I always feel better after a walk, even if I do not feel I have the energy for it. And if I have to lie down for a while, on these nice days, I try to pick a shady spot outside and do a crossword puzzle or something. Anything that distracts my mind from cancer. I worked for 6 hours this morning and the first time I thought of cancer was when my phone alarm went off for my Neulasta shot. That being said, we all have ups and downs and we are here for each other through it all. Some people just have a rougher time with side effects due to nothing they did or did not do. This is the place to vent. We get it. It helps venting here because once I've vented here, I typically feel much better and it keeps it from my family. Cancer takes away your control of so many things. I know my attitude is the one thing I can control, and staying as positive as I can really, really helps me through this crazy time. Though it seems time stands still, it is temporary. A May group has started. It seems like our April group just started. In that short amount of time, a June group will start and the first April gals (those doing 4 cycles) will be finishing, and we will cheer for each and every one as we finish this crazy phase. Allicat, I will definitely try to watch ESPN tonight. I had my 3rd AC yesterday. My chemo buddy (a friend I gave tons of advice to when diagnosed, and now in turn gave me lots of advice when I had a recurrence and started on her regimen...we scheduled our chemos at the same time) finished her 12th and final Taxol yesterday. It was such a happy day! I am feeling great so far and hoping it continues. I hope the IV fluids tomorrow prevent the BP plummeting I had last time. Wishign everyone a Wonderful Wednesday!!!!!",

Hoping for minimal side effects. Lynn, I am not good on links on my ipad. The BCO freecycle is in the Day to Day matters. section. Not sure what all is on there. Positive spirit, Love your fundraising idea of the shaving. A bunch of my coworkers shaved wit me...and my husband, and my son. It was a hoot. It was fun making such a rotten occasion int someting ositive and turningit int a good memory. mWe shaved mohawks first, and shaved some of the young guys into \"old man\" receding hair line haircuts first. It was a hoot! I think you will have great memories of your head shave. Littleblue, My MO ordered antinausea meds with my fluids. If I do not need them, he said just to tell the nurses. He encourages coming in for fluids often. That is a contrast to my former MO who did not have me come in even after I passed out. It is amazing how different MOs can be. Do not be afraid to be assertive and tell them you need it. I learned the need to advocate for myself the hard way. Renee, When my counts plummeted last time, I felt flu like and feverish. I do not know if it is the same with everyone, that was just my experience. Alibeths, I hope you are getting fluids often with that BP; if not, call MO soon!!!! Sue, I hope the CMF went well. I hope you are feeling good. Cheris and Pegsurri, Welcome! So glad you ladies have found us. Sorry Cherish that you have to do AC every third week due to Neulasta. I hope though that you can enjoy that extra feel good week, even though it extends things.",

I hope maybe you can have some good conversations about things. LittleBlue, Yahoooo for final chemo tomorrow! 4 weeks ago I posted about a gal who happened to sit next to me at her first chemo; she had been given horrow stories from a friend and was scared to death. I was worried when I did not see her 2 weeks ago (turns out she was there at a later time). When I walked in for labs, she hopped up and called my name from across the room! I was so happy to see her. We hung out again at chemo. She is doing really well, looks fabulous, and has an amazing wig!!!!! I was so glad to hear it and to see her! I'm not sure what some of the other patients think because she's a little loud in the chemo room, but she's a riot and brightens the place up. She's awesome and the chemo nurses love her too! It was so nice to see her all smiles instead of shaking in fear.  ",

It looks like you are doing things right with nice small meals. Littleblue, looking forward to that hike already! Love, love, love your powerful words. Thank you for sharing.

Allicat, Hope TC goes well with maximum cancer killing and minimum side effects...and no hospital visits. RPayton, Are you on TC? I had that with TC; felt like back labor. I have it a little less from Neulasta. Ibuprofen alleviates it for me. Not sure what you MO allows. Wishing you relief. Anewbeginning, carry case for meds is a good idea. My Zofran goes everywhere with me! Alibeths, Amazing how dogs just know and hang out with us... Lynn, Thanks for all of your work on the list! ajbenefield, how horrible that they messed up your anti-nausea meds. That'd better never happen again. Don't be afraid to be anal. I have a list of what I am supposed to get and I ask every time they hang something...what am I getting and how much. Stephmoen, Soooooooooooo glad to hear you are home!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I hope those counts keep on rising! fmmbw, Hoping you are still feeling good after TC#1. Glad it is done. The Princess, Glad your labs looked so good. Mine took a free fall this time! The day before I got my port (weeks ago), the lab tech drawing blood said something to me that I will share. She said, \"Make sure you know exactly what type of port you get and whether or not it takes Heparin or saline. Then tell every nurse and lab tech, and anyone who ever accesses it which kind it is and make sure you get the right thing.\" I heeded her advice, and yesterday was the third time I had to specifically say that my port takes Heparin...and then the nurse got it. I am so thankful for that caring lab tech, but am surprised that the nurses do not routinely always ask. The port can clot nad not work if you are not given the proper drugs. I wanted to pass that along so everyone else can do the same. I got fluids yesterday which has kept my BP up a bit more so far. Last night was pretty much my first \"yuk\" feeling night so far. For some reason, evenings are worse than days for me (probably more tired). Thankfully, I have felt much better today, have had a \"normal\" day (if there is such a thing) and am hopeful it will continue.  ",

I hope you start to turn the corner and feel better soon. Glad you have one more behind you. Lynn, Hope all went well at the chemo bar today. Glad your hubby could come with you. Love the pix! Hope that hair hangs on a little longer. I hope you are feeling good. Littleblue, We are much, much stronger than anyone not going through this will ever know. Most injuries heal with surgeries. Many cancers require chemo or a surgery, but little else. Very few illnesses require surgery, chemo, rads, more surgery, etc. This is a long journey and you have to be a heckofa tough cookie to handle it all...but we do. On the flip side, there are great treatments available and we have each other to share the journey with. A good friend has a neuroendocrine tumor in her liver (and bones) and there is literally no one anywhere around she can find who has had the same thing. As much as we share with each other, I know there are questions I can't answer and issues that are hers alone, and it is a very lonely journey. So we are strong, we are brave...no matter what side effects chemo dishes out, we show up next time. Once again, I am grateful to have each of you for support.  I have had no port pain; it only aches when seat belt is on it. It does stick way out though, because I am very thin. I know it is ugly, but it is summer and I will wear tank tops, and if someone does not like it, they can look the other way. I think a lot of experienced surgeons jerk things around a lot during port surgery. I had a new resident who went really, really slow. BS was right there with him, but I think he was so slow and gentle...more so than more experienced providers, that I had little to no pain afterwards. I think perhaps the surgeons need to slow down a bit and respect the healing process. I think surgeons in general tend to downplay the recovery process. ",

I obviously have a new MO who is fabulous, very specific on risks and side effects and wants to know about any side effect so he can help deal with them. What a difference. There is a clear note in my chart that I am never to see my previous MO.

Do keep an eye on it. Scarlett, If you do not have a fever nad are not feeling too sick, they will probably go ahead with infusion. Usually they like to stay on schedule if your counts are good and there's no fever. Gingee, I agree with Lynne, You look so gorgeous, Every time I see your picture I think you could be one of those Hollywood stars who rock that look. Gingerchi, I hope the tummy troubles go away! Stephmoen, Sounds like a good appointment! BAT, So glad to hear the tumor is responding. That makes it a little easier to show up to each infusion. Lynne, I take Zantac for heartburn and a stool softener as post chemo meds now. I only took Zofran once on Taxol. Princess, I never sleep well on infusion day because of the steroids. I have started cleaning binges and then I usually can fall asleep around midnight. Instead of lying there awake, at least I get something accomplished. gkodad, If I was given the option for dose dense, I absolutely would have taken it! Addie, How are you feeling???  All is good here. Pleased that round 4 has gone as well as rounds 1-3 so far. Of course, today is just day 2. Days 3-4 are the worse ones! I do get a rash on my face each week. I had 4 people today ask me how I got such a bad sunburn. Sigh...no sunburn...just Taxol. MO wanted to give me steroids, but I told him the steroid side effects would bug me more than the rash. He agreed to forego it if I promised to call if it got worse or spread. Deal! He also is allowing L Glutamine which I am grateful for. I asked about it in relation to preventing neuropathy. He said the jury is still out on that, but it can be helpful to reduce muscle pain and weakness with Taxol and gave me the green light for it. I don't see MO again for 3 weeks unless I have a problem. That's only one more week than normal, but it still makes me nervous...from week 4 to week 7...seems like a lot could happen in that time frame. I could have seen another doc at 2 weeks, but I like my MO much more. He's just out of town for the week. Luckily he or his really good nurse do respond to portal messages really quickly. Hoping I have zero issues in teh next 3 weeks to report! ",

Littleblue, Loss of hair has nothing to do with AC working. One of my friends did adriamycin as part of treatment for lymphoma. It was 5 months into 6 months of chemo before she lost her hair. The chemo nurses used to \"pull on her hair and try to peek for a wig because they couldn't believe it!!! Lynn, the wig is cute!!! I like it! Andrea, Glad you're feeling good. Hope the mouth sores go away! Well I've had a good day. I had to wait 75 minutes for the PA today (that was not good) but luckily I brought stuff with me to do, so it was a productive wait. My counts were all good!!! My neutrophils were even higher than last time. I was very worried they would continue to freefall. I was very glad!!! Then from the appointment I went to DD's school to distribute yearbooks. I put together the school's elementary yearbooks, so the kids all know me very well. When I walked into a 3rd grade classroom, one of the boys yelled, \"Hey, you got your haircut (actually the wig is a little longer than when I started chemo)\". I replied, my hair is a bit different now. He yelled, \"I LOVE it!\". That kid totally made my day. :) Since kids are notoriously honest, I left with a huge smile on my face knowing that at least to kids, I look okay! After DH's work picnic 2 weeks ago, he had several students ask why I had not lost my hair yet. My wig (in my profile pix) does not look too real to me, but to others it apparently passes the test. My only goal for the wig is to do things at work and do things like go to the store or to the kids' school and be able to just blend in. Most people who know me know I wear a wig. That's fine. I do like knowing I can just blend in though. Now to head out for my walk before DD get home.",

My mom had CMF in 1992 and she is 25 years cancer free, so I think it must be a pretty darn good regimen! Some places use it much more than others. I was only offered TC last time and this time AC+T was all I was offered. I knew it was considered the most aggressive, so there was not much choice or debate.",

They really do need to change their attitudes and practice. My (former) MO told me when I had some lumps develop that I was not at risk for recurrence and I should ignore the lump unless it went from a grape to a golfball. Needless to say I never went back. When I was seen by a different doctor there (my current MO...who is awesome), I made it very clear that former MO is never, ever to see or treat met. In fact, I told them that if he is on call some weekend and I have to be seen, I would go to another hospital before he would ever lay eyes on me again. It is written in my chart. Positive spirit, As for post chemo check ups, it's kind of frustrating to be honest. I would see MO every 3 months for a few visits and then every 6 months. I saw the breast surgeon every 6 months and then was scheduled about a year later. If you do not have BMX, you'll have mammograms and such, but other than that, there generally are no scans. After I had my fat grafting, I developed several lumps. These are what MO totally blew off. He would not even do an ultrasound to monitor if they were changing. There were so many, I could not tell if anything changed week to week or month to month. Once MO blew me off, I went for a second opinion at Mayo. They did an ultrasound and did a repeat one a few months later. The doc there, literally measured and tried to map all of the lumps, which though it did not help find my recurrence, did at least make me feel like someone would notice change. The first lump I found (recurrence) was at the site of the original tumor, was very superficial (as was my original one) and felt just like it did the first time. I happened to find it in the shower. BS sent me to PS to see if it was related to reconstruction. He thought it was since it is where he splits the pec muscle, but I insisted on a biopsy and am thankful I did. They found the second one at the time of my excisional surgery...it was amongst the other lumps that were previously ignored. It was very small and had not shown on MRI, etc. Once I am through chemo, rads, and such, I am going to ask for a clear plan on how they intend to assess those lumps and monitor them over time because I no longer want to hear that I am low risk for recurrence. Usually with breast cancer, they do not do routine scans, tumor markers, or anything which is kind of scary. You just have to be diligent about assessing for lumps and monitoring for any other unusual symptoms.",

I am not sure if counseling is an option or would help, but perhaps it would at least help make your needs known to him in the meantime with someone to guide the discussion. I am glad you are enjoying your vacation. ksusan, Love your gratitude list. BC does make me realize all I have to be grateful for. The support from friends near and afar definitely makes me feel loved and appreciated. gkodad, Wow you are talented!!!!! Do you have a website with your artwork, or do you sell it at art shows and such? Your picture is absolutely beautiful!!!!! We go to Venice, Florida every few years in the summer.

I notice a HUGE increase in hot flashes if I do not have my ceiling fan on. Georgie, So glad you are almost done with this phase, and glad to hear the chemo has worked so well. Princess, I am glad you had no reactions. Because I tend to get a rash on day 2, I get 20 mg decadron each time too (as well as 50 of Benedryl, and Zantac and Aloxi). I hope they find a reason fo ryour fevers, but am glad you could stay on schedule. ksusan, That amount of vitamin D does sound like a big jump. I do remember my family doctor last year telling me that she takes 4,000 a day. gkodad, I am so glad you were able to make it to your art class. I truly believe that continuing to do the things we love during this life detour makes it much more bearable. RPayton, I am so glad that you are okay. That crash sounds scary. Sorry that happened. I hope the vehicle can be repaired quickly. Mostly though, I am glad it is the vehicle in need of repair, and not you. Gingerchi, I know some people who have done AC then 3 weeks off then surgery then a month off then Taxol, so they had a long break between things. I hope that they get that infection cleared soon. It sounds painful and frustrating. Ankledolphin, you are soooooo close to being done with this phase...yahoo! I hope all the meetings with the surgeons go well. I have a crazy week this week and next between kids events and ton of work shifts. I'm hoping I stay healthy and have the energy for it all...so far, so good!

I like working part time because when I am home too much, all I seem to think about is cancer. Work gives me a good distraction and mental break. Working 80% may be too much. I don't remember if you are doing weekly taxol or dose dense. So far, I feel fine on the weekly, but I am definitely more tired days 3 and 4. I will let you know if that energy picks back up the other days. That being said,. I was so exhausted this morning I did not think I'd get in a run or a walk, but I just got back from an easy 5.5 miles...walked half ran half, alternating miles, and I feel better now than before I left. Maybe I just needed to get my blood moving. Rockerwife, Is the single shot Neulasta instead of Neupogen? Neulasta is higher dose and time release so it can cause quite a bit of pain...or maybe it's just all of the build up of he toxic crud. I hope teh pain eases. Positive spirit, you have quiet a bit of hair left! Hopefully the rest will fill in soon. Your scarf is very pretty. Addie, Enjoy the program in July.

For most women, insurance will not cover a baseline bone density scan until menopause. Then many doctors do a baseline as a routine check. For BC patients who will be on an AI, they typically will. Renee, Taxotere is known for water retention. Can't scroll back further on my phone. Today is the first of my 2 \"bad\" days I get each round.

It sticks so far out that you can see hte tiny dots through my skin. The nurses alwasy comment how they can see them and don't have to palpate for them...yep that it because it sticks out an inch from my bony body! Dizzypark, That is a long way to travel! It sounds like you have a fabulous MO though who's worth the travel. I've been working like crazy around the house today vacuuming, trimming shrubs, weeding, etc. since I will spend half of tomorrow at appointments and in the chair. Tomorrow is MO appointment and Taxol 2 of 12. The following week I just have labs and Taxol...no appointment, so it'll be a quicker day...which I think I'll like! I bought another ball cap yesterday. This one is florescent orange. It is nice because it has adjustable elastic to tighten it and has no huge \"hole\" in the back. I have a tiny head...even with hair, so bald, the hats are even smaller. I always worry they will blow off when it's windy. I think this brings my ballcap collection up to about 12! I HATE myself in short hair, so even when it grows back I will be wearing ballcaps for a year (or more).   ",

I guess I am wrong. I'll take taste and nosebleeds over neuropathy and lack of energy. Most of my bone pain is in my upper jaw too. I guess the Taxol likes to hang out in my face. I definitely think chemo aged me about 5 years last time. And it is aging me again. At the rate my cancer seems to like to grow, I may never reach old age, but I'll look like I did! Littleblue, I always have had a ton if questions for MO, but I found it harder to come up with a list for RO. I don't trust many of my bodily functions these days!!!!! Ksusan, I love your sense of humor! Positive spirit, it sound like the support groups were great. I agree on the alone time. Last time around, my mom came out for a couple weeks, and literally the only alone time I could get was if I locked myself in my room. I about lost my mind. Alone time is important. Who else is in the chair this week? What day???? I can't sleep thanks to the steroids, soan early walk is in my agenda. ",

Addie, Other than a little pain on day 4 and more fatigue, I would not know I got anything.  Don't stress about Taxol. Hopefully you'll have an easy time on it too.  None of that \"yuk\" feeling from AC. Off for walk #2 for the day.  Had kid events this morning and it is HOT here, so I am doing 2 shorter walks today. I hope everyone has a relaxing, healing weekend free of side effects.",

Last time around I never went to the store without a stocking cap (it was cold out) or my wig just fro that reason. This time with it being so hot, I often just wear a ball cap. I hate that people probably are staring or pointing things out like that. I much prefer to just blend in. Lynne, Taxol's bad days are also 3 and 4, but they are not as bad as AC...at least not for me. gko dad, I will keep you posted on my counts. I was excited when I saw MO last week and my white counts came up between rounds 1 and 2 of Taxol. He told me that I was in the \"honeymoon\" period. They have recovered from AC, but not hit the Taxol nadir (low point) of 20-21 days. He said they'll be good for a few weeks and then likely fall. If they get too low, they can use Neupogen. My MO has always been upfront, honest, and spot on about side effects...which I appreciate. (With my former MO, that was not the case). Here are my days on weekly Taxol...understanding that I have only had 2 rounds, and likely it'll get harder later... Day 1:feel fine, a little tired when I first get home due to Benedryl; I usually cannot sleep at night due to steroids. Day 2: I feel fine. Day 3: A bit more tired. Mild bone aches occasionally. Day 4: More tired. More bone aches, but it is sporatic and I have never even had to take a Tylenol...never even thought of taking one. Days 5-7: Fine, other than general chemo fatigue. My taste is a little \"off\", but not too bad. My hemoglobin has continued to drop. MO expects it to drop fo r2-3 more weeks nad then stabilize and gradually come up. Karen30: That definitely warrants a call to the doc, even over the weekend. The only time I felt the \"glass\" feeling was back in 2013 on chemo and I had developed a fissure secondary probably to a yesat infection and digestive issues combined. My Mo at the time did nothing so my OB wrote a script for a creme which was a steroid/antifungal. It cleared it up within a day. I saw her for routine appointment (scheduled months earler) just before chemo this time and she wrote me another one just in case. I have used it occasionally and it's helped. That may help with feeling like you are passing glass, but it would not address the abdominal pain. You need to make sure you do not have a blockage. Sorry you are going through that. Keep us posted on how you're doing. Littleblue, Glad the GI issues are clearing up; hopefully it was an ill-timed stomach bug. I hope the edema goes away too. After 2 years with my dinosaur iPhone 4, I finally got rid of it and upgraded to the 21st century. Chemo this week will be spent learning how to use it. I am a technological moron, so if I am at teh chemo bar, it should keep me from hurling it across the room in frustration when things don't go my way.  ",

Gingerchi, hope the echo goes well. My platelets are ok. MO seemed surprised they were so good. Glad Taxol went well. Addie, if your friends ask \"what can we do to help\" maybe organize a cleaning evening. Have friends over and everyone clean something for an hour, and then socialize for an hour.. They will have fun, they will feel like they are helping (which makes them feel good) and you get a girls night with friends and a clean house. Remember that people want to help. You will have many years to pay it forward, Andrea, glad things are going well now! I was at my daughters' swim meet tonight. I was the clerk of course, do my job was to line all of the kids up for their events. I just wore a ball cap and was expecting questions from younger kids since they speak their minds. Nope. None. That felt good.",

I have not had any drinks while on chemo, mostly because I would not be able to taste if. I rarely drink, but when I go, it is usually a Pina colada. SLV, glad you are down to 1 left. I hope the hemoglobin comes up do you have more energy. I ended up too busy yesterday to burn... Crazy day. I will add it when I burn my port. 25 days. My parents are visiting, which is nice, except that they treat me like an invalid and kept telling me what I should do, should eat, etc. they speak to me in a high pitched voice like they are talking to a toddler. I am trying to be patient. My BP typically goes up 20-40 points while they are here. My mom gasped when she saw me bald with just a hat on. I was just that way 2 years ago. I am not sure why it was such a shock. I will have to dig deep to be patient. Tomorrow is their anniversary and my brother is coming. That should help. ",

Let's hope so! Our practice sees weekly Taxol patients every other week. The week in between I still get blood work and the nurses take vitals. If the blood work comes back questionable, then they call the doc before chemo. Gingerchi, Hope you are feeling better! Gingeel, Ask your MO about the L Glutamine next time you see him/her. If you do a search on it, it's being studied to possibly help ward off neuropathy. MO says it can help reduce muscle cramps and pain as well. Dizzypark, I do understand about your parents. I love mine very, very much, but they drive me crazy during treatments. I do understand it must be hard to have your child go through this, but they treat me like I am 12. They live across the country. Last time they were here for a visit during chemo their 10 day visit turned into 22 days and I went bat shit crazy. I had no privacy...they did not leave except to go to the store, so unless I locked myself in my room or left the house, I had zero alone time. I understand the double edged sword of appreciating the help, but going crazy too. Be sure you get some alone time. KSusan, I am so sorry about your dad. So far day 3 this round is fine. i just got back from 6 miles alternating running and walking each mile. I felt good and would have gone further if I did not have to work in an hour. I am hoping the good continues. So far I think I have actually felt better and better each round...much less fatigue the further out from AC I am. 1/3 done with Taxol! ",

You seem to have a really good team in place. RPayton, hope you can sleep tonight despite the steroids.  ",

I am so sorry you have to be here, but we WILL carry each other through the good times and the bad. I had chemo in 2013 also and can assure you that though there will be bad days, there will be many more good than bad. The chemo nurses commented today that I was a rare person to come in with a smile and leave with a smile. I attributed it to having time to take a short walk between surgery and chemo....it was 70 degrees and sunny. I also had a friend who was having chemo at the samr time, so we had our own corner and had our own little party! I also attribute it to great preinfusion drugs. I went for. a 3 mile walk when I got home. I have minimal port pain and feel good. I know this will change, but for now, I will take it! Sprite, If you can get the desk assignment, it will be much better. You cannot control other people's homes and infection could be devastating. mel, enjoy your vacation! little blue, Yes, I am a firefighter/paramedic. I love my job and my FD family! Thanks for all of the nice comments. I let my daughters shave my hair into a mohawk and take lots of pictures. I made it my Facebook profile (and understand that a mohawk would be completely out of character for me, which made it more fun.) I then shaved it.

It is nicer to get things going and on the road to the finish line. Great list supernanny! Also look into Look Good, Feel Better... you can search for a program in your area. They go over make up techniques for cancer patients. You will come home with hundreds of dollars in free make up from top brand names. Allicat, you sound like you are going through a lot. I am sorry for all you are going through; how rotten of your friends. I am so glad you got out of the abusive relationship. You definitely need all things toxic out of your life. I hope your cancer center has support groups and such . You are well on your way with the yoga class. I hope you can find a job with flexible hours. I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. I am thankful that it hasn't yet. I went for 2 mile walk twice today, did some desk work at the FD for a couple hours, and got some housework done. I also gave myself the Neulasta shot and had an appointment with a lymphedema therapist. I know days 3-6 are usually worst, but I am thankful to have some great days. Today was not just a good day, it was a great day. I'll take any of those I can get!!!!! I changed my profile picture to my wig. I have 2 which are similar.

I think most do have a freezer. I alternated between sucking on the popsicles and chewing ice. So far no mouth sores (knocking wood). Hoping all goes well on Friday.  My mantra this time is that cancer is the enemy and chemo is my ally. I know I may need to be reminded of that in the months to come since there will likely be bad days.

Once I posted about them, I felt like a thousand pound weight was lifted from my shoulders. I really have not thought much about them since and my walks have been tear-free. Usually I am awake most of the night of my Taxol infusions, but my previous sleepless nights made me tired enough that I actually slept well last night. That also is probably why I feel a hundred times better today. I hope when everyone else is having a bad day, you vent as well. We all need to do that now and then and it sure did help. Thanks for being such great friends. If I had tried to share that with any of my friends locally, they would have totally freaked out. ksusan, It can be so stressful looking up carcinogens because everythign from the clothes we wear to the things are houses are built from to the containers we use to the makeup, deodorant, to about every food we eat is somehow linked by someone in some study somewhere to cancer. I have just decided that I eat a variety of healthy foods, I exercise, and I try to be aware of my body. And then I life life every day. Lynne, Last time they also had said no scans without symptoms. I was ok with that until he blew off my new lump. That's when I changed to an MO who pays attention. This one also does not do scans without symptoms, but the difference is that he takes symptoms seriously and does not blow them off like my last MO did. I think the key is that if you do develop a new symptom, do not let them discount it. Gingeel, You do not look like a freak. You are gorgeous. Kids are not used to seeing women without hair, so she was probably trying to process it. It would have been easier if she could have asked a question and not just stared though. If small children stare or ask, I just say that I am on a medicine that made my hair fall out, but that it will grow back soon, but for now I am enjoying the cool breeze on my head. If it's a girls, I usually add that my hair will grow back and be as pretty as yours again soon. It tends to break the ice and answer the questions that are swimming in their heads. RPayton, I hope those crazy Illinois storms stayed away from you! Little blue, I hoped the chin hairs would go away for good, but no luck. Not only do they seem to come back first, but they seem to grow the fastest. My fuzz is sticking around so far. I still look completely bald since the fuzz is white, but at least it hasn't snowed white fuzz on my clothes. So far, Taxol #5 is treating me no worse than 1-4. I'll take that. My hemoglobin, which had been climbing took a dive back into the mid 9s again. Hoping it goes back up next week. WBCs are good though, so I was happy. Today has been a good day. Glad because I work tonight from 6 PM-6 AM. I love my job because I love what I do. I also love that my coworkers do not care if I have long hair, short hair, no hair, cancer, no cancer...they treat me exactly the same, and when I am there, I never give cancer a second thought.",

I asked for as little sedation as possible to minimize the drugs in my system, and they complied. I am not freaked out at all by medical procedures though. When I was done, I went outside for a short walk because it was a sunny day. Then I headed up to chemo. I am a worrier and know I would have stressed every day worrying about when my hair would fall out; that's why I shaved it ahead of time both times. It did mean 2 less weeks of hair, but for me, it also meant 2 weeks of not worrying about it, and that is worth more than hair for an extra 2 weeks! It also gave me something to have control over. Hoping all goes as smoothly fro you as it did for me.  Today I went for my normal 3 mile walk...and then I ran for 1.5 miles. It was my first run since starting chemo. It felt good. I know I may not have many more as my counts fall, but it still felt good. Do realize that I use the term run loosely these days. If my body moves faster than a walk, it is considered a run.",

I have an orthopedic appointment Tuesday for my stupid toe. The bad thing about having it happen at work is that I have to do what they say, so I have to go to the ortho....because I don't already have enough appointments. So Tuesday will be ortho then labs then chemo. The day befoe I have my rads consult. I did e-mail my surgeon today to ask how I set up port removal.

I hope the appointment with the trainer goes well. slv, Glad you had a nice birthday. I also appreciate birthdays much more now; I used to dread them! I had my rads consult. I had met with the RO in March before they had decided on chemo, so today was the first time since then. They sent the PA this time instead of the RO. She gave me several things about the treatment plan that were different than he'd told me and she said it was because the nodes were negative. I asked when the plan changed and why it changed and asked to have it clarified with the RO before I left because I know you can only do rads once. The RO finally came in and it turned out that the plan had not changed. The PA just made some assumptions or read it wrong. I am not sure which, but it did irritate me. I was glad he came in though, because he said I could do the sim 10 days after the end of chemo which will allow rads to start exactly 2 weeks after chemo ends. The few days may not seem like a big deal, but early October is Fire Prevention Week, and I typically work 70+ hours that week. I'd like rads to be done by then. Tomorrow I have my orthopedic appointment to find out how long I have to wear this darn thing on my foot, and I'll be able to finally see my x ray. From there, I will go to the hospital for labs and chemo. It'll be Taxol #10!!!!! I know a lot of us are in the chemo bar tomorrow for our Taxol cocktail.   ",

Andrea, I am glad this down time for you is during the summer when you can enjoy it, rather than in the cold of winter! I hope they get their plan in place soon. Lynne, How cool that you know your RO! Sounds like she gave you nice details. I wish all of them did that. I hope your DD is feeling better. Darn toenails. I have not looked at mine in a week. Last I checked they were ok, but I know that can change! Littleblue, Get on Facebook...use an assumed name if you have to. We've been posting pix each week, but only the group can see them there, not the whole world!!! I've got some nice fuzz going on. Now the brows and lashes are another story. They have been gone for about 7-8 weeks with not a hint of growth in sight. Sigh. I have 2 more Taxols left. August 3 and August 11. I go for my rads planning on Aug 21, and will begin rads on or around Aug 25. Dizz, Glad the dogs are taken care of. I hope you have calm in the neighborhood now. Gingeel, I hope you are feeling better soon. My teeth ache sometimes too on Taxol. I figured I was the only one!!! Glad to know I am not alone in that, but sorry you are dealing with it too. I had a great lunch. We chatted for about 3 hours!!!!!!! Still feeling good overall. I have no numbness in my toes, but I do have a spot on my heel the size of a tennis ball that's numb. My tongue also gets numb for about 3-4 days the last few rounds and I feel like I slur my words! Thankfully these side effects are more annoyances than things that are horrible. For a while I was afraid that Taxol was affecting my vision, but then I realized I just needed to change out my contacts. I have disposables that I wear for 2 weeks at a time. ",

I felt like I should give it a trophy for holding on so long, but I was mad at it because it landed in my eye. Why do they have to go into your eye instead of falling elsewhere???",

I am surprised, and appalled honestly that once you had a neutropenic fever, they never gave you Neulasta or Neupogen in later rounds. Sepsis is nothing to mess with. I think you should ask for periodic blood work over the next few weeks so if your neutrophils trend downward, you can get Neupogen before a fever or infection set in. Neupogen doeswork, but it takes a few days to kick in. Most docs do not go scans afterward without reason, though I know some do. It is very frustrating and scary to forever pkay the wait and see game.",

Lots to catch up on; sorry if I mess anyone. ksusan, hope the port pain is better. Glad it was not more serious! melb44, There is a research study out now comparing AC-T vs TCX6. It is ongoing, so results will not be in for a while. It seems to vary geographically which is used, and also based on MO preference. TC does not have the potential for heart damage, which is why it is preferred by some. The risk of heart damage is low, but if you are hte one it happens to, it doesn't matter what the risk is. arlene, I hope tapering the steroids helps! fran, I am a Jersey girl too! I grew up in Vernon. I am in Iowa now, but I definitely still have my Jersey spirit. My family is still there. supernanny - I hope the Ativan helped the nausea.

It is amazing...frame it! You are beautiful, and you can just see the love in his eyes! I saw MO today for blood work. WBCs had dropped, but were all still within normal limits, so Neulasta did its job! Yahoo! Hemoglobin dropped below normal, but that was expected. It is not low enough to make me exhausted or cause shortness of breath. I am hoping it does not keep free falling at its current rate! Tomorrow is AC #2 for me. I am hydrating, hydrating, hydrating today! I am hoping nad praying to do as well as I did last time. I also have to say that the MO I had in 2013 was horrible. He minimized everything. Current MO is a rock star! What a difference. Wishing everyone a great day! Time for me to get out in the sunshine and go for a walk!",

Cancer really plays nasty tricks with your mind. Alibeths, I thankfully am able to drive home from chemo and do not feel any chemo fog. My days of exhaustion are Saturday and Sunday after my Tuesday infusion. I think that's when my counts drop the lowest and I get a low grade fever. Gingeel, It is frustrating that docs say different things. Some consider 2-3% not to be a benefit. When people are deciding to do chemo or not and would benefit 2-3%, they typically are told there's no benefit (though the risk-benefit may swing against chemo in these cases). I am not sure what percentage they consider to be of benefit when making these suggestions. The frustrating thing is that the research study that compared dose dense and weekly head to head did the dose dense for 6 weeks so that the time frame would be the same. Hence there was more neuropathy in that group...they got 6 full dose dense infusions so they got more total Taxol. In actuality the 12 weekly Taxol hit the dose dense total after 9 infusions, so they actually get more total drug and have the higher likelihood of neuropathy. The trade-off is that the doctors can monitor more closely for it and adjust the dosage as needed. I have never figured out why they were not compared head to head in their current form. My guess is that there may be a short term 2-3% benefit, but that the overall survival is still identical. Lynne, The next time a friend says \"what can I do\" reply that you would love a half hour of help in your garden followed by a half hour if just relaxing and visiting over some nice cold iced tea. You will appreciate the help and the visit and your friend will appreciate the opportunity to help. They will gain more out of it than you. Our friends do feel helpless and really want to know what to do. It is nice when they know to step up, but most only know that if they've been through something similar. Most do truly want to help though. Good luck to all headed to the chemo bar for your cocktail today. Wishing you maximum cancer killing and minimal collateral damage.",

When you are hungry from those steroids, eat, but just make healthy choices...especially since you probably can't taste the food anyway. Also don't drink your calories...drink water, decaf iced tea, etc rather than juices or soda. You can tackle the weight afterwards. I find that my daily walks actually give me energy. I tend to have more energy at the end of my walk than when I leave. They also are my \"me\" time and give me a mental break from everything. Just me and my music. Which reminds me.

It is great to hear you have such a great support system. I do too, and am so very grateful! melb, hope you get answers from your MO. allicat, So sorry you are in the hospital. Did you get Neulasta? I did not with my first few TC i fusions and landed in the hospital for a neutropenic fever too...was so frustrating. I hope they get that fever down, get your counts up, and get you feeling better and returning home soon. Gingerchi, the pain from Neulasta is usually within a day or 2 of it. Not everyone gets it. Keep taking Claritan! Glad you are able to ge some food in. My oldest daughter knows I like yogurt, and also fruit...and also that frozen things are soothing on my always sore throat. So...she spread yogurt on a tray, put a bunch of fruit in there and froze it. I just break pieces off for a snack. Yum!!!!!! Why hadn't I thought of that?! It's great! Positive spirit, That reaction must have been very scary! It sounds like your team is really on the ball, and addresses things quickly. I hope they gave you Emend beofre the \"A\". It also looks like they have great ammenities there for you. Fran, I think FEC is commonly used in Europe and sometimes places in Canada. It sounds like a really effective regimen. ",

Scarlett, Make sure MO is aware of how lightheaded you are. Fluids are your best friend to keep your blood pressure up, and be sure not to stand up too fast. Also make sure you are keeping your belly full...snack often if needed to make sure your blood sugar is good. I ran the 5K this morning. It was HOT. There is a heat advisory in effect. I was obviously much slower than last year, but I was glad I finished without walking (even though my \"run\" was not much faster than a walk at the end). I finished in 32:06. Last year they divided the ages 40-44 and 45-50. Since I just turned 45 a month ago, I was excited that I might have a chance to place in my age group since it's a small race. This year they had the age groups as 40-49. Boooooooooo!!!!! I was 5th in my age group instead of placing, which would have been a pretty proud moment considering the chemo and heat. Nevertheless, I am proud to have finished without walking and still finished in the top half of hte age group...which means the bottom half must have walked much of the race! My kids love running 5Ks, so I probably should find a few more for us to do. It does keep me motivated and push me. ",

Littleblue, I hope you are staying safe with all of the fires...and stay away from those bears! I love the scenery in your picture! ksusan, your hair is filling in so nicely! Mine is getting there. Last time I had a little circle of white on one side in the front. I have that same circle, but it has a friend now. The very front middle has a spot about the size of a quarter that's still white. Looks like I may have to color my hair for the first time...when I have enough to color. Thanks for posting the rads pictures. My friend who finished a couple weeks ago was black and peeling; glad to see it's not the norm. I did see her last week and it is healing nicely. That gave me hope even if it is bad! Gingeel, Glad you feel a bit better and had a nice day at the beach. Lynne, Sounds like a nice nigh tin Boston. Fun! I also just ordered one tube of Miaderm to see how it works. Andrea, How are the headaches? How did rads go? Rockerwife, Glad you're back in the classroom. Hooray for normalcy...whatever that is! gkodad, I feel like I have my own pharmacy too. I keep it all on my dresser since DH can't stand anything on the bathroom counters! Mamajencoz, Thanks for checking back in! Today should be your last chemo. Congrats!!!!!!! I had been alternating Mondays and Tuesdays. I'm so glad to not be in the chair today. My skin took a hit this last time and I look like a teenager with acne. Yuk! I am due for my yearly check up with the dermatologist soon anyway, so if it is not better, I'll make that appointment sooner rather than later! I just got a really nice note in the mail from MO. It was handwritten by him congratulating me on finishing with courage and grace and being a source of strength to others. It was really, really nice. There was a pewter pin enclosed with it, but it poked through the envelope and did not survive the mail, unfortunately. My MO is awesome. Soooooo much better than the last clown I had. I got rid of my boot today. So glad to have 2 normal shoes now! ",

I have a friend with stage 4 kidney cancer which has metastasized to the lungs. He has been stage 4 all 10 years I've known him...and he's still doing great(he's my boss at work) His philosophy is that new drugs just have to stay one step ahead of his cancer. So far, they have. SueH, I hope you can rest and that your energy recovers soon. #8...........CHECK! 8 down 4 to go! Very excited about that!

The tech said breast cancer patients that my doc treats generally get 180 or 200 per day for a total of 4,500 or 5,000. I am taking a picture each week of my chest to document changes week to week.

I was hoping for a November appointment. \"We have a cancellation for tomorrow.\" Blaah. This was my first week of no appointments in longer than I can remember! Oh well. Better to get checked. This Letrozole seems to give me acne, so going now is probably good. I do want to get the dermatologists's perspective on long term effects of rads on the skin. Anything else specific you all ask specific to this BC stuff and the meds we take? I also got a call today from the lady at the cancer center regarding the Survivorship program. My MO really likes his patients to go. They go over a summary of all of my treatments and talk about long term effects, things to look for, etc. I think if nothing else, it is nice to have another person to bounce questions off of. That appointment is in November. The worst of the rads burns are healed. Just a couple open areas left, and a still bright red boost area... That thankfully, is not too sore",

I have 2 friends here that had the DIEP, and they both have said that the hardest thing was walking hunched over the first couple weeks from the donor area surgery. Hoping you continue on this path to healing with no complications. I agree 1000% about the frustration of \"over-treating\" and not doing mammos young. They admit that they'll miss some. I guess that they consider those lives expendable. I think the people making the decisions against aggressive care are males sitting behind a computer screen looking at numbers and treating us as statistics. I agree with you. I prefer to be aggressive. I am well aware of the long term risks nad we're all sure aware of the short-term crap it puts us through, but we need to be able to make the best decisions for ourselves about our bodies.",

My Sept chemo crew are still some of my greatest friends. I hope our April gang can support each other in such a way. My cancer came back in February with a tiny lump where my first tumor was. Sine the excisional biopsy came back positive for cancer, they did further excision a few weeks later. In surgery, they found a second tumor, over 6 inches away from the first, hiding out in the soft tissue. Apparently my body likes to make cancer. This meant a second trip to the chemo bar. If it gives me lots more years with my 3 kids, I am all for it! So, April friends, sorry you have to be here, but since you're here, join us, tell us about yourself, and share what preparations you are making for chemo. I got my wig yesterday, and my coworkers and I are having shave-fest 2 on March 30. There will be good days and bad days, but more good than bad.

Before being diagnosed, I was beginning to think maybe I was getting too old for what I do and wondering if I fit in, etc. No one ever said or did anything to make me feel that way, it was my own insecurity. Having 20+ coworkers shave their head with me (both times) and constantly tell me how throughout both times how much they want me to return meant more than I can describe. It has also put me back in touch with some long lost friends. It has made me more of a compassionate person both at home and at work, and when friends are faced with things like this, I know better what to do to help. Being part of the Sept 13 chemo group and the March/April 2015 groups also is a bonus. Last fall several of my Sept 13 gals and I met in Vegas. We're meeting again a couple weeks. I've met several other places when some of us are traveling and happen to cross each others' paths. It's been great. I hope to meet some of you all in the future as well.",

I found my recovery to be easy, but I do bounce back easily from things. I knew going into surgery that I would not be able to use my arm muscles to get me out of the recliner (which is where they want you to sleep for a while) so I made sure I had strong abdominal muscles going in. That helped a ton!!!!!!!!! Anytiem in the weeks leading up to surgery I needed to get out of the recliner, I made sure to do so without using my arms or \"pushing off\". I just scooted up and used my legs...to \"practice\" what I would do after surgery. Before surgery, make sure all beds have clean sheets and that the house is vacuumed. Those are 2 jobs that will be tricky for a bit. Specific tips for surgery: If there are things you use often at home that are on high shelves, move them lower for a few weeks. Reaching up is not allowed for a few weeks. You will want some tops and PJs that you can either button up the front or just stand and pull up. Yep\u2026I went to Kohls and tried things on right in the aisle\u2026if I could easily pull the shirts on over my clothes, I knew I could do it after surgery with no clothes. I am sure I was a spectacle, but it worked. As for the bras, I wore the super stretchy, cheap Walmart ones because I could pull them on easily and then used 2 or 3 of the padding things to make it look like I had a little chest. I used less and less of these as I had fills. Drains: Blaaaaaah. Mostly, I wore inside out sweatshirt jackets (hoodies) and tucked them in the pockets. It was like revisiting the 1980s in the Flashdance era! That was the easiest for me. Even in August, I kept the AC low enough to be able to wear them like that. I do have a hoodie that I cut the sleeves off of so I could attend an outdoor event. I went to work, the store, a triathlon (watched) with thousands of people there. No one knew I was hauling around drains in my pockets. Stock up on 4X4s and gentle tape. They will give you some gauze pads, but it was not enough. The tape, which never gave me rashes before, gave me rashes which seems to be pretty common then, so find the gentlest one you can. Pain meds: The first 2 days I set my phone alarm to go off anytime I was due for pain meds and antibiotics to stay on top of them. I did not need the narcotic meds after that; just Advil. I was lucky though; most people need then more. I just lived in my recliner and kept ice applied very often. Pain meds can cause constipation. I ate oatmeal, and a ton of fruit in the hospital and at home and it was not an issue. I think it would have been painful if it was. I think I did take stool softeners too. The surgery meds and pain meds can cause dry mouth. Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash both helped.  I hope at least some of those are helpful!",

I have not told my kids, though they are perceptive and know something's up. I also have not told my parents because my mom's mastectomy is on Thursday. Here's what I posted on Facebook, for anyone no ton there. The biopsy took much longer than I expected; just because they did the whole thing where they make a tiny incision, put the catheter in, etc (core biopsy). I thought it would be poke it and go home (Fine needle aspiration). I was there 90 minutes. She said she got 2 good chunks, so she should have plenty. She did not make any predictions (nor did I ask for any), and just said she'd pray for good results. That was a little disconcerting, but I am guessing she says that to everyone. I should have the results tomorrow, unless they have to do additional staining; then it would be Thursday. Now the real waiting begins.  I did kind of get a worrisome vibe from her, I have to be honest. On the other hand, she knows I was told that they (surgeon, not radiologist) were 99% certain it was scar tissue in February, and were wrong, so I would not anticipate her trying to predict anything or give me any vibe. Trying to prepare for the worst, but hope for the best. What will be, will be, and I'll just have to put one foot in front of the other.",

My white count was low, which it wasn't last time. I know that's common after chemo, and he said not to be surprised if that just becomes my new norm. We had really good conversations about how things are going with me, my mom's cancer, genetics, life in general. My MO is just fabulous; he most kind, caring doc I have ever met. I return in 3 months. I will see BS, then my MO, and then they'll schedule an MRI. The area where my tumors have been has been really lumpy ever since fat grafting in 2014, so this will allow us to have a baseline for when new things pop up since my body likes to make lumps. My gyn appointment is the 25th.  KSusan, Your RO sounds great! Mine seemed to think patient contact was an interruption in his physics-filled day. He was brilliant but had zero rapport or communication skills. ",

Glad to hear it's emu fat! 2 down, lots to go. I counted 7 different zaps today (if I counted right). They ranged in timing from about 5 seconds to 25-30 seconds. 3 were without the bolus (1 had some special attachment on the end of the machine; I think it is some sort of beam modifier) and 4 with the bolus. If I get 30, which is what the original plan was (though it is subject to change), then I am 1/15 done. Monday is my day for appointments.

It is annoying nonetheless. Dizz, You absolutely, positively need to write a letter and document exactly what she said. It was rude and uncalled for. In addition to an attitude adjustment, she needs education on reconstruction. I admit before BC, I had no idea about reconstruction, so she likely does not, but someone working in her position, with s mouth as big as hers needs the education. You will be doing all future patients a favor by writing a letter or asking to see the director when you're there tomorrow. You should mention it to every tech you see tomorrow as well as the radiologist. You deserve an apology.When I had my ultrasound, they did still have me do a mammogram; they just cannot squish very hard or do multiple views.",

I think I might be kicking around a UTI, so if I still feel that way next week, I will go to my family doc and ask her to draw labs while I am there. I also have those moments just as you describe. I watch my kids do something and wonder if I will be there to see their events in a couple years. It about takes my breath away when I have thoughts such as that. Addie, how are you feeling? I completed 15 of 30 rads today. I am definitely feeling more tired. My skin is holding up ok.

The same thing can happen when people bear down hard to have a bowel movement (we actually get a lot of EMS calls for this because people pass out from it). So it should not happen again. They probably gave you stuff to speed up your heart which then put it into overdrive for a bit. Sounds really scary! Glad all is okay and that you still have your echo for reassurance; especially with a family cardiac history. How frustrating that the scheduler was not there. It's all on computers. Surely someone else could have scheduled it for you. Neulasta helps with white blood cells. If your mouth sores got infected, it's teh only way it would help. Sucking popsicles nad ice helps to prevent mouth sores. 10 minutes before the \"A\", all during, and 10 minutes after.

I also tend to have blood in my urine since then which worsened this time around. My MO is testing my urine in Oct and will refer me to a urologist if blood is still present Ksusan, sounds like a good visit other than the toilet mishap. Interesting PA would assume fat necrosis; did you have fat grafting? I thought that is when it usually occurs. GKO, We'll be finishing rads about the same time. I like to divide it up the same way. Little blue, I shaved my facial fuzz twice and it has not returned...thankfully!!! ",

Mine said tea is fine, especially decaf. I drink a cup of regular tea in the morning, and thenprbably 3 or 4 decaf teas later in the day...sometimes hot tea, sometimes iced tea depending on the weather. It is one of the few fluids that appeals to me!!!! I do limit my green tea to a few each week since I have heard that antioxidants are not recommended during chemo. My MO pretty much says anything like that in moderation is pretty much ok...just don't overdo it. I love his common sense approach to things. Lynn, I hope all goes well tomorrow. Assure your daughter that sleepovers are ok in a few weeks, you just need timeto adjust. However if she wants to go to a friends house..... My kids have had sleepovers here, but the basement is their domain then, it's pizza for dinner, and something equally simple for breakfast. Kids are adaptable...sometimes it just takes time. Lol, no wonderwoman here. Just enjoying any and every feel good day I am lucky enough to have. And when I am busy, I do not think about cancer, and I feel normal for a while. And feeling normal is good",

Little blue, I am also sick of this rads stuff, feeling like a turkey at Thanksgiving. I look at that linear accelerator as a medieval yorture device. It'd better be killing any cancer cells left behind. I think what irks me the most is the PA going over side effects saying \"you might get a little pink; like a minor sunburn.\" I knew better from others but I do not know how they can lie and not say that some people will get a minor sunburn and others will have more severe skin effects",

This burning alive crap is for the birds. We don't even do that to birds. We at least kill them before we cook them. I suppose their goal is to keep me alive though, and for that I am grateful.

All of my CBC bloodwork was within normal limits. It's funny looking at the results because they look so high after seeing such low ones for months!!! The other bloodwork which measures liver function and such always takes 24 hours. I am not worried about that though. I asked about thyroid testing in the future once per year since radiation to the neck is associated with increased rates of thyroid cancer. He said we can run those blood tests, and he also will address my concerns about lumps I had previously under my pec muscle (which is where one of my tumors recurred). He addressed everything and we have a plan for everything. He also reffered me to a urologist for the blood in my urine, which tested positive again today. My MO is truly the most caring doctor I have every had for anything in my life. I am lucky he's my doc.",

I can get bandages to stay put on the other areas, so it is not as sore as the axilla was, and the bandages stayed put during my run today. What this means is that I am going to run/walk the Des Monies half marathon on Sunday. I am doing it with a friend who is the wife of a coworker. She has done it for years and did not really get in shape this year so she was not going to do it. At the last minute, she wanted to, so she thought running/walking would be a good idea. I may be slow, but I will finish. I decided I needed to dot the i's and cross the t's on Finished Treatment...basically it's my way of saying F*** You cancer.

At this point, I wish the few overachieves left behind would just go; I'll be happy to see them back when chemo is done, but for now, the few stragglers bug me! Enjoy seeing that first born!!!!! How exciting! Princess, My MO is very aggressive about heartburn meds too. He told me before AC started that it would cause serious heartburn and made sure I had meds to treat it. Karen, Glad you got to skip the decadron. I was thrilled to hear my MO does not use it (other than premeds) unless needed for nausea. I'll take nausea over the jitters and steroid crash! SueH, Sounds like your hubby is a keeper! Fran, I'd have been so mad about the party comment too. I hope you got it resolved without having to change plans. ksusan, Sounds like you have understanding loved ones. Positive spirit, my leg hair is 90% gone. Just enough left to have to occasionally shave. I wish the other 10% would go away and stay away. melb, Scary about that port!!! If it is a power port, ask every single person who accesses it if they are using heparin. If they forget, it could clot. I am surprised at how many times already I have had to remind nurses. I hope the injections are working. The paramedic in me has to add that if you have ANY chest pain or shortness of breath while you have that clot, to call MO or go to ER immediately and make sure they know about the clot. Greenae, hope #3 goes well! Stephmoen, What great news that your tumor shrank so much already!!!I hope the Neulasta does it's job. Sounds like your hubby and son are really sensitive to your needs; that's fabulous! I feel really blessed by great friends who keep me fed, help shuttle kids when needed, etc. There are few positives to cancer, but one is seeing how many people care. Lemonade, I am so surprised you are no tin the hospital. I hope your MO is keeping a close eye on you! fmmbw, The pancreatitis on top of BC must be horrible. I hope the fluids help next time. They did seem to help me a little this time around and I will get them next time as well. Luckily 99% of the time DH is very supportive and helpful. He just needs a little reminder every now and then when he gets so wrapped up in work that he loses sight of everything else. He got his reminder this week, so he's been great ever since. My kiddos are very independent and self sufficient which helps too. The best thing I ever did was teach them how to do their own laundry! I am enjoying my last few good days before my last AC next week. I got a good run in today (I do use the word run loosely...if it is faster than a walk, it is a run), had a great training last night at work, and am working quite a few on call and duty shifts over the next few days. I do love the few days of relative normalcy. ",

I would drink protein drinks, make yogurt and fruit smoothies, freeze some of the smoothies into popsicles, eat soup, and anything else you can. I would ask the MO and pharmacist for liquid medications; many are available in liquid form; it just needs to be prescribed that way. Hoping for relief for you soon. stephmoen, glad the temp is down. Andrea, Hope you can get some rest after your busy weekend. Lemonade, hope you keep recovering. I did call MO on Friday. They did a urinalysis which showed blood in urine but no infection, so I've been guzzling cranberry juice. Thankfully tart beverages are my beverage of choice right now, though that'll change with #4 soon...always seems to have me craving odd things. Little blue, how are you feeling? How's everyone doing???? How about a Monday check-in???!!! I am headed to see MO's PA this morning for blood work and check up before tomorrow's chemo.. Last time my neutrophils were borderline, so thinking thoughts of lots of neutrophils so nothing is delayed. I want nothing more than to kiss the red devil goodbye tomorrow. I want nooooooooooooooo delays! ",

Even though I go Wednesdsy, they will need to do a biopsy because of my history of my last lump. That means longer for answers. Hoping they can needle it so I can have answers sooner. My mom let me know that her doc heard from the company that did the genetic testing. They are doing a family study on us. Her doc is sending her the info to send me (quite the process). I asked her to scan and email when she gets them so I can get them turned in to my docs while I am there this week. I want those answers soon too. This year began with a lot of bad news.

I think it is much easier mentally once you have your plan in place. I hate being in limbo just waiting. Before my recurrence, I was a mentor to 3 local gals going through chemo. 2 of the 3 sailed through and were anle to work pretty much all of the way through. The third has taken more time off. I was able to work from home and work flexible hours during chemo last time, and it really helped a lot. I enjoyed being able to work because the boredom at home drove me crazy.

My MO is thinking of Prolia too because it shows to significantly decrease the risk of bone mets. Renee, Glad the upper and lower GI are cancer free, but the uncertainty of celiac must be frustrating. I hope it comes back that you don't have that. 3 days until biopsy. I was doing great for the last few days, but my anxiety is ramping up the closer it gets. I am not anxious for the procedure......just the results. I am very, very glad I opted to have it because the more I research, the more I see any scar changes should be biopsied since they can't be reliably interpreted via ultrasound. Glad I am being proactive, no matter what the result. Really, I just want to get off of this roller coaster of uncertainty and move forward either way. I do not enjoy limboland one bit!!! Tomorrow should be a pretty busy day. Monday is not, but I'll try to busy myself and then Tuesday morning will finally arrive. I am pretty sure Tuesday will feel like it has about 240 hours instead of 24...that wait for results, as you all know, will NOT be fun. I did look back at the calendar from 2013 to check how long it took for biopsy results and it was 1 business day. I got that call in the morning, so Wednesday morning will be the time I should hopefully know. I am glad I'll (hopefully) be off the ledge in time for the holidays.",

Round 4 was my worst too, but I am happy to report that once I snapped out of it and felt better, I felt MUCH better. This week is EMS Week so I was in charge of organizung an educational open house attended by about 500-700 people...not sure exactly how many... lots of people there. I put in several 12 hour days. It went well. Today was just clean up day, so just 6 hours. I pretty much just went to bed when I got home. Tomorrow it's time to tackle Mount Laundry! I have read all of the posts; can't remember to comment on all since they are on a previous page and I read a couple days worth, but I remember a few recent ones! Fran, I am so glad you finished FEC!!!! Hoping the side effects go away soon and stay away! Andrea, That is a fun wig!!!!!! Lynne, Rest up; hoping good days come soon! I hope you get that toe checked. Don't mess with infection. Addie, I was not able to do nipple sparing because of where my tumor was, but I did do skin sparing, and I am very, very pleased with how things look after reconstruction...better tan my look before BC to be honest. I went into chemopause after my first TC last time. I just had my ovaries out. Many of the gals in my Sept 13 chemo group have gotten their periods back. I think some have been sporatic. kcoralee, welcome! gkodad, neutrophils can go up a lot in a day. Mine was 1.5 at chemo 3, and MO said he figures it was below 1 a few days before. slv, hope the port feels better soon. Rockerwife, love the beanie! Littleblue, feeling any better? ksusan, how's the grading going? Sorry for anyone I've missed. I was listening to \"Fight Song\" and got inspired to \"take back my life\". For years I always wanted to runa local race called the Dam to Dam. Inever tougt I would be in shape enough. Then I worked it in 2013 and saw how may people walked. I decided I would do it in 2014. Then I got BC and had a bunc of srgeries ad such in 2014. I decided it would be my \"finish line\" afterall those sugeries. I ran it and loved it; it is a fun race. I decided I would do it every year. Understand I use the term \"run\" loosely. If it is faster than a walk, it is a run. Though I fully intend to beat BC for good this time, if for some reason it comes back, I do not want to have missed this opportunity to do it...assuming I feel good after my first Taxol. I plan to walk most of it (it's a half marathon). Really, I think it's my way of saying F U cancer; I will do what I want! My song for the day is \"Never Surrender\". If you read this far...wow. Sorry...feeling wordy today now that I finally sat down!!!!!        ",

I had a fun friend, and was relaxed and chatted the whole time. My MO must have picked just the right premeds for me because I have not had nausea. I have had more energy than anticipated, and have picked up a few extra work shifts. I have tried to get a walk in the sunshine each day which helps me as much mentally as physically. I know the good days may not continue, but I will take them! Everyone is different, and it is sometimes a crap shoot as far as side effects. Expect to do well. You can do this. Remember, cancer is the enemy, not chemo. We will get through this together.",

I got Aloxi, Emend, Dexamethasone, and Zantac. I did great with my first AC and am hoping for the same luck with my last 3! I took my Zofran religiously for the first 5 days and have needed nothing since. MO did tell me that AC and the Zofran cause terrible constipation. He told me to take my favorite stool softener and a laxative for the first 7 days. I appreciated his frank honesty and I did as he said and had no trouble with constipation, but it was clear I would have if I had not taken the meds. So if your MO does not warn you, be sure you are prepared with those. You also will want to suck on ice or popsicles during AC.",

My kids are also at an age that they would NOT appreciate me doign that. Hers are toddlers. Man, she sure looks beautiful though! Some people can just rock that look!  Stephmoen, remind me what your chemo regimen is. Day 3 tends to be the toughest for most people, but for me on both regimens, I was able to pretty much carry on as usual. On TC, I had more pain and took ibuprofen that day. On AC, I simply took a short afternoon nap. Other than that, I carried on as usual.My best advice for that, and chemo in general, is plan to attend those types of events. Plan to live your life. Just plan for a little extra rest when you need it, and be flexible with yourself and adjust as necessary.",

I am actually working a duty shift at the FD tonight.  Usually during chemo I just do on call stuff, but I am filling in and enjoying every second of it.  I love, love, love my job and my coworkers, and the thing about chemo that bugs me the most is making me not be able to work my normal shifts.  I appreciate the ability to do \"light duty\", but I prefer to be on the ambulance and on the trucks.  Tonight I am on the ambulance.  It is nice to feel \"normal\"...even if only for a night.  ",

This date is the 2nd anniversary of my first cancerversary. My 2nd cancerversary is Feb 2, so I really can't \"celebrate\" being cancer free since it came back. I can celebrate by saying F you cancer and cutting out the date from the calendar and using it to start the fire with which I am going to burn the damn Tamoxifen that did not work for me. I am interested to see what color it burns. Stay tuned! ",

Just this week, I was at a school. I had not been there since October. I had 4 different teachers comment on how much they loved my hair! I chuckled and told them it was a wig because I had breast cancer. They are all a little shocked, but I reassure them that I really appreciate the compliment because it makes me feel good to know I look good, and that I kicked it once and plan to kick it a little further to the curb this time. Once they know I am at ease with it, they are as well. At work, I work with 98% guys. They seriously know more about how my breasts have been cut off, filled, recut, etc than anyone should know. I told them from day one to ask questions if they had them, since likely a close friend or family member would one day be diagnosed. Lots have questions and I answer them all. My workplace is more like a family though, because we eat meals together and sleep there, so it's a little different than most workplaces! I also used to be a middle school teacher, so I am used to answering any and all questions! Basically, go with your comfort level. And once you share, people will offer to help...when people offer to help, give them a simple task...I'd love a freezer meal to make when I'm not feeling well...I'd love if you could cut up some fruit and drop it off sometime. People feel helpless and truly WANT to help, so I let them, which frees me up a bit. This is payback for when you've helped others, and you will have many, many years to pay it forward later.",

It helps to shorten it. If I am in teh car, I turn on the AC full blast. In the winter, I was known to suddenly put down the windows when it was FREEZING out (which did not make those in the car with me happy). I have also been known to open the freezer and pretty much step inside of it. Anewbeginning, Boo on the nails. I hope they hang on. Taxol is most known for causing nail damage, pain, and neuropathy. It'll cause fatigue too. For me, day 1, I slept for an hour sue to the Benedryl and then was wired from the steroids premeds. Day 2 I noticed nothing. Days 3-4 I was very tired, I had a little pain (very little) on and off, and that was pretty much it. Days 5-7 back to normal. I ice my feet and hands to try to reduce neuropathy, and I take vitamin B6 for the same reason. L Glutamine is supposed to help reduce neuropathy too. Ask your MO before taking anything though. As long as I don't take antioxidants or unknown supplements, my MO is pretty open to things.",

Little blue and georgie, painwise, I am guessing dose dense Taxol is similar to Taxotere. I needed Advil for about 2-3 days each cycle. I felt like I had back labor! It was not constant though. With weekly, it was just mild fleeting pain and only occasionally...at least for the first one The dose dense Taxol is a long day. One hour premeds and nearly 3 hour infusion. It will be nice for you to be done a month sooner though.",

Lynne, If you do Taxol dose dense (every 2 weeks), you will have about an hour of premeds, plus 3 hours of Taxol. Then add on blood work and appointments beforehand. If you do it weekly, you can subtract 2 hours of Taxol. I like your poem. Here's mine: First it takes your hair Then your brows and lashes are bare Takes every taste bud And turns it to mud GI stuff, let's not even go there.  Today I turn 45. I have mixed feelings. I used to hate birthdays and getting older. Now I appreciate them more and realize what a privilege it would be to get to live to old age. I was diagnosed at 43..spent much of 44 getting reconstruction and such and then my new diagnosis. I am hoping that at least the second half of 45 will be a bit more relaxed and returning to normal...whatever the new normal is. Feeling a little emotional today; maybe because I wonder how many more birthdays I have left. More likely because I had 2 hours of sleep thanks to steroids, and am coming down off them which leads me to be a mess for about a day. I have not had a walk/run today, but will head out on a long one after lunch to get my head in gear. Hubby is working, so the kids are making breakfast for dinner...my favorite...score one for me! Thankfully I feel good today and am having no side effects from the Taxol other than the red steroid face. I saw a different MO last week and did not tell him about the run because he did not know me at all and I knew he would never ok it. My MO thought it was awesome that I did the run and asked me what other runs I was doing this summer. He runs too, so we were chatting about various races around the area. Better head out for my run soon before it rains again! A good day to all with minimal side effects. We are halfway through another week... 1/2 of a week closer to being done.  ",

One silver lining to cancer is many long lost friends have found me. It is nice to be in touch again and hear from them, and I heard from many of them today Fran, Enjoy that margarita on Tuesday. You have earned it! You will have to drink one foe Lynne too; you bith have birthdays next week. Lots of Geminis here!!! Littleblue, I think this hard on the spouses. I just try to make sure DH has time to just go out with his friends on occasion so he can have some fun and non cancer normalcy. That is awesome that they are doing the BBQ. All you need to do is show up, and say thanks. People feel helpless when those close to them have cancer, etc. They want to help. Allowing them to helps them as much as they are helping you. You will have many years to pay it forward.  ",

I hope all of ours comes in as nicely as yours. GKOdad, I get a \"cradle\" too. It is the same stuff we use in EMS as vacuum splints! I laughed when I saw that. I have my head. neck, arm mold, hold on to handles, and then have my feet strapped down. That was at the sim anyway, so I am assuming, that'll be my position every time. Wednesday is my run through. I wish they could just run through it and then do the real thing! I'd like to get one down! RPayton, My nails have not been too bad (not using anything) but I can already see nicer nail growth coming. Lynne, It does surprise me seeing the different things various places allow for rads. I tried researching and even the research studies say that. I think it is because nothing is proven to work. Some people have \"prefect skin\" with a various regimen, but the reality is they got a different protocol than many others and many have gotten lucky, because other use the same stuff and get horribly burned. Reading the post near the top of the rads board from an RO definitely made me understand it more. It also has to do with whether or not they use the bolus, how thick of a bolus they use, how often they use it, and how sensitive your skin is to it. That being said, I did stock up on a ton of lotions and potions and will try all of them after rads each day in case they do happen to work!!!!! I did find someone to teach for me Monday and that has decreased my stress level tenfold! A week from now, I will be port-free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Mine sticks out so far that I can hang a clothes hanger on it and it does not fall off. I want that sucker OUT of my body! Dizzpark, One left????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I hope the side effects are few and manageable. I am definitely ready to get going with rads. I feel like I did waiting for chemo to start. I did some reading today on the physiology of the skin changes with rads. I like understanding the whys of things. It definitely gave me a good timeline of what to expect and why it happens. I just want to get it going so I can get it done! I have really been in a mood lately, and I think it's just wanting to get things going and get my time slot. I am glad work has been so busy to keep me adequately distracted. The kids start school on Wednesday too, so it'll be a big day for all of us!  ",

Lynne, I think it is anywhere from 2-4 weeks, but 3-4 from last infusion seems to be pretty common. I am not 100% sure. As for drinking, I tolerate water a little better on Taxol than on AC. I mostly drink decaf unsweetened sun tea with lots of lemon or lime. If not that, than other tart things. I have been doing better on water the further I get from AC. I do have a few days where nothing tastes good, and then it's whatever I can stomach...usually lemon water. 3 Taxol down...officially 1/4 done with Taxol. Yahoo! No problems yet. I went from there to pick up my lymphedema sleeve. The woman at the store was really surprised when I took it off nad asked why I wasn't wearing it home. I explained that it is preventative and only needed at certain times. What I wanted to say was \"It's 95 f***ing degrees outside, do you think I am going to go out there with these thick things on my arms? Are you nuts???!!!\". Seriously, it's not like a new pair of shoes that I would be excited to wear out of there. On that note, all of my kids are out and about, so I am going to slap on a ton of sunscreen and go take a quick dip in the pool to cool off. Addie, Funny your MO looks like Rajesh. Mine looks a bit like and sounds a lot like Adam Levine. I fell asleep once watching The Voice the night after an appointment and it startled me when I heard Adam's voice. I was wondering why my MO was here. Then I woke up a bit more! gkodad, great point about the stats. Research moves so fast that by the time most long term studies are published, they are outdated. We all just have to work with our docs and come up with a plan that together we think will work best for us. If we had a crystal ball, it'd be easy, but we don't so we just do our best to do what we can to get through treatment and then live healthy, happy productive lives afterwards. Littleblue, my MO likes running, exercising and such too. He totally \"gets it\" and is very supportive of my running (as long as I promise to use sunscreen). I also look in the mirror and am reminded that I'm bald. I suppose that's good since most days I feel so good, if I was not bald I would probably forget about BC. For that I am thankful. I work with mostly guys, and about 1/4 of them are bald by choice. I do wear my wig when I go on calls at work so my patients aren't freaked out, but I can't help think that they could go through chemo and no one would give it a thought that they were bald. My friend that finished a few weeks ago totally rocked the bald look (and now the growing back look). I wish I had her confidence. For now, I just keep expanding my ball cap collection!",

Last Wednesday at our fire training, our Chiefs talked for over an hour about our increased risk of cancer, safety stuff, etc. they went on and on and on about studies, etc. Hoping that may have set off my dreams. I still will make some notes in case something happens, but hopefully I won't need it for 40 years when I die living it up like the Golden Girls. Hoping this is the one time my dreams are WRONG Thanks for letting me vent. I feel better than I have in a few days. :) You ladies are awesome.",

I have been taking daily pictures now! I am not exactly sure what will be in my boost area with so many surgeries, but I am guessing some of the axilla will. Yuk. I am sorry that area is so sore on you too. Definitely ready to move on from rads... Glad it is quicker than chemo! Ksusan, Your hair is coming in so nice and thick and full! Nice shirt",

I don't even ask if they ever consider me cured because I know they do not have a crystal ball. I was very, very low risk to recur, especially how I did, but here I am. Others have a super high risk and live fro 50 more years. My mom had BC in 1992 and has done great since then with no problems. They can give me all the statistics they want, but I figure the stats are either 0% if you don't recur, or 100% if you do. I do have days where the fear gets the best of me, but thankfully, the rest of the days, I just try to live my life and ignore the fact that I have BC. Addie, That 10 pounds will come off faster and easier than pregnancy weight. Just make sure you are eating plenty now so your body can heal itself. I hope the TE pain is better today. Andrea, SO happy this is your last trip to the chemo bar and that in a few short hours it'll be in your rearview mirror. I hope it is not too crazy hot there! Scarlett, My BS told me the day I had my BMX that I was a survivor. He said that they aim for curative unless you are stage IV, but the reality is, as some have said that we never really know. Littleblue, how are you feeling? How many more Taxol remain? Princess, I hope those neutrophils were high enough that you were able to come home. I am so glad they got you to a room right away. I am not really liking the fact that my \"bad days\" come on the weekends. I wish they were midweek! I am however grateful that there are just a couple bad days each cycle and then I feel totally normal again. I was worried when I felt worse last weekend that I'd feel that way for the next 6 weeks...such a relief to have it short-lived and glad I write down daily symptoms so I know what to expect round to round as far as when things will resolve.

We'll celebrate the good, and carry each other through the bad. Karen.

I think I could use a few massage sessions when this is all said and done. I think my body would like that!!!! I think we all could use that. It might just appear on my Christmas list Jen, how are you healing? Andrea, I hope you get the surgeries scheduled. I hate having things up in the air. So back in 2013, they did genetic testing, but only tested for BRCA1 and 2, which was negative. When I recurred, my mom's doc had her tested since she had BC in 1992. She came back with a \"variant of unknown significance\" in CHEK2. They did not test me for that. It increases risk of breast cancer about threefold and possibly colorectal cancer. I asked here about it and since it was not a definite positive, they will not retest me, because they do not think insurance would cover it and it would not change treatment.they did say in a year or 2, they may know more about the variant. They also said if her doc wants to do a family study, they could. We'll see....... Nothing pressing, but would be goofs info moving forward",

He agreed it felt like scar tissue but also agreed we need to investigate to be safe. He gave me 3 options: 1. Watchful waiting (he did not recommend), 2. Ultrasound, 3. Surgical excision (said was fine but risk of healing issues, and maybe aggressive). We both agreed to ultrasound and they got me in this afternoon. You could definitely see the area on ultrasound. That spooked me s little; I was hoping to see nothing, but it also reassured me that my instincts were right that something is there. It looked just like scar tissue to the radiologist. There is blood flow around it, but not to it. She said we could wait it out to see if it changes, talk it over with BS, or schedule a needle biopsy, ultrasound guided. That's what I am doing for peace of mind, especially since last time when they excised the \"scar tissue\" they mentioned how it did not seem to have any blood vessels. Next Tuesday. Hopefully no surprises this time! I am feeling so much better about things. I am sure I will be stressed Atuesdsy night, but I feel good about it now. Thank you for putting up with my stressed craziness. I am not usually such a bucket of nerves. It feels good to feel like me again!",

I feel like my pain has eased some in the last month or 2, but it was really uncomfortable for a while. I was really glad that MO brought it up at my last appointment and offered suggestions from what previous patients had told him worked. He actually cares, which is nice. I am glad you got the U/S referral. Let us know how it goes. If the wrist x ray does not show anything, perhaps for an ortho consult or an EMG. I developed carpal tunnel after chemo the first time and know 3 other local gals who had the same thing. Surgery was a quick fix...but annoying to add something else to the mix. ",

I did not know you beforehand, and it's hard when we look in the mirror and don't see ourselves, but you look absolutely stunning.  Scarlett, I would be really mad that MO did not call you about the Dexa scan. Mine called 4 months ago just to tell me mine were normal! Even though mine were normal, MO wants to put me on Prolia because I'll be on AIs for 10 years, and because my cancer has not behaved and Prolia has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of bone metastasis. He gave me the long list of pros and cons and told me to do some research (I already had and was planning to bring it up, but he beat me to the punch). He was not sure if insurance would approve it. We just heard yesterday that they did approve it, so I'll probably schedule it for the 18th, because I need to be there anyway. I know the long term is unknown, but at this point, if I can live long enough to see my kids graduate, anything else is icing on the cake and I'll take whatever collateral damage occurs.",

You could list 3 or so days per week and have a friend sign up to go with and drive you. As much as we hate to inconvenience people, you probably have a ton of people who all want to help, but have no idea how. Having someone drive a few days would make you less tired, and would give you some quality time with friends. Just an idea. When my friends made meals and drove me to chemo, I always had to remind myself (and they reminded me often) how much they want to help. They feel helpless and helping actually helps them...if that makes sense.",

The reactions to Taxotere and Taxol are typically due to the inert ingredients. Most women who react to them do okay with Abraxane, from what I have read. It is a Taxane, but uses other fillers, inert things.  Will hopefully have more time to write later. Wishing everyone a great day. So far, Imam still doign well, and crossing fingers it continues.

I got Neupogen in the hospital every day and was released after 4 days. The first 3 days I had little change in neutrophils, but on day 4, they shot up. My temp was always at least 2 degrees higher at night than during the day. I was in a research study for a vaccine, so I had to take my temp several times per day. I hope your counts rebound and that you are released soon. In the meantime, I hope you can entertain yourself in there. It is sooooo boring. You are in my thoughts and prayers. gkodad, welcome!

They thought it was a node at first, but then pathology came back that it wasn't so they sent it to Mayo...found no lymph tissue or breast tissue...just another really aggressive tumor that did not show on any imaging growing in the soft tissue. Glad my surgeon found it, but frustrating nonetheless when you've been aggressive with treatments. I am sure you feel the same way. Have you had rads? I am getting them this time...hoping that helps keep it away for a long while. Glad you found this site. How many Halavan treatments will you have?

My Sept chemo crew are still some of my greatest friends. I hope our April gang can support each other in such a way. My cancer came back in February with a tiny lump where my first tumor was. Sine the excisional biopsy came back positive for cancer, they did further excision a few weeks later. In surgery, they found a second tumor, over 6 inches away from the first, hiding out in the soft tissue. Apparently my body likes to make cancer. This meant a second trip to the chemo bar. If it gives me lots more years with my 3 kids, I am all for it! So, April friends, sorry you have to be here, but since you're here, join us, tell us about yourself, and share what preparations you are making for chemo. I got my wig yesterday, and my coworkers and I are having shave-fest 2 on March 30. There will be good days and bad days, but more good than bad.

If he/she could not follow the contours of your breast and still get clear margins, then they have to excise the breast in a way that enables them to get the whole tumor out, get clear margins, and minimize risks to nerves, etc. Things will settle down as healing takes place and you can contact a plastic surgeon if needed to get a better cosmetic outcome.

Before I even met with my MO, I knew that I wanted to be aggressive in treating this (and do chemo)'because I want to have no regrets or what-ifs. Mine was 2cm, and not in the sentinel node. Mine is grade 2. I also have a close friend who had a low oncotype score, yet had a recurrence. My MO agreed with me. We both agreed that if I was 15 years older, hormone therapy alone, rather than in addition to, would be the treatment of choice. For me, this was the decision that I knew gives me the best chance to be there for my kids, as well as have the best peace of mind. I start on Sept. 20. There no right or wrong answers, and it is a very hard decision based on a lot of personal factors. I definitely encourage you to get a second opinion (perhaps even a third) and perhaps get both the oncotype and mammoprint score to give you all of the tools you need to make the best decision for you, and do not let others question your decision.",

They changed things up on me today. They did the four bolus ones first. Totally messed with my mind sine I had it down to a science knowing exactly how long each zap lasted, and the order of them! I had x rays first, so I am guessing switching the order made for one less adjustment. They make 3 different positioning adjustments (of the table, bolus, wedge, etc) each day during treatments.",

Ksusan, I am tired from working crazy hours, not sleeping well, and trying to keep up with kids' activities. My skin is uncomfortable but not horrible. I just wish I could sleep better! I too try to go in with a smile each day. I count to distract myself. Nevertheless, when they take my BP weekly, it is often around 156/96...way high. I took it at work last night.....120/72. Apparently I do not do as good a job at relaxing while thereas I think. On the subject of sore throats, I only made mention of mine to my RO when he asked about weight loss and I noted my throat was a little sore so I was not eating the best. He told me then it was because it was in the radiation field. I had not known that. I am getting supraclavicular nodes though, so that's why throat/neck get some. I also think that radiation can make any reflux worse and that can contribute to sore throat",

I an thankful for the weekend off. Rads has been easier physically than chemo for sure, but I would agree that for me it has been mentally more challenging. I had to rearrange my whole work schedule to meet their schedule, the drag of going right smack in the middle of the day every day, and the unknown of what's to come. When you're finished chemo, you're so excited to be \"done\" but with starting rads 2 weeks later, there's really no \"done\" and no time to celebrate. I think with chemo, after the first round my side effects were predictable, so I could plan. With rads, you have no idea if/when you will peel, blister, wet peel, etc...or just remain pink and skate through. It makes it very hard to plan anything, and I think that drives me crazy! That also is why I have been posting pictures...so people who come after me have a little more idea of what comes when. None of my friends who went through it could remember when different effects started; they just remembered how they felt/looked at the end and how long it took to heal. Right now it changes by the day. I am much more colorful today than I was yesterday.",

RO told me twice per day but the pharmacist saw me when I picked it up because I had a tank top on and tolod me three times per day. I put Mepilex dressings on and hold it in place with a pillow. I keep the dressings on all night and a couple hours each day. In between, I try to let it air out so it dries up. I have some areas with nice new skin, and some that are just starting the moist process. Uuugh. I described it to my friend last night as if you have a really bad case of road rash and someone pours alcohol straight into that...the 30 seconds of unbelievable pain...except that it lasts for a week or more. I have been taking 3-4 Ibuprofen and 2 Tylenol in between Ibuprofen doses (always 2 hours before Ibuprofen is set to wear off). That makes it so I can tolerate life. The Silvadene is soothing and helps to prevent infection. You cannot be allergic to Sulfa though, because it contains an antibiotic.  KSusan, Your skin is looking great!",

If it is faster than a walk, it is a run. There sometimes may be little difference between my run and walk. I did not care during chemo if I walked the whole thing. I was actually very freeing to not care at all about time. The October marathon is about 9 days post rads, so I may be at my worst. If I do not have too many open areas, I will try to do it.

When they need to be more aggressive, they use 20 grays per day. That makes a big difference, as does bolus, total dose, area covered and individual reaction. Most women I see get pink/red, peel a little, and generally don't have too much discomfort. I hope lots with those reaction post pictures too because I think it is helpful to see a wide range of reactions",

When I asked, they told me they really don't stay put, but I could try. They gave me one and wrote a prescription so my insurance would cover the rest. I had to get them at the hospital store; pharmacy did not have them. You can get them on Amazon, but make sure you get the ones WITHOUT the adhesive edges. They are crazy expensive, but you can use it for a few days and it is worth every single penny. They immediately bring relief and knock my pain in half. You do have to be creative to get them to stay, but I cannot stress enough how much relief they brought, and I do think they really sped up the healing process. I do not know why these are not standard of care, other than they are not creative enough to get them to stay put.",

You'll see pictures if you look back. Basically, the skin turned red, then purplish black then disintegrated and seeped/oozed serous stuff from the open areas. Other areas just turned maroon and peeled (dry desquamation), and they hurt no more than a sunburn. If you have moist desquamation, you'll know it because it is the most painful thing I have ever experienced. Thankfully it healed in a little over a week. Most people do not progress to that, and I am hoping you don't...and hoping no one else does either. I had 2 grays per day over a huge field, and had the bolus used every day, so that kind of set me up for it. I am very glad now that they were so aggressive, but eeek! I did really well both times through chemo, so eventually the other shoe had to drop. It dropped and clobbered me hard during rads!!!!! But......life is back to \"normal\" now.

AC then Taxol has been shown to be a little more effective than TC in a recent study (TC was \"not non-inferior to AC+T) http://www.onclive.com/peer-exchange-archive/2016-... That study was stopped early because TC was inferior. As you can see from my stats, I have done both regimens, and TC did not seem to work for me. Thus far, AC+T has. I think the 12 weekly Taxol is at least equal to TX4. It is generally better tolerated. https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/805220 http://www.ascopost.com/News/4213   ",

Biopsy is the only definitive way to know for sure, so it is good your doctor is being cautious, and also so good that you are so on top of your health to get it examined right away. From my experience \"rubbery\" feeling is good. I have had 5 biopsies. The 3 rubbery, movable ones were benign, andthe 2 that felt like frozen peas were not. Everyone is different thoguh. Statistics are highly in your favor. Waiting is very hard though, so try to plan a full weekend of things to do to distract yourself. Do keep us posted.",

That is likely why they are being aggressive. A second opinion is always a good idea though. You need to be comfortable in your decision, either way.

I always call it the chemo bar where I get my cocktail...which is odd since I almost never drink! Wishing you an easy time this round. Lynne, Whatever works for you as far as the hair...go for it. I went through it in the fall last time...summer will be much different. I will definitely try to get a copy of that book. Thanks for the recommendation! I work really flexible hours and have cut back, so don't be in awe of anything. I just have been pretty lucky with the SEs so far. I know the other shoe will drop eventually. I walk every day because it is my sanity saver. ankle dolphin, the hair loss is hard, and whether you like buffs, hats, skullcaps, wigs, scarves, is up to you. Whatever works, go with it. Last time I wore my wig all the time. I do love my wig and wear it to kids' events, but it is too hot on my daily walks. Today was my first day in just a ballcap. Thankfully the earth did not open up and swallow me whole. I was nervous going out with just a cap on. Rockerwife, I was admitted during TC for a neutropenic fever because my (ex)MO \"wanted to see how I'd do\" without neulasta since I was young and healthy. It burns me up how they are willing to gamble with our lives like that. I hope you are getting Neupogen and that your counts rise soon so you can kick that infection and get home. So sorry you are in the hospital. Positive spirit, I hope you are feeling better today. Vanmama, Hope the CMF goes much better for you.   ",

There was no reason for that to happen; when you are that low you cannot fight anything. That is not fai rof them to gamble like that. ERNurse, I try to involve my kids in things too; it gives them a sense of empowerment and independence. I always remind them how much it helps me and I appreciate it, Positive spirit, good for you for reaching out for help for your kids. I just try to keep things as normal as possible for them and involve them when I can. They got to have my head into a mohawk and paint my head like an Easter egg. When else would they ever get to do that (hopefully never)? I try to just let them have fun. Since we are not taking a big family vacation due to weekly Taxol, they each get to plan a 4 day weekend getaway. They are totally excited about planning this. It is something I should have done befoer, but never got to, so I am glad we are doing it. Anything special or fun you can do will make it memorable in a good way for the kids. ksusan, hope you are feeling good. Little blue, how are you feeling? Andrea, Welcome! Sorry you have to be here, but we're glad you've found us. You have found a fabulous group of women here to share this crazy journey with. Lynn, You do not owe your husband an apology. He needed to hear it and he owes you an apology big time. I sometimes have to spell thing sout like that too and just lose it fo rhubby to understand. He's a brilliant man; just sometimes needs to be reminded about some common sense things. Karen, I hope you're feeling better. I have a chronic sore throat throughout most of chemo. I realized halfway through last time it was heartburn. I need to up my meds this time. If you have other side effects, that is not the culprit, but if you have a sore throat that seems to hang on, it may be a contributing factor. Sorry you missed your ACLS class. I just happened to recert mine a couple weeks before my recurrence because there was a class nearby; ended up being good timing. Allicat, You are sooo right on needing to speak up!!! Mamajen, So glad to hear you are feeling better. I take Zofran during the day and add Compazine only at night and only when needed because I would rather keep a clear head and it makes my mind fuzzy. Lemonade, I had not heard she's a BC survivor too! I hope everyone is having a great weekend with minimal SEs. I got called in to work tonight and was thrilled to feel good enough to be able to work a duty shift and not just on call. Working the overnight, but we can sleep if we are not busy. Enjoying the feel good weekend and hoping it continues. Then Monday blood work and MO appointment with chemo on Tuesday. I will then be 3/4 done with AC. My friend who I've been scheduling my chemo times with is having her last Taxol that day, so I'll bring her flowers, a balloon and some cake balls I just made. Looking forward to her celebration, and looking forward to doing the same in 4 more months. This first month has gone surprisingly fast. Hoping the same for the next 4!!!",

Mine is my profile pic. I am 44. I was first diagnosed at 43... recurrence at 44. My MO told me to take Zofran for at least 5 days and then try to wean from it. He said premeds from chemo last through day 3. He also said I may need it for longer each round. He is very aggressive on nausea control and was very clear that he wanted me to stay ahead of nausea and call right away if something is not working. He also was clear about the need for heartburn meds and laxatives with AC and Zofran. With TC, often antinausea meds are just needed for a day or 2..then the muscle and bone pain start. So Wednesday I was at training at work and we had a dinner. I took a teeny scoop of sloppy joe and the. filled my whole roll with dill pickle slices. Thursday I stopped at McDonalds. I hate McDonalds; I go there about once per year. I had to have an egg and cheese biscuit. Yesterday I ate a package of sweet potato fries. Who knows what I will crave today???!!! It always amazes me, the similarities between chemo and pregnancy!!!!! So far today, I just want applesauce",

I also have my favorite go-to ball cap. It is one I gto for Christmas from my daughter last year, well before my recurrence. It's made by Under Armour. I like it because it is thin and stretchy. Most ball caps are not stretchy. Because it is, it stays on my tiny little head better, and does not blow off...hasn't yet anyway. It's also just a cool, comfortable material. I need to get a few more because I wear it all. the. time. I think my counts are falling because my pulse was really high just standing up in church this morning! I did manage to get my walk in before it gets too hot today, and I am hoping to get some things planted in my garden today. Sundays make me happy because it begins a new week, which brings each of us a week closer to having this in our rear view mirror. In case I haven't mentioned it lately, I am so very grateful for each of you on this crazy April journey. We've got a great group of gals here, and we're getting the cancer-killing job done. Before I started chemo in 2013, I read probably hundreds of blogs of people going through chemo and I took notes on commonalities of people who seemed to have an easier time versus those who had a harder time with side effects. Some of it is a simple crap shoot; there are some things we have no control over. The one big thing that always stood out was that those who exercised seemed to have an easier time. I never knew if they exercised because they were having an easier time or if they had an easier time because they exercised, nevertheless, I made a commitment to myself both times to get my butt out and walk each day. There was a study on the main page of the website with study results on that very subject. Even if you feel crappy enough to not do much, try to get around the block or do any little thing you can. It seems every little bit helps. http://www.breastcancer.org/research-news/exercise... Here's to a side effect-free Sunday for all!",

I have no idea if it will help to prevent hand-foot, but it will not hurt. I also will ice my hands, feet, fingers and toes during Taxol. I did during Taxotere too.

I struggle every day with what to drink; it varies every day what tastes good, but I do think a straw would help. As far as temps, it is hard to judge temperature sometimes with hot flashes...I keep temperature so I am comfortable...and that varies from minute to minute. I also tend to get low grade fevers after Neulasta (and anytime my counts are low) which makes it hard as well. Anewbeginning, Hope the next THP goes well. ankledolphin, if you don't get Neulasta, just keep close eye on your temp and report it immediately if it rises. Round 4 has definitely been the roughest so far. Thankfully, I do fine from about 6 am through 3 or 4 pm and that's when I start to feel horrible. I am grateful to make it through most of my day and be able to get stuff done at home and at work. I like ksusan's idea of getting to know each other. Here's the scoop on me. I grew up in northwestern NJ, in the mountains. I went to college at Penn State, which is where I met my husband. In high school and during college, I volunteered for my local ambulance squad. After I graduated from PSU, i stayed in the town for a couple years until DH finished his PhD. He got a job as a professor in Iowa, which is what landed us here. I was a middle school health teacher for 4 years when we first moved here, and I also was on the local fire department. Here, fire and EMS are both run by the FD. I stopped teaching when my son was 1, to stay home, and got my paramedic at the same time. I now have 3 kids, a son and 2 daughters. In a few weeks, their ages will be 15, 13, and 11. Our fire department has expanded and added station crews, so I work as a firefighter/paramedic there part time and also serve as the public education coordinator. I miss teaching, but love my current job and love that I still get to be in the schools teaching fire safety, first aid, etc. I enjoy running, biking, and gardening when not at work. I have a dog who is big and friendly, but not very smart. That's my simpleton life. Who's next???",

Partly it depends if you are getting 4 treatments or 12. Taxol tends to cause less \"yuk\" feeling or nausea than AC. It can still hit your blood counts hard. The fatigue tends to be cumulative. As others have mentioned, it can cause nail loss and neuropathy. I see a different MO before my first one since mine will be on vacation. Since my last one OKed it during Taxotere, I am going to go ahead and ice this time too until told otherwise. I did during Taxotere and only lost one nail; I had no real problems with neuropathy. Taxol can also cause quite a bit of joint pain. It you get the 4 doses and have Neulasta, it'll obviously be worse. I was able to handle the pain of Taxotere with ibuprofen, but it varies person to person. I believe most MOs use Benedryl and steroids as preinfusion drugs, but that may vary. I start it on Tuesday, so I'll report back for sure on how it goes! Most everyone I know though, says that Taxol is much, much better than AC. I am a person who mosquitoes absolutely love. Most people like being around me outside because bugs will eat me up and leave them alone. When I was on TC, I never had a single mosquito bite; apparently the mosquitoes did not like my poisoned blood. They must apparently feel differently about AC. I have a mosquito bite bigger than a quarter on my bald head. Seriously. I pretty much always have a wig or a hat on, and was only out for about 5 minutes over the weekend with nothing on my head. I hope that mosquito faces a long, excruciating, painful death from my AC poisoned blood. I hope bugs do not like Taxol. I'd like to have a bite-free summer. Hoping everyone has a good week. We are almost halfway through May. The days keep ticking on by.......",

We'll celebrate the good, and carry each other through the bad. Karen.

I then put all of the pictures on a chart. I will post it as more people finish. Doing Taxol, hair usually starts to grow during that time, so you can subtract 8 weeks from that hair growth chart to get an idea of where it'll be. I do recommend taking pictures each week during that time because when I would get frustrated nad think it was not growing, I'd only have to look back a few weeks and see it had grown. I was always a put my hair in a ponytail and go person and I cringed every time someone complimented my short hair. I appreciated the comments, but I always hated myself in short hair...hence my big collection of ballcaps...which is still growing. I went out to dinner last week on a patio in downtown Des Moines. I had my wig on. 3 different gals passed that were bald. I guessed (totally stereotyping here) that one of them was bald by choice, and the other 2 either had chemo or alopeca. I remember thinking about how no one was staring or even doing a double take, and maybe I should just go bald more often. Then I got home, took off my wig (I only wear it when working, shopping, or out with my kids), looked at my sick-em-out ears and decided I did not have the courage. Maybe when on vacation someday I'll have the courage. I am not very fond of the bald look on me either. It was much easier in the winter; I threw a stocking cap on and out I went. By spring I had some hair. In the summer, it is not that simple, and is much more challenging. I do feel your pain. We all do. This is the perfect place to vent though. I am positive about 98% of he time. The 2% when I am frustrated and say something to someone here, the response is usually the same...\"just stay positive.\" I always wonder how many people who have strokes, heart attacks,or have been hit by a car and have months and months of recovery are told to \"just stay positive\". all. the. time. Of course we all try to stay positive! Even with cancer, life is much happier that way, but there are annoyances and frustrations and it seems cancer patients can't vent them without people thinking they are being negative! I honestly think it's because people don't want to hear the negative or the realities. Rant over! I am actually having a good day. Off to go do laundry and yard work!",

Littleblue, My MO is doing 12 weekly doses of Taxol because he can monitor for neuropathy more carefully. I did ice my hands and feet when I had Taxotere and had no neuropathy. I have not asked my MO about it this time because I have seen his PA or another doc for a couple visits because of his days off, vacation, etc. I am assuming he'll allow it since my last MO did, and really, I would do it anyway because I need my feet for balance also and need feeling in my fingers fro IVs, etc. My MO is pretty open to it, so I am sure he will be fine with it. Timewise, I would have preferred dose dense though! Taxotere was nasty stuff, but like the others, manageable. I had back pain that was very similar to back labor for a few days each round, but Advil made it manageable. I am hoping the lower dose weekly Taxol is not as bad. I also ran fevers on Taxotere...neutropenic fevers. I think the neuropathy from Taxotere can be as bad as Taxol, so I am not sure of the reasoning to switch if it becomes a problem.",

Addie, Those steroids make you come crashing down and the emotions are unfortunately part of that.  It's almost like post-pregnancy emotions when you can cry for no reason...only here we have 1,000 reasons to cry. We are here.  Vent anytime.  It is easy to get overwhelmed.  I can tell you that out of our Oct 13 group, all of our recurrences thus far have been people that were \"regular\" breast cancer...non of the triple negatives.  My mom had triple negative in 1992 and she's still here too.  ((((HUGS))))  I am so glad that today is a better day already! Allicat, That is pretty much my idea as far as chemo.  As much as I hate it, one of the docs that saw me completely underestimated the  aggressiveness of my cancer and my gut feeling was I needed chemo.  Thank goodness my current MO was on the same page and wanted it...and then ordered the oncotype just for added info and it was very aggressive.  I had to fight to get chemo in a way, and I try to remind myself of that every day I get frustrated. Littleblue, If you have a cold and your counts are ok, they will typically do chemo.  If you have a fever or your counts are low, they will typically withhold it.  I hope you feel better!!! Sunshine, welcome!  How is your hemoglobin?  When that gets low, it can be hard on your muscles...not to mention all fo the other drugs they pump us with that can affect things.  I hope #4 goes ok for you.  Be sure to mention it to your MO. sheshe, I hope all went well with the infusion.  Are you seriously having surgery one week after your infusion???!!!  What surgery?  Are you done with chemo, or do you have to do more after surgery? slv, I hope the headache went away! Gingerchi, Glad you are turning the corner after AC#4...the best part of it is there's no turning back.  AC is in your rearview mirror for good!  Weekly Taxol is not bad so far.  The every week thing is a drag in a way, but it also is just kind of routine and I feel like I can check them off faster.  Not sure if I'll still feel that way in 6 weeks, but for now, it's not bad.  One so-so day and one blaah day, but the rest are fine...and they are predictable. Just expect to not get much sleep the night of infusion because of the huge dose of steroids.  I am already making my to-do list for next week!    ",

I have a playlist called \"fight songs\" which I listen to frequently. It really helps me stay focused. Each song has something in it...some reason it's on my list, and those songs help me when I need motivation. Littleblue, Cool fund raising idea! This site is a good one. Otherwise, one that either supports research or a local one that helps people through treatment with practical things. We have a local one started 3 years ago by a breast cancer survivor that provides meal gift cards each week of chemo and a few house cleanings......soooooo helpful! gkodad, I am with you as far as the prognosis thing (and I LOVE your response to people). I had less that a 1% chance of recurring in the manner that I did. Statistics are numbers. Our chances are 0% or 100% on recurrence. We do or we don't. When I get lumps and things I worry, but other than that, I try to just live my life. Cancer has taken a lot of days as far as treatment and such. I do not let it take more days by worrying endlessly. Though it is always in the back of my mind, if it comes back again, I'll deal with it then. In the meantime I will live life and love life. Allicat, Your \"beat cancer\" reference is a good one. You're right. When I am 80 and get hit and killed by a truck, my family can say I beat cancer! No one has a right to question your choices. We all make the choices that work best for us in our own lives with information geared to our own situation. My mom was questioning EVERYTHING when I was diagnosed in 2013. She did not get that treatments changed since she was treated in 1992. She was so annoying, I have never let her come to any appointment or chemo with me. I love her, but she drove me crazy with that (and still sometimes does). When people question things now, I tell them when it's their turn to fight this, they can make the decisions that work best for them, but right now, my doctors nad I have made the best decisions for me. Stacey, I plan to get the port out the very first opportunity I get after chemo! ksusan, It's the \"little things\" some days. Yay for tank tops! Every bit of normalcy that returns is a good thing! Karen, I hope Taxol went well. It has been pretty easy for me. #3 was even easier than the first...probably because I am further out from AC. slv, Soon that light at the end of a tunnel won't be a train. Hooray for being more than halfway done. Thus far, Taxol #3 has treated me very well. Other than my taste being totally gone, a bit of burning in my feet, and a minor rash, I would not have even known I had gone for any type of chemo. My energy is even starting to return. I really feel great and honestly forget I have/had cancer until I pass by a mirror or taste my food. . My son had a CT of his foot yesterday. We meet with the surgeon later this morning to see if any of the broken bones are displaced. If so, he will need surgery. I'll take positive thoughts for everything to be in its place!!!!!     ",

My taste is now officially gone. Everything tastes like cardboard. I am grateful to feel good enough that sometimes I forget I have cancer. The other day at work was one of those days. I was just going along with my day and thought nothing of ordering my normal sub from Jimmy Johns. I was really mad when eating it because it did not taste like anything. I kept trying to figure out what they forgot on the sub when it dawned on me. The sub is fine. It's my taste buds that are not fine. Then it dawned on me that a bunch of the stuff on the sub is probably not recommended during chemo. It was too late, so I just ate it. It did not taste like anything, but I know I need the calories. Friday I was at Trader Joes and the lines were all really long. They opened one up and called me and my son over as soon as we walked up. It dawned on me later that we must have looked really pathetic...bald mom with kid on crutches. Today I was at the store with my daughter and they again opened up an aisle. It must just be me that looks pathetic. If only they knew I feel great! I wish tehre were a way to be selectively bald later. I would love to go to the front of the line on days when I'm rushed!!!  Allicat, Congrats on being done! I love your sign! GKO, I do hope Taxol is better. I hope the residual AC hits the road soon. Karen, Sorry about the fissure. They hurt a lot! Lynne, Not sure I could read that book. Someday maybe, but it would hit too close right now. Andrea, I agree about the humor. I do try to find humor in odd places, and sometimes this is one of them. I see some horrid things at work and humor is a coping mechanism that I use there too. This is probably just a carry over from that.",

I am due to have my port put in March 31, and start chemo either the same day, or April 1. This is my second go-round with chemo. My Sept 13 chemo pals saw me through chemo with my sanity intact, and I recovered both my energy and strength and have run a few half marathons since then (I will remind myself of this over and over during the next 6 months). My Sept chemo crew are still some of my greatest friends. I hope our April gang can support each other in such a way. My cancer came back in February with a tiny lump where my first tumor was. Sine the excisional biopsy came back positive for cancer, they did further excision a few weeks later. In surgery, they found a second tumor, over 6 inches away from the first, hiding out in the soft tissue. Apparently my body likes to make cancer. This meant a second trip to the chemo bar. If it gives me lots more years with my 3 kids, I am all for it!

Addie, I do hope the director follow through and gives you the program. I went in 2013. Mine was also moved. I stopped 4 different places before finding it and was in tears by the time I arrived. Obviously no one else was as bull headed about finding it as me because I was the only one to show up. The guy running it was weird and I looked like a clown when done, but I did appreciate the free make up and his tips on drawing brows. My friend went to one locally this week and said it was fabulous, so I am glad her experience was better than mine. The brow pencil I got is still the one I use. Littleblue, I ordered a pony from there are few weeks ago but have not received it yet. I am really, really hoping it comes soon. If it does not come today, I will e-mail them and ask for the status of my order. Gingerchi, So glad you will son be able to resume treatment. I am thankful that my most frustrating side effect is the horrid taste. Nevertheless, I am sick of the slimy, moldy cardboard taste. I am sooooo hungry and food smells so good that it is just cruel how bad it tastes. MO usually mentions any weight gain or loss. I was really glad he did not comment on my 2 pound weight loss over the past few weeks. I had expressed to his nurse that I was trying really, really hard to eat lots of protein and such to keep weight loss to a minimum, but that it was frustrating me. I think she must have passed that along, which I appreciate! I probably would have been upset had the weight loss been criticized. Thankful to have an MO nad his nurse who not only communicate, but care!  ",

I have read many articles written by physiciams where they discuss why women are choosing mastectomies instead of lumpectomies \"despite the same overall survival\". Frankly, these articles burn me up. It is YOUR choice which surgery to have and yours alone. Yes, the overall survival is the same. However, what they don't tell you unless you push them, is that local recurrence is higher with lumpectomy. Their attitude is that if you have a recurrence, no big deal, you can do BMX then. No big deal to them, but I can tell you that having a recurrence IS a big deal. BMX does not guarantee you will not have a recurrence. I am exhibit A of that. Nevertheless, I do not for one minute regret my decision. I had tiny breasts and if you took a lump, you were pretty much taking the whole breast anyway, so for me it was a no brainer. Do what feels right for you...whether it's lumpectomy, mastectomy, or BMX. Katy, The quilt is beautiful! RPayton, I love the items you've crocheted. They are so cute!!! I survived the morning parade walking a few miles and handing out candy. I also survived my time in the boat making sure the cardboard boats all made it out of the pond/lake. My family all went to the summer festival for dinner tonight, but I chose to not dine on vendor food of unknown sanitary quality, and instead chose to stay on the couch and eat leftovers. I am enjoying the quiet time home alone. I'm going to attempt to run a 5K in the morning. I'm hoping I wake up with some energy...which seems to be lacking at the moment! I am very much a morning person, so I know tomorrow should be more energetic! After tomorrow, it's a new week, which means I will get to check one more Taxol off the list in a couple of days...always a good thing! ",

In 2013 when I did TC, I was hospitalized for 4 days with a neutropenic fever and had labs, cultures and such another time because of fevers. Nothing ever found. I should have gone in on one other cycle, but ex MO just blew the fever off like everything else. No cause was ever found for the fevers. My personal opinion based on no medical info whatsoever is that it was my body's way of reacting to the inflammation caused by the Taxotere combined with low WBCs. I also got IV potassium that time. MO has allowed me to take a low dose potassium this time which has kept it at low-normal. Low potassium can wreck havoc on your body. I'll hit the chair tomorrow for Taxol #8! I'm liking these higher numbers!!! 2/3 done with Taxol tomorrow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ",

I was so scared they would not do chemo because MO I saw at the time thought it was unnecessary, thankfully local MO did think it was necessary and Oncotype confirmed how aggressive it was. As a result, I was so grateful to be able to get chemo. I think of it as my ally and cancer as my enemy. That mindset helps. It also helps knowing that hair returns, energy returns, etc. I know it is mostly just temporary. ",

Then there is the area under the pec muscle where they found the second recurrent tumor. I told him I appreciated his time. I also found out that I will be getting the bolus every day...and they will be using the bolus on the entire area. I The tech's eyes got really big when he said that after she asked what area they will bolus. My friend just finished rads a couple weeks ago and had the bolus every day on a small area. I know what that area looked like. Yikes! I need to think long term, and I am glad he is being aggressive. This will be as much mental as physical once the burns start. Trying to prepare for that now. ",

I am supposed to teach all day at the FD and I am trying frantically to get it covered. There are only a few instructors. If worst comes to worst, one of the guys on duty can likely teach it and I will get his shift covered. First things first......get through my crazy week ahead!

I have no hair to pull out this year, so I'll need to just take it day by day and try to sort of keep my sanity intact. ",

I am due to have my port put in March 31, and start chemo either the same day, or April 1. This is my second go-round with chemo. My Sept 13 chemo pals saw me through chemo with my sanity intact, and I recovered both my energy and strength and have run a few half marathons since then (I will remind myself of this over and over during the next 6 months). My Sept chemo crew are still some of my greatest friends. I hope our April gang can support each other in such a way. My cancer came back in February with a tiny lump where my first tumor was. Sine the excisional biopsy came back positive for cancer, they did further excision a few weeks later. In surgery, they found a second tumor, over 6 inches away from the first, hiding out in the soft tissue. Apparently my body likes to make cancer. This meant a second trip to the chemo bar. If it gives me lots more years with my 3 kids, I am all for it! So, April friends, sorry you have to be here, but since you're here, join us, tell us about yourself, and share what preparations you are making for chemo. I got my wig yesterday, and my coworkers and I are having shave-fest 2 on March 30. There will be good days and bad days, but more good than bad.

Ankle dolphin, it is common for eyebrows and lashes to fall out s few weeks after chemo. Unfortunately since their growth cycle is reset to all at the same they may fall out again in a few months. I am fearful mine may not return this time since they have been gone for 3-4 months. I was excited when I got 3 new brow hairs, but they all fell out too. I still have no nose hairs yet either. Addie, I am 3.5 weeks out and am feeling better other than some lingering fatigue and shortness of breath with exertion. Jen, I love that Mohawk!!!!!!!! The 3 day break from rads is nice, but I could have probably used it more in a few weeks.

Jen, I hope you start feeling some relief. I see my MO tomorrow for my first follow up since Taxol 11. I just started Letrozole today. So far, no issues. I think it takes a few months before problems kick in, but I will just assume I will have no issues until proven otherwise! I posted this in the March group. I will repost it here............. I am going to share a story that's made me pretty sad. It is about a friend/neighbor who finished the same chemo regimen about 2 months before me. She just died a few days ago. Very, very suddenly...was doing yard work, felt ill, laid down and did not wake up. I did not post it in case it was related to treatment. I just spoke to her husband. She had a massive heart attack. Her arteries looked like this had been building for years and years per her husband who just got autopsy results. It had nothing to do with her cancer or treatments that they could see. He mentioned that she had been having symptoms such as extreme exhaustion with very little exertion. She figured it was related to chemo and rads. I am mentioning this because as devastated as I am by her loss, I do not want it to occur to anyone else. I implore you that if you are having symptoms that do not seem right, it may not be related to this cancer crap. Please, please, please get it checked. We've worked too hard to get through this cancer crap to let something like that happen.",

Last time it was the PS who was open to doing a biopsy when I asked for it. The BS is a little more opinionated, so we'll see what he's open to. My plan this week was to work on my Christmas letter, but I cannot even bring myself to do that since I jinxed myself so badly last year. I did send a message asking if there's a cancellation, to move me into it. I know they won't though.

That has kept me as distracted as I can be. DH leaves town tomorrow morning, so once I get off at noon tomorrow, I don't work again all week. That has me a bit stressed. I have slept ok at work, but not at home. I finally took melatonin Friday night and it helped, so I'll use that again as needed during the week. I alternate between being confident it's scar tissue and feeling like I'm crying wolf to certainty that it's back and fearful that all treatments thus far have failed. Beyond all of you, I've only told a few friends. I did tell one coworker who asked how my appointment went last month (I had not seen him since then) and asked if I had any others coming up. I'm not a good liar and he could see by my face something was wrong when he asked that, so I did tell hi,. His mom died of cancer (lymphoma) complications 10 years ago, so he does truly understand my fears. I have not told my kids yet, unlike the last times. If I need a surgical biopsy I'll tell them, otherwise I only will if it's positive. They need to be shielded at some point from the worry. I've had a lot of time to think about all possibilities, so I did message both PS and MO. I asked MO if it's worst case scenario and is positive, if it's better to have it out now surgically or try to treat it to see if treatments work this time. That'll impact surgical vs needle biopsy decision. I asked PS what the risks were of surgical biopsy on radiated skin vs needle biopsy risk to implant. Hopefully they'll both answer before Wednesday so I can have a good discussion with BS. 3 more days....... (even though I won't have answers that day) Renee, I had samples taken of my stomach about a month before all of this BC crap reappeared. I also had some damage to my stomach lining from heartburn/reflux, likely secondary to chemo. Thankfully mine came back benign. Wishing that yours does as well. Keep us posted. Gotta run.

My BS has always made it clear that he will see me for the assessment of lumps and such, and for clinical breast exams, and that my MO will address \"the rest of the stuff\". My mom had a unilateral mastectomy in 1992, so today she's having a mastectomy on the other side for the new cancer. She never had reconstruction before, so she's having TEs placed on both sides so she can later have implants. My dad called a little bit ago and said everything went well and she'll be going home in a couple hours. She's not the picture of health (but thinks she is) so I am concerned about her being released and not kept overnight, but she's pretty stubborn (which is where I get it from), so she'll do what she wants, no matter what they recommend. Glad surgery went well though.",

I do not mind wearing a BC t shirt or hat every now and then, and it leaves the door open for people to ask questions sometimes, and I have been approached by strangers, and met some new people that way. That being said, I got rid of the BC key ring, antenna topper, window clings, earmuffs, and the giant pink tree ribbon that someone gave me. They were a little over the top for me. A pink ribbon ornament would be ok...as would something else that symbolized something else about this life detour...a heart representing the love of friends (and your April chemosabes), or something totally badass because you kicked cancer's ass.",

I am very strong, and generally very positive, but some days I just want to crawl under the covers.......and that's OK! I can't imagine people going into someone's room that has had quadruple bypass, or someone that has just had a giant piece of colon removed due to colitis and saying \"stay strong\"...so I am not sure why people feel the need to say that to cancer patients!",

Mel, I hope the prescription helps the bladder problems. That sounds really uncomfortable. Stay ahead of the nausea meds, and call MO right away if you need something else. There are tons of options. I had acne with my first 2 TC infusions last time. It was really annoying. For some reason I did not with the last 2.  One thing I noticed that helped last time was to make a note each day...just about a sentence or 2, of how you are feeling and any symptoms you have. You can even do it on your notes on your phone. It helps when you go to MO and it helps from round to round because the symtoms are similar, and you know what to expect...and can plan accordingly.  Littleblueflowers, before I started chemo in 2013, I read about a hundred blogs and made notes of commonalities among people who tolerated it well and those who did not. One thing most people who did well had in common was that they got out and exercised...even if just a little, each day. Of course those who did well had the ENERGY to exercise, and there are some things you cannot control, but anyone with the energy to get out each day, I encourage you to do it...even if only to get around the block. Since I did a pre-emptive head shave last week, I am going to let my kids decorate my head like an Easter egg today. Just because I can. Must make some fun out of this crazy time in our lives wherever I can! I will try to post a picture later.",

Stress can cause cardiac events. If it is pain when you push on your sternum, it is likely unrelated to your heart, but if it is a tightness type feeling, it needs to be evaluated. In relation to the other pains, once you have a fear of cancer, your mind takes every ache and pain and tries to convince you it is cancer. It takes actively working on it to not do that. I would record all symptoms in a journal or on your phone, and keep updating them. When you next see a doctor, you can explain your symtoms, time of onset, etc.  Best wishes.

This is a great place to do it to express fears and frustrations, which gives you a place to do it, yet shields your 6 year old from it. 2. I think there are some threads for caregivers. I encourage you to join them and get support from others. I think people underestimate the stress on the caregivers. 3. Once your wife has her treatment plan, encourage her to jump in here and join the chemo board, if that is what her plan entails. It was a sanity saver for me. 4. I have a good friend locally that had 29 positive nodes...axilla, supraclavicular, and neck. She had a complete response to chemo and is doing well; she just hit her 4 year mark. 5. Every person who says \"what can I do?\" ....... give them something to do...a date to bring a meal, a day to come vaccuum, a day to watch your 6 year old for a few hours. People WANT to help, and you'll give them a way to do so, which helps them process this. At the same time, it gives you and your wife relief from doing those things, so she can heal and rest, and you can focus your attention on her and your child. 6. The first few weeks after diagnosis are the hardest mentally because you feel like you are spinning your wheels in place. Once a treatment plan is in place, you feel like you can forge onwards. 7. The days I felt I could not hold it together, I went for long walks on deserted bike trails where I could cry all I wanted nad get my emotions out. It helped.",

Mine is a little more complex because it is a recurrence so they need to cover original scar, new scar, original tumor and new one...and a second one they found this time around hanging out in the soft tissue. I noticed the boost area did not cover that last tumor which was up in the soft tissue towards my axilla under the pec muscle. It was the most aggressive of all of them. I asked the team about it, they went and got RO, he looked and agreed it needed to be in there, so they redrew things and are making a new mold. I am grateful to have an RO who listens and adapts, and does not have an \"I am always perfect\" attitude. It also points to the importance of knowing your history, where your tumors are, and paying attention. That is the area that is the most burned and he did say it would get significantly worse and more sore with boosts. My reply was that if it keeps this cancer from coming back again in 14 months than it'll be worth every ounce of pain. Thanks for being aggressive with it. I think he appreciated that. Remind me I said that next week when I am writhing in pain! I already feel like I am on fire there! The reality is though that I do not care to revisit this cancer crap again. Sewbutton, Your comment about your hubby putting his body part in a microwave for days may not have been appreciated by him, but it sure was by me!!!!!

Surgery is their expertise; medical oncologists are the ones who are experts on treatments after surgery. I believe Oncotype is typically not used on HER2 cancers because the purpose of oncotype is to determine the benefit of chemo, and HER2 cancers are treated with Herceptin (and sometimes Perjeta) which is given with chemo. I understand your shock, but do understand that HER2 cancers are typically very aggressive and there are treatments to stop them, but they do require chemo. Size of the tumor does not impact aggressiveness. You had multiple tumors, which means your body is making cancer multiple places. You are young. You have many years still to live. I understand not wanting chemo. I've done it twice. Do understand though, that your risk of distant metastasis if you skip chemo and Herceptin, is high. Once cancer has spread to distant sites, it is not considered curable. Right now, you cancer has a high cure rate. Clear lymph nodes do not guarantee cancer has not spread; it only takes a cell or 2 to break away. Ultimately, this choice is yours, but make sure you understand fully the impact of your decision, and that you can live with your decision long term. If you can, then your decision is right for you. You might consider other opinions from other doctors to get advice on treatment options. I also think stopping by the triple positive board is a good idea. The folks there can let you know your options and how things have gone for them.",

My other issue is that my routine work pulmonary function test which dropped from 105% of expected to 78%. When I had my radiation follow up, I asked about it because it said that it was likely caused by something restricting lung inflation (not a problem with bronchi or alveoli). All docs said it is probably from radiation. RO said \"highly unlikely\". He said it is probably from chemo. MO said absolutely not; likely from radiation.

Once you get that figured out, then focus on the others. They may or may not be related, but first figure out what the breast lump is. You'll need a diagnostic mammogram and an ultrasound. Any doc can order that. When I first found my lump, my doc was on vacation, so I made an appointment with an NP. She felt the lump and called to get me in for a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound the next day. In the meantime, keep a log of your other symptoms, what you're eating, etc, so once you get the lump figured out, you can try and then address those. Also keep a log of any and all questions you have. I am sure it is very frustrating. An internal medicine doc would be a good one to work on the other symptoms, but first deal with the breast lump because the stress of that is likely aggravating the other symptoms. If you don't want to wait until the 18th, then make a GP appointment sooner, which will help you get things like mammo in before the holidays (or maybe you are more patient than me....once I find a lump, I want answers yesterday!!!!)",

Add to that the ads from drug companies...I heard one on the radio yesterday urging people to educate your doctor that symptom X is probably this, and you need this to alleviate your symptoms. I am pretty sure the doctor does not need to be educated on that, and can look at the symptoms and work to find an appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Educating yourself and advocating for yourself is very important (saved my daughter's life when I had vasa previa), but you have to understand what you're reading, take into account the source (if it is from a drug company it is not unbiased) and if you're reading research, you need to clearly understand statistics and the language of researchers. If not, ask someone who knows this to help interpret it and apply it to your particular situation. The same goes for radiology and pathology results. I always get a copy of those and think others should too, but people need to remember that these are written by doctors for doctors, and are in specific language common to that field. People criticize their use of words because they can't understand them.......they are not written for the lay person; a doctor can interpret it for you!!!!!",

It should not impact your treatment. Luminal B tends to be PR negative and high Ki67, but there are PR negative people I've seen that turn out to be luminal A, so I can't say for sure. Your doctor will most likely base treatment decisions on the Oncotype (or Mammaprint....either can be ordered). Best wishes!",

She had BC in the contralateral breast 2 years ago. You cannot compare a mastectomy to a knee replacement because going without a knee replacement does not prevent you from getting cancer. You cannot compare it to taking out a kidney because you do not need breasts to live. Neither is a realistic or fair comparison. The flip side: once you have BMX, there are no more mammograms, ultrasounds, etc unless there are new symptoms. While this may sound great, it can be very stressful because anatomy can be lumpy and bumpy. I know a couple women who are CHEK2 positive who opted for lumpectomy and one who opted for UMX. They are all doing well and do appreciate the yearly screening.  There is no right or wrong answer. My family history was only one small piece of what led to my decision. The only right decision is the one that feels right to YOU. When I had to make my decision, I hand wrote a chart with the pros and cons for me of every choice. This helped clarify things.",

My scar tissue post mastectomy is different than the breast lumps prior to my mastectomy. I already had one lump which needed to be surgically biopsied prior to my BC diagnosis, so I do understand the stress of fibrous breasts. I still get them checked, but my cancerous one felt exactly like my cancerous lump the first time, and felt different than any other scar tissue since then. In addition to my family history, I cannot help but wonder if there were environmental factors. There were 5 girls on my street growing up. 4 have had breast cancer prior to age 50, and one is being followed for odd lumps and bumps. As I said, a lot went into my decision, but whatever you decide, do not look back and ever ask \"what if\". You made the best decision for YOU, and that is all any of us can do.",

So perhaps you could call and request an ultrasound. You can always call the mammogram place tomorrow and ask for your results, and if there is no mention of the lump, then pursue things starting over. I would think if you had felt a lump that they would have put a marker on the spot, and would somehow make mention of it to you. Hoping you get answers soon and that all is benign.",

Here is the other perspective. I had a lump in 2015 that my BS and PS were \"SURE\" was benign. They both said they were 99% sure, and did not say 100% because they never say 100%. This was different than other scar tissue lumps I'd had, felt just like my cancerous lump, and I had a STRONG gut feeling that it was cancer, and my gut has never been wrong. PS said he'd remove it if I'd like and would do so without messing up reconstructed area. I opted for this. Well, as you can see from my profile, my gut was correct. Even when excising the lump, it \"looked benign\" so it was taken out in a bunch of little chunks. My docs were shocked when it came back as IDC. Since clear margins were not obtained, I had to go back to have another surgery for reexcision, lymph node removal, etc. As inconvenient as core biopsy is, it is better and less dangerous than repeated surgeries.  Hoping all comes out benign in your lumpectomy, nad that you heal quickly.",

I did quite well through chemo; some people's bodies respond differently to things. I also had an MO who was very on top of the latest anti aides stuff, and was aggressive about preventing heartburn and constipation. I know that helped immensely. One thing that is important to remember with rads is that there are different protocols. Some people who do well brag to just slather X or Y on, and you too will do well. That is short sighted. I slathered all sorts of things on and burned horribly. BUT I had mastectomy, I am thin, I get rashes from the sun, I had an aggressive protocol, and I had the bolus used every day. All of those things set up the perfect storm. Most importantly, I am currently cancer-free, and hopefully will stay that way. When people ask how rads was, I tell the truth, but am quick to add that most people do NOT have that experience. I think it is very important to hear from people who sailed through",
