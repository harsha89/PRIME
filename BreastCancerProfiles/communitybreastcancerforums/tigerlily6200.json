While they were getting more pictures they found a 1cm mass that they hadn\u2019t seen before. The u/s confirmed it wasn\u2019t a cyst and although the radiologist said it seems to be on the benign side of things, nothing is 100% so I am scheduled for an u/s guides core biopsy next Thursday. My question is this: are return appointments for the results normal? They made me a biopsy appointment and a return appointment for 3 days after. I thought they\u2019d just call me on the phone? It seems more stressful to have to be told in a room like that? Idk. Anyone else had to do that Log in to post a reply",

They only saw something during my first ever mammogram. I am waiting on my u/s guided core biopsy for an approximate 1 cm mass that the radiologist think is benign but order the biopsy to be sure. So now I am trying to read what I can so that I understand the process and what questions to ask, if I need to ask them. Can anyone clarify this for me: how likely is lymph node involvement? Is it based on the size of the tumor or the type? Does everyone need a PET scan? I am just trying to figure all the information that is out there, without driving myself mad. Any information will be appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
