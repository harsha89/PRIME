I finished chemo august 3 of this year and rads last month. My attitude is is that the score is to let us know who would benefit most from chemo and you and I fall into that category. We have to have faith that the chemo wipes out all those little buggers and the Amiridex in my case will keep them away. I feel your fear and identify with it. It's definitely one day at a time",
