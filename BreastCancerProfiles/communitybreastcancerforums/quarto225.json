I am 55 and they just told me I had artchitual distortion of the right breast too have no idea so I looked it up and really should not do that because no good news on the internet. My family has a strong history so I am nervous but it is out of my hands at this time and all I can do is go for the tests tomorrow and begin to wait for the results which is the worst. Let us know about yours seems like everyone that has this it is in the right breast, odd",
