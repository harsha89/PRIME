Sadly she had to change hospitals when Blue Shield and UCLA parted company but she will be starting it again now at Cedar Sinai where they are just learning how to administer it. Neither of these were trials. Another poster reported that his wife was receiving it at MD Anderson in Texas. Good luck to you.",
