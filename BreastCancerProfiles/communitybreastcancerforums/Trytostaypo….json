I would say ask your oncologist what the exact situation is in your case.  They should be able to explain very clearly.  All My Best !!!!!!!!!",

I also have expanders in, had Bilateral Mx with TE placement 1/10, then had rads on my right breast March-April 2010. I finished rads 4/12/10.  Was not fully expanded prior to starting rads. Had my first appointment for expansion 2.5 months after finishing rads.  The right is pretty uncomfortable. My skin is still darker on that side. How does your TE on the radiated side feel compared with the other side?",

I have bilateral mastectomy, tissue expanders and finished radiation on right side April 2010. I liked Biafine, but it is only with prescription. However to me, Aquafor was terribel - so greasy... Thank you, donna",

I also have breast cancer.  Sometimes a look at the postings of women with advanced cancer. As a cancer patient , it is the WORST possible fear. I think , it is in the back of the mind of any cancer patient, if she will ever get there.  God bless you and your friend, Donna",
