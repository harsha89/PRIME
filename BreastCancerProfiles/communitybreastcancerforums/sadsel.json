Just pulled drain 1-1/2 weeks ago.  Was still draining first week drain was pulled and it was dressed to absorb the fluid.  The drain incision finally sealed off and is no longer draining.  2 days after that happened, his left breast area became very red and warm with fluid building up again. Called doc and put him on antibiotics.  He now has big blood blister which popped on its own but skin is still weeping. Put dressing on so no germs could get to it.  He has appt with doc today.  Anybody have ANY kind of experience with this?  I'm panicking that it could be major infection and may need more surgery.  Let me know please!  Log in to post a reply",

We are waiting on results.  I can't thank everyone enough for all the information on this board.  I feel if he does have it, at least we have an idea of what to expect. I was freaked out at first, but have now come to terms that it may be bad news but he will do fine.  If anyone's husband has gone through this, please post as I would like to know how things went for them.  Thanks again for all the info, it is definitely a Godsend, especially to a newbie! Hugs to all of you! Sadie ",
