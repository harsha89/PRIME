Yay!  I am officially Stage IV now {gulp}, but my onc says patients can live with bone mets for many years.  So this is about all the time I can spend in my computer chair....the percocet hasn't quite kicked in yet.:-)  I hope all of you have a great weekend!",

I think my mom had a minor heart attack each time I did it.:-)  I'll bet you are thrilled to have your grandbabies so close. I'm doing ok.  I am all done with rads now, and my throat is finally starting to feel better.  I'm still exhausted, but from what I've heard and read that's probably the norm for awhile.  I won't have a full PET scan again until mid-August, 3 months from the first one.  I did see my neurosurgeon last week and got the news that I will most likely not have surgery.  The vertebrae below the fractured/compressed one have too much damage from the cancer.  The surgeon feels that the best thing for me to do is continue to wear this neck brace for about 6 more weeks, allowing my neck to heal the best it can.  And then just be careful ~~ no skydiving for me!:-)  I'm actually quite relieved that I'm not facing that surgery, I was a lot more anxious about recovering from that than I am about getting rid of these nasty little cancer cells. Tomorrow my family is getting up ridiculously early to go get on an Amtrack train and head over to the Wisconsin Dells for a little getaway.  We are all so excited to do something so \"normal!\"  I even managed to find a masectomy swimsuit that I feel half-way decent in, and I'm looking forward to some calm, aquatic refreshment.  No waterslides for me, I'll be hanging out in the kiddie pool.:-) I hope that all our sisters here are busy with their own happy summer plans!",

Mandy ~ I'm so glad {and fairly jealous} that you had a wonderful trip. What a blessing to have that time with your family. HaveHope ~ It was good to see you check in.:-)  It's great to hear you're feeling good and that your MIL is doing well. I'm doing ok.  I've been feeling a little more pain lately, but I'm thinking it's just from running around too much the last 2 weeks.  Its also been way too hot and humid here, and that just sucks the life out of me.  I have a PET scan on Sept. 2, and will get the results on the 7th.  I'm having a port put back in on the 8th, because it took 6 tries to get the IV started at my last Zometa infusion.  I've officially been approved for Social Security Disability and am getting ready to hand in my resignation at the bus company.:-(  I'm actually looking forward to being able to stay home and homeschool my kids and nurture my still-young marriage {our 2nd anniversary is next month} with all the energy I have, it just kind of sucks to have the decision made for you the way its been made for me.  I told my manager that I just didn't understand why they wouldn't let me drive a bus under the influence of narcotics.....I think there would be a lot less road rage if everybody took a little oxycontin before rush hour!:-) Cebula and Bold and Texas and Horsern, I hope all is well in your lives and you're enjoying these last weeks of summer.",

I had chemo yesterday, everything went ok.  Only got about 3 hours of sleep last night thanks to the decadron.  Blah.  Onc said I will have scans probably the week after Christmas.  If things are stable, we will continue the chemo we're doing, if there's any progression we will change to something else. We had a doozy of a snowstorm that started at about 1pm yesterday and ended at about 5 this morning. I think we got 6-8 inches out there.  Its really pretty.  Of course it happened on a night that my kids were going to a youth event with our church youth group, so I spent a lot of time worrying about them being out and about with other people driving. Tomorrow we are planning to go cut down our Christmas tree if it's not too cold. Tonight I think we will be baking cookies to send to the guys in my husband's national guard squadron over in Iraq.  He actually was supposed to be over their with them, but his commander held him back when we found out about my bone mets.  He will be getting deployed sometime next year, and since he missed this round to Iraq, he will end up going to Afghanistan.  Somebody in his unit sponsored our family for Christmas, so we all got to fill out a Christmas list, even my dad's dog!  What a blessing!:-)  It's been really tough for us the last couple months, so I'm really grateful that I will FINALLY start receiving my disability benefits this month.   I hope y'all are enjoying your weekend.  Blessings and hugs to everybody.:-)",

We had an insane amount of snow here over the weekend.  I honestly don't remember having this much snow on the ground any time in the last 10 years.  On Saturday evening my DH and DS had to shovel individual tire tracks for about a half a block so we could get our car to the church parking lot that is across the alley from us.  They actually pulled the city buses off the street, which had never been done during the 11 years I was driving bus. And that meant having to make my way downtown where DH was stranded trying to get home from his national guard duty.  Sheesh!!  I ate a lot of chocolate this weekend.:-)",

I'm doing ok.  Tired of doing chemo, I just had the 2nd injection of round 8 yesterday. Blah.  But it's doing what it's supposed to, and even though I feel generally crappy most of the time, I know it could be much worse.  Looking forward to a mini-vacation with my sister and her daghter and me and my kids over to the Wisconsin Dells later this month.  Blessings to all.:-)",

Congratulations on driving!  I know it was a big deal for me.  For me, HER2 was not the determining factor regarding chemo.  {I'm supposedly HER2-, although my oncologist wants to wait for the oncotype test to know my status for sure.}  Anyways, my nodes were clean, but my cancer is grade 3, more aggressive type, and my nottingham score was 8.  Because of those factors and because I'm fairly young, my oncologist is recommending chemo.  So there are many things your oncologist will look at to decide the best treatment plan for you.  I'm sure that Dec. 6 feels like a really long time to wait, but you'll make it.:-)  In the meantime, enjoy your holiday weekend and try not to think too far ahead.  {yeah, I know, easy to say, but not to do!  I need to follow my own advice!lol} Take care and Happy Thanksgiving.",
