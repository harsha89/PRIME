No Biopsy straight into a Lumpectomy. They removed a lot of tissue(Breast significantly smaller). The Dr said it looked like DCIS, but it could be IDC? I had two separate clusters of calcification's. I had a biopsy on the right one last year and it was ADH. Follow up Mammo in Feb said everything was clear can calcification's grow that quickly? Sorry. New here. Thanks for any answers.",

I did not talk to the Dr afterwords, and of course he is to busy to talk to me now. I guess I am just confused. Do they do a lumpectomy when its not cancer? I guess thers a part of me that wants to believe its not cancer. I never got a straight answer just that it could be. Thanks Sheila.",
