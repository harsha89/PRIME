In any event, I paid the $$ for the luxury hospital room at North Shore Univ Hospital in Manhasset.  It was NOT worth it at all.  It was a beautiful room, but so what.  I was pretty out of it the whole time, and so I couldn't enjoy the huge flat screen TV, etc. The nursing care was absolutely horrilble in my \"private luxury wing\" of the hospital.  That was what really bothered me.  In the end, I got a robe and slippers to keep.  Don't pay the extra money, it's not worth it.  Again, I hope you get to have your surgery next month.",

Now at 3 months out, a lot of feeling has returned but I still do have some numbness in the low back. It takes time and it wasn't until 2 months out that the feeling even started to return.  Hope that helps.  I'd be interested to hear what your doctor says about it, please let us know. ",

The fills for me were no big deal and not painful at all.  First the doctor finds the port in the expander with a magnet device that's sort of like a stud-finder.  Then they will clean the area, and then inject the saline.  You won't feel the needle at all.  My doctor filled my expanders to 200ccs at the surgery, then waited a couple of weeks.  The fills were then only 50cc at a time.  That's only like a shot glass full, not much at all, so you shouldn't feel it.  If he adds more at once, you may feel it.  I saw a noticeable difference in size at each fill though, which was great. Good luck! ",

On the plus side, it does say that while there is an increased risk of BC in such women there is no evidence of increased risk of ovarian cancer, which is good news indeed.  ",

I was tested because I have a really strong family history - maternal grandmother with breast cancer, 2 maternal aunts with BC, first cousin (mothers side also) with BC, mother had melanoma, paternal grandmother stomach cancer, paternal uncle cancer (I don't know where and he's deceased), uncle on my dad's side died of non-hodgins lymphoma.  That's a lot of cancer, and a lot of BC.   Nobody else was tested but me.   Is this a trustworthy \"real\" negative or an uninformative negative? In any event, they didn't find the mutations they tested for, and now my ovaries get to stay where they are, which is good news indeed.  I would have had the ovaries and fallopian tubes removed if it had come back positive.   Dx 1/29/2009, DCIS, Grade 2, 0/2 nodes, ER+/PR- Log in to post a reply",
