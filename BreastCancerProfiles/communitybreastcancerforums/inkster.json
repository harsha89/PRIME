I figured it was all in my head, but kind of wondered if it was related. Now I know. And will be packing ginger in my purse along with my post-zapping cream. :) Speaking of cream, I know there was a long discussion about this, but just to add a delayed 2 cents: my RO gave me hydrogel at the office to use after treatments but then rather strongly recommended I find Calendula Cream. It's homeopathic and made from marigolds (yay! something pretty in cancer treatment). I bought some (on Amazon) and tried them both. I really like the Calendula Cream texture-wise - it's far less sticky. I'm just starting this path (session 3 was today) so the jury's still out on effectiveness. Others using Aquaphor surprises me. My tattoo artist used to recommend it to help tattoos heal, but switched to something else. I remember it being hard to work with and can't imagine trying to cover an entire breast plus armpit and section of back with it. More power to those of you using it and fabulous if it works for you.

Also, blaming chemo brain. :P Anyway, I'd like to join y'all. I wrapped up chemo on 9/9 and go in on Friday for the CT scan/mapping session. IIRC, I start radiation about a week after that. The RO told me how long I'd be going in, but the whole thing is a bit fuzzy (have I mentioned chemo brain yet?). I think she said 6 1/2 weeks. Something odd and not a neat number like 36 or the ilk that I could remember, but I'll find out more in a few days. My fingers are crossed that I'll be done by (U.S.) Thanksgiving. This is my last phase of treatment before I toddle off into the sunset with my hormone pills; definitely going to be thankful for that.",

My MO pushed my return to work date until the beginning of December, which makes me think he is adding the radiation treatment into the timeline (I'll be done with chemo by the beginning of October). The date change, of course, freaked my boss out and she wants me to figure out if I can come back and work through radiation as planned or not. Never having done this, I have no idea but still have to come up with an answer. So, I turn to you lovely people. What was your experience? And if you didn't take the time off, do you wish you had?

Or is the cap more of a protection thing (and fancy mesh patterns would be a bad idea)? Other thoughts? Huge thanks!
