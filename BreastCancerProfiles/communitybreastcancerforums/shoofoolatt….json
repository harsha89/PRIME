I am interested in ways to dress - like how to use scarves and the like - so that I will not be dependant upon using a form to look ok in clothing.",

At first I thought it was going ok, but then the headache started, then the nausea and chills, and the overall fatigue. I had to just take to my bed and stay there for the weekend. I thought that things were better today (Monday), but I'm now running a fever - 100.8. Not feeling great at all. Hoping this all goes away soon. My next infusion is New Year's Eve.",
