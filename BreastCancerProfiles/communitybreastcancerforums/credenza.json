    "Content": "credenza wrote: Hi, I've been recently diagnosed with breast cancer and my first doctor recommended a conventional mastectomy. She said sometimes people spare the nipple, but she recommended against it. I got a second opinion at MSK and he said that nipple sparing mastectomy might be an option for me. I said I am interested in nipple sparing but that I am not interested in reconstruction. He seemed puzzled by this, as if he didn't understand the point of saving a nipple if I wasn't going to reconstruct a breast. I am very small breasted and am not strongly identified with my breasts, but if I have the option of saving a healthy body part, I would like to do so. I know there are some risks with nipple sparing mastectomy, and I am not so attached to my nipple that I would sacrifice my health or peace of mind for it. I have been unable to find any information on nipple sparing mastectomies without reconstruction. Is there anyone out there who has had this done? I would be very grateful if you were willing to share your experience and how you came to your decision. Thank you so much!
