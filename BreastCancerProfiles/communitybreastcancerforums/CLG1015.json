Two years ago a lesion was discovered in my right breast.  I have undergone multiple ultrasounds over the last two years for the area to be monitored for change.  Originally, the radiologist suggested a biopsy, but I have implants and the area needing a biopsy is too close to allow it without an elevated risk for puncturing the implants.  The doctor felt it was safer to monitor the area then proceed as needed if a change was apparent. Last week, my primary care doctor felt I should see a breast surgeon to follow up on all the ultrasounds and mammograms of the last two years rather than basing these decisions solely on the radiologist.  At her suggestion, I saw a breast surgeon who wanted ANOTHER ultrasound, even though my last one was five months ago.  She sent me to a specific radiologist she recommended, and I had the ultrasound last week.  That radiologist said there had been changes in the mass and she recommended an open surgical biopsy, which will be done after an ultrasound guided needle is placed in the area to lead the surgeon right to the spot.  The report indicates BIRADS 4, with the following: The 4 o clock lesion is heterogeneously hypoechoic and demonstrates new microlobulation as well as a peripheral hyperechoic rim.  The mass measures 0.5x 0.4x 0.8 cm.  There is associated posterior shadowing noted in the central portion of this mass.  I am recommending ultrasound guided wire localization followed by open surgical biopsy to exclude occult malignancy. I have the biopsy scheduled for Thursday morning, and was told two to three business days for the results.  Has anyone else had similar experiences with this and had a specific outcome?  I find I feel better the more informed I am, but I am also trying not to be an alarmist.  I just am concerned at this point and hearing from anyone with information definitely helps.  Thanks in advance for listening!
