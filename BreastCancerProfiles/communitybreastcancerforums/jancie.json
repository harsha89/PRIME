I had a SLN biopsy done about 2.5 weeks ago.  I have a little bit of lumpiness (hard) under my incision but that feels like more of scar tissue thing going on so I am lightly massaging that area.  However, I do have that \"cording thing\" going on where I have a tight tendon that is sticking out and highly visible under my arm pit.  I am attending a weekly lymphedema exercise class - just being proactive, I don't have lymphedema.  I showed the instructor my arm pit and she said that it was caused by doing too much so soon after surgery.  I told her that I wasn't doing to much, heck I stayed in bed for 3 days straight on pain meds sleeping 18 hours a day, etc. I guess when I felt I was really not doing anything, vacuuming, etc. that in fact I was doing too much and the key she said was that I was doing things that lifted my arm above my head higher than my shoulder.  She said to not lift my arm upright - to keep it at 90% - hard to explain but take your elbow and put it straight out to your side, it is no more than that height that my lower arm should be at any given time for the next 2 to 3 weeks and that will help soften that tight tendon. Going back to the \"I am not really doing anything\" just after I got diagnosed with BC, I worked at a horse barn doing 8 to 9 hours daily of hard intensive labor.  So to me, grooming my huge horse for one hour because she rolled in the mud yesterday was \"not doing much\" - however that 1/2 hour of using my left arm high above my head (I am really short and my horse is REALLY tall) aggravated that tendon and tightened it up. I don't want lymphedema and I know that it can flare up even years from now so I am going to do everything possible to be proactive and follows this instructor's advice 100%.",

It is not uncommon to have chemo first especially since you have a 5 CM area.  The good thing is that by doing chemo first - the oncologist can determine how well your body responds to chemo.  If your mass shrinks down alot during chemo then you know that your body is responding well. I had a 4 CM mass and had chemo first.  When it came time to do the lumpectomy the surgeon couldn't even feel my lump anymore.  By the 2nd chemo treatment he could already tell the lump was shrinking. Do you know if you are ER, PR postive or negative?  Her2 status?  Grade?  These answers would be on your pathology report.  Your oncologist will use that information to determine treatment. Once you do get a treatment plan put in place - I promise you - you will feel much better emotionally. ",

The problem with Mirtazapine is that you will want to sleep for 12 hours straight so if you get a prescription for it - think aboiut taking it the first time on a Friday night or any night where you can sleep in the next day.  It did wonders for me!!! I am now able to sleep on Ambien or valium again but while undergoing chemo - neither one of them worked for me. Just don't ever combine Ambien and Valium.",

I was having a really hard time on Taxol so they did offer to put me on Taxotere but I refused as there is a thread here on the board of some women that have suffered permanent hair loss due to Taxotere and I didn't want to take the chance.  Yes, the chance of suffering permanent hair loss is a small percentage but because I had gotten almost all of the side effects of chemo that you could possibly get, I didn't want to be another statistic. I was pumped full of steroids to counteract any allergic reaction to the chemo and ended up gaining 20 lbs , also I because extremely bitchy while on steroids so I avoided my husband, friends, etc. It has been suggested by many of the gals that you get your dental work done first.  Go in for a check up and get any cavities filled, etc. before you start chemo because chemo is hard on your teeth.  I was able to get a dental appointment with a dentist within 4 days when I explained to him I was going to start chemo - normally I would have had to wait 30 days or longer since he was a new dentist.",

I had 2 MRI's on my hip this year along with 4 sets of x-rays and they still can't figure out where this pain is coming from.  I am beginning to believe the tamoxifen might have something to do with it. I had 3 sets of chest x-rays done this year when I broke my ribs.  The great news is that if something was not right - it would show up. This past month I have had 3 sets of x-rays to my left arm and shoulder due to another accident - thankfully only fractured bones showed up. From what I understand from the doctors, the insurance companies are putting pressure on them to not order so many scans.  Personally I would get a full scan once a year if I can because it takes the worry away from me that the cancer might come back and I wouldn't know about it for months and months.",

I was weighed weekly during radiation because they are really careful about people gaining too much weight or losing too much in a 6 week period.  When they tattoo you for rads, they put those tattoos in the optimum place and weight gain as we all know or even drastic weight loss makes our boobs either shrink or get bigger and that would affect the radiation areas.",

My MRI came out with 2 additional spots in left breast, one lymph node looked like it might be abnormal and two spots in my right breast that were undetected in the mammogram. So I totally psyched myself of having to probably go with bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction. Had a second ultrasound today of both breasts.  The spots that were showing up in the MRI were insignificant according to the doctor and he didn't do any more biopsys.  I wasted a valium! Then I went on a website that was posted in another forum that showed pictures of what women look like when they get mastectomys, the reconstruction process, the filler things (I am tired and can't remember the name right now) and then finally the reconstruction.  It showed pictures using the DIEP method and the method where they take muscle and tissue off your back, implants, etc. I so DON'T want a mastectomy after looking at those pictures. I know I can't do a DIEP reconstruction because my stomach is totally flat.  I have no fat on my back and so my only route is really implants.  But looking at those pictures - I saw so many reconstruction jobs that were not done well at all. I am now dreading my appointment with the cancer panel tomorrow.  They have already gotten together and reviewed all of my test results, etc. and they have set a game plan in place for me as far as treatment goes. I know my breast surgeon said that the only way I could do a lumptectomy and radiation was to have chemo done first since I have small boobs and a 4CM tumor.  Ok, I can deal with the chemo if I need to but I am so not prepared for a mastectomy after looking at all of those pictures. I know being prepared for what you are going to look like after surgery is the smart thing to do but now I wish I remained ignorant. I feel like a kid now reacting in this manner and not a mature adult.  I am ticked off with myself for not being more mature about this. I don't know what my recurrence rate for the cancer coming back.  I want to LIVE by all means and will do what is necessary but dammit - this SUCKS! Never Alone - My TaTa Sisters are always with me!

I had chemo first to reduce the size so I could have a lumpectomy. The odds were the same either masectomy or chemo and lumpectomy. Every choice you make is a personal choice to be made by YOU. Not your friends, not your husband -this is about YOU and what YOU want. Once the lab results are available after biopsy and you get the grade, HER2 status, ER/PR status - all of that is taken in consideration when your oncologist gives you a treatment plan. Like you, I was scheduled to meet a surgeon the same day I had a biopsy. The radiologist was 99% sure it was cancerous. I was just glad to have a surgeon consult set up immediately. This is a hard time but as you can see there are so many women/men here to support you and help you with any questions or concerns you might have. Take that ativan!!!! Just because your tumor was large does not necessarily mean it is dangerous. Ok, would love to have another word other than dangerous come to mind but I can't think of it right now.

Marybe - Yes, I had Jose Heber do my hair one time.  He has a shop in Hollywood (LA), but he also goes to a shop in Dallas, Texas about 3 x per year and you have to book your appointment at least 6 months in advance to get in there.  He determines the color and the style and then has the stylists do your hair as he watches over them, he reviews what they have done and has them make adjustments, etc.  I told him I didn't want any color because (1) I didn't want to spend the money and (2) I had natural blonde hair.  Between the consultation fee and the haircut - the cost was around $230.  Mind you that was back in 1992.  I am sure the cost has risen quite a bit since then.  I LOVED what he did, the style was absolutely perfect for my face, age, etc. it was just too much work as I had to blow dry sections of my hair with a large roller brush to get it looking like he did it so I just let my hair grow out. Chelev - I WANT YOUR BANGS!!! BTW - A horse buddy of mine gave me a christmas gift last year of a soap product that exfoliates the skin.  A light bulb went off last week - what if I used that soap on my face to get rid of the peach fuzz growing on my cheeks from chemo?  Remember, I was the one that was too scared to shave.  I have used this product 5x now when I shower - just on my face and I scrub my face really good and the peach fuzz in finally disappearing.  It is not all gone but I would have to say 50% of it is gone!   If you want to try it - I found it online at www.bodycompletenow.com       You click on Skincare and it is called Sugar Creme Skin Smoother - size is 13.4 oz and it costs $13.95.  You could probably buy it in a local bath soap shop - I don't know.   She gave me the orange ginger smell one and it does smell good and it does make your skin feel smooth when you use it.  Oh and as little as I use this stuff will last me 3 years. Question - the top of my scalp is very tender.  I have a ton of hair (not long - just lots of it) so is the tenderness from the hair trying to grow or what?  The only time before I felt my scalp feeling tender was right before my hair started falling out from chemo.  This has been an on-going issue for weeks but kept forgetting to ask the question.",

I think I am going to hold off on doing anything with the facial fuzz.  I do have a $50 certificate at a spa - maybe I can have a facial done where they do a lot of exfoliating and it will come off?  I am scared to death to shave it.  My sister who had cancer shaved her moustache and it came back all prickly.  Didn't bother her until her young son asked her why her face was like his fathers.   I need to go shower and SHAVE THOSE DARN LEG HAIRS AGAIN!  I have always stopped at the top of my knees because my thigh hair was blonde and never long.  I looked down today and the hair on my thighs is not only DARK but 2\" long at least!",

I believe the eyelash/eyebrow fall out depends alot on what chemo you are getting and how your body reacts to chemo.  Mine came out sometime after my 6th chemo treatment.  To be honest I am not exactly sure when because I would refuse to look in a mirror and I hardly ever wore make up.  It wasn't until I tried to put on mascara one day that I noticed I didn't have any eyelashes.  For all I know, they could have disappeared 4 weeks earlier.",

Lisa - you made me laugh with FCWW.  I have gained 13 lbs since I started chemo.  I was a size 4 and am now a size 8.  Nothing fits but my fat pants (anything with an elastic waist). I have started walking 2 miles a day but it doesn't help if I come home and have a huge bowl of chocolate ice cream - I am 3 weeks PFC but still have food cravings.  They are so bad I think I am still on steroids.  I am getting so frustrated with my hair.  My hubby asked me why all of a sudden now I am obsessed with getting my hair back and I can only think is that before I was so sick during chemo that I could have cared less.  Now that I am feeling good, I want to look good. As far as what I have - just keep looking at Jaimieh's pictures and I look EXACTLY like her! I can't wait until it gets long enough so I can put some color in it.  Right now it looks like when I was born - PURE WHITE!  As white as a bride's dress.  At least if I had some color it might look like I had more hair but I don't think it is even 1/4 long yet but I shouldn't complain since I am only 3 weeks PFC.  It seems like I finished chemo months ago and I have to remember patience! I have a lumpectomy scheduled for Wednesday.  Looking forward to completing another stage of this fight against my cancer! Even though I might not respond much these days, I am reading up on ya'll and am enjoying reading about your individual journeys so keep on posting!",

I was told that by several people that until your body is rid of the chemo then the hair color won't turn out right.  This might be TMI but I was always able to tell I still had chemo in my body based on my urine, it had a strong odor and was bubbly.  Now my urine is back to where it was before chemo so I think I am finally past that point. I only ever colored my hair three times in the past and that was to put strawberry highlites in it.  I am going to be very cautious and have my stylist use a semi-permanent dye that doesn't have chemicals in it (or very few chemicals) as I don't want to damage what little hair I have.",

My hair came in white at first just like some of ya'lls did also.  I didn't shave off the white chemo hair.  Within 1 month after that, my hair started coming in a mousy brown/gray color and you couldn't really see the white at all.  In fact the first trim I got 3 months PFC, even the ends were no longer white.  I can't explain it - that is just what happened. I guess what I am saying is maybe not be in such a hurry to do a second shave.  We endure enough losing our hair the first time around, I can't imagine shaving what little hair I had growing even though it was white and a totally different texture.  Heck, CCBaby will remember way back when it was mentioned to do scalp massages to promote hair growth and I told her NO WAY AM I MASSAGING MY SCALP - I didn't want to lose not one single strand of hair!!! I did wait 6 months before I started \"frosting\" my hair.  I wanted the chemo poison to be totally out of my system.  The lady at the wig shop encouraged me to wait because when you still have chemo in your system then you stand a chance of the color coming out \"brassy\" like CCBaby mentioned earlier.  You need your hairdresser to understand your new chemo hair.   I was a natural blonde so I frosted my hair twice 4 weeks apart with the old fashioned frosting cap.  This was less damaging to my hair than to totally dye 100% of it.  After the 3rd frosting, I love my hair color now!    Years ago I dyed my hair a strawberry blonde and I remember my scalp burning so bad.  I am hesitant to go that route again.  I would rather color the tips and leave the roots alone for now.",

When you are doing TCH - I don't know if you have a choice of Taxotere or Taxol.  I don't know if Taxol works with Carboplatin (spelling?) and Herceptin.   I just googled chemo drugs (sorry cut and paste doesn't work with my Mozilla) but the website www.tirgan.com has a list of all of the chemo drugs and side effects.

I didn't realize how good my hair could look blowing it dry with a roller brush in sections.  Maybe you can schedule a hair appointment and ask them to dry/style it this way and see how it comes out.  If I lived near you I would be there in a heartbeat to show you how to do it. It is hard doing the back of my head - I can't see what I am doing at all so I have to stop and get the mirror out and make adjustments on some of the sections but I am getting better at it each time.  Right now I am thrilled that I have a cute short haircut.  I also use a product made by FX Special Effects - molding wax.  I put a little bit on the tips of my fingers and rub it lightly on the top of my hair as you don't want to get a glob of it anywhere, then put a little bit more on my finger tips and go for another section.  Then I can start pulling and shaping my hair the way I want to and the great thing about this stuff is that  your hair never feels sticky, waxy, pasty, or how it feels if you put hairspray on it.  Your hair feels totally natural.  I have tried other products and have given them away but this stuff - dang it is good.  I got mine at Walgrens for $4 and I am still on the first can (I can't think of a better word) - but long story short, one small container lasts me 3 months or longer. ",

I will say this, the product has become popular in the last 5 years as you can buy it at most grocery stores in the regular shampoo aisle, they wouldn't sell it there if it were not safe for humans.  I tried the more expensive shampoos on my horse and they failed to produce the same results.  You can get a HUGE bottle of it at Target for around $6 for 32 oz.  That sure has got to be a heck of a lot cheaper than buying Nioxin - but whatever anyone feels like using - it is all a matter of personal choice.  I have been using Mane and Tail for about 2 weeks now and I am noticing hair growth even though I am still doing chemo and more hair growth than I thought I would have at this time.",

Like Jaimieh - my hair is laying flat on my head but a little bit longer (not much though) and I am wondering if this is a sign that I won't get chemo curls?  When you get chemo curls do they happen right away?  I am thinking that some of my hair is long enough to curl by now.  Personally I would like straighter hair as it looks longer than curly hair.  My hair is also a mixture of gray and white hairs. Someone on my stepfamily board suggested that maybe I put some colored mouse in it to see how it would look.  Sounds great except when you are dealing with 102 degree weather and your head is sweating!!  I can just picture mouse color on my hat and shirt as I drip with sweat from this heat. ",

You can go to Whole Foods and purchase natural dye products which is what I am planning on doing the first couple of times.  Yes, they do cost more - about $15 per box from what I have seen but if that will prevent any damage to my newly grown hair then that is what I will use until my hair gets to about 2\" long and then I am going to use semi-permanent hair color but again, that is just my personal plan that works for me.",

My hair has come back in thicker.  The hair used to be baby fine and now the hair shafts are thicker.  My hair felt a little bit course the other night so I went back to my pre-chemo routine of using Dawn first and my hair felt so very soft last night that I was having a hard time keeping my fingers out of it. There are quite a few of us taking Biotin - it is a supplement in a pill form.  The typical dosage is 10,000 mcg per day so look at the mcg amount when you buy it because I saw some at Target that were only 1,000 mcg which would have meant I would have had to take 10 pills per day and I am not going to do that.  I get mine from a speciality health and nutrition store - same place where I got my aloe vera gel (100% natural) for my radiation and some women here are using it on their scalps to promote growth.  I used it once and I didn't like the sticky factor of it so I haven't personally used it since but I could see where it would be great to use as a gel to spike up your hair!",

I had been trying to find a rack with pegs that you would hang baseball type hats on that mounted on a wall with round pegs on the end for the purpose of hanging up my wigs.  I have 3 cats and the last thing I needed was to put them on wig stands and have my cats nest in them. I went to Target and couldn't find anything so I headed to Home Depot.  I found an older gentleman (around 60\" - grandfather type man) and asked him for assistance.  He showed me a shelf with dowels but the dowels were straight and I was worried about damage to the interior of the wig so I asked him if they had different dowels I could change out. We went over to that section of the store and they didn't have anything.  I FINALLY told him that I was starting chemo next week and I needed something to hang my wigs so I needed something round on the end.  So he took me to kitchen cabinet hardware and showed me a \"round pull\" and I said that would be excellent. He then started asking me if I needed anything fancy, how many wigs, how far apart the spacing, etc. He started writing all of this down.  He then said \"go eat breakfast and come back in an hour\" I looked at him and said \"are you saying that you are going to make this for me?\"  He said \"yes\" I started bawling like a baby because I just could not believe this man was going to go out of his way and have this made for me. I gave him a huge hug and said thanks. I came back an hour later with my stepson and he showed me what they had made and it was PERFECT.  I then started crying again because of his compassion and generousity.  He then said the store manager wanted to meet me so I met him and started crying even harder thanking him for going way above and beyond, etc. They wouldn't even let me pay for it - they took an hour of their time, their materials and gave it to me free. I can tell you this.....I have shopped Home Depot for years but from now on I will not be shopping at Lowes - I am giving all of my business to Home Depot. There are truly wonderful people that you meet in this world that are kind and compassionate.",

I am trying to grow my hair long again - at least get it to my shoulders so only the very tips will be trimmed off. As far as the wild neck hairs - I have a pair of doggy clippers and actually took them to the lady at the wig shop about 3 weeks ago and she trimmed the back of my neck because it was so uneven.  I had hair growing really down low on my neck that was not what I call \"scalp hair\" and it made a huge difference when she shaved that area. I know it costs more but my personal opinion is that you should go to a styling salon and pay the $45 to $50 instead of one of these fast clip places (super cuts, etc.).  Sorry, I don't mean to knock those places down but I have gotten nothing but butcher jobs at those types of places and I end up regretting trying to save money and dealing with a very poor trim. On the other hand, I went to an expensive styling salon prior to chemo and told the lady that I wanted my hair layered throughout.  She just didn't get it at all.  I was concerned because she was 20 years old - not enough experience as far as I was concerned but since I didn't have a regular stylist, I didn't have much choice.  The only reason I didn't get really upset was the fact I was using a gift certificate and it wasn't any money out of my own pocket.",

I haven't put any color in for 4 months now as I am giving my hair a rest over the summer.  I was so hoping that the sun would naturally bleach it as it has in the past but I guess I am not in the sun as much as before because it isn't doing anything for my hair. As far as counting how many weeks you are - you start with the last day of treatment.  At least that is what most everyone has done in the past.  I finished chemo the end of May 2008 and my hair is past my shoulders by about 3\".  Keep in mind I have gotten baby trims every 8 weeks so it would be a couple of inches longer if I never trimmed it.",

I have MIA again but had a lumpectomy last week and am feeling back to normal again.  I would post more on this site but it takes FOREVER for the pages to load and I don't have much patience these days.  Go figure!  Must be the after effects of chemo. I still haven't taken the time to figure out how to post pictures, again no patience at this time to even try it. Now I am looking like Chelez's avatar!  The white is gone and now I have a 5 o'clock shadow on my scalf.  I am 4-12 weeks PFC.  I am taking 10,000 mcg of biotin per day and am using Mane and Tail shampoo.  My hubby can't believe how much my hair has grown the past 2 weeks and I have always had very slow growing hair.  I have a friend here locally that is 3-1/2 weeks PFC and she barely has any stubble.  I don't know if it is the biotin and shampoo that is helping so much or what.  I was using the shampoo on my scalp for about 3 weeks before I even started noticing some hair growth.  I wish the hair fairy would come visit me!  At least now I am no longer embarrassed to go without a cap in my own home in front of my hubby and stepson. Although I love my collection of 7 wigs, I am ready to ditch them because of the heat.  I can only wear them for about 3 hours and then I have major hot flashes. Love reading about ALL of you and here is to a good hair day!! ",

My hair is growing in spurts.  And I was so glad to see some growth today in the bang area even if it is just nubbies right now. I am glad that your dh noticed that your hair grew overnight!  Most men don't notice those things and I am sure it made you feel really good. Funny is that I never looked in mirrors before - I could have cared less - didn't need to see what I looked like but now I can't pass a mirror without looking to see if I have hair growth! It is liking watching that pot of water come to a boil.  Watching it won't make it boil any faster but still I am there watching my hair hoping that it will grow right before my eyes. ",

From what I have read here on the boards - the problem with Rogaine is that once you stop using it, the hair falls out so I personally would steer away from that product.

Some people have mentioned using Latisse to get their eyelashes back in and then they also put it on their eyebrow line.  It is very expensive (at least for me) so I didn't bother.  But the ones that have mentioned Latisse have all had positive comments about it (well....as far as I remember since I have chemo brain still).",

Due to my small breast size and large tumor a lumpectomy and radiation is not an option for me.  The surgeon started talking chemo and I just lost it.  Thankfully my husband was with me because I don't remember anything after the word Chemo was said. Since I really don't want a masectomy he said I would have to do chemo firs to try to shrink the tumor to where it wouldn't be so disfiguring to do a lumpectomy. Ok, this I can understand but that doesn't mean I wanted to hear this. He suggested that I go in front of the cancer review board next Thursday and get an opinion from them before making any decisions.  I will meet one on one with an oncologist, pathologist, emphedema specialist, general surgeon, plastic surgeon, etc. He also scheduled an MRI and bone scan.  I am having those done tomorrow. I asked for pain meds and valium and he said that he wanted me to go to my general practioner for those.  Of course I called that doctor immediately and was able to see him today. He gave me a prescription for 180 valium and 20 Lortab.  YIPPPEEEEE.  I am going to take a valium before I get my MRI and bone scan test done.  I need something to take the edge off since I am having anxiety attacks over this crap! My regular doctor also told me that WHATEVER the cancer review board recommended is what I need to follow even it that means chemo, masectomy, radiation and then reconstruction. So my question if any of you are on tonight is why can't they just do masectomy's on both breasts and immediate reconstruction.  A friend of mine that got breast cancer back in 1984 did this and her cancer hasn't come back.  Unfortunately I have been out of touch with her since I moved to Utah and have no means of reaching her now to ask her. I guess it all depends on what kind of cancer and how far it has spread?  She didn't know she had cancer until she noticed discharge coming out of her nipples which means to me that it had to have been pretty advanced? I so wish I didn't have to wait until next Thursday to speak to the cancer panel.  This waiting and pre-testing is so hard.  I just want a game plan established and get a move on with this horrible thing invading my body. I have resigned myself to the fact that I might lose my boobs and I might lose my hair.  If that is the case then I had better in the least get some bigger and better boobs out of the deal!  If not, then where is the silver lining other than the fact that I get to keep on living? I so need to take a valium right now.",

I can't believe you did an eventing trial 5 weeks after chemo.   Are you crazy???

What limited information I do know is that you really need to be able to read and understand your pathology report.  There is a wealth of information here that explains about the hormone receptors and what it means to be positive or negative.  It is good news if you are estrogen positive but bad news if you are HER2 positive.  I never even heard of those terms until I got a copy of my pathology report and started doing some research here in all of the different forums.

The surgeon was a \"general surgeon\" but he specializes in breast surgery.  I don't NEED any reconstruction but I am going to go ahead and get my breasts lifted just because I can and they tend to droop when you are 50 years old.   If you have any questions when you start chemo - let me know.  I am more than happy to help you.   Funny story though - everyone kept telling me DRINK WATER DRINK WATER DRINK WATER to flush out the chemo.  I hate drinking water.  My thought was \"if I flush out the chemo then I am not leaving it in my body long enough to work - I want that chemo working\"  Ok, wrong response but it didn't harm me to not drink water.   Yes, it is better to drink water and keep hydrated.  Just wish I could tolerate the stuff.  I figure coffee is nothing more than flavored water.  I know the caffeine does dehydrate your body but I can't live without my coffee.",

One of the standard protocols for radiation is to go 5 weeks Mon-Friday and then the 6th week they do a booster radiation for 5 days.  30 treatments in all of rads.  Rads was probably the easiest for me as far as SE but I got so darn fatigued by the rads - each week it was more and more difficult for me to get anything done.  The last 3 weeks of rads I was sleeping at least 14 hours a day.  Not everyone gets the fatigue to the point I did but do know you will get tired and it is cummulative - in other words the fatigue gets worse as you go along.  I would have to say from reading here for the past 1.5 years is that the standard for rads is 25 to 30 treatments.",

My MRI results were not good.  They found 2 areas of \"enhancement\" in my left breast where my tumor is that they did not see in the ultrasound.  They also found 2 areas in my right breast.  There is one lymph node that might be abnormal. I was immediately scheduled for another ultrasound on both breasts and more biopsys.  Having endured this procedure once already and the pain associated with it you can imagine the anxiety I am feeling right now.  I am having this procedure done on Tuesday so the results should be available to the cancer board on Thursday. I am shocked that I have not become a total basket case.  I guess I have come to terms and acceptance that this is what I have to deal with.  I have emotionally accepted the fact that I am going to lose my hair and my boobs.  However, I know that when the time actually comes I probably will be in a totally different mindset.  It is like death - even though you know it is going to happen, when it actually happens that fact that you knew about it and expected it doesn't make the event any easier to deal with. I have never questioned \"why me\" because I have looked at it more from the angle of \"why NOT me?\"  I am no different than any other woman, I am not special and chit just happens. My general surgeon made a statement that had a huge impact which was \"you need to be concerned about living because that is our goal - for you to LIVE\".  He said that when I lost it when he mentioned that I more than likely would have to go through chemo. I want to LIVE.  I will do whatever surgical and drug methods I need to do in order to survive this.  I can't thank ya'll enough for the emotional support that you have provided me.  I love the fact that all of you share your personal experiences based on your own personal thoughts. I don't think I could handle it if all I read was responses that said 'CUT IT OUT, CUT IT OUT\"  I think you know what I mean.  ALL of you realize that everyone's decision is their own to make and you don't try to persuade any of us to make a certain decision based on your own decision and how you felt when you found out that you had cancer.  I think this is what makes this board and the people here very special.  Instead of browbeating us newbies to make certain decisions that you would personally make yourself,  instead you help provide us with the necessary information that we need to make our OWN decision. Hugs to all of you!",

I am also very heavily leaning towards getting implants as my reconstruction method. I don't want to end up with lopsided, uneven breasts.  If I have to endure all of this crap, I might as well have some great boobs in the end!",

One day I am fine and the next day I can't stop crying.  I know that treatment options have come so far in the last 20 years.  I just never thought that I would have to deal with this personally.

I had no lymph node involvement even though my tumor was fairly large before it was detected as I never did self breast exams nor had I been to a doctor in over 10 years.  Because I was Grade 1 - my tumor grew very slowly.  However due to the size - my stage ended up being a IIA. The staging is done based on lymph node involvement and size of tumor.  In your case where IDC and DCIS is involved, the staging will be based on the size of the IDC tumor - irregardless of what size the DCIS area is.  At least that is what I have always understood and I am sure if I am wrong someone will come right behind me and correct me.  Take a deep breath - there are wonderful ladies here that will always have your back!",

I also bought two wigs by Jon Renau (Angelique and Bebe) and I thought initially that I would like it the most because you couldn't see a \"part\" in the wig because of the way they weaved the hair in but it seems too poofy on top now versus the other ones.  It has a \"teased look\" at the part line and since I lived in Dallas for 20 years you would think that I am used to \"big hair\" I have two of them that were more expensive ($120.00) that has no part line so to speak and they ended up being my least favorite.  I doubt I will wear those very often. I bought a couple of cute hats and scarves at Target last week.  You can buy the Large square scarves and tie those back easily.  I have found the smaller ones (paisley print) type are not large enough to tie nicely - sorry but I have chemo fog and I can't remember the name of those type of scarves but they come in all colors - they are cotton and they have a paisley type print on them.",

My husband is going with me for the ultrasound on Tuesday and also on Thursday when I speak to the cancer panel.  I asked him to come because I would forget half of what they tell me and also he is GREAT at remembering and taking notes. A funny but sad story, my mare had colic surgery years ago and my husband went with me to the vets to check on her.  The vet came out to talk to me and I was hysterical, crying, etc. because she meant so much to me and the chances of her surviving this surgery was only 50/50.  The vet took one look at me and then started talking to my husband about the procedures, recovery, etc.  My husband knows NOTHING about horses but the vet knew immediately that I wasn't going to retain one word that he said to me when I was so upset.  My dear husband repeated word for word exactly what the vet had said the next day when I had calmed down.  I still laugh when I think about it because here is my husband asking the vet intelligent questions and yet knows nothing at all about horses or colic but somehow he knew what questions he should ask. I am glad that your Aunt got you moving in the right direction!  You have kids to think about and she was making sure you remembered what is important in your life and what you have to live for. I have a wonderful husband and a beautiful filly to live for.  My mare ended up dying but I do have her filly that means the world to me and I couldn't have my filly suffer the loss of her mom and me both. The valium is taking the edge off when needed and I am sleeping well at night.  I need to remain as physically strong as possible and get plenty of rest prior to starting my journey of surgery, chemo, etc. I know I will feel so much better emotionally once I find out if this cancer has progressed past my breasts into other areas of the body.  I just need to know - hard to explain but I like having a very structured type life so knowing all of the facts are important to me. thanks for everything!",

I am very fortunate to be dealing with a breast care center and not doing this individually.  The breast care center gave me a 3\" 3-ring binder full of information with questions to ask the surgeon, the oncologists, etc.  I have the option of talking to the breast cancer panel which includes specialists in oncology, plastic surgery, RN's, and lympedema experts.  There is a special clinic just for lymphedema on how to try to prevent this side effect, what exercises to do, etc.  They are also putting me in touch with a local BC support group that meets at the hospital weekly.  I have an assigned RN who is a clinical coordinator of breast care cancer services.  She is my go-to person on all questions day or night. I have looked at the information provided on reconstruction.  I don't think any type of Tram Flap, or buttock flap will be an option due to (1) I have been smoking for 20 years - 1/2 pack a day and (2) I don't have anything extra available to take out.  Being very lean isn't a lot of help right now. What amazes me is the fact that I feel so healthy.  I haven't felt this way in so many years until about 1 year ago when I started working at a horse barn 8 hours a day doing manual labor.  In one day I typically lift approximately 2,000 lbs over the course of 8 hours.  I had lost the 30 lbs I had gained over the last 10 years and am back to a size 4.  I haven't been sick nor been to a doctor in about 8 years other than for horse related injuries. I am determined to take this one step at a time, one day at a time.  Yes, I am scared but I am going to find a way to muster the strength to get through this and I  know I can do this with ya'lls help. Thanks again!  I will update tomorrow after my appointment with the general surgeon.",

As women we feel like we have to be strong and in most cases we are - we seem to put up a brave front to others when we are really scared to death. I remember when I was first dx'd.  I went from anger, sad, crying, numb, back to anger, sad, crying, numbness and the cycle went on and on. Once I got into treatment I felt better because I knew then that I was killing the cancer - I had a plan and we all like to have plans! At the end of my treatment I felt a huge letdown however, I was expecting this from talking to other women.  You go through months of killing the cancer, treatment is over and now what are we supposed to do?  The last year was filled with doctor appointments, seeing our oncologists, radiologists, breast surgeons, chemo, radiation, surgeries, etc. and then it all stops except for Tamoxifen or an AI.  But life does go on and we learn to live with it.  For some people it takes longer than others. Whatever you do, don't beat yourself up.  You are allowed your emotions, your pity parties, your crying spells or whatever.",

The chemo I am taking is Adriamycin and Cytoxin followed by Taxol.  I totally trust my oncologist and he was highly recommended to me by so many people. Yes, there are many of us that smoke and nothing ticks me off more than to have a doctor refuse to provide a service because we smoke.  I have had numerous operations in the past and it did not delay my healing process one iota.  I do agree that smoking will restrict the blood vessels for certain types of reconstruction surgery which is why if I were going to have a masectomy I would have chosen implants for that reason and also the fact that I am too thin to take fat from anywhere else in my body and besides to me it would be a less invasive way to recreate boobs versus cutting another part of your body but that is my own personal opinion and there are upsides and downsides to all of the reconstruction options out there, again it is all a matter of your own personal choice and what feels best for YOU.",

When I am having a rough day the pain migrates from my hips to my knees and then down my shins so my entire lower body hurts bad. I am still on Tamoxifen and likely will be for another 4 years as my oncologist wants me on it for 10 years. At this point I don't think going off Tamoxifen is going to give me any relief whatsoever. I now work as a mail carrier so come rain or shine I am delivering mail and that includes lots of snowy days (although not much snow in Utah this year). I take 2 percocet each morning when I start work and 2 at night but mind you I am taking (2) 10/325 which is a hefty dose. I tend to hurt less when I am active. The 2 days a week I don't work I hurt so much more because I am not moving as much. Using a heating pad at night when my knees and shins are killing me tends to help - at least it soothes the pain somewhat so I can sleep. Working is the only thing that keeps me going. I still have tendencies to go into a deep depression due to the pain where all I want to do is stay in bed for days on end. My job doesn't allow me to do this and I think it is probably saved my sanity because I am forced to get out of bed in the mornings. You don't get the luxury of calling in \"sick\" when you deliver mail for a living. I wish there was an answer to this chronic pain but it is a condition that I am learning to live with albeit very difficult at times.  ",

The hardest part of this journey for me and for the other women was the period of waiting between finding out the results and starting treatment.  I swear once you have a plan in place, it is so much easier on you mentally.  The journey is not easy but just knowing what steps are being taken and when the next step starts eases your mind so much. Once I started chemo, I knew exactly when surgery would happen, when radiation would start, etc.  Now I know that 2 weeks from Monday I will be seeing my oncologist and breast surgeon again and start on Tamoxifen so I still have a game plan in place and that makes me feel so much better.  ",

I did ok on adriamycin - lost my sense of taste which only ticked me off when chocolate started tasting bad. On taxol - had pretty major joint pain but did not get neuropathy.  My nails did not fall off - did lift a little bit off the nail beds but never fell off.  You just don't know ahead of time what kind of SE's you are going to get. I didn't get the port and looking back I wish I had.  My veins are destroyed from chemo which doesn't sound bad until you end up in the ER and have 9 bruises up and down your arms because they can't hit a vein. My hair started growing back while I was on Taxol.  It never grows back fast enough.  By 6 months I had enough hair to get a baby trim to get rid of the scraggley ends - my hair didn't even look as good as a pixie cut but now it is down to my bra line and I am happy. I was vain - I only went out in public in wigs.  I bought 7 of them so I could have fun with them.  All different colors and styles so each day it was \"ok, who do I want to look like today?\"  I was also fortunate that I had enough hair that I could ditch my wigs in summer when it got too hot. The one thing that surprised me was the lack of nose hairs and what that does.  You nose just drips all of the time as there is nothing there to catch the drips so you need to keep kleenex or a hanky on hand. I might think of more later but I am tired right now.",

I am glad that you caught it early and can do a lumpectomy.  Is your doctor going to order additional tests such as a bone scan, lymph node biopsy, etc?  It is important to your final treatment plan to know if the cancer has spread at all.  I was fortunate that my cancer is contained within my breast but am still going through chemo to try to reduce the size of the tumor so that hopefully I can get a lumpectomy. Valium has become my new best friend!  Unfortunately I can't type worth a crap when it is still in my system and have to keep backspacking every other word.  My doctor gave me a prescription for 10 mg Valium - I would not even attempt to drive on it - so be very cautious.   It makes me quite loopy and so very relaxed",

I agree the waiting is a nightmare.  Then once you get your DX - you have to wait and see how you are going to be treated - it goes on and on.  On top of that there is a waiting period between treatments - you could be doing surgery first then wait 3 weeks to do chemo or radiation depending on what your treatment is. I have 4 periods of treatment in which I have to wait 3 weeks between the different types of treatment.  It is during this time I feel like I am sitting here not doing anything at all to battle my cancer and it drives me crazy.  But your body has to heal in between all of this. Let us know what your results are.  You will find a wealth of support and information at this site.",

I have this issue from chemo.  I had a procedure 4 weeks ago where they filled up my bladder with saline, scoped it, took pictures, etc.  Ends up I have pinpoint bleeding on my bladder wall - glomurulations is what they call it.  I was prescribed a med that I need to pick up at Target - my urologist first had me get CystoProtek from Amazon - it is a supplement type medication. That didn't work so I am going to start this new med that she generally does not prescribe because it is $1,075 for 3 months but luckily I have good insurance. The only SE I had was sex was extremely painful and I do mean like a knife sticking inside of me and so my gyno sent me to the urologist.  I had been complaining about this issue ever since I finished up with chemo. I would definately go see a urologist if you can.",

I asked my radiologist about the 3 weeks versus 6 weeks rads and how do they compute who gets what treatment.  I was curious because the chemo killed my tumor (shrunk it down to nothing) and I had no lymph node involvement. The doctor told me that some radiologists will do the complete radiation in 3 weeks but they will give you a stronger dosage so in essence, you get the same amount of radiation in less time but according to her (doctor) she preferred to do the radiation over 6 weeks as it was less damaging to the skin.  I will get 5 weeks of whole breast radiation and the last week will be booster radiation where they radiate a certain area of my breast only. I was also told that they will continue to weigh me weekly as most breasts do get larger when you gain weight and they want to make sure they are still pinpointing the correct area.  This is also one  reason they are doing weekly x-rays if I understood her correctly.   The doctor wants to make sure that she is hitting the target area and it is a doublecheck feature. My nipple is already tender but I was told that was to be expected as the nipple is extremely sensitive.  I guess no different than when I would lay out in the sun without a top on - but I always made sure I put plenty of sunscreen on my nipples. I am having such a hard time getting up in the mornings since I started radiation and I have only completed one week so far.  I can only imagine how I am going to feel by week 3.",

I know it is hard to ask for help - but DO ASK FOR HELP!  If someone volunteers to help you - take them up on it! For me that was also difficult as I prided myself on being superwoman - working 9 hours a day, keeping my house clean, grocery shopping, raising two stepchildren, etc.  I was so very independent. I had to become humble and realize that I could no longer do it all myself and days when I felt like crap - my dh had to grocery shop, cook, or bring something hope for us.  I had to learn to depend on him which was very difficult for me as I never wanted to ever be dependent on a man. After about 1 month - I sucked it up and took all of the help I could get and was very thankful to have friends that would bring me meals twice a week for 4 months while I was doing chemo. You don't know how you are going to feel anymore than the doctor really knows how your system is going to react so at least for the first appointment - have a friend drive you and stay there with you and if it were me I would also make arrangements to have your children picked up if your dh can't do so. I managed to get myself to and from the hospital for my infusions but not everyone can.  I did have my dh go with me the first time and if he wasn't available I sure would have had a friend go with me.  I didn't quite know what to expect and I needed a support system.",

Then I was sent up to surgery - don't remember much of that because they finally put me out like a light! However, fair warning - be careful of what you do on the side where they are doing the biopsy because you can get cording if you overdue it too soon.  Be gentle with that arm and side for 10 days or so.  I started feeling good and went out and groomed my horse (hand way above my head in a circular motion) and got cording from something I thought was easy \"lazy\" work.  So I rested up for another 10 days and the cording went away.

I was told not to put any lotions on my skin before radiation but using 100% pure Aloe afterwards would help.  You have to be careful with Aloe gel as the stuff they sell at Target, etc. does have some drying agents in there per the pharmacist so I plan to go to a health nutrition store to get my aloe gel. ",

If I am angry, I tell my husband to stay clear of me.  When I want him near, I tell him.  I only answer the phone when I feel like it.  There are days I want to talk and other days I don't want to even get on my computer other than to read but not to post.  Today is a posting day   Yesterday was not.  Neither will tomorrow and then I will be off line until Monday around midnight.

Here I am now 30 lbs heavier because of chemo treatments.  I am a lug now whereas before I was working a strenious labor job for 8 to 9 hours per day, lifting upwards of 2,000 lbs over the course of a day and was even starting to get a 6pack on my stomach.  Yippppeeeee!  I had never felt and looked so darn good in my life and WHAM.....I have BC.

I had chemo, lumpectomy and then radiation.  My knee jerk reaction when dx'd was to \"cut them off - both of them\" but when I learned that my survival rate was the same lumpectomy/radiation versus masectomy - I decided for myself that I wanted a less invasive surgery.  I am happy with my decision and have no regrets 2 years later. Some women don't have the option of rads because it is daily for 5-6 weeks and they might live too far away from a major hospital so their choice is going to be masectomy.  Sounds like you have a choice which is great. My tumor was 4 cm to start (size of a ping pong ball) and by the time I went into surgery the breast surgeon couldn't even feel it.  I did have a sentinal lymph node biopsy done prior to starting chemo as that was the only way we could tell if the cancer went into the lymph nodes.  Once you do chemo - it can hide those results.  The good thing about doing chemo ahead of the lumpectomy is that I found out for me that my body really responds well to chemo. Anxiety issues???  Ask for ativan, lorazepam, diazepam (valium) and also some sleep medication.  I take ambien nightly and lorazepam as needed for anxiety attacks.  Never could get the doctor to prescribe ambien, etc. until I got cancer and then they had no problem writing out those slips.",
