How small should the tumor be before it can be removed and Is it the usual way to proceed usualy chemo and then surgery ?   I want to really thank everyone for support and for clearing up some of the questions i had.

I am still very confused about that.. Does it mean she has a malignant tumor ? Does it mean he suspects it is ? If the specialist said its cancer does it mean really low chance of it being B9 ? I guess biopsy is the sure way to know what we are dealing with? But after doctors visit it feels like we are diagnosed partially and not the diagnosis I was looking for.  Another thing that worried me more is the PET test does that mean doc suspects spread of cancer ? Pardon me if I don't make sense or not expressing myself properly.  @Barbe1958  Thanks for explaining that to me I didn't think of it that way.. It is logical that the tumor size remained the same or it grewa bit but didn't double because it was measured with mammo  (4cm) on 25th of may and the actual lump felt bigger (9cm) on examination by doc today...  ",

After the visit she feels more strong and composed don't know if its just a brave front. Don't know how to interpret lack of information or reassurance from the doctor. Maybe its his style of work or there is something terrible going on and he did not want to alarm her and doing best he can. Excuse me if it doesn't make sense or I am just rumbling.
