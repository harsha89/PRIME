    "Content": "Beachnme wrote: Hi Everyone! I'm 57 and  was diagnosed in Dec 2010 with DCIS in one breast and opted for a bilateral mastectomy with no reconstruction. I never planned on wearing any prosthetics, but one thing lead to another and I ended up with some very expensive boobs and bra. I was taken advantage of and ended up paying about $300 more than I should have for  2 boobs and 1 bra, something I could have on hand, you know for that cute little black cocktail dress-lol. I did end up finding some great ladies who just started selling post mastectomy products and have been helping them whenever I can. We have even started taking gently used items (bras & prosthetics) so we can help those in need ,they have even inspired me to become a fitter. I'm appalled at the price of these products and how so many women are taken advantage of when they are most vulnerable. I hope if you are out looking for mastectomy products you shop around and find someone who is a certified fitter and can help you feel and look your best. Log in to post a reply",
