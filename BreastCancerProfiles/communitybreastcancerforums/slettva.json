    "Content": "slettva wrote: I started chemo in April 2008 and have had my 3rd treatment. I am taking Taxotere and Cytoxan. I started my period the day before my last treatment and have been bleeding, sometimes very heavily at times, ever since. I am on my 12th day. My oncologist says this has happened before in some cases as the chemo can create a hormonal imbalance and he cannot give me anything since my breast cancer is ER/PR positive. Everyone else I have talked to in my local support group said their periods just stopped. Has anyone else had this problem? Log in to post a reply",
