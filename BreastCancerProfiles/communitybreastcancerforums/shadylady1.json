My radiologist watched them for a year and I was checked every 6 months. She thought the calcifications were damage from radiation. When they started growing, she biopsied them and it was nothing. It's just using an X-ray or 3d imagery rather than ultrasound. I have had both. Not much difference but it can be due to the location of the calcifications. Wishing you the best!
