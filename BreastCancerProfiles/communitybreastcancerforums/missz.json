      "Content": "missz wrote: Hi....new here. I went in for my first ever baseline mammogram today. After they looked at the films the doctor did an ultrasound as he thought I might have a cyst. I saw it- rough edges, not a solid looking mass- he said it didn't look like a cyst but aspirated it to be sure. No fluid- not a cyst. So he did a needle biopsy. This is all out of the blue to me. My maternal grandma had breast cancer but I was told, as long as it's not mom or sister, mammograms usually start at 40 (I am 37). I was never told nor had I read about the link to colon cancer- found that out today. My mom had Stage 4 colon cancer which almost killed her. I'm terrified. I won't hear anything for two days. My boyfriend lives across the country and I can't find him. My mom's across the country too and I don't want to scare her. My friends are being great but I'm just losing it. Log in to post a reply",

Then I had surgical consult #3 today and HE said I could 50% do that, 50% have it needle biopsied again or possibly vacuum biopsied. At this point my head is spinning and I don't know what to do. Is it common for biopsies to completely miss? My ultrasound shows the needle going right through the mass. I just want this over with and the thought of biopsy after biopsy is really stressful- but so is surgery. Log in to post a reply",
