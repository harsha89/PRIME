It's relieving to know that I can actually have a benign condition at this age without any tell-tale signs besides a lump. Past experience with this radiologist indicates that if they don't call me the day after results are ready, it's business as \"usual\" and I can follow-up with my doctor. If I don't hear from them or my doctor by Friday, I'll call my doctor. According to the ACR, radiologists should call the PCP, in addition to sending a report, when there is a Bi-rad 0, 4 or 5 and the radiologist's office called me directly the day after my Bi-rad 0 - I'm gonna let that get me through to Friday without stressing too much.",

I almost fainted with relief because of the stress of not knowing and formulating all sorts of bad scenarios and outcomes in my head. It worries me because I really don't know how I'd handle it now if the results were different. I could only hope I'd be as brave and strong as the women here on this site.",
