I will definitely look into the hospital social worker for financial advice. There sure isn't a lot of help out there for people that are insured but have a high deductible it seems. You gave me a lot of hope for getting through the chemo treatments as well. Luckily I don't have children to worry about, just a dog (that acts like 5 kids). You are right about the first thing your mind goes to is the movies and how horrible it seems for them. I have to remind myself IT IS A MOVIE. How often did you do treatments? Were you able to work the day after? How long in between did you have? If you don't mind me asking and I hope I'm not getting to personal for you, it looks like you did the lumpectomy first then did the mastectomy? What changed for you? How did you come to that decision? Now I have 50 more questions for you! Sorry! And once again, thank you for putting my mind a little more at ease over the bomb that was dropped known as chemo.",

Just diagnosed on 9/23/13 with IDC, grade 3, stage 1. After seeing the surgeon, the BRCA testing (still waiting on results), MRI and Oncologist in the last week it has been a whirlwind. I have never had to pull out my insurance card so many times. Surgeon received the results from MRI testing and said it looked like it has gone to lymph nodes. In all my reading I knew that meant chemo was a grave possibility now. After seeing the MRI results she staged it as II instead of one with the tumor being 3.1 instead of the originally thought 2.3. Oncologist said she would definitely recommend chemo due to my age (39) which is the one thing that I am absolutely afraid of. That made it REAL for me. Yesterday was a tough day. When I found out I really was ok and having to explain it to co-workers and friends and family seemed to make it a little more tolerable. I read absolutely everything I could find from books to internet and whatever I could find at various doctors offices. None of it prepared me for hearing the words \"You definitely should do the chemo\" come out of the oncologists mouth. The surgeon discussed lumpectomy vs. mastectomy and I was for sure in my mind doing the lumpectomy with radiation UNLESS the BRCA results were positive. I would do the mastectomy if I could take the time off work and not go into bankruptcy. I am fortunate enough to be insured but there is a huge deductible and like most people I live paycheck to paycheck. Anyway, just wondering if anyone else has been in the limbo of whether to do chemo or not and how they came to decide whatever the decision was for themselves. Have not scheduled the surgery yet as I'm still waiting on the BRCA results to make the decision on what kind of surgery to have. I know that they still have to do the sentinel node biopsy during surgery to really see if the lymph nodes have been affected. Has anyone has a smaller tumor, my age (39) and been stage 2 and done chemo?

I would like to hear from some people that have done or are doing chemo now to prepare myself. I am aware that everyone is different but I would like to hear some stories of people that had a full time job and how they handled that as well. We you able to work thru it? What were the biggest obstacles for you? Side Effects? I have found that this group is better than anything you could possible Google as it is more \"Real\" life than a bunch of statistics. Thanks!",
