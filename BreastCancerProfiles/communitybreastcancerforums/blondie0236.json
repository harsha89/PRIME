      "Content": "blondie0236 wrote: I recently had an abnormal mammogram which lead to a follow up mammogram and ultrasound which showed a cyst.  Left the facility with with a bi rad 3 score and told to come back in 6 months for a follow up ultrasound.  Then was informed I was over the 20% risk of developing breast cancer due to my mother being diagnosed at 49 and her sister at 45 so I went in for a breast MRI.  Mri results were negative.  Cyst was seen with imaging features consistent with it being benign with high proteinaceous debris.  Small foci of calcification in one breast along with a few very tiny cysts in that area. Small volume of residual fibroglandular tissue.  My MRI bi rad was a 2 with recommended annual mammogram and MRI.  So my question is, should I see a breast specialist to review my test results and have in case something is found in the future?  All my test results were sent to my OB/GYN and my doctor and I have been going by what the radiologists have told me that everything is ok. Do I still need to go back in 6 months for a follow up ultrasound or can I now wait a year and go back for my annual mammogram? Log in to post a reply",

A rounded subcentimeter density persists in the inner slightly lower right breast. No persistent suspicious asymmetric density identified in the left breast.  Lobulated density in slightly inner left breast is unchanged from 2009, benign. Right breast ultrasound demonstrates a hypoechoic rounded mass at 4 o'clock position 7 cm from the nipple, which may be a cyst which cannot be cleared of internal echoes, versus hypoechoic small solid mass. Measures .7x.3 cm. I strongly favor that this is probably a cyst which is too deep to entirely clear of internal echoes.  Recommend ultrasound followup in 6 months to ensure continued benign features. My personal history, I'm 46 yrs old, my mother had bc at 49, her sister at 45. Log in to post a reply",
