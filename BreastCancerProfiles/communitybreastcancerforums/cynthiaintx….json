Some of us handle pain with a different tolerance than others. My needle core biopsy was wonderfully painless (a little pulling sensation, but that's it), and my surgical team was incredible! Same radiologist who did the biopsy did the wires - and again, no pain. You do stand for awhile, because your boob has to be in the mammogram machine. That's done with local anesthesia. My surgery was done with a general - good thing, the doc said it took a little longer than expected. But even the surgery had minimal discomfort (removed a tumor the size of a grape). Now, my radiologist was a special lady - she went into her career field because her mom had breast cancer. I'm so thankful to have been her patient - the breast center is now on my Christmas cookie list! The key word is COMMUNICATION! Be sure to say you want a local to have the wires inserted.The lidocane feels like getting a flu shot, no big deal.",

When I had my mamo and ultrasound, the radiologist said it didn't look good... and indeed, it was a slow-growing tumor. Surgery was shortly after, they got everything, and now I'm going through radiation. So far, so good! Please don't worry, it doesn't add a minute to your life. Do your homework, be educated, but worry is not going to help. Go out with friends, have a good cup of coffee, pick some apples, go to the museum. Don't worry.",

The radiologist gave me the report that she wants to do a core needle biopsy asap - so that happens on Tuesday the 20th.  I'm getting the feeling from what everyone is saying that there will be a surgery, to just what extent, however, will depend on the biopsy. I live by myself, but have a good group of friends, a few who have already been through this, and an incredible church family.  I'm looking on this whole thing as a big inconvenience in life, but it has to get done.  At this point - well, throughout the whole process to come - it has to be viewed as one day at a time, imho.... Is there a faith-based forum, or thread? One day at a time...

I got this.  Like I told a friend, I'm preparing for the worst, praying for the best.  Cleaning house like crazy in case I'm out with a surgery, and that's keeping me plenty busy!  Might find some recipes for freezer meals (I live by myself) and I already have a friend who will take my dogs if I have to be in the hospital.  I know that I don't know anything yet, and am not worrying.  Concerned, of course, but worry?  Not gonna solve anything.  As Matthew 6:27 says, worry won't add a day to my life.  I've had several surgeries in my life, and while they are in no way fun, I made it through just fine.  I have a very strong faith, and it's only being made stronger. In fact, I'm viewing this right now as a huge pain in the butt that I really don't have time for, so let's get it over and done with.  I have too many other things to do.  Then again, I'm kind of a crusty ol' Texas cowgirl who doesn't tolerate nonsense very well!",
