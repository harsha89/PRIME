She is sending me for a mammogram and ultrasound of my right breast as well as rechecking my vitamin D level, thyroid, and running an ANA lupus panel. She said at this point she doesn't know what to think. She believes I could possibly have breast cancer or an auto immune disorder of some sort. Her exact words were \" I'm not looking at your breast and saying this is most certainly cancer, but it is concerning me enough I would like to go ahead and do both the mammogram and ultrasound. It doesn't look normal and your breasts are so fibrous I can't possibly determine anything without those two tests\"",

I thought maybe someone on this forum would have information until I can see my GP tomorrow morning. I am a new RN and have just started my career on a busy med-surg unit at the local hospital. While getting ready for work Friday morning I noticed something when I looked in the mirror. With my right arm above my head I could see a crease pulling upward towards my nipple on my right breast. I grabbed a hand mirror and could see better that it infact looks almost like a W shape on the underside of my breast.  I felt with my hand and it is like the natural curve of my breast dips in and then rounds back out. I felt my breasts and they are both very fiberous and I can't tell what lump and bump should or should not be there. My skin is not discolored, no leaking from the nipples or palpable lymph node swelling. While examining all of this in the mirror I turned sideways and nearly panicked at what I saw. Directly below my collar bone, across my ribcage and sternum, my chest is very obviously dipping in on the right side. I ran my hands back and forth and could feel a dramatic drop of about 1/2 in where my ribs meet my sternum on the right side. I laid flat on the floor and could see my ribcage on the left stick up much higher than my right. My shoulders are uneven now as well. I would be inclinced to think I am having a skeletal issue of some sort (scoliosis?) but don't exactly see the relation to the breast pulling up and in? I have been having some bone pain in my ribcage and back but attributed it to working nearly 15 hours a day on a busy unit. I also went to my GP in September of 2011 due to extreme fatigue and nose bleeds. She ran a battery of tests and said I had a fairly concerning Vitamin D deficiency (my level was a 20) and I was started on 10,000 iui of D3 a day as well as anemia (I take iron supplements now).  My newly trained mind is running a 1,000 miles an hour. I just keep thinking about my bone pain, the D deficiency, and the breast pulling up and in and I just sob. Im 28, a wife, and mother to two young children... I was wondering if anyone was diagnosed with any of these presenting symptoms? It isn't a dimpling, this is a 2in long crease on the underneath curve of my breast. Thank you for reading this novel and I appreciate any help I can get.  Log in to post a reply",
