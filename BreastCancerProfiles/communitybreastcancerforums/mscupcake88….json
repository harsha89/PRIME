      "Content": "Oct 4, 2017 01:48PM - edited Oct 4, 2017 01:52PM by mscupcake88 I found an indentation on my right breast. It's on my areola and is very noticeable when I lift my arm but if my nipple/areola hardens it goes away. I had an ultrasound on it a month ago and it came back clear. I'm a new mom and I'm over come with anxiety about this it just doesn't look right to me. Should I push for an MRI. I'm not sure what step I should take next. I have slight health anxiety to begin with and my husband usually fluffs me off and he says he sees it too.",

Im from Canada so I don't pay for any tests done but I have an appointment with my gp for next Tuesday to discuss more options and I've also booked an appointment with a therapist to help with my anxiety. Hopefully both drs can help me get to the bottom of this. Thank you ",

I'm going to call my gp tomorrow and try and get in this week or early next week. I'm worried she's just going to fluff me off which she usually does because of my known anxiety and my clear u/s results. I'm going to push for the MRI ",
