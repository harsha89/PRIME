I know I'm not alone in this journey. I've been fighting br cancer for 15 years. I'm blessed to be able to share as many others. In 2007 had mets to bones and 2013 liver. We've tried various chemo drugs including Ibrance, and now I'm starting Gemzar/carbo Monday. Taxol/xeloda was my last regimen & it worked, NED, but 3 months later & I now have 8 new small liver tumors and the vertebral lesions are active again. So I guess im looking for any info from actual patient testimonies. My hair was finally coming in... Don't know if losing it again for the 4th time. And just wondering about SE this time. Happy and blessed no matter what. I'm still here and moving ahead. God is gracious!",
