Both surgeons and oncologists say I'm healing and doing well. My nerves are at a total frazzle because I am not able to take anymore hormones....and I feel I am becoming homicidal !!!! Some people think it's funny, but it is horrible. They say \"I know the feeling\" but they really don't. I am fairly new to BC.org and have been very encouraged by a lot of the gals who have already experienced what I am about to embark. Have you visited the \"Lumpectomy Lounge\" ?    ",
