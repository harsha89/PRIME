The surgery to remove is like a general lumpectomy.   If they can't see it easily via ultrasound, they will use a mammogram to put in clips to identify the area for the surgeon.   You'll get the twilight type anesthesia and go home right after you recover from the anesthesia.    I had very little pain - was back at work the next day.  Good luck!",

She had surgery to remove it 3 weeks ago - and it turned out to be much larger than originally thought.   It was 5 cm and she had 10 positive nodes of 21.  She tolerated the surgery (same day) really well.   She has some other health issues - had a heart attack 5 years ago and stents placed about two years ago.  Has issues with blood pressure, cholesterol and COPD.  The tumor is ER+, PR- and Her2+ We met with the oncologist last week and need to follow up with scans to see whether it has spread anywhere else in her body.   He offered two plans - the first, if it has spread and she is Stage IV, will be to use an Aromotase inhibitor and Herceptin.  The second, if it has not spread, will be to begin chemo - TCH - which is Taxotere, Cisplatin and Herceptin.    It avoids the cardio toxicity of the Anthracyclines (AC) and such.  While it won't be easy, he thinks it is worth a try - and so does she. I am a 5 year survivor - this is very hard to watch my mom have to go through.  I wish you and your mom good luck and strength in this process.",
