Anyway, the second biopsy was completed in about 10 minutes, and then I was turned onto my back and taped up.  I told the people in the room about my discomfort with the \"sneak attack\" resident, and I would encourage other women to be more vocal in opposition to residents before they are brought into the room.  I got my results within 24 hours: all benign.  I am left wondering whether it was worth the stress, and whether the metal clips (made in Cincinnati, I asked for clarification on this) and the radiation (about 40 minutes' worth) might actually *give* me cancer, but at least for now I am cancer free.  I hope this helps, this is a wonderful site, sylvia",
