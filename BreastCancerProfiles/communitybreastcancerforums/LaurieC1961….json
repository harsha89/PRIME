    "Content": "May 18, 2012 01:58PM - edited May 18, 2012 07:47PM by LaurieC1961 I am 10  months out from last chemo, 6 weeks from final Herceptin.  I lost almost all my fingernails last summer while still getting chemo...... watched them slowly, slowly grow back, only to have them recently start lifting again.  Has anyone else had this happen?  No pain or discoloration, just  lifted halfway down the nail bed on all fingers.  I've been getting gel manicures  the last 6 months; wondering if that could be part of the problem?  Also wondering if the ultraviolet light they use to set the polish is a health risk, especially for a cancer survivor.   So discouraging to lose them again, especially when they grow so slowly, but not a big deal in the whole scheme of things.....  the last year has given me a whole new perspective on what's worth getting upset about and what's not.",
