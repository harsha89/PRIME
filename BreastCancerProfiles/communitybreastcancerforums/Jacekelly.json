Im requesting the Oncotype DX test which tells you the chances of it coming back. I understand in Estrogen positive with up to 3 podes positive it will tell you whether chemo would even work or be necessary. Has anyone else considered this. Im meeting next week with my Oncologist to find out. The test is expensive but covered by Ohip if doctor orders it. ",
