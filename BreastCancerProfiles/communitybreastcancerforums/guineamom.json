I'm ER+/PR+, don't think they tested for HER, at least I don't see it on my report. Most of the rest of Apr was spent talking to PS, medical oncologist and raditation oncologist. I had to change PS and BS because of a change in hospital. By the time I've decided to have the surgery, it's early May. Called BS in 1st week of May to schedule surgery and have been waiting. Called them twice after that and they made it sound like I was nagging them so I stopped calling. Now I'm just sitting back and chilling, no point worrying.",

I was just trying to \"help\" knowing how desperate the blood banks are now. All the discussions brought up a question in my mind. Even if I'm not diagnosed with cancer, I am BRCA+, does that mean I shouldnt donate because I have \"bad\" genes? I've been donating for many years, does that mean I've caused harm to people who received my blood? Like greenacres said, in a life threatening situation, I would take blood from someone who has completed cancer treatment.",

I was diagnosed with DCIS a couple of months back, now waiting for a surgery date for BMX. As I do not have a surgery date yet, I signed up for our company's blood drive tomorrow. I've checked the donor eligibility requirements, there is no wait period for breast cancer in-situ. Now I'm having 2nd thoughts about the donation. I asked the hospital's breast care navigator if it's ok to donate, she said no problem. However, she suggested that I double check with my PS. I feel stupid calling the PS because I do not have a surgery date. Should I go ahead with the blood donation? To sisters who had gone through BMX, how bad was the blood lost during surgery? Blood bank is really low on blood now so I would really like to donate, but not at the risk of my upcoming surgery. Log in to post a reply",

I just googled on ultrasound images, most probably that's a cyst he focused on. Anyway thanks for all the replies. We'll see how goes when my BS gives me the biopsy results. Most probably she'll send me for more tests because of family history. (mom had breast cancer, sis BRAC positive)",

      "Content": "guineamom wrote: Not diagnosed, not worried, but frustrated. Thought I'll do some ranting to vent my frustration. It has been a long journey with no conclusion yet. All started with a yearly mammogram in Oct. They said I have dense tissue and asked me to go back for another mammo. Few weeks later, after the 2nd mammo, they said they saw something so they did a US. After the US, the radiologist said she saw something that did not line up with the mammo. She suggested that I schedule for a MRI. I called my primary care doctor and she said instead of a MRI, I should go see a BS. I managed to get an appointment with a BS on 3rd Jan. She looked at my films from the mammo, did yet another US, and asked me to go for a MRI. So, after going one big circle, I was heading back to MRI. Just got a call from the BS with my MRI results. Again inconclusive, they definitely saw something and now BS wants to do a US guided core needle biopsy. She said if the radiologist could not find the lesion with US, then I should do a MRI guided core needle biopsy. I read other's experiences on this forum, I don't think I've seen another person with experience similar to mine. If tests are all inconclusive, hopefully that implies all are good. I'm tired of being probed here and there. Anyway, thanks for listening... Log in to post a reply",

My experience is very similiar to Druanne's. Went to mammogram, they saw something. Went for 2nd mammogram, then sent to do ultrasound. On ultrasound, they saw lesions that did not tally with the mammogram. That's what they told me, I dont have the report on hand now so cannot give the exact results. I called my PCP, she sent me to BS. BS send me to MRI. MRI showed 2 lesions that did not tally with ultrasound. I do not have the MRI results, so can only base it on what BS put on the order for biopsy. Went for US guided biopsy, radiologist found only 1 lesion that he thinks tallied with MRI result. Even the 1 lesion, he wasn't 100% sure. He was murmuring to his assistant that my tissue was very dense, pretty much can't see much. Should I have request to get the MRI guided biopsy in the first place or something even more drastic? From all the testing, seems like they practically cant see much to be really sure and different imaging systems are giving different results.",

Cells are B9, but they are atypical so BS would still recommend that they be removed. I cannot remember the exact terms she used, she lost me once she said it's not cancer.   Now she wants me to go for gene test before deciding what kind of surgery ie removing just the cells, or something more drastic if BRCA test positive. More tests coming, but at this point I'm not complaining too much. Thanks for all the support I received here. Hope that everyone who's waiting for their results will get good news too.",
