Only just a few months ago I started getting this pms symptom, I normally don't have any symptoms. I'm worried because they are still tender and heavy and a little bigger than normal. I've seen things about hormonal imbalance (for instance: high estrogen levels) but I don't think I have enough symptoms for it to be that. Although I do have quite irregular periods. I thought maybe it was my bra so I switched it but it just seems to have gotten worse. I'm not too worried that it's breast cancer because there are no lumps or any other breast cancer symptoms but I thought this was the best place to ask why this tenderness isn't going away. And if I should just see a doctor about it or if it's something that doesn't require me to. Log in to post a reply",
