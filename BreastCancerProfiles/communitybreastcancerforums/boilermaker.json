    "Content": "boilermaker wrote: I am a 20 year old female that recently discovered a lump in my breast. I know that the risk of breast cancer at my age is very low, but I went to get it checked out anyways. I've had an ultrasound and was referred to go see a surgeon. The radiologist said that it was probably an atypical fiberadenoma, but recommended a mammogram (which my other doctor said I should NOT have at my age). I went to the surgeon today and he said that I could either have a needle biopsy now or wait a couple months and see if there are any changes. If it had grown he would remove it then. I'm not really sure what to do, he suggests waiting until August, but I'll be back at school then. Any suggestions or thoughts? Log in to post a reply",
