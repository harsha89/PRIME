The drains are the worst, very sore at the site. And seem swollen there and under my arm too, so Im definitely going to look at the lymphedema info.  I dont see my surgeon till Aug 17. Havent seen an oncologist yet, my visiting nurse sais here in Vegas they seem to do everything the other way around to the rest of the country! Had a little cry last night (a happy weep), I have always had a mole on my left breast, and was sure during mx i would lose it, but last night, there it was! Isnt it funny what makes you cry - I still had my mole! LOL!  On another note, any ladies still waiting, please, make sure you take the stool softener, - Oh my goodness! Keep going ladies, you are all such an inspiration and I feel connected to a wonderful group of sisters.",

I should have, I think thats why I felt so awful post op. My head felt like it wanted to explode off my shoulders. :(.  I dont usually have any bowel issues, so it was rough (My poor mum deals with it daily!).  I started taking a natural stool softener, and am now thankfully doing better.  Heres to you not having the same issue!! :)",

Went home tuesday evening, feeling not too bad.  I have to be honest, not too much pain thank goodness, just have to remember not to stretch with my left arm! ouch!  The only problem Im having is getting comfortable to sleep. I have always slept on my stomach, so Im really finding it uncomfortable to get settled.   all I have wanted to do since I got home is sleep! Im sure thats normal.  Headache is a bi##h though, I think it could be from the constipation which also isnt fun! (or the menstrual cycle that decided to visit monday - oh of course it had to visit at the time of surgery!!) Had a visit from the home health nurse yesterday, so saw the scar for the first time, was a little shocked, didnt know quite what to expect, but I hadnt expected it to look like that. I know its new and will look a little different once its completely healed. My husband is having a wee bit of a panic with having to help change the dressing! I go see the BS next friday for follow-up, hopefully both drains will be removed they are uncomfortable.  Surgeon told me he took 6 or 7 nodes that were swollen, but preliminary path of sentinel node was clear, so I am keeping my fingers crossed all the others were ok.  Good luck to all the ladies who still have to go in for surgery, and my hugs and well wishes for all who now in recovery.  I know we are going to all get through this!   ",
