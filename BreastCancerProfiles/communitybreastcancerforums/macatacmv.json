The waiting does suck. Now there isn't the distraction of Christmas anymore. But the nurse was very kind and did reassure me that they will let me know as soon as they know. They know waiting is very hard.",

I never had asthma before, but since I caught a cold right after surgery, I have had a horrible cough. It got so much worse during rads. I just saw a pulmonary spec on Friday . He thinks the linings of my bronchi tubes have gotten stripped away. I am on Advair, Abuteral, Singular, a cough suppressant , Prednisone and starting a nebulizer soon. It is a real pain in the neck. So you are not alone! There is a more active thread called radiation recovery, if you would likevto join us over there. Nancy",

My RO prescribed silver sulfa cream, it was an anti biotic cream for servere burns and it helped because it was so cooling. I also used a baby teething gel pack, put it in the freezer for a bit and then on sore areas (with cloth covering) to bring the heat down. Hope that helps, it must be hard to be so far away. Does she have a primary care dr. I am using mine to help me with the issues I have now. Remember the rad tx keeps working  for weeks after the tx part stops. Hope that helps.",

They took their time to explain things, early stage, caught very early, clear margins, clear node, but I am waiting for the BRCA test results. Going ahead with the RO, set up appt for next wed.  I am still struggling with being tired all the time. I can just fall asleep anytime. I am back into my regular routine of working and all, but just have to force myself to interact with people.  I'm thinking if I keep going through the motions it will get easier. The good news is I seem to be seeing lots of doctors, so I can keep mentioning to them this fatigue and I am  not even in active treatment. They keep asking if I am depressed, but I don't think so, and drugs are not always the answer. Anyway I am walking forward and glad I am not alone.",

This is serious business, you shouldn't feel like you are being dismissed. This disease knows no age limits. I know one woman who is being told she is too old to go through treatment. One of the positives for me in this process is finding the right doctors for me. I had put up with a condescending male doc for many years. I have since found a doctor that takes me seriously. It took some looking around. But now I know what to look for and to not give up and settle. Good luck and keep looking around this site until you find the people you fit in with. Being not alone is the best when we are worried.",

My BS has never gone over my path report with me since my lump right before Christmas, post op appt and 1st meeting with MO is on Monday. I got a very grudging, putting her on the spot, stage 1 from the nurse on the phone. She told me everything looked good in the report. I'm having a hard time shaking the feeling they are not telling me everything. (actually much of anything) I shot off an email and still no response. I had to see my pcp because I developed a respiratory infection 2 weeks ago and he could not pull up the report on his computer. The hospitals are in partnership so I thought I could get answers from him.  sigh!  Anyway trying to have faith and just hang on. ",

I follow along on all the different journeys we are on and cheer and weep along with you! I don't always post because I am so confused. I got so sick so soon after the surgery that I haven't had the strength or energy to pursue getting the path report faxed to my pcp which I had to do with the first one from the biopsy. I agree that the medical profession has to do a better job at communication. I have a hard time believing that they don't realize how this dx makes our lives feel unmanageable. I too am hoping there is not much to say, but the terminology on my paper work does not match what they told me before the procedure and on my patient gateway site there is another procedure listed that has not been discussed. Am I crazy or should this be more understandable. Also do all techs and nurses have to be so perky?",

I know people are use to me being strong and able to handle all things, but I certainly don't feel that way now. I hate that word fine. This feels like a struggle up from the deep. And I cheer when one of us has a break through. Joan, all I want to do is sleep. I fell asleep last night after dinner on the couch and woke when my son called me at 10:30 got up and went to bed and slept through to 7am. I think there is something else going on and the docs are so focused on the bc, we are missing something else. I am not sure who is taking care of the whole me. I have the BS, the ONC, and will meet the RO this week but they all seem to not hear how I am struggling. They don't seem to be ordering tests or concerned about my overall health. I will go back to my PCP on monday and ask to  get a blood work up, but he says he doesn't know much about bc and wants to help, but just offers a script. I know I have  to be my own advocate, but I really have no energy.  ",

All the different experiences.  I felt the techs and radiologists were saying one thing and acting a different way. Everyone was very upbeat and saying it was probably nothing but insisting I get the next test quickly. I had my annual mammo in Oct, they called me back for another look, but that was not unusual  but I was on my way to visit my daughter out of state, so made an appt for 2 weeks later. When I showed up for that they said oh we need to get the room ready and handed me a sheet with stickers with my name and hospital number on it. Very different. After a couple more pics, they tried to do a US and think they would have done a biopsy if they could have seen it. As it was I had to wait until after Thanksgiving to get a stereo core needle done at another hospital. At that appt everyone was still very upbeat and asking if I was going out for lunch after procedure, but also saying things like oh what a little family cluster and showing me the image. I met the BS at that time \"just in case\". Still being told most of these  (80%) are nothing. 6 days later I get a call while working in the basement of my house, on my cell phone which does not get great service, from the BS. I had to walk outside to get better reception, while a customer was standing there waiting for me to go inside and wait on her. So after I hear I'm sorry it is cancer, I missed the part about it being treatable and probably curable, she talked to me for a while, but I couldn't really process much. She said her office would call to set up an appt for the lump/snb. She did give me a number to call back if I had questions. It took 3 more phone calls for me to get more of the details. Anyway I have a mistrust of people smiling at me while giving me bad news. Since then I have only seen the BS surgeon right before being wheeled in for the surgery.  I do have an appt for Jan 23 to meet with the BS and MO. It does seem to be a hurry up and then wait situation. I am learning to be more patient.  ",
