Even one session softened my breast adhesion and scaring. I wish more people talked about this treatment, including breast and plastic surgeons. I am not a proponent of chiropractic so I was a little skeptical of my GT therapist also being a chiropractor. However, I guess it ends up being something chiropractors would be interested in since it is a non-surgical, not mainstream treatment. Regardless, if I had not seen this post, I would never have known.",
