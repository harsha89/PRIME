I also wanted to pass this along (as hopefully it may work for someone else too):  when i awoke from my first mastectomy, it was really tough to get out of bed, but i discovered that by hooking my foot under the bed rail i could use that as leverage to help myself up and out of bed.  My surgery was delayed so i layed there with those fluid bag thingys for a long time - thus, i had to get in and out of bed constantly to go pee - it was freaky.  Sorry about the babbling. God Bless",

We're up next.  Like takeadeepbreath's awesome analogy let's \"jump\" and have soft landings.  Git R Done!  Praying for everyone.  Peace out.",

This might be tmi but i recommend buying stool softener, cause for me the constipation after surgery was a close tie for the worse part of the whole ordeal lol.  Baby wipes are good too for a refreshing wipe down - as i showered every other day in the beginning.  Sleeping in a recliner was easiest for me for first 2-3 weeks.  Also, if your brain is like mine, it helped me to keep a journal - or i wouldn't have been able to remember the whens and details of it all. Thank you Zogo for starting this thread and for letting me vent and share - somehow it's cathartic to see it in writing on this invaluable website.  I know it's tough to get into the holiday spirit with this looming over our heads, but i want to wish everyone Happy Thanksgiving and send strength and courage your way - we are stronger than we know.   ",

So far i have been fortunate that my pain/discomfort this time has been significantly less than last time (about 90%) - i guess due to no node removal (the difference in pain is unbelieveable) and muscle already being stretched from augmentation last july - can't really feel expander, and no drain hole burning pain - got lucky there.  No funky hairy forest going on this time in my armpit (last time so sore couldn't wash or shave there for a while) and the stool softener eliminated another torture.  Just wanted to share that for those who are not removing nodes or had breast augmentation prior; although i do realize that everyone still reacts differently.  Will have first follow up appt with my surgeon on Fri to go over everything; nurse called the next day and said everything looked good - was still foggy and i'm almost sure that's what she said. Anyhoo, i also wanted to pass this utube video www.KomenPhiladelphia.org/Video that my aunt emailed me about - as everytime someone watches it a donation is made.  It brought tears to my eyes, but in a good way!  Again, prayers and peace and comfort to all.  Remember the reason for the season; God Bless.  Love, S",

Big hugs ",
