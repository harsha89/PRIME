The waiting is driving me crazy but I feel like these boards calm me down. I don't feel alone in my head when I am reading all of your encouraging words. I am wondering... it is somewhat uncommon to get bc under the age of 40, is it not? If you don't mind sharing, how many of you have/had parents or grandparents with bc? I wonder because I don't have bc in my family on either side so I just figured I was safe. Now I am not so sure.",
