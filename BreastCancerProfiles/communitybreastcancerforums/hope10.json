It shows possible upper right lobe mass. the follow up  xray shows chest cavity lesion. One Doctors thinks it is scar tissue damage from radiation, and thinks it was too soon after rad to have a scan. one thinks it may be a mass and wants be to have a lung biospy. Occ. i do have shortness of breath and a pain in my right lung when i take a deep breath. anybody with similiar problems? thanks for being out there.
