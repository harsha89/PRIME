After the mammogram, they needed to do an ultrasound as well. The radiologist said he found a \"mass\" in my left breast and some calcification in my right breast. They scheduled a ultrasound guided biopsy for my left breast and a stereotactic biopsy in my right breast. The radiologist was very vague about both procedures, but I've looked on the Internet and found some information about it. Can anyone tell me a little more about these procedures? I think the waiting is the worst part of this. Several years ago, my doctor told me I have fibrocystic breasts. Would this make any difference? Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
