I went for my annual lady visit recently and the dr found a lump and sent me for a breast ultrasound (my appointment is this monday) the lump is in the same breast, same exact spot, same exact size as the lump my mother had. my question is what are the odds that I would get breast cancer identical to my mother (should it be bad news and not benign) I know I have increase chances because of family history, i was also on multiple different types of hormonal birth control since i was 16 years old and was only made aware last year about the added chance of getting breast cancer since my mom was hormone positive. At the same time that its making me insanely nervous, its almost easier to handle (right now atleast) because if it is identical to my mom, i saw her come through surgery, chemo, recovery, medications, tests etc. and see how good she is doing now so its easier to stomach that way. but still just wondering if there are any other women or men who have had this happen.
