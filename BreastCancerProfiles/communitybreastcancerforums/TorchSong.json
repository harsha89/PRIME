So I can see it will grow (if slowly and come in grey and so on) There is progress here!  But what about the rest of my hair? My eyebrows/lashes are thinking about it--little dots and miniature lashes.  But--no underarm hair (not that I miss that much) or leg hair (don't miss tht either) and (this does bother me) no \"private\"hair. Somehow it's that and the head hair that bother me most.   Question: I may be interviewing for a new job in about a month. They know about my bc and treatments, but how do I minimize the impact of a prectically-bald woman? I want to project an image of a competent, energetic person who can hit the ground running and do wonderful things for them--and I'm worried that my baldness will project the opposite--\"oh, the poor cancer patient!\" I don't use or have a wig, I usually wear a beret or bucket-style hat.

We had wine and cheese,  my stylist friend clipped my hair into several different styles so I could see what I might like when it grew (and I loved that he put it that way), and then we had some fun--he shaved my initial on the back of my hair, he gave me a mohawk... I know that wouldn't work for everyone, but it gave me a way to deal with it positively. Also, so much was falling out by then that it was just disgusting...on my keyboard, on my pillow, in my sink drain and even my food! Ick! I was ready for a clip. We ended up shaving it because it was so patchy I looked like I had mange! I do hats...mostly just plain winter ones, althogh a friend crocheted me one. I find the wigs uncomfortable, and I'm not a scarf/turban person, either. I probably have more than I need, as people keep giving them to me--about 12 or so. It does give me a wardrobe, but there are about 3 or 4 that I wear most of the time. I wasn't going to let anyone see me bald, either, but last night I was just too warm, and asked my partner if she would be OK with it if I took my hat off. She said (brilliant answer), \"You do what you need to be comfortable, that's more important than anything else.\" And she thought I was cute!  As others have said, you'll find what works for you!

If they're vaguer, I'll give them something general or targeted to what they said they wanted to do (\"Food? Well, I've been craving a good mac n cheese, if you 've got a good recipe...\"). None of them are anything that has to happen--the important stuff like groceries and rides to treatment and such are already planned out with family--so if the offered events don't happen, it's ok but they are things/help it would be great to have . It sounds like a bit of work for \"help,\" and maybe it is, but I also look at it this way...they want to help, and if I accept it (especially with a specific request), then maybe they'll find they can do it and offer help to someone else on down the road, who needs it even more than I do. And if they decide it's a hassle or I'm too particular, then they've learned (I hope) that they didn't really want to help anyway.",
