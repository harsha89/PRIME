I've been diagnosed with Paget's disease of the breast in the right side (rare form of breast cancer often associated with DCIS or IDC) last month. I don't know yet my stage or grade. The surgery will be performed soon. I have clean mammogram and ultrasound. The next exam will be an MRI I suppose. Lately, I've been feeling back aches in the ribs of the right side. Not sure if the pain is in the bones or in the muscles. It lasts all the day and sometimes I have it when I wake up. It's like I want to vomit when I have these aches. Since my diagnosis, every little pain makes me think of metastasis. My question is: is it possible to have metastasis from breast cancer with clean mammogram and ultrasound of the affected breast before surgery?",
