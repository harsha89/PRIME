Once I arrived at daysurg, the nurses were great and really explained it. I had to wait about an hour because another lady was also having it done and she was scheduled before me. They sat me in a private area, in a lounge type bed, with blankets, tv, lots of attention. The wire localization itself probably took about fifteen minutes. They sat me in a tall, straight backed chair pushed up to the mammogram machine. They took a couple of pictures to check the location and the previously placed clip, then gave me a numbing injection, which I did not feel, then placed the wire. I didn't feel a thing. Then they covered the wire with sterile gauze, led me back to pre-op, where I waited another fifteen minutes or so before having my excisional biopsy. I thought I was going to have conscious sedation for the excisional biopsy, but when I arrived at preop, the anesthesiologist told me he had decided to use general instead.",

I never took HRT so I went through that three years ago. one reason i was so dismayed to get the hot flashes back again, and the mood swings. Yuck. I am definitely having pain in my wrists and hands, which go numb frequently throughout the day--and at night as well. My MO said that by the ninety day mark, the SEs should start to get better, mostly because the brain gets used to the level of pain and starts to ignore it. If you can make it to the ninety day mark, he said, you should be able to do the five years. I was really surprised how quickly the SEs started. I foolishly thought it would take a couple of months before they kicked in. I take Tylenol or Ibuprofen to help me get everyone done. However, I have noticed over the last couple days that the pain does seem to be getting a little better. Not gone, but definitely better. Now if the mood swings would go with them... I am noticing the dryness issue, as well, but stupidly didn't put two and two together. What treatments or supplements are you using to help with that? As for supplements, i'm taking 1800 mg CA and 1000 mg D3, a multi vitamin and flax seed oil. My bone density was normal going into this and I am praying every day that it stays normal throughout. I also wish you good luck with your decision, MelissaDallas.",

Hot flashes, headaches, and difficulty concentrating round everything out. Lately, I've started taking the med at supper, rather than breakfast, in hopes the worst of the aches will happen while I sleep. It's too soon to tell if it's helping yet, but I have hope that I'll get some relief. My oncologist assures me that this is as bad as the side effects will get. It was a difficult decision, especially considering the potential of Aromasin to weaken my bones, but my risk was high enough that I was willing to give it a try. How about you? How did you make your decision? Have you noticed any side effects yet?",

But the six month follow ups are spread out over time, so no, I don't really think about it, as I really need the reassurance that early detection will save my life. I haven't even researched anything about the radiation levels because I'm going to have the mammos regardless and I just don't need another thing to worry about. Â But that's just me.",

Besides all the aches and pains it's given me, about a month ago, I began to suspect it was leaving me more than a bit depressed and foggy headed, but I soldiered on, sinking deeper into the blahs every day. Four nights ago, I finally decided to skip a dose. I haven't taken it since. The relief from the side effects has happened as quickly as the aches and pains came on. My head has cleared. I'm sleeping better, moving easier, feeling less crippled, easing into exercise again. What finally prompted me to skip the med wasn't even the depression, it was my hands continually going numb, then achey and tingly, like they were asleep and waking up. They burn and they hurt. I'm still feeling that, though not nearly as badly. I haven't called my MO yet. I suppose I could ask him to add in an anti depressant. But those have their own problems and I'm not sure I want to go that route, either. I don't think I would be worrying about this if my biopsy hadn't been borderline for DCIS. I know no one can answer this dilemma for me, so I'm not really sure what my purpose is in posting this. I guess I was just wondering if any of you have tried these medications, then changed your mind?",

I kinda liked your metaphor :) After two years of having extra films and the radiologist looking at them immediately, my first post biopsy mammo was more than a bit anti-climactic. The tech simply took the pictures, then sent me on my way, with \"your doctor will get the report in a few days\". I see my BS on the 21st, but I assume if there's anything important in there, they'll call me in sooner for magnifications. Momoschki, thanks for sharing your experience with the second and third opinions all being different. It is frustrating and confusing. Are you on exemestane? Or one of the others? What are your side effects? When I first started with it, I had bizarre nightmares, but these lasted only a couple weeks, along with strong body aches, especially in my legs, knees, and feet, headaches, and the strangest feeling of general weakness all over. The achiness is not as severe now, but it is constant, worse after I've been sitting for any length of time, even a few minutes, and still that feeling of general weakness--I can't really explain it. My hands go numb frequently and I am always tired, always, and I've gained about twenty pounds. My MO said weight gain wasn't really a common side effect, but that I could be moving less because of all the pain, and that is definitely true. My DH never could keep up with me when we went walking together. Now I'm limping along like I 'm ninety. I don't see my MO for another four months. I'm not sure what I'm going to do, but I'm leaning toward not taking it. I plan to discuss it with my BS on the 21st and see what he thinks. God luck with your mammo on Monday. I wish you the same boring results as you wished me, lol.",

Now, i'm three weeks out from my next 6 month mammogram and i'm praying everything remains status quo.Â  But I don't regret trying the medication.
