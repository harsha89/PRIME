Glad you have someone to call Mon.  That should help move things along, I would think.  And you should get a good-sized check for the waiting period when you finally do get it.  I hope it moves smoothly for you once you talk to someone.  It's the not knowing and the waiting that seems so unfair.

I seem to be able to lose 3-4 pounds if I really work at it.  I do wonder, though, if some of it is water weight.  A week ago I was so bloated and was up 3 pounds at the dr.  Then 2 days ago I was in the bathroom every half hour, and now I feel great.  So, that 3 pounds must have been fluids.  I seem to need to watch more closely what I eat and make sure I drink lots of water, or my weight fluctuates, regardless of the calorie intake.  Who knows?  But, I do hate that everything is shifting towards the center! I think there's only so much we can do, and I HATE THAT!  Just one more way to feel loss of control.  Let me know if you find the answer!  And, hope you have a wonderful trip. Lane",

I did try to schedule the surgery sooner. Tina, I really should just splurge and have someone come do my windows!  My DH is worse on a ladder than I am, and I'm tired of thinking about it.  Kind of silly to attempt to reach the high ones.  You're right! Texas, I've always been a reader, but this winter reading has consumed even more time than usual.  I love historical fiction and nonfiction, and have taken many suggestions from the Book Lovers Forum.  Last week I read 2 of the cutest, funniest books by Julia Stuart:  The Tower, the Zoo, and the Tortoise, and The Pigeon Pie Mystery.  A great way to escape for a while.  Hoping to get to know you all better, too.  I've been absent from the board quite a lot the past year.  I wish everyone the best.  There are so many wonderful women here.

Femara has kept me NED for 18 months and began working almost immediately.  It did its job for me.  I would consider help with the SE's first, rather than stopping the Femara; but, you know best what you can tolerate.  The SE's are worse for some, I know.  I hope you can get this worked out; I've heard that the SE's might diminish with time, too.  I hear you, though, girl!

But, remembering back 14 years to my first rad treatment after lumpectomy.  Don't know if they photographed any of you.  Maybe by now they are a little more sensitive.  But I had to sit in a chair and have my boobs photographed (one with an unsightly scar).  They put the photo on my chart.  So they could identify me by boob?  in case they got the wrong patient in there?  Or for legal purposes in case the damage from the rads was excessive?  WHO KNOWS??  I didn't ask.  But, right when they were ready to take the photo, a gorgeous young male tech came in.  These days it wouldn't bother me as much.  But, I was much younger then, and my pride took a serious hit.  Plus, I was so depressed and still in denial at the time.  Guess I'll never forget it.  It's something I can only this many years later laugh about (a little). It still brings back horrid memories and feelings. Sorry, guess I got off track.  Best to talk about things that make me laugh! Love you all.  Nice that we still can keep a sense of humor, isn't it?  Amazing, really! Lane",

We can drive ourselves crazy thinking about it all, and searching for new lumps, huh?  Now that I'm 18 months out and still on my first treatment, Femara and Zometa, I'm really starting to worry that soon the Femara might stop working, and what's next?  Have to keep telling myself that this is the way life is now, and I'd better get used to it!  It helps to share with you all.

Hugs to you and your mom, Lane",

Also, the absence of Lovenox injections, Thoracentesis needles, and, really, just the absence of a hospital environment does tend to aid relaxation. A great book in my comfortable chair with my sweet golden Retriever's head on my lap. 2)  Where do I live?  Monument, CO, almost equadistant from Denver and Colorado Springs.  We love the mountains and the climate.  Much milder than you'd expect being just east of the mountains, as I think one of the other CO girls mentioned.  Weekend trips to mountain towns, parks and resorts, wildlife, cities just far enough away that we still feel we live in the country yet have access to city life.  We also love trips to New Mexico, which is only a hop, skip and jump away, and which explains my love of Margueritas, the non-limeade kind. My husband and I grew up in the west and have lived in Utah, Alaska and CO.  We landed here almost 30 years ago and don't intend to leave. 3) What do or did I do for work?  I've always loved to travel, but as so often happens, ended up on a different path.  I have a degree in business and spent a good portion of my adult life in the insurance industry, of all things.  But, I always kept the dream of traveling in the back of my mind. In the end, I got it, if only for 3 years.  The year I retired I enrolled within 2 months in a travel school and became a tour manager.  I led 7 small-group tours to Italy and loved every minute.  They PAY you for this!  Not much, but hey!   During this time I was diagnosed with a recurrence after 12 years.  I was determined and able to keep working during that time, and made it happen.  I still can't believe my good fortune at being able to make that dream come true. 4)  Do I enjoy craft work?  I was more involved in crafts years ago, although I still enjoy knitting.  I used to knit sweaters and afghans, now I'm happy with smaller projets, such as hats and scarves. Years ago I did cross stitch, latchhook rugs (do they still do those?), needlepoint, crochet, embroidery, sewing, and knitting.  I never did macrame for some reason, although I was a 70's child of the universe.  I do remember knitting socks for a boyfriend and even red, white and blue boxer shorts!  Can you imagine?  Itchy!  I remember him saying his mom was shocked when they showed up in the laundry.  I was shocked that he actually wore them! 5)  Am I happy with my life choices?  YES!  Over all I've been very fortunate and have few regrets.  No one has a perfect life.  Don't the good parts stand out as excellent after we've experienced the not-so-good?  And, now facing a shorter life span than I'd expected, I try to keep the \"no regrets\" attitude as I move forward, day by day.  I am planning a trip to Italy in April, keeping in mind that it might not happen, but if it does, it will be great.   If it doesn't, what fun I've had planning it.  The bonus question:  My favorite time of the day has recently become early morning, as the sun rises through the pine trees in my back yard.  Sometimes I'm awake at 4 a.m.  Well, when you go to bed at 8!! I love to have coffee and read in my favorite chair while keeping an eye on birds and squirrels as the sun comes up.  This morning 4 deer wandered through.  I love it even when the sun reaches the angle which showcases my dirty windows.  Maybe tomorrow I should get out the ladder.....or not. Now I'll be thinking about the next 5 Questions, and who will have some interesting answers.  Have a nice weekend!",

The way I look at it, especially now, is, I'm going to have a dessert once in a while, if I crave it, and I'll continue to have a glass of wine occasionally.  I'm going to enjoy this life while I have it and not deprive myself nor let myself feel guilty.  QOL is too important to me.  I would say do what you feel is best, what you can incorporate into your lifestyle easily and with undue stress.  But don't beat yourself up over it.  I do understand what you are going through.

At times I still can't believe it is happening.  Take time to pamper yourself.  You're definitely worth it.  Living for today sounded easy before this happened.  I have to keep telling myself that being miserable is ruining the time I have.  I do have a choice whether to be happy or sad.  It works most of the time.  Try not to be hard on yourself when you get down.  It happens to all of us.  You have lots of support out here!
