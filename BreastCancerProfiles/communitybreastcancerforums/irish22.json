Just for good measure less then 24 hours after I posted my rant I ended up in the hospital with a DVT in my jugular which was lots of fun. I got released today and decided I am taking a week off of work and asked a friend if I could stay at her house while she is out of town so I can recover in peace. I'm hoping a week alone with the pup can help me build some strength to deal with a few more weeks before the next break down.

      "Content": "irish22 wrote: I am seriously considering asking for anti anxiety meds or anti depressents or pretty much anything. My dad won't go back home and when I try to make him he gives me a guilt trip about how we're all horrible children, we all lie and steal from him. I can't deal with his craziness anymore, his hypochondria and him whining about how much longer do I have to take chemo because it's making me lazy and rude. I know this sounds awful but I can't. He clearly is suffering from some sort of serious mental issue and he refuses to admit it and seek help for it, he won't talk to the doctor about it and prefers to make us all suffer because of it. I tried to talk to him calmly about it, I tried being mean about it, I've tried yelling and screaming about it, I even called his doctor and told him he's gone crazy. He fakes major health issues all the time. He came home a few weeks ago and told me he was in liver, kidney and gallbladder failure (yes, gallbladder failure). There was nothing the doctors could do so they sent him home, of course 2 days later he was fine. Two weeks ago he called everyone he knew before his routine colonoscopy to tell them the doctors were sure he had colon cancer. He lies to my siblings and me to start fights between us, he accuses the mailman of opening his mail, he says my brother and I are stealing money from him and accuses me of hiding his bank statements. I'm still working 40 hours while doing chemo and try to get in a nap if i can, when I do that he tells me I'm being lazy and wakes me up repeatedly until I just get up. He cooks meals that are nothing but fried food (which I'm not a big fan of plus my appetite just isn't always there) and then screams about how ungrateful I am if I don't eat them. Any food I buy he throws away and tells me it molded, even my poptarts molded in two days! He keeps making weird pureed veggie drinks and told me it's curing his diabetes, he isn't diabetic. Since he refuses help my brother has tried telling him he needs to go home that he's stressing me out to much and he's stressing him out too. He says we just want to get rid of him and not to worry when he leaves he won't bother us ever again. I know there is something seriously wrong and try to remind myself of this but he just pushes and pushes and then when I flip out finally somehow it is all my fault and I'm an awful person. I can't do it anymore. He's letting me live in his vacation house up here for the time being which he usually uses for a couple of months a year and thats it and I'm very grateful for that because money has been tight but it's not worth it and I'm going to have to move soon. The thought of moving and more bills is stressing me out even more. I miss my sister who lives out of state. While my brother occasionally drives me to an appt hes quickly moving into denile, he even booked a vacation the week of my surgery and said he didn't think it was a big deal, apparently I'll be going to that alone too. I'm sick of going to appts and chemo alone, I'm sick of spending hours on the train to ride to chicago for my appts and tx, I'm sick of listening to my friends whine about how much their lives suck (trade ya). In the past 3 weeks neuropathy has set in on my hands and feet, my skin is just a mess from taxol toxicity as the NP said and chemo brain make me feel like a zombie. Yesterday a coworker walked up to me infront of everyone and asked if I heard that a girl my age from the town over died of cancer the other day and i spent my lunch break crying in my car. I have no idea what to do, part of me wants to say eff it and hop on a plane and live out my time on a beach sipping mixed drinks. The other part of me keeps trying to remind myself this is just as hard on them as it is on me. And as for my dad he's gonna be lucky if I don't tie his ass up and leave him in a wheelbarrel outside the psych hospital door. I'm at a loss emotionally. I know this rant was long and kind of whinning too, sorry, but I do thank you from the bottom of my heart for reading it. Any suggestions on good mood meds would be appreciated, I'm tempted to go back to my college days of smoking weed.    Keep Calm and Carry On Dx 1/13/2011, IDC, 1cm, Stage IV, Grade 1, 17/34 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I can't seem to wrap my mind around the fact that there will never be an end, I will never hit a point where I won't have to recieve treatment. I also hate the fact that life long treatment is hard to explain to people who don't understand stage IV breast cancer. If one more person tells me \"(insert BC survivor they know or Christina Applegates name) had a masectomy X number of years ago and they're fine! They didnt have to be on chemo forever so I'm sure you won't!\" I will punch them in the ribs. I want to reply: \"Well remember Elizabeth Edwards? Thats the type I have.\"  On the other end of the spectrum tho I guess we are blessed that there are treatments that can extend our time, some cancers once they're stage IV theres nothing that can be done. While our prognosis sometimes seems grim we see so many people here who are living 5, 7, 18 years! I never thought I'd say I'd be greatful if I can live to see 30 but I am grateful that if I can put up with all the crappy meds, scans, appointments and SEs I at least get a chance at it.",

I recommend sucking on lemon heads for the metal mouth you'll get and using a good moisturizer for dry skin, report any neuropathy immediatley ( i was lucky, I didn't get any until my 5th month and even now just have the smallest amount in my heals), drink LOTS of water and get a good extra soft tooth brush and keep on top of your oral health ( i noticed my gums receded considerably). I also had horrible nail issues, one of the ladys on here told me to soak them in listerine and it took care of it quickly. I was told no to dental work while on chemo d/t blood count issues, infection risk and slow healing. With all that being said I still continued to work full time and even some overtime a couple of weeks the entire time I was on taxol and even started taking zumba classes halfway through my regime.

For some of the earlier stage women or women who were never actually diagnosed they live in fear of becoming us. Like a form of PTSD from Cancer. They surround themselves in this disease like the knowledge they attain here works as an armour to protect them. I remember when I signed up for this site thinking if it was even appropriate to sign up since I really doubted I would ever use this site again besides getting some questions about a biopsy. Oh how nice it would have been to forget this website even existed honestly. One of the women who responded to me and answered my questions was someone that had never been diagnosed herself but had quite a few scares in recent years. She was so calm and knowledgeable and very supportive. She still hangs out on those boards and answers questions related to biopsies and PM's me quite often to check in on me which I think is very nice of her. I kind of feel like some of those women are like little volunteers answering the questions of masses, really no different then a hospital or hospice volunteer. ",

She kept telling me that there was no concrete proof it made any difference but I was distraught and clutching articles I had printed that she had written herself about studies and theories on improved survival time in stage IV women who opted for surgery. Thanks rkt for sending me those articles by the way. Anyway that was back in December. Last week I got my BRCA and P53 genetic results and all were negative, so as we agreed if they were negative I would compromise with her for the less invasive lumpectomy with lymph node dissection and radiation. I also have to have no clotting activity and no progression in the mean time. My scans last week were clear besides sclerosed (sp?) bone mets on my spine so I'm thinking surgery is on. My surgery is scheduled for March 26 at MDA so I need to get to making my mind up about radiation. I am scared to death of it. I worked in home health and hospice for a few years and saw some awful breast radiation. I'm also scared that it could cause a secondary cancer (my grandpa got bladder cancer from the radiation for his prostate cancer) or it can activate some met cells that are currently just chilling out. I was wondering what all you ladies think about radiation after stage IV diagnosis? I feel like I've fought so hard to get this surgery I may be doing myself a disservice for not going all the way with the follow up but I also feel like I'm doing so well pysically right now I might be inviting trouble.

There are a ton of awesome websites that you can research that talk about dealing with panic/anxiety and depression in children without using meds. They talk about exploring options in everything from traditional therapies, to diet and excersise changes and sensory therapy. I would try everything else you can first.",

I had my biopsy yesterday, talk about a circus. I had my radiologist, the tech, the RN, then a med student and a vendor that was observing. The lump biopsy went well, but the lymph node biopsy was awful. They tore a blood vessel and I ended up bleeding a bunch and getting a huge hematoma. My arm was killing me yesterday and is still very sore today. All in all not bad though, I'm sure it could have been worse. The radiologist told me she noticed a change in my nipple from when she saw me last week, that it looked like it could be trying to ulcerate. I'm hoping a benign tumor could do this, anyone know? Anyway I was hoping for my results today but my doctor called and said she wanted to see me tomorrow morning to check my biopsy sites since I had complications and that she should have my results and we could sit down and discuss them. Thanks again for all your support, this is such a wonderful community and wealth of knowledge, I'm so glad to have found it.",

Less then 30 minutes after my diagnosis he already had went through some business contacts who got me in touch with the leading breast cancer surgeon at Northwestern as well as a doctor who specalizes in women under 30 with breast cancer. I was amazed (and thankful) he had all this done while I was still trying to stop crying. Yesterday was tough but today was business as usual and what I imagine is the start of my complete disdain for hospitals and the waiting areas.  :-) Anyway I will be back on here with a million questions soon enough but I thank you all for your kindness and support through the diagnosis period.

The use of epogen is discouraged and should be avoided in patients where the goal is cure and used carefully in metastic patients. If needed for a co-morbid condition (ie. renal disease) then the dosage decision is left to the oncologist who bases the decision off of current tx, tumor markers, etc. She said that the warning put out by the drug manufacturer themselves says epogen should only be used in breast cancer patients who are currently recieving chemotherapy.

Everyone is so excited to work there and so proud, it's such a refreshing thing to see.   My new port works awesome but I had a horrific surgical expierence. I had an allergic reaction to the vancomyacin before surgery and then a panic attack during the twilight sedation while they were stitching me up. I guess I was yelling that I could feel them stitching me and asking them to stop and trying to move. I was so bad after surgery they had to give me a ton of ativan and restrain me. I remember bits and pieces but not most of it. They kept me overnight for observation and once I got to a room I guess I called my brother and was hysterical. He said if the doctor hadn't called and told him I had a rough time with the meds he would have flown down here because I was so frantic and talking crazy. I've never had an issues like that with a surgical procedure and have had conscious sedation at least three other times, one being for my original port. I have no idea what that was about.

You will find a great source of support and infomation here. I know how scary it is to have a pending stage IV diagnosis so I wanted to offer some advice. One DO NOT google statistics, they are worthless and often manipulated on many sites to support their views and theories. They also don't break down factors such as people who were diagnosed at the point that treatment was not an option or people that chose no treatment. Wait  until you have all the facts of your cancer before reasearching, things such as your grade and your hormonal status. Otherwise you will scare and overwhelm yourself. Second do not count yourself out if you are diagnosed stage IV, even if it is mets on your spine. Bone scans are not definative and they can pick up on things that aren't there and leave out things that are. Ask for a spinal MRI to be sure. Bone mets are considered the \"best\" mets to have if you have them, they are often easily manageable and for longer periods of time. I was diagnosed with stage IV with mets to my spine last year and I am doing great and have no symptoms. If it wasn't for post chemo troll hair I doubt anyone could tell I have cancer. Third Occult tumors do happen, tho rare, but you will be no better or worse off as anyone else with a primary intact tumor of the same grade. Shortly after I was diagnosed I got a new patient at the clinic I work at who had an occult breast cancer. Hers was found when they thought she had cellulitis in her arm but it turned out to be skin mets. She responded well to treatment but sadly passed in a car accident a few months ago. I have also read that chemo works better on people with lower tumor burden, with no main tumor to fight it can focus on wiping out all the cancerous nodes and stray cells anywhere else.   Good luck to you, prayers for comfort and peace to you during this difficult time. <3",

I'm not a big fan of the wait and see approach, I think that is typically doctors that get so used to seeing the normal of 80% of biopsies come back negative they forget about the other 20% sometimes. Since your breast MRI came back negative it sounds pretty good that nothing is going on but you have a right to request further testing if you feel something is not normal.

I'm nervous about this for the obvious reasons of the SE's of removal. I'm especially scared of the lymph edema because I won't be able to work if I don't have the use of my hands (I'm a hemodialysis tech and need to be able to string machines, palpate fistulas and stick them and work quickly on the lines used for blood cleaning).

For the next two months the lump grew some, then about 3 months ago I started noticing changes in my breast appearence. I decided I'd keep an eye on it but wasn't really concerned. The only breast cancer history I have is an aunt on my dads side diagnosed in her 60's and I'm under 30. Then it seems like before I knew it my nipple had become flattened and the skin around it kind of lumpy and I'd developed a flaky appearence on my nipple. I also started having an intermittent burning sensation near the lump and spreading to the underside of my breast. The lump itself is hard as a rock but does not hurt at all, but the tissue around it seems irritated. I finally went to  my gp to have it looked at on Tuesday. She called the breast specialist and they said to ultrasound it and call me in a couple of days after that with my result. At my ultrasound the tech came in and checked it out then told me she had to get the radiologist. The Dr. came in and checked the lump and lymph nodes under my arm. She told me i have a 3cm solid mass and thickening of my lymph node walls and something about blood flow to the cortexs of my lymph nodes. She let me see the lump on the ultrasound and you could see where it was pulling at surrounding tissue. She told me she wanted a mammogram immediatley and was going to contact my gp. I was taken to mammo and did one with 3 different angles of each breast. The Dr. came in afterward and told me she wants to biopsy both the lump and a lymph node (when she talked about the lymph node she mentioned staging purposes). She also kept asking me if I was sure I had no history of breast cancer.She said I would have my results the day after my biopsy and asked if she would rather I have her or my gp call with results and course of treatment.  When I went in that day I was just concerned how long it would take because I had someone covering for me at work that couldn't stay long, by the time I left I was scared out of my mind. If she seriously thought it was cancer wouldn't she have told me? The only thing she would tell me is that my other breast is perfectly normal. She looked kind of panicked or uncomfortable or something, it realy put me at unease. Any thoughts on any of this?  I'd appreciate anything.

The sharp pains are focused it seems on my lower ribs, elbows, legs and feet. It almost feels like a little electrical current hitting my bone, it's just a quick sharp jab. They said I may expierence achy bones like with the flu, so I was wondering if the sharp bone pain is normal? As for the swollen glands in my throat I'm not sure if this would be a side effect or if I'm trying to fight off an infection or virus.

I hate to be paranoid about symptoms but with my track record of illinesses lately I think I'm ok to be overly cautious. Thanks all.

As of right now it will be just the right but since I'm under 30 I'm doing genetic testing, if that comes back positive I will be doing both. Anyways I was wondering how long you guys were laid up for? I'm wondering how long the recovery is, how long until I have full strength back in my arm and such. I know it sounds dumb but I am wanting to get back to work as soon as possible afterwards. My job is something I enjoy and right now to me working screams \"normal\" in a time that is very much not for me. I work in dialysis and while not streunous it does require a full range of motion and steady hands. I'm also curious about the pain factor involved and about the drains, I'm not familiar with this. Also how long before they let me start working out and I guess anything else you can think of that I can't. One surgeon has told me I may not have use of my arm for 2 months, but I've been reading about women online who were back in a routine in 2-3 weeks which sounds great but very quick. Also I will be having a reconstruction done at the same time as the mastectomy, what additional side effects does this have?

I honestly don't have any answers to what can help with the pain from it, I was taking advil for anit inflamatory which seemed to help but I can't anymore because it reacts with my anit-clotting meds.

I get pissed when people complain about their trivial problems like it's the end of the world and I often get snarky with them about how things could be worse. When I hear someone in public complaining about something stupid I have an urge to just walk up to them and say \"Excuse me, you think that's a problem? I have terminal cancer. That's a problem.\" I long for the days when my biggest issues was getting stuck working two weekends in a row. I get pissed explaining about my cancer over and over. No I'm not cured yet. Yes I still have cancer. Yes I will always have cancer.

In recent days the pain in my left side has become noticibly worse and it almost feels like it is pulling in there. It seems to become worse if I'm standing up for long periods of time or walking like at work and feels much less persistant if I am laying down.

The surgeon I was recommended too after dx was kind enough to set them up and I had them done in less then a week after my dx. Ask when you get them done for copies of discs or slides to take with you (I suggest two sets, one to give to your team and one to keep for your self incase med recs or a doc loses them which happened to me right away). Also get copies of reports from each scan for your self to keep in own records and one set faxed to your new doc or onc handling case. While for the most part all docs i've met have been great I also work in healthcare and know that I need to be my own advocate as well. Good luck and God Bless on your journey. I hope you will find this board to be a source of strengh, compassion and knowledge like I have. <3",

My friends boyfriend just had a large fibrous mass removed so even men have breast issues like us. If your doc won't listen and at least do an ultrasound I'd find one that would.",

My onc told me after I first met him that at some point we may consider surgery but it often wasn't needed at this stage. I found it confusing because why the hell would I want this thing living in me, I was ready to grab a melon baller and do a crude lumpectomy on the spot. I'm excited to see this tho, the least I should get is a free boob job with cancer.",
