I was diagnosed with Triple Negative breast cancer in June 2008 and have had 2 surgeries, 5 months of dose dense chemotherapy and 26 rads so far. The good news--only 8 more radiation treatments to go and I'm home free! Here's a link to my daily cancer blog for all the gory details--3nbreastcancer.blogspot.com/ So far my radiation has been smooth sailing. The only major SEs are burnt skin and minor fatigue issues (not enough to stop working every day) I have a GREAT schedule and it is partly due to having the rad blasts in the PM. My daily schedule -- work 7 AM - 1 PM. Drive to Stanford (1 hour each way min) treatments at 2:15. See rad onc 2 X week after treatment. Drive home. Home by 4 - 5 and relax and rest in the evening. So far this schedule has worked for me. One evening a week I have a support group to lead but otherwise I am home reading or watching TV.",
