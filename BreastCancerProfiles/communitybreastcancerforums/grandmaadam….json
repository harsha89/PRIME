The only reason I was given was that it was \"standard\" treatment protocol, good long term results, less radiation and just as effective as the 6 week treatments.  All of my margins were clear, lymph glands clear and low oncotype score. So far I've had no side effects, no issues at all and my skin has completely healed. I would suggest you bluntly ask your RO what is going on. Let him know you have concerns about his hesitancy. You have a right to know what is floating around in his head about your treatment. Good luck.",

Just a note for what I found completely unexpected and shook me up pretty badly. Some women have no problem being half naked in front of strange men but as a victim of sexual assault I was not prepared for my reactions. In the past all breast exams \u2026 uncover one side do the exam, cover that side up then go to the other side. All mammograms, ultrasounds, etc were done by women. Years ago I had male Ob/Gyns but they followed the same procedure of only uncovering one side and there was always as nurse in the room during the exam. Even now there is always a nurse in the room with my Oncologist and Rad Oncologist during exams. Then I was sent for radiation treatment. No one told me that I would be stripped naked to the waist and they wanted me to be that way, with my arms above my head, during the entire treatment. Also, the rad therapists were men (the only female was on vacation) and no female would be in the room with me when the men were there. I was blindsided by the wave of terror, I thought the assault from years ago was behind me, not so, only buried. I had an emotional meltdown. I can tell you my male Rad Oncologist was incredibly understanding. BEFORE the therapy actually started, he stopped everything until the female rad therapist was back from vacation. We talked and she handled my entire therapy session herself and at no time was I ever naked to the waist. She even covered my treatment breast after set up. Their kindness and understanding got me through my treatment, the last one was October 31st this year. The reason for this huge post is to encourage you to let your people know what is going on no matter what concerns you. I have a good friend who laughed at herself saying she didn't care who saw her naked \u2026 I wish I could be a little like her. Each person is different, each has their own concerns and issues \u2026 don't be afraid to advocate for yourself. Good luck on your journey.",

His response is that the lead shields used for other xrays, like a dental xrays, are no protection from the high intensity we're receiving for breast radiation. In order to get the lead apron thick enough, it would crush us. Anyone else asked their RO? Would like to know what they said.",
