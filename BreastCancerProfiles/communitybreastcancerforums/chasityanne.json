Most of the info came from google so I hope I'm on the ok track. I've always been slim naturally and at 115 5'4 now. My usual weight is at least 125. But with all the stress I've lost so much. I'm scared I'm not going to have the nutrition I need to get through the chemo. I don't have a few lbs to spare. Is there any dietary restrictions on what I should be eating or not be eating especially around chemo time? I don't feel juicing everything is enough. I'm also eating fish and chicken. Beatmon -My port is scheduled for the 15th. This is happening sooo fast. DivineMrsM - I def think I should be on some sort of antianxiety meds. All I could think about last night was about dying. Like, how will it feel, when will it come. How old my children will be and what phase in their life. etc. I've at least accepted the reality of this not being able to be cured or \"fixed\". And noone really knows how they will meet their end, but it kind of sucks having a sort of time frame. =/",

My mind is hazy and I've been mostly pacing. It's hard to focus in with all the info. Taking it slow and that seems to be the first thing I can concentrate on is getting a file folder started. Thank you so much for the links. And and ALL info that anyone shares is truly a gift to me right now. And when I get back I'm going to spend some time exploring the different threads. Thank you all so very much from the bottom of my heart.",
