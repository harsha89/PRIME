They did it then had me come back for two more pictures and then the ultrasound since you can feel the lump. They said it all looks like fibrocystic/normal breast tissue. They gave me a hand out about breast pain and things to try like reducing caffeine, vitamin E, and Evening Primrose. I only drink water, so caffeine isn't an issue but I guess I can try the rest. It said to try these things for 8-10 weeks. I also got the Thermography report back this afternoon and it says it is fibrocystic too and low risk...I know that doesn't mean much though. But I fee good they agreed I guess. They did ultrasound the lymph nodes that are tender in that arm pit and didn't say anything about those, so I guess that's okay too. She will send the report to my doctor.  Thanks for talking me through!",
