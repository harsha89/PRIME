However, this does not mean that there is no evidence as their notably very narrow restrictive criteria eliminated nearly all the supportive published evidence from review. 30 years ago there were equally no randomised controlled trials on mammography but Kodak, Siemens and GE had the funds to do them. It will take time for those involved in thermography to do the same. At best, mammography misses 20% of cancers and with dense breasts the sensitivity drops to almost 50%. Furthermore, the latest Nordic Cochrane Review has confirmed that mammography has been grossly oversold with the purported life-saving results of mammography actually being miniscule. There is therefore a great need for other user-friendly adjuvant investigations and good thermal imaging can help. Unfortunately, we have not only some substandard computer systems being marketed and/or substandard reporting but also different protocols. This international situation continues to frustrate those trying to get uniformity because thermography works when properly done. I am a now retired NZ MD (graduated 1963 London) with 10 years of clinical experience in breast thermography now involving over 4,000 women. I am currently training others and would not have continued spending time and considerable finances initially in an American system and then the newer automated German Mammovision by InfraMedic if thermal imaging was ineffective. Thermography was instrumental in finding several breast cancers where repeated mammographies and U/S failed to detect anything including one with a normal biopsy. Referrals for other investigations e.g. MRI, then confirmed the invasive cancers. Thermography is a breast health monitoring device that can uniquely show changes in blood vessel patterns and heat distribution. Because a cancer has to develop new feeder blood vessels to grow beyond a pin-head size this can result in superficial breast cancers (i.e. breast) being detectable by thermography. Hot cancers are also more aggressive especially in young women. Ideally, every young woman ought to have a baseline imaging before first pregnancy that records her unique vascular pattern. Later images could then be compared. Thermography combined with naturopathic guidance can be used to monitor reversal of abnormal breast pictures and even confirmed breast cancers. Double-blind studies are inappropriate and even unethical because each individual patient could be advised differently. Antioxidants, iodine, selenium and dental revision could all be variously involved besides nutrition and the standard advice on smoking, alcohol, exercise and avoidance of soft plastics. Whether a woman takes interest in her breast health is a matter of choice. Thus thermal imaging with or without mammography with full truthful informed consent ought to also be by choice.",
