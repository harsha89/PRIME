Like sherryhaire, really slowed me down the first few days, although I have been lucky enough to not vomit! I've still got this terrible heartburn/GERD feeling, and the inside of my mouth has started to hurt - no sores, just hurts like sores are coming. My first blood workup was yesterday, and everything is low. Not so low that I have to confine myself, but I have to \"practice proper handwashing and stay away from sick people.\" Sure hope that Neulasta shot I got last Wednesday kicks in soon!",
