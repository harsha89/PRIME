I had my mamo and u/s on Thursday. And, as I said was too shocked and ignorant to ask questions. On friday and yesterday I was in a car for our vacation with my two kids and and my son's friend and couldn't make the call. I figure it doesn't change anything right nw. And, my kids don't need to know unless I'll be having a surgery or treatment. However, my brain gets to me. My kids are 13 and 6 and I don't want them to worry and it makes e sad. Of course I go other places. Right now, I'm just tjhinking if there is something there it's early and treatable. That's why we do these tests. I have no symptoms and can't feel anything in my breast. I'll keep reading this board!! Thanks a million!",

I think that is fairly small - right? My BIRADS is 5 - yuck - that means high chance of malignancy - right? The mass is solid - again, not good. She reminded me that 85% come back benign, but I just feel like these aren't positive signs. Anyone with any opinions or thoughts? Thanks million.",

Diagnostic mammogram showed calcifications. Then took a a breast ultrasound. Saw calcifications and a lesion that wasn't detected on mammogram. The radiologist said it looked suspicious, but I didn't ask many questions because I was so shocked. I left for vacation 24 hours later (on it right now) and of course have anxiety about having biopsies when I return (ultrasound and stereo). I don't feel any lumps. And they said it's not a big deal to wait a week to biopsy. I saw the lesion on the us and it looked like an irregular black area - almost like a mountain. Bits of color would appear every now and then. Anyway, since my mammogram was clear a year ago, this popped up and I can't feel a thing, is it wrong to assume that if there is malignancy it would be fairly early in the game?? Any thoughts would be appreciated long with suggested questions to ask for a Monday morning phone call. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",

(day before biopsies).  He told me up front that he thought I had cancer, but was very encouraging because it looked small and likely early in the game.  I was prepared for a mastectomy at the end of this month.  We already had an MRI and plastic surgeon consult scheduled.  Had 2 biopises on Thursday (u/s guided and sterotactic).  Got results back - my calcifications are benign and my \"bonus\" mass is actually a radial scar that the pathologist wasn't even concerned with.  Since radial scars sometimes can hide early cancer, we are removing it next Friday and doing and open biopsy (a 30 minute outpatient surgery).  So, I'm pretty much clear.  There is still a chance they could find something small, but it's getting removed and we'll go from there.  So, BIRADS 5 can come back okay. :)  I understand about worrying about your kids.  Mine are 13 and 6.  I didn't breathe a word.  Last night I told the 6 year old I'll be having a surgery next Friday, but didn't get into details.  My husband told my 13 y.o. that was suspicious something was going on and gave him a bit more detail.  Best of luck to you!!",

I will have my breast surgeon consult on we'd. 7/6 and biopsies on Thurs. The place I do my mammograms is part of a hospital system that has you meet with a breast surgeon as a standard to confirm a need for biopsies and have an idea/introduction if you have to return. I'm of the school of prepare for the worst /expect the best. I'd love it if I was just being overdramatic. I'll keep you posted.",
