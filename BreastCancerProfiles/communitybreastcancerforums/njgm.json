Finished my first go round (4 cycles) of Taxol and Herceptin last week. Graduated as of today to my second go round! I will receive a \"quad whammy\" every three weeks of FEC 100: Flourouracil, Epirubicin, Cytoxan & Herceptin. I gather it is guaranteed to cause reactions! The two weeks in-between I will just get the Herceptin (YEA!) The day after the quad whammy I will go in for a shot of Neulasta.....comments here do not sound promising!! Glad to hear there are other alternatives if the Neulasta doesn't work! My thoughts and prayers are with each and every one of you. Alectosmum",
