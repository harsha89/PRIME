Crop type top without high neckline or logo and with short sleeves to meet top of sleeve would be best for me. And cool and breathable! Would be lovely to have something like a crop T-shirt that didn't dig in under arms The specialized garments do look very expensive though. Thanks for trying.",

If it is wrinkling at the wrist you probably just need to ease it further up your arm. LE left arm so sleep on left side with left arm sloped up onto one pillow and right arm resting on another pillow on top of left arm. Seems to work. Hope description understandable!",
