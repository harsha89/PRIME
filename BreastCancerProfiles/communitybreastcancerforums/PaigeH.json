Had the biopsy early this morning, and having trouble getting the bleeding to stop.  It's still leaking a bit.  But I tend to be a bleeder.  They only needed four samples, and I saw the sample scans.  They definitely got the microcalcs in there. So now the wait begins.   Any advice on how to handle holiday parties?  Some are with acquaintances, some with dear friends.  I am not very good a putting on a poker face, and I am finding hard to engage in mild chit chat, as these things require.  ",

My biopsy has been scheduled for Thursday morning at 7 am. They squeezed me in - - they seemed concerned about the results. So did the surgeon's office. She said to keep in touch about results and they would fit me in this Saturday if necessary, even though they are booking out to mid-January for the doctor I want. The radiologist referred to all of the v-shaped calcifications as like a \"flock of geese flying south for the winter.\" I need to stop googling things. V-shaped = scary. Good luck with your radiation. My friend just finished hers and said it was so much better than the chemo.",

      "Content": "PaigeH wrote: So, how worried should I be? I had a Birads 3 report six months ago after a diagnostic mammo. The doctor said she recommended waiting six months and retesting, or if I wanted they could do a biopsy. I waited. Went in today. I knew it was not good when I was waiting, and waiting, and waiting for results, as other women came and went. The tech finally showed up and said the radiologist wanted to see me. Longest walk of my life. Radiologist was super nice - - too nice. I didn't give him any reason to think I was freaking out, but he sat me down and kept his hand on my arm the whole time he was talking to me and showing me my films. He said there were \"significant\" changes since the last test was done. Must have said that 3 or 4 times. He said the calcifications are showing a branching or casting pattern, shaped like ducts. He said biopsy was a must, but that it is a small area, so we \"caught it early.\" When I pressed about what chance of cancer, he said 15%, but that is contrary to everything I have read since about fine linear branching calcifications. He said Birads 4 now, but according to what I have read it should be a 4b or 4c, more specifically. Sooo, anyone know of anyone who has had fine linear branching calcs that were benign? And, does the fact that the number of calcifications has increased \"significantly\" increase my odds of malignancy? Radiologist said to have my GYN call in an order for the stereotactic biopsy. GYN said she doesn't do that, she refers to a breast surgeon and lets them make the decision. I don't want to wait to meet with a surgeon just for her to refer me to the radiologist for the biopsy anyway. Is it better to have testing done by a radiologist or a breast surgeon? If it's all the same, I just want whatever will get me the fastest results. A very good friend just finished chemo and rads for breast cancer. I know what this does (as much as you can second hand). Very scared. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "PaigeH wrote: So I started a thread last week describing my 6 month mammogram findings, which were \"fine linear branching calcifications.  Several new calcifications (since last mammo).\"  As noted in that thread, I went for my biopsy, and they said it was a radial scar with amorphous (not fine linear branching) calcifications.  I just got the pathology report, and now I think they did the biopsy in the wrong spot. My original mammogram, 6 months ago, noted an area of concern with heterogeneous microcalcifications at 6:00 (location on breast).  My follow up mammogram results, last week, showed the new calcifications at the anterior third (front third) of the breast at 3:00.  But the biopsy was done not at 3:00, where the new calcifications were, but at 6:00, where the old ones were!  The biopsy wound is at 6:00, and the biopsy report said the biopsy was taken from 6:00.  I only put it all together after getting the path report and comparing it to the mammo reports. I have a call in to the radiologist's office, but they are taking an uncharacteristically long time to call back.   When you all had biopsies, did they go in at an extreme angle (as would be required to reach a spot at the front of the breast at 3:00 from an entry at 6:00)?  Or just straight in from the skin to the wound? If they did this wrong I am not going to be a happy camper! Log in to post a reply",

I am someone who does my research, so I went into the diagnostic mammogram with a pretty good idea of the issues to ask re: calcifications (morphology, size, pattern, etc.).  Frankly, I did not have a lot of faith in the responses I got from the radiologist.  She seemed a bit frazzled in answering the questions.  She said I could have a biopsy if I want one.  Well, I don't want one if I don't need one, but I do want to have a little more reassurance that, given the changes from 2 years ago, I don't need one. Is it typical to have significant changes in calcifications that turn out the be b9?  I did some research and couldn't find a concrete answer, just answers to the question of what happens if there are not changes.  Thanks for any info!
