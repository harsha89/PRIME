I wash them in a lingerie bag, then hang them to dry.  The ones I put through the drier lost their compression a bit after even the first wash. They are absolutely not a fashion statement.  They are boring and look weird, since I wear them inside out.  It's not bad as a layered look, but that's more for fall or winter, not summer. ",

I often had my compression sleeve on, but less than usual, and felt pretty uncomfortable by evening. Our Dallas weather is humid and hot, and my 2x/day MLD didn't seem to be making a dent. I have not been taught to wrap yet, probably since my swelling is mostly under control. (I will be learning this soon).  I have sports compression shirts here, which I wear here and there, as well, and do pretty well with them.  This weekend, I decided to sleep in my compression shirts, since I usually don't sleep in any compression at all. What a difference!  I wear them inside out, since the seams scratch my sensitive skin.  At my LE appt, the therapist noticed right away that my armpit and back are the best they've been so far.  I know each of us is different, and what works for one may not work for another. I still have to figure out what I'm going to do during the days, and I need to learn to wrap at night. There is SO much to learn for me to feel like I really understand this.  And I felt like this one little positive thing gave me hope.  Sleeping in a compression shirt is not hard or uncomfortable, and it's working well for me, at least for now.  Compression sleeve by day, sports shirt by night. Happy dancing here.    Dx 12/12/2009, DCIS, 2cm, Grade 1, 0/7 nodes, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",

It does look a bit odd - long sleeves, and all - but for me, it's really helped a lot with my truncal issues.  With the correct size for me, my arms are compressed too.  If you are unsure, purchase one and see how it does.  I have a local sports store which has a good selection, so I've just tried one size at a time.  Immediately after surgery, I was swollen and tender, so I needed a larger side. Now my swelling is down and my tenderness is less, so I can take a bit more compression, so I'm now wearing a smaller size during the day, but my larger sizes at night.  My LE swelling is not severe, so it able to be controlled with the UA shirts and 2x/day MLD.  Compression sleeves are used if my outfit can't accomodate the UA shirt, but those sleeves do not help support my truncal issues.  There are other options - the binders, swell spots, etc, so if UA does not work for you, you've still got other avenues.",
