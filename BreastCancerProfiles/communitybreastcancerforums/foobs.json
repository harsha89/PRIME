I hope someone just diagnosed will take this honest account to heart, try to be positive through treatment, and be braver than she's ever had to be. I remember getting angry if anyone even suggested my life/health would change after this. I remember thinking \"let's just get started so we can finish this! I wanted to win, to throw everything they had at this beast! I was a little naive that way, but all in all, today, I'm pretty healthy, busy, and very happy. Chemo and aromatase inhibitors have taken a toll, but I'm living and it's a good life! My primary care Dr has been wonderful in caring for my long-term issues. His awareness and compassion are rare and I'm lucky to have found him. I don't believe there's enough awareness of the long term effects of breast cancer treatment, even among the oncologist teams. Still, I am so grateful for where their focus is and for them saving lives. I felt vulnerable when chemo, radiation and surgeries were over when I was only checked every 3 and then 6 months. I worked hard to look forward, not back and tried my best not to worry. \"Laugh and the world laughs with you, cry and you cry alone\"! I asked myself \"what's surviving worth if you spend your time worrying\"? I now say to myself every morning, \"tonight when I go to bed I will say, today was beautiful\". Most of us survive this horror. I'm probably older than most of you now, and can tell you that life goes by too fast to let any beast make you afraid for very long.",

Maybe this isn't the place for it but I'm so mad that no one talks about lobular cancer (only 12% of BC diagnosises).  Gyns apparently have no clue that if you have dense breast tissue and take HRT, that mammograms don't do any good.  They don't even suggest an ultrasound--I would have payed for it myself!  Alerted the women in my family and so my sister--dense breast tissue.. had the same experience as I did.....insisted on an ultrasound and lobular cancer was found. I'm so furious.  If I hadn't found mine and then researched for months, my sister & I wouldn't be here.  I barely missed stage IV and realize what a difference III and IV are but I feel your rage and pain.I know how brutal III is and can only imagine the treatments at IV.  WHere is all the money going?  to print pink brochures??!!",

The bilateral mastx is because of strong family history and this sneaky lobular cancer and size of tumor.  Because we don't have a DIEP surgeon here, I have to travel to MD Anderson Houston for the BM and DIEP.  Over the phone, MD Anderson told me that anything over 2 cm has to have chemo first.  So my BS here and I decided to do the lymph node biopsy and lumpectomy (this is looking like it may be two tumors, same quadrant, right breast)   Sounds like I need to get a consult with the BS and PS in Houston and fly down there for a consult after chemo and prior to radiation.  Does this sound reasonable to you?",
