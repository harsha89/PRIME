Your DX is scary to be sure but there are a lot of Stage IV ladies on this forum, many who have had the same DX for years so there is hope. I don't live in Michigan. I live in Tennessee. I'm sure there are some support groups there. I'm a member of one through my church. I also had a patient advocate from the women's health center where I had my biopsy. Maybe your doctors or the nurses can direct you to organizations or agencies that can help in some way. My family lives in town for the most part although I mostly confided in and relied on a friend who is a nurse and had had breast cancer. Support is so important just having someone to talk to other than your DH. Mine was supportive but didn't really understand what it did to me emotionally. I bet there are some ladies on the Stage IV forum who live in your neck of the woods. Reach out to them. They truly know how you feel. I relied on this website from the getgo. It was my lifeline. Still is because we all know there are no guarantees. Keep the faith and keep us posted. Diane ",

Our mother had breast cancer in her late 60's which was in the 80's. She had a MX - no node involvement. The doctors wanted my sister to have the BRCA test and she refused. She is married with no children and in her mid-60's. We all know stats are not 100% and in fact I didn't fit the criteria for women who were at higher risk for getting BC. Obviously my mother and an aunt as well both got BC so my sister and I were at risk genetically. My Oncologist told me 70% of the BC cases were not genetically connected. My sister in law had DCIS and her mother had BC. She has 3 sisters - none of them have BC. It is really a crap shoot. We have a cancer history in our family too. I am wondering if there is such a family who doesn't anymore. Dad had lymphoma, brother had melanoma, grandfather had pancreatic cancer and then Mom and us with BC. I think if it were me I would not play with the percentages. I am the poster person for anxiety so to me with the projected odds against me I wouldn't play Russian roulette with what if or maybe or it could be or your case defied the odds. That totally scares me to much. I remember my OB-Gyn talking about this lady who elected to have a double MX because of cancer in her family because she wanted peace of mind. He didn't necessarily agree with that decision and in fact thought it was a bit drastic. I disagree peace of mind is more important to me than my boobs. No guarantees of course but maybe a little less anxious. Good luck you guys have tough decisions to make. Just make sure when you make them you don't second guess yourself or look back. Its your bodies and your lives. Diane",

My score came back low. I have an 8% chance of s recurrence. She ordered the test because I had a micromet in my SN. In past years if you hadany lymph node involvement it meant automatic chemo. Not so anymore. The Oncotype test tells the oncologist specific information about your particular tumor. Doesn't matter if you have a family history or not and btw I do too. My mother had BC and my sister has it now too. I have to admit I don't understand why you are having a MRI. I would be persistent with your doctor and find out why. You have every right to expect answers to your questions and concerns. It's his job to keep you informed. My SIL had DCIS 8 years ago. She had a lumpectomy too. Doing fine now.

I had had something important scheduled for that Monday - which is the day he does his surgeries and he said it was no big deal to wait another week so honestly even though you want to get it done sooner I dont think it is harmful to you to wait. I dont think for a second if they thought waiting was detrimental that they would wait. I have a family member who was DX and was having a MX; it was going to be a month from the time she had all her scans done to the actual surgery date and she wondered the same thing. Her ONC assured her she would be okay having it done in a month. As luck would have it the BS got a cancellation so she had it a week early. Try not to worry...hard to do but you are as of now at the mercy of your BS' schedule. Good luck..",

I am the poster person for impatience so I am the last person to give advice on how to wait. I think for me though I was in such a fog from the time I was dx to the beginning of my treatments that I didn't allow myself time to focus on the shock of being told I have BC. I am not however the poster person for being healthy...I smoked, drank, breast fed but did exercise constantly. Unfortunately, BC does not discriminate. There are lot of women who don't fit the criteria for getting BC but they did. Given the information you gave us it does sound like yours is definitely early stage and that's why there is no rush to do something asap. I have Stage 2(micromet in the SN), Grade 1 IDC. I had a lumpectomy followed by 33 RADS treatments and currently taking Tamoxifen. You will get familiar with the BC terms in time but do have someone with you for your appts if you can. You will be inundated with information and there is no way to digest it all. Plus you can and should have all the support you can get. There is no magic formula for enduring the waiting period but a number of ladies asked for and received prescriptions for anxiety. It does help. You have children too so maybe that might be an option for you. No crime in asking for some help in dealing with this. Also remember BC is not the death sentence it used to be. They have come a long way in research and treatments. We all remember what it was like when we were informed we had the dreaded C word. I have to say I didn't break down until the Oncotype test scores came back. My score was low; I am truly blessed. Use this forum as your go to place because even though you have friends and family there is nowhere else where women understand better exactly where you are coming from.

No it does not automatically mean metastasis just because she has back pain with breast cancer. Her GP has run an X-ray so you will know something definitive about her back pain. Her BC is early stage and her Oncotype number is low - both of which are good. Once you know the results of the X-ray the doctor should offer suggestions on how to deal with it.

As for screening the other thing I can say is what if you hadn't gone at all? The outcome could/probably would have been a lot worse. A friend of mine's sister ignored concerns for 6 months. Understandably she was afraid of what the drs might tell her or maybe like several of us might feel that the problem will go away and then there are ones like me who never had a symptom. I too went for annual mammograms - my mother had BC in the late 80s - she had a MX. She died a few years ago but not from BC. The mammogram \"found\" my BC. So it really is a crap shoot. I have a daughter too and I def encourage her to have a mammogram and her 3 daughters when the time comes for them. Yes we are still vulnerable. Think of it this way...again what if you hadnt had the mamogram...Also there are women on this forum who have experience recurrences very quickly and others many years from their DX and doing fine with no recurrence. The drs can only do so much after all they really dont know why we had the unlucky draw...but we did and we do. Good luck. Diane",

Until I had the Oncotype test done my Oncologist was ambivalent about my treatment plan being chemo or radiation. I am Stage 2(micromet in the SN) and Grade 1. I read about what can happen, and apparently has happened to some of you, with having radiation. My decision was based on rolling the dice to do something now that might prevent a recurrence or risk the hereafter and fallout from the effects of radiation down the road. I am a worrier by nature so I already knew there was no way I could deal with not having radiation now and beating myself up about it now or later but everyone is different and every case is different. We have to go with our gut feeling with the information we have at the time. I don't doubt for a second the cost of chemo is off the chart. I have BCBS and we had already met our deductible so we never got a bill for the treatments thankfully. I do know though they can cost between $1000-2500 a treatment and I had 33 of them..do the math. Staggering cost. One thing that I have learned from reading posts from all you ladies on this forum is we are all our own advocates and we are not afraid nor intimidated by our doctors and will and should challenge them in their decisions about our care.

I am not as educated as others about possible reasons your medical team is recommending all of that treatment but I can compare notes a bit. I had a micromet in my SN as well. I was initially Stage 1 but with that micromet my staging changed to 2. My ONC was ambivalent about what my treatment plan would be. My BS told me instant chemo. I did know that the final say was not his but the ONC. She or he will be your go to person for years to come. To help her decide my ONC ordered the Oncotype test for me. It is a pricey test but my insurance which is BCBS paid for it. This test does some 21 different tests on your particular tumor. They dont care about family history, etc. The results of the test which comes in about 10 days to 2 weeks tells the ONC how aggressive your cancer is and the likelihood of a recurrence among other things. My ONC said this test has been a lifeline both for ONCs who are unsure about treatment and the patients themselves because they are the ones subjected to treatment. She said ONC know they overtreat patients and this test is a tool they use to help avoid doing that. My score came back at 11 and my cancer was deemed to be non-aggressive. Because of the findings she decided I would have radiation so I had 33 Rads treatments and currently taking Tamoxifen. I am 2 1/2 years out from my DX. I dont know if I have gene mutation or not and by the way my sister has bc too - LDC and I have IDC. I also had a lumpectomy; my sister had a MX and did not have to undergo chemo or radiation; she is taking Arimidex. Oncologists are divided about treatment plans; some seem to attack the cancer more vigorously than others but at the end of the day the decision is yours - after all it is your life. Of course you are exhausted mentally and physically and that drive doesnt help nor does the pressure from your workplace. You are on a emotional roller coaster right now and I know you are tired and it is hard to think straight. I think if I were you I would look at the chance of recurrence if you did only the Tamoxifen and did not do chemo or rads and then decide. Since I had a lumpectomy and not a mx my decision was different than yours. My sister did not have node involvement but she did have to have a lesion on her lung that had been there for years and years. She also has to have scans every few months. She is about a year out from her dx. I also think no one knows better than you about your own body just be sure whatever decision you make you dont second guess yourself or look back. And finally I do think you can have too much treatment. I will tell you Rads werent bad at all for me but they have been for other women. A friend of mine had a double mx and chemo but could not tolerate Arimidex or Tamoxifen...she just passed the 5 year mark so you never know. You might want to consider another opinion just to be sure. Good luck. Keep us posted Diane",

If it had been mandatory that would have been a different story of course. I know the score will help the onc decide my treatment but now I am confused about whether it matters that much. I guess that will be decided dependent on the score. Like everyone else I want to fight the cancer with everything I can get but not sure if the benefits of chemo will outweight the side effects. I guess that will be decided when the score comes back. I posted earlier that the people conducting the test said 51% of the time the score comes back low...30% intermediate and 20% high.

There are a number of links on this website that can address or at least comment on your specific concerns. The women on this website have all been to hell and back with BC.

Not everyone feels the same so you might be different. Do you feel comfortable talking to your supervisor about your situation? After all it is only temporary so it isnt like you are asking for a permanent change in your schedule. You might also want to talk to your HR department. Dont know how it works with your profession but I spoke with my HR rep when I was first diagnosed and throughout my treatment. I agree with heavenschild about someone with the RADS center possibly offering assistance. Several women who went through RADS when I did made early morning appts - like 7:30 and went to work but they werent working as much as you are. I went to the Baptist Hospital Cancer Center for my treatments(Memphis) and they dont stay open that late. I know they need to accommodate people who cant be late to work and need to go after work. I am blessed because I took leave from my job(corporate job) and I only work part time. Also do rely on friends and family to help because I was told over and over again by the RADS techs to listen to your body when you are tired. It isnt like you can help it. Good luck...Try not to worry and the time will go by fast. diane",

This insidious disease is supposed to be reserved for genetic connections and an unhealthy lifestylesbut we do know now that\u2019s not always the case. In my case my sister and I both got BC. Our mother had it when she was in her late 60s. She did take Premarin during menopause which we have discovered is a direct link to BC. Who knew? I think we all agree support from family and friends is paramount. Rely and accept help when you need it. A church group I joined was a godsend. We compared notes and offered suggestions based on our individual experiences. We even had a radiologist and psychologist come and talk to the group. It helps when you can go one on one with experts. We have a small intimate group but we have become friends. There is reason for hope and optimism. While BC isn\u2019t one size, fits all there is a lot of sage advice available on this website. Who knows better than us what you are going through? Btw I am 7 years out last August. So far, so good. I had IDC, Stage 1b, Grade 1. I had a lumpectomy and 33 radiation treatments.

Recovery takes time and even when we have responsibilities like kids, etc.,  you still have to take it easy and let yourself heal. A family member brought food for us which was nice but the most comfort I found came from being able to vent and talk about what happened with friends esp ones who had been through it. One in particular was a godsend. She is a nurse at St. Jude and had been through a double mx. Some people just want to be left alone and I was one of those people.

Grades are determined by the size and fortunately I was still a Grade 1. Fact is there are no guarantees whatever grade or stage you are. We all know people who have survived many years from having Stage IV BC. Frankly I dont think they really know why other than the obvious that the cancer spread. We are all labeled with the C word and will forever be looking over our shoulder and panic when its mammogram appt time but try and not let it take over your life. Cant help the physical part but cant work on the emotional one. One day at a time. Keep the faith. Diane",

Good news for you is your tumor is Stage 0. That typically means it is non-invasive meaning it has not travelled into the breast tissue. Your BS is already planning for a lumpectomy which is also good because most ONC want to save the breast if they can. I had a lumpectomy and it is no big deal. Once you have that surgery the Path report comes back and the BS will discuss it with you and then she forwards it to your ONC. Your ONC will decide treatment. If the Path report validates what the BS thinks then you more than likely will have radiation. My sister in law had radiation called mammocite which means you would go 5 days a week, 2x a day and then you would be done instead of the 31 treatments I have to have. My tumor was smaller than yours but I did have a micromet in the SN so it went from Stage l to Stage 2. I dodged chemo because I had a low oncotype score(a test ONC like patients to have done to determine if how aggressive the tumor is) and my tumor was determined to be non aggressive. Waiting is the hardest part but believe me there are a lot of women who wish their cancer was Stage 0...keep us posted. Diane",

Oncologists have said for years they have overtreated women and the Oncotype tests provides information about your particular cancer. They dissect and redissect your tissue sample and arrive at a number that predicts recurrence, accurate size of your cancer and how aggressive it is. Oncologists are however on the fence when a score comes back in the intermediate range. If you are on the low end they make a judgement call; high end typically means chemo or rads or both. My oncologist was on the fence with mine but because even though a micromet showed up in the SN it was so small she was not ready to recommend chemo so she ordered the Oncotype test. My score came back 11 with a less aggressive cancer and smaller than first thought. Had she not ordered the test more than likely I would have had chemo. I had 33 rads treatments so the test is extremely beneficial to oncologists and patients. I do think however the oncologist in beth's case probably should have ordered the test b4 subjecting her to chemo. We all have to stay on top of our particular situations by researching, reading and posting on websites like this. It has been a godsend to me. I was dx in Jan 2010. This website was my lifeline throughout my surgeries and treatments. Nowhere else do you have the kind of support and help from women going through the same thing you are. Best of luck. diane",

I didn't have chemo - I know easy for me to say and I'm not trying to dispense advice just saying all of us are afraid of a recurrence and you have already been down this road. I think that is very telling. I had 33 RADS treatments - I was blessed because SE's were minimal. Had I not had the Oncotype test I would have had chemo. My score came back@11 so my ONC said RADS not chemo.  Others who have been through chemo are better able to make suggestions. I know women who have had it I know it's no walk in the park. Surely your Dr can make adjustments so its not so debilitating.  You do have a beautiful family. It's as much for them as it is for you.  Diane ",

Hard to stay focused - absolutely but also try to keep in mind that if they were positive it was BC you wouldnt be coming back in 3 months - they would have acted on it right then and there. Finally, even if it is the dreaded BC it isnt the death sentence anymore. By the way there is BC in my family too. My mother had it and now my sister, sister in law and myself have it. My sister in law's mother had it too. Keep the faith and good luck...diane",

The test is typically done when the Oncologist needs additional information to make a decision about your treatment plan. Thankfully mine ordered it for me. I have Stage 2, Grade 1 IDC. The test is pricey but I think Genomic Labs who conducts the test will work with you about paying for the test if your insurance company doesn't cover it. Fortunately my insurance company did. I have BCBS. The test takes about 10 days to 2 weeks to come back. Mine was back in 10 days. I had a score of 11 which is low thankfully and an 8% chance of recurrence based on the fact my tumor was determined to be non-aggressive and small. I did have 33 RADS treatments and am currently taking Tamoxifen. It also provides you with additional information about your particular tumor. Definitely ask your Oncologist about it. If your score comes back in the intermediate range then its back to making the call which way to go. The purpose too is to determine what benefit you would get from chemo. We all know the SEs are horrific for some women so naturally if you can avoid it you would. Good luck. Keep us posted. Diane",

In my case I was already braced for the DX. Didn't mean I wasn't upset - just not shocked. I have to admit when I hear test results sit on doctor's desks for days I wonder how those doctors would feel if it was them or one of their loved ones waiting by the phone. They have to know how scared we are. Maybe sensitivity training is in order for some doctors. I've had a few charm school dropout doctors who could benefit from it. Good luck! Diane ",

The fear factor is alive and well but believe us when we tell you it will get better once you know exactly what you are dealing with. I have IDC too; Stage II, Grade 1. I did have a micromet in my SN which was discovered after my lumpectomy. My ONC ordered the Oncotype test which is a test that does specific tests on the biology of your particular tumor and produces the odds of your cancer returning. Sorry not trying to inundate you with more information because you are after all at the starting line but it is a test that will in all likelihood decide your treatment plan. There are so many links here that can take you through the process. This forum has been my lifeline. I was DX 2 1/2 years ago. I think most of us were kind of in a daze when we got the shocking news so it would be very helpful if your spouse or a friend could go with you to appts. My husband went with me and it was a good thing because they provide you with so much information it is impossible to digest everything. I have 5 children but they are all grown; my youngest is 23 and living at home. He just graduated from college last month. I was very calm when I told him. I was braced for the outcome because the Radiologist pretty much told me it was a foregone conclusion after the biopsy. I did like other posters and vented with friends who went through the same thing instead of my husband or my son. I didnt realize my son was so emotional about it until the night before my surgery. Of course you are scared - so are they. I have always been a perpetual optimist so I have not allowed myself to get down in the doldrums or freak out about having breast cancer. As I told my ONC though we are all forever branded with the C word. That is just the reality of it. I would avoid Google or any other type of fact finding search engine and restrict my research to breast cancer sites like this one. There is no real One size, fits all kind of breast cancer so there are no right or wrong answers. Remember it is not the death sentence it used to be and it is your life and you make the call about your treatment, etc. We are all pulling for you and praying for you. As for your children they will be okay. They are resilient. My plan was not to scare my son and I did my best not to do that. Kids are smarter than we give them credit for sometimes. My son's friend's brother has cancer so he was a big help to him. Keep the faith. Diane",

You may be positive that it is bc and maybe it is but until you have the tests you wont know for sure. We can all identify with not wanting to know. I was in a daze for months; the shock of being dx does wear off quickly because drs move very fast after that scheduling the appropriate surgery, appts with an ONC and meds to follow. IMO delaying the inevitable is just going to make you more anxious and I would suggest you dont say anything yet for obvious reasons...you dont know for sure. Sometimes being in the medical field makes something like this more difficult because you know too much. Still you are the patient not the nurse.

The ladies here are truly godsends. I am 3 1/2 years out so I have lurking here for some time. We all know all too well about the fear factor. It is alive and well but it does get better.  We aren't doctors but we have been there, done that and some of us are still doing it. Know this though even though we come in all stages and grades BC does not define us or you either.  I am sure you don't want to scare your husband but frankly it's okay too. Give yourself permission not to be the strong one. I kept my game face on throughout the whole ordeal for my family esp my youngest son. I saved my cursing and crying for my friends. Not saying you should at all but it was my way. My DH was very supportive. It was my turn to be taken care of. The Women's Health Center where I had my tests, etc assigned a patient advocate to my case. She was an angel. Hopefully you will have one too.  As everyone else said breathe...one step at a time. We are all here to help and support you as best we can. Keep the faith and keep us posted.  Diane",

I'm wondering what the reasons are for lowering the scores other than random group surveys. According to my Oncotype results I have an 8% chance of recurrence. A lot of factors go into determining whether chemo is the treatment of choice. Had the scores been lowered back when I was tested I would still not have opted for chemo because I didn't have an aggressive BC. My BS told me I had a wimpy cancer whatever that really means. I did have 33 rounds of Rads which was a walk in the park compared to chemo. There is a radiologist in our support group at church. We meet every other month. Great group of ladies who try to help others who are DX with BC. We have lost one lady who had aggressive BC from the getgo and a litany of medical issues like diabetes and lung problems. The radiologist probably feels like she is at a press conference when she comes to our meetings because we inundate her with questions. She said the Oncotype test is a good barometer of your BC and oncologists are relying on it more and more to determine treatment. Recently one of the ladies who has ILC found out her cancer has metasized to her hips. She was stunned and so were we. Her tumor markers were up so her ONC did scans and found lesions scattered all over her hips. They had planned to do Rads but given they were not confined to one area opted for the chemo drug for life. Idk if she had the Oncotype test or not. We all know there are no guarantees. We all make the best choices for ourselves based on what we know and what we can tolerate. After all we all should have a decent quality of life regardless. Diane  ",

In fact mine walked in after I was called back to be retested and told me it was breast cancer. I hadn't even had a biopsy yet. I also had radiation and one of the techs told me I was blessed mine was early stage and I would be fine. She had been a tech for 20+years. Wile I know it's just her opinion it was still encouraging. I'm 7 years out this month. So far, so good If it is indeed breast cancer there's a lot your daughter doesn't know yet. One step at a time. We all understand how frightened you and she are.

My ONC was undecided about treatment because even though the report showed some node involvement the tumors were smaller than first thought so it was her decision to have the test done. I am glad she did. We got lucky because insurance paid for it; had they not I probably would not have had it done. She said a lot of ONCs were using the test as a barometer for treatment because women were being overtreated. Not only was my score low but the cancer was deemed nonaggressive. It is no longer the case that node involvement denotes chemo. Depends on the size and type of cancer. However, had the tumor in the SN been large maybe my treatment would have been different. As it is I think I am going to proceed with radiation. A score of 11 means less than 6% chance of recurrence. I am concerned because my tumor is in my left breast which is right over the heart. There are side effects to chemo and radiation but at the end of the day it is our lives so we may the call.",

Genomic Labs does testing on the biology of your particular cancer. No family history, etc., is factored in. I think it is 21 different tests. They then calculate a \"score\" based on the results of those tests...size of the tumor, type, etc. My ONC said for years women have been overtreated so this test has given them a tool to help determine the best treatment. I am so thankful for that test. My score came back 11. Because of that score I had RADS instead of chemo...33 treatments but at least not chemo. The only problem with the test for ONC is when your score comes back in the intermediate range; then the dr has to make the call which treatment is best.

We fall into the high risk category although Oncologists are saying the vast majority of bc cases are not high risk. Go figure. I think they just dont know why and hopefully they will soon. It is enough of a burden when you are older but now younger women are having to deal with this dx and worry about it for much longer and the bc they are getting is aggressive. I think birth control pills have some bearing and we already know hormone therapy did. When my mother was dx in her late 60s the drs immediately took off Premarin. I did take hormone therapy for a few years when I was thrown into early menopause but it never did a lot of good for me. I remember asking my Ob-Gyn what to do and he didnt have a definitive answer. My sister never took them but she still got bc. We both are probably carrying the gene.

I think a lot of doctors say they would be okay with seeking another opinion when in reality sometimes their ego gets in the way of allowing another doctor's input. That happened to my youngest son. The doctor even called me and said he was available for the doctor to call him - okay that was allright - but also he was confident it would be the same Dx. It wasn't. I didn't have treatment concerns with my Oncotype score because it was 11 but I know several women who are/were in the same boat as you are...what to do, what to do. I think a second opinion will give you peace of mind. Having chemo is a big deal and a difficult decision. You need medical expertise but the decision is still yours. My BS didn't recommend an oncologist for me - actually the friend who recommended him did. I like her - she is very direct and compassionate; I see her every 6 months. While a lot of us may have had our surgeries, etc., in a more timely manner than you did I am sure they would not have delayed those procedures if you had a situation that could not wait. Let us know what you find out from the second doctor. Good luck. Diane",

Good grief he is a very well known and respected BS but he is severely lacking in the bedside manner dept. Anyway it turns out the oncologist recommended the oncotype test. She was undecided whether I should have chemo or rads because even though there was cancer in the SN it was a micromet. So, I had the test done and thankfully the score came back at 11. They also said the cancer was non-aggressive. I cried for the first time since I was dx. I told the BS office I thought my score was going to be 80...she said she had never seen an 80 but she has seen a 64 score. My BS was so confident I was going to have to have chemo because of the cancer in the SN but my oncologist told me it was no longer a slam dunk. She said doctors have discovered they have overtreated some women so the oncotype test is a barometer they use to help determine what treatment is best. So I will be having rads in a month and on Arimedex. Had the second surgery last Monday to even up the margins. Should get the Path report back tomorrow. Sore today but otherwise okay. Thanks again for asking. Hope things are going well for you.   diane",

That's what happened to me b4 my lumpectomy. Dont smoke a lot but still smoked. In surgery the head nurse asked me how long I had smoked and told me to take a deep breath. Drs werent concerned but apparently she was. Oxygen level was 97%; 95 is normal but of course they want you to have 100%. Anyway drs are almost paranoid about taking a patient to surgery these days. Things happen unfortunately. I cant understand ever removing something w/o a biopsy unless the dr is convinced it is a cyst. I had several of those removed b4 I was dx. You just need to have confidence in your dr regardless and there are zillions of those out there. Totally agree with everyone else about a BS.

The priest responded by saying \"who do you think helped you get through this?\" You certainly don't need permission to vent. Don't blame you a bit. We have all drawn the unlucky card. I am curious about radiation as your treatment. I thought you couldn't have it again but maybe that's just for BC? It doesn't make me feel more optimistic when I read or hear about women with worse situations than mine because I feel bad for them but it does make me feel more blessed. Regardless cancer doesn't define us. You got through a horrific medical crisis before and you will again. Good luck and keep the faith. Diane",

I know if you have lung cancer it shows up first on a chest xray. I never experienced anything like that but to be fair I dont know anything about your Mom's BC.

No one should tell you not to worry because none of us knows either but of course it might not be cancer. I would probably give them until lunchtime on Friday and then call. I had a friend who had a test that was potentially serious and they were supposed to call on Friday. They didnt and she was a wreck all weekend. Good news was it wasnt what they thought it was and she was okay. Everyone is different and some people, like my husband, can wait for the call. I didnt have to because the radiologist had already pretty much told me what she thought it was in no uncertain terms and I figured since she had seen a zillion biopsies the likelihood of it not being cancer was slim and none so when I got the call I was disappointed and scared but not totally surprised. I was already braced for it. Maybe you can keep in mind even if it is the worst it isnt the death sentence anymore. Good luck. Let us know. Diane",

I have Stage 2, Grade 1 BC. I didn't find it - the mammogram did. The difference for me during the time leading up to their finding it was I lost weight. Typically, weight loss combined with other factors CAN be a sign of cancer. I had no idea. I had cut out all the sweet stuff thinking that is what ultimately caused my weight loss. It probably contributed to it but mainly it was the cancer. For your own piece of mind, and you are so young, settle what it is once and for all with a doctor. Cysts are very common. We don't want to be dismissive of your doctor's decision because he is the expert but it is your body and your life.

My BS told me the positive node would get me chemo. They did not think there was cancer in any of the other nodes. And they have to go back and take out more tissue as well. My initial reaction was anger. The doctor was so optimistic after the surgery and while I know I dont have the death sentence and he cant know for sure, he still was so matter of fact about it. You know kind of like a hit and run. I see him on Tuesday and hopefully get my appt scheduled for the oncologist next week. I will yield to her take on this whole thing but I am bummed out. I also get tired of putting on my game face for others. We all have the right to be mad about our medical situation and to not have to pretend we arent scared.

My tumor was Grade l. The oncotype test came back with a score of 11 and a determination that my tumor was non aggressive and smaller than first thought so my oncologist said she would not recommend chemo but 33 rads treatments which I have had. I asked her why she wasnt recommending chemo and she said because drs were overtreating patients and the oncotype test has provided them with more info to make a determination on treatment so that we wouldnt be overtreated. Had the micromet been larger or my oncotype test score been in the intermediate range my treatment plan in all likelihood would have been chemo. I am glad it didnt. There are side effects to everything and with rads sometimes they dont show up for months. I have been released from my rad onc and had my first mammogram since my dx and both reports were good. One of the problems with rads is the hit your lungs take. My cancer was in left breast which is right over my heart so you have that problem too but again both chemo and rads pose SEs but they are the best treatment plans to help prevent recurrence. Listen to your doctors of course but at the end of the day go with what you think is best for you. It is your body and your life.",

Congrats on going back to college and making a 4.0 - pretty impressive! I have had annual mammograms for years too and before each one I went into my panic mode mainly because my mother had breast cancer in her late 60's. She died a few years ago but not from bc. Anyway in 2010 I went to have my annual too. I usually got this card in the mail within 2 weeks and I remember thinking the day I got the FIRST call that I hadnt received it yet. Wasnt panicking until the nurse called and said they needed to redo the mammogram because one breast looked larger than the other. Not a good sign but still I was apprehensive not freaking out...yet. When I went in to have the mammogram redone the tech did the same exact thing to me. Had her game face on but actually mine said she expected me to get dressed and go home. Then the radiologist comes in and the first thing she says is I wont like what she is going to tell me. To say I was stunned would be a gross understatement. The tech had just told me that she usually tips the patient off that something might be wrong....she didnt. This is immediately followed by the radiologist spouting off all these percentages about survival, etc. as if I could process anything she was saying...the biopsy was scheduled and done and the next night the radiologist called me at home and says how are you doing .....and by the way you have bc. Talk about a charm school dropout. I know there is no easy way to tell us but seriously...You go ahead and whine you earned it. No one unless they have gone through what we have can possibly relate to the fear factor we all have. Before, during and after and it never ends. We will be looking over our shoulder forever. That's just the reality of it. On the plus side bc has come a long way since my mother was dx. She had a mastectomy and no chemo or radiation. Nothing in the nodes thankfully. Nothing though will ever make us feel completely secure about having this disease. We can feel better if we caught it early because our chances of survival are so much better but we are getting ahead of ourselves. You dont even know anything yet. The only suggestion I can give you is remember if it is the worst it is not the death sentence. Keep us posted and keep the faith. Diane",

It certainly doesn't automatically mean it is cancer because they want you to have more tests. Be glad they are going the precautionary route. Obviously early detection is key if it is. I had a recall too. I knew mine was cancer because the nurse already told me one breast was larger than the other. That had never happened to me before and certainly not a good sign.On the positive side I am 5 years out since last August.

Good for you nurse-ann changing ONCs. I have only had one appt with mine so I dont have a good feel or real relationship with her yet. My sister in law has BC insitu; she had the same ONC as did a friend of mine. She is very well respected and has a good bedside manner. I have yielded to her advice because at this point in my treatment - I am doing RADS - I have no choice and I was so relieved when she said I didnt have to do chemo she is at least for the time being, my fav ONC. I dont understand why ONC are not more upfront in talking with us about our condition. Omitting information relative to our specific cases is not a good thing. We cannot possibly deal with what ails us if we dont know what we are dealing with. We all do our homework which is a good thing because there is a wealth of information out there on this forum and on the internet about breast cancer. We need to always go armed with that information so we can ask the pertinent questions. How you extract answers from your ONC I guess depends on the ONC. So far, mine has been forthright but to be fair I am not in a long term treatment plan so there isnt a lot she needs to make me aware of. So apparently nurse-ann you have had issues with your other ONCs. They are the experts but they are not God.",

Based on the biology of your cancer they can determine what the chances of recurrence are. I was told that for Stage I and II 51% of the time the score comes back low...and that is good. 1-17 is considered low; 18-31 is intermediate and 31-100 is high. My oncologist ordered the test because she is not sure how much chemo to subject me too. Even though I had cancer in the SN...microscopic but still there it typically means chemo but the tumors are small.  So it is a good thing/bad thing. Do I really want more info to worry me but at the same time my treatment may not be as severe if my score is low. Obviously there are no guarantees either way. We just have to accept these stats and tests for what they are and they are all we have to go on right now.",

The only question was how aggressive the oncologist wanted to be. Still you had such a low score and the fact chemo wouldnt help you that I can understand why you wouldnt have to have it. Why would you if it would be of no benefit to you....a friend of mine had chemo and her score came back 10 which is low. She said the fact it was invasive cancer was all she needed to hear plus she is a nurse at St. Jude and deals with cancer patients every day so she has seen the worst and seen it come back. I wish they hadnt scheduled the test because if it comes back high I will be even more anxious. It is also interesting that if there is only one node involvement the insurance co denied coverage. I have Blue Cross and they never said anything about how many nodes were involved just that I am Stage IIa.",

There are agencies where I live that will do mammograms for free for people in need and they should. I have two friends who dont have health insurance so they havent a mammogram in years. I worry about them because had I not gone for my annual mammogram my cancer would not have been found. Early detection is key. I also have a friend whose sister did wait too long and it was too late. She was scared; all of us on this forum can relate to that but waiting cost her her life. You can always come to this forum for information and people who will support you. This forum has been my salvation. No one understands more than these women do. The only negative information I have heard about cutting and spreading is when it is in the lymph nodes so a lot of BS do not remove all the nodes. There is a risk with any surgical procedure but the cutting has saved many lives. You need to do what you think is best for you and no one here will tell you what to do because BS is not a one size, fits all disease. Now that you have insurance you really should find out if it is breast cancer and then decide what you want to do as far as treatement. Good luck...diane",

It is agonizing waiting for the results but I was blessed mine came back in 10 days. I was told it takes 10 days to 2 weeks. My results came in the day before my first appointment with my Oncologist. Thankfully, my score was low@11. I have a non-aggressive tumor and if I continue on Tamoxifen for 2 more years - I am 3 years out - my recurrence rate is 8%. My BS told me I had a wimpy cancer. I should be encouraged by his assessment but I don't think there is anything anyone can say to alleviate the fear factor most of us have about a recurrence. Because my score was low I had 33 RADS treatments instead of chemo. I am so thankful for that. Once the test comes back at least you can proceed with whatever treatment plan your ONC prescribes for you. Keep the faith and keep us posted. Diane",

A cancer DX takes its toll emotionally and physically plus you still don\u2019t know the vitals of your tumor which can result in anxiety and depression. It\u2019s exhausting. So much to deal with and for the vast majority of us - a shock when we get the DX. I can tell you once you do know exactly what you are dealing with and the treatments are scheduled your anxiety will lessen a bit. It\u2019s the unknown that really knocks you for a loop. I went through the process pretty much in a fog. I wasn\u2019t really all that surprised when I was DX because I had never been called back to the doctors office for a redo. Plus I was told one breast was bigger than the other - game over. Be kind to yourself and take it one step at a time. Hopefully you have a support team. Lean on them. You will get through this.

The judge was a woman so at least there isn't a gender issue. I listened to a discussion about the this subject this morning. The ex lives in Chicago and has a good job. The mother doesnt work and in all probability, can't. I dont have Stage IV cancer; I have Stage II but I like everyone else, have had surgeries and will now start a long term treatment plan of 31 radiation treatments. An attorney who spoke in defense of the judge's decision said there were a number of reasons why the judge made the decision she did and not the least of which is the mother had an adulterous affair, left for the weekend and her children were cared for by the grandparents. I am sure that didnt help her case. I am ambivalent about this. Stage IV cancer victims have survived, some many years after their diagnosis, so why not allow the children to be with their mother for whatever time she has left. On the other hand do you want your children with their mother when she will be subjected to the rigorous treatments and hospital visits? The children are young - one I think is in first grade and one in sixth grade. How hard it has to be on them too. What do you guys think?  diane Log in to post a reply",

The children are forced to grow up, initially, in a single parent household. Not saying at all before you go crazy on me, that those parents are not good parents but like it or not children should be in a 2 parent household. Thats the reality of it. Dont care if it is old fashioned or moralistic or not and dont care about any stats you can bandy about saying the children dont suffer. Dont buy it for a second. They can tweak the stats anyway they want. Not reality. I have a friend whose daughter got pregnant. He is a staunch Catholic and refused to embrace the whole baby thing as if it was okay. Didnt ignore the child at all he loves her but he resented his wife and family acting like it was perfectly okay. I admired his stance in the wake of all the grief he got. As for education - get a college degree no matter what. Its hard enough w/o one. It at least opens doors and gives you a sense of accomplishment. Of course you have to pay it back - my son is. He graduated from college in May. All of our children did except for one and he is blessed with a good job despite not having a degree.

The chest X-ray showed multiple lung nodules in the lungs and in the left lung which is where she had radiation 6 years ago. She told her to get it checked out at the cancer clinic where she had her mammograms and see her Oncologist. There was no previous chest X-ray to compare it with. Her guess was scar tissue but of course she didn't know. The Radiologist would. My friend has constant allergies. She literally sneezes every day. No evidence of pneumonia. One lung wasn't completely clear and she was wheezing a bit. The PA sent the X-rays to the Radiologist. My friend said she would wait to see what the Radiologist findings were. The PA got ticked and said the Radiologist would agree with her. The report came back the next day as normal. Detailed explanation of their findings which my friend shared with her doctor. She has since had a complete physical with an internist. So my point being doctors are being cautious which is good but often panic sets in because we assume all doctors agree on a DX. They don't.

I was really worried about the Path report because I have had a lot of pain and discomfort from the recent surgery. Not nearly as much with the lumpectomy but BS says it is because the breast area is so tender and the lumpectomy was not that long ago so the breast needs more healing time. She said not to panic but if I have fever, severe redness, bleeding, etc., to call her. Fortunately, none of that is going on. I took one pain pill the first go around but this time I have had several a day. Really works too thank goodness. Now I wait for a month or so and get ready for Round 2 of the torture process with the rads.

My BS said that would get me chemo which of course I didn't want to do - who does - but my Oncologist wasn't convinced that was the right treatment plan. I was Stage 2, Grade 1. My Oncologist said the test was being used more often than not because she admitted women were being overtreated and the test affords them more information to make the appropriate treatment plan. It is pricey but my insurance BCBS paid for the test. It has to be authorized by your insurance company before your BS will send them the tissue samples. Also, Genomic Labs, the company who performed the test, will work with you on a sliding scale if insurance won't pay for the test. It takes about 10 days to 2 weeks to get the results back. I was a basket case until I got the call from my BS' office. I have to admit I would have a problem with a doctor saying no need for the test but maybe they are under such pressure from insurance companies about over-prescribing the test that they make a judgement call. That wouldn't make me feel warm and fuzzy. No guarantees of course but both my BS and Oncologist have a lot of faith in the test. It also affords me additional information about my particular tumor which was also deemed to be non aggressive. I don't think you can get the test w/o your doctor ordering it but I think if it were me I would press for the test. After all it is your body and your life and your cancer. It is really sad that $ has to play such large role in determining treatment but it does. My BS' office told me BCBS should think about the cost of chemo vs radiation which is dramatic and allow the test whenever possible. BTW I had 33 RADS treatments vs chemo - it was a piece of cake compared to chemo. Good luck and be persistent...we all have to be our own advocates. Diane",

Her bedside manner left a lot to be desired but that's another story for another day. Anyway, do take someone with you. My husband went with me and I am so glad he did for a myriad of reasons. He is an engineer and so meticulous. Plus you are kind of in a fog during the early process and certainly not thinking of all the questions you should be asking and that person will be. The doctors will inundate you with information and arm you with all kinds of pamphlets and advice. Take a deep breath and take the time to make your own decision. This forum is a lifesaver and my lifeline. While no one is attempting to dispense medical advice, and shouldn't, they can certainly relay what their particular situation was like and that is helpful. Keep in mind not everyone is the same nor are their circumstances so don't assume because it happen to us it will happen to you too. This is probably the worst part of your experience because there are so many things you just don't know yet. Once you do it will ease your mind a bit. Also keep in mind BC is not the death sentence it used to be. Treatments have come a long way. Do come back if you need help or just to vent. Good luck and keep the faith. Diane",

My ONC ordered the Oncotype test. Genomic Labs got approval from BCBS for insurance coverage. A few years ago when I had it done the test was around $5k. I have read it is less than that now and Genomic Labs will work with you if insurance won't cover it and you have to pay out of pocket. Anyway, my BS' office said 10-14 days before the results came back. I can tell you with absolute certainty that time period seemed like an eternity. I cant tell you how many times my BP spiked when the phone rang. Waiting for test results were more agonizing for me than the actual DX process. Anyway I got THE call the day before I was scheduled to meet with my Oncologist. I remember checking the caller id and shaking. I know chemo isn't the end of the world but lets get real no one wants to go through it. My BS needs work in the bedside manner department so I was relieved it was his nurse calling and the first thing she said was...good news and I relaxed and cried. The report was better than I hoped for and my score came back at 11. Great weight lifted to be sure. I am thankful my ONC ordered the test. She said she was ambivalent about my treatment. She also said the test afforded them more information to prevent overtreatment of patients which she admitted has been the case. So good luck with your results. Whatever they are you will get through it - we will help you. Diane ",

I dont have the same diagnosis you have but I did have a lumpectomy followed by another surgery to even the margins. I did have a micromet in the SN so I went from Stage 1 to 2. The Oncotype test is going to make a HUGE difference in your choice of treatment. That is of course TBD by your ONC. Some ONC decide on treatment regardless of the test. Mine didnt. She ordered the test and I am so glad she did for a myriad of reasons. My score came back in 10 days at 11 and my cancer was non-aggressive. Needless to say I was relieved. It meant NO chemo and I do feel a little more positive about the chance of recurrence. We all know there is no perfect science but this test is a good barometer for the ONC. You are young and even though you have a family history, as I do, the test is about the biology of your cancer. It does have some bearing on our overall chances but it won't be a factor in your test results. My discussion with my BS was that the ONC would decide the treatment.You have no node involvement which is good but your cancer is larger than mine which is Grade 1. Regardless this is not the death sentence. Yours was caught early too. Remember to be your own advocate. You need your doctors expertise but at the end of the day the decision is yours. Weigh the pros and cons and ask questions and come back here anytime for support. This forum has been a Godsend for me and it will be for you too. Good luck.

We are all pretty much in fear of being staged as III or IV because our options/treatments become more limited. It certainly does not mean BC in those stages are not treatable because of course they are. There are a number of testimonials from women who are still alive and kicking who were dx in one of those stages. I have Stage 2, Grade l bc. I have had a lumpectomy and 33 rads treatments. While I am encouraged that my first mammogram since the dx is fine the fact is none of us will ever be in a place that we wont be looking over our shoulders because we have the C word plain and simple. BTW some drs dont even do staging. You are right that most drs are more interested in the aggressiveness of the cancer. I had the oncotype test done at the request of my oncologist. She was ambivalent about my treatment plan because I had a micromet in the SN. My score came back low; the size of the tumor was not as large but the most important thing I took from the report was my particular tumor/cancer was determined to be non-aggressive. Frankly we are all inundated with information and it is next to impossible to process all of it. I was told I have a wimpy cancer by my BS only to find out he tells them to anyone who has Stage 1 or 2. Maybe drs are unaware, but should be, that we hang on their every word waiting for some word of encouragement or it will be okay. They can say the first but of course cant guarantee the second. BC is not curable but it is treatable and that's all we have for now. For the record I still feel somewhat optimistic because my cancer was caught early and so far has not ventured anywhere else. No one has all the answers. Right now we are all basically statistics. We cant hold the researchers to those stats because actually based on the criteria used for women most likely to get breast cancer - I dont fit and yet I have it. Enough said.",

The survival rates are supposed to be the same with MX and lumpectomy but if you are given a choice it is your own personal choice - no right or wrong answers. I think we all may at one time feel like we could have done something to not end up with this beast but the fact is a lot of us dont have those you are high risk for breast cancer categories. Drs do not know why we drew the unlucky card. We all have the fear factor going on but we all also have a lot of options and treatments available to us that werent years ago. Btw I did have the Oncotype test and my number came back at 11; smaller tumor than first thought and not an aggressive cancer so I am glad the ONC suggested I have it done. You will be okay; you have all of us praying and pulling for you. Keep us posted. Diane",

I had the Oncotype test done and that micromet was still categorized as node-negative. It is very small...thus the micro. Also node involvement used to mean you couldn't have the test done but that is no longer the case...see the link from cookiegal. My score was 11 so there was nothing to talk about as far as chemo for me. You do need to look at the benefit of doing it vs not. With a lumpectomy, 33 RADS treatments and 5 years of Tamoxifen the chance of recurrence for me is 8%. It goes without saying there are no guarantees but at least the Oncotype test gives us more information about our particular tumor and it affords our Oncologist another tool in determining treatment. Prior to taking the test my BS said the node involvement would get me chemo. It didn't. Bottom line is our Oncologists are the go to people for treatment. The one bit of sage advice I can offer is whatever you decide don't second guess yourself or look back at say if only. When in doubt get a second opinion. It is definitely worth it. You might want to read the link on this forum to ladies who did elect to do the chemo. Horror stories for some, not so much for others. Good luck with whatever you decide.

The mother doesnt work and in all probability, can't. I dont have Stage IV cancer; I have Stage II but I like everyone else, have had surgeries and will now start a long term treatment plan of 31 radiation treatments. An attorney who spoke in defense of the judge's decision said there were a number of reasons why the judge made the decision she did and not the least of which is the mother had an adulterous affair, left for the weekend and her children were cared for by the grandparents. I am sure that didnt help her case. I am ambivalent about this. Stage IV cancer victims have survived, some many years after their diagnosis, so why not allow the children to be with their mother for whatever time she has left. On the other hand do you want your children with their mother when she will be subjected to the rigorous treatments and hospital visits? The children are young - one I think is in first grade and one in sixth grade. How hard it has to be on them too. What do you guys think?  diane Log in to post a reply",

Her's tends to travel; mind does not. Doesn't mean it won't but they are using info from my Oncotype test to determine the likelihood and will not order those additional tests to preserve my piece of mind. Frankly I can't handle more tests to get nervous about so I am content to live for the moment. Doesn't mean I don't get anxious before my mammogram because I do but that's life.

They were too free with their discipline if you know what I mean. My mother in later life lamented what she did; my father would never admit to a child that a parent did anything wrong...never. Really sad. I loved my parents too but we all take our childhood into our adulthood. My husband and I do not and never have used corporal punishment. Both of us came from families who did and neither of us was going to follow suit. Even though my parents arent living now I can hear my dad reacting like your father and I think it is just the fear factor. Somehow if they give you the pep talk and talk about the cures, etc., then somehow it will apply to you too so I can understand denial. I remember my sister saying when our mom was dying that so and so lived until they were 90 again like then our mother should too. It is so hard to function when you have been dx with this disease. The fear factor is in all of us no matter what stage you are in because we all know there is no guarantee if you have early stage cancer that it wont recur. I understand the stage you guys are in and all that that means. I am constantly impressed at how courageous all of you are. I am for all practical purposes, a wimp. I have had my game face on since I got the bad news  - you know never let them see you sweat. By the way cool my husband was an alcoholic and now my youngest son has drinking issues. He works and goes to college and is doing well but still uses alcohol to medicate himself against what ails him and to party. Two of my brothers in law on my husbands side are both alcoholics...one hasnt drank in a zillion years and the other one is in serious denial. I cant imagine how difficult your childhood must have been. You havent come out of it unscathed but you definitely have come out of it stronger...we are praying for you. diane",

I agree with pp729 if you can have the test done I would definitely do it. Genomic Labs conducts the test and they call your insurance company to get approval because it is very pricey. Had it not been for that test I would have had chemo so I am so grateful for the test. All of us who have had the test done knew going in it could tell us things we didnt want to hear so it is a roll of the dice in that respect but still worth it to me. It is not a guarantee but a lot of ONC are recommending the test be done because they have been overtreating women in the past. Chemo and Rads are both expensive but chemo is more expensive. Good luck...by the way the it takes 10-14 days to get your results so you might want to move on it as soon as you can. Diane",

According to a spokeperson close to the situation, the ruling was 26 pages long and the affair, according to him, was one of a number of reasons why the judge awarded the children to the father. We all know the fact that she has Stage IV breast cancer was a major consideration. I am sure his attorney played the illness card; I would hope out of concern for the children but my cynical side it was used against her. I have a good friend who is an attorney and he too thought she should not have filed for sole custody. By the same token neither should he. Of course it is tough to have joint custody and be in two different states but it is done every day. He chose to move to Chicago. Why - job related? If not, shame on him. I know first hand about child support; my husband paid child support for his children for 13 years and while the big check every month played havoc with our finances it was his moral and legal responsibility to do so. I know there are a lot of dads out there doing all kinds of creative things to dodge child support. My daughter's ex is one. Shame on them too. These children have a lot to deal with and the focus should always be about them but my heart does hurt for her. She is battling the beast we all are and now this. More stress she does not need.",

Tamoxifen does not attack the bones like Arimidex and even with additional meds my ONC thought Tamoxifen would be better. NO SEs except hot flashes now and then. This whole process is very difficult. The DX is hard enough to handle and then be inundated with information and decisions to be made is overwhelming. Def need someone to go with you to take notes.

They made me feel more optimistic about my chances but of course they don't know for sure either. Cure is a word some doctors don't and wont use because what is the timetable for being cured when you read about recurrences 10 years out. They do throw out stats because that's all they have to go on. My sister has ILC and opted for a mastectomy because that kind of cancer tends to travel. My sister in law has DCIS and she opted for a lumpectomy and radiation. We all took and are taking either Arimidex or Tamoxifen.

One of my neighbors though comes over and asks me how I am and then says she would have brought over food but she knows my husband cooks? Seriously? Its not the food its her reasoning. Plus this same neighbor was like the town crier...she told any and everybody including ex-neighbors. I dont think she is a mean person but she def has a big mouth. She tells personal stuff on her familly nonstop and in fact doesnt want to hear about yours so I guess she thinks its okay to do the same to yours. I wasnt trying to hide it but it was embarrassing to be walking through the cove and stop to talk to a neighbor who already knew...surprise...not. She has since moved and her son and daughter in law are living in the house. I have to admit when she comes to visit I avoid her. I know I would be a better friend to some people than they are to me but thats okay. I know what kind of person I am..The so called friends who have abandoned you should be ashamed. diane",

For women with your healthy lifestyle it just doesn't add up but unfortunately doctors are at a loss to explain why other than family history why some women develop the disease. My sister, SIL and I fall into the genes category but even then that is alow % of women afflicted with BC. The fear factor is normal and frightening of course. The Path report will tell you a lot. Not trying to scare you even more but my BS didn't think I had lymph node involvement either but after that report came back I had a micromet in my SN. He was surprised. I was devastated. Since it was small my Oncologist ordered the Oncotype test for me. Thank God she did. I dodged chemo because my score was low and my tumor was determined to be non-aggressive. I had 33 Rads treatments. Not bad at all for me. Bit of burning and fatigue. That's it. I take Tamoxifen but that will end this month. I think we all will always look over our shoulders because we have the C word but believe me time does make a difference. I will be 5 years out August 22. We think every ache and pain is attributed to our BC spreading. It's hard not to feel that way. I'm willing to bet your stomach issues are your nerves in overdrive. Earaches are very common too but since you got BC you are afraid it might be BC related. That's a normal fear. People who don't have BC don't understand but I really don't expect them to. All you can do is what you are doing. You will be tested and monitored fairly often at first and any changes will be noted and dealt with by your Oncologist. The early stages of the process are the hardest but once you get through the treatments it gets better. The unknowns will drive your anxiety level through the roof. Also normal. Rely on friends and family for support and this website. It was and is my lifeline. I have made friends from this group of ladies. After all BC doesn't define us. Keep us posted and keep the faith.

It was several years before that. He called the hospital where I had it but their records were on microfiche so he wheeled the machine in and did the test. He was not happy. When I was in the OR the nurse said she needed to get my oxygen level up. Idk what it was it usually hovers around 98 and I was a smoker. She then told meto take a deep breath.

What you must do though is check it out and see and remember that it doesnt mean whatever it is cannot be treated. I am sorry about your friend. Sadly women do die from bc but you should also know the vast majority do not. Early detection is the key. I didnt do self exams either. I didnt find my bc; the mammogram did. I have Stage 2, Grade 1 IDC. My BS said I had a wimpy cancer whatever that means. Treatment has come a long way since my mother was dx in the late 80's. She had a mx and died a few years ago but not from bc. I would have a friend go with me if that is possible. I didnt when I had my biopsy but to be honest I was already resigned to the fact I had bc. Before then I had never been called back for another mammogram after I had left the office. I had been called back to redo them but never once I left. I knew when the nurse said one looked bigger than the other what it was. I would think bloating could be attributed to a thyroid issue or something to do with your periods. Unfortunately there is no way to know for sure until they examine you. This forum is a lifeline and a godsend so once you get back from the doctor if you want to vent or ask questions this is the place to do it. As I said we all know how you feel and somehow we all managed to get through the surgeries and the treatments and you will too if it comes to that. Good luck and keep the faith. Diane",

We ALL panicked when we heard we had the C word followed by more shock, tears and even anger. This disease will take you through stages by the stage of your cancer and your treatments. This forum has topics for everything which is so helpful. I liked my BS. He has a great reputation and is considered one of the best. He does need to work on his bedside manner though because he can be a little abrupt. I also like my ONC but not real thrilled with my Rad Onc. I think a comfortable connection with your doctor is crucial. We know they are doctors and experts in their fields but we need an emotional connection as well or at least I do. You already sound so organized. I was advised to keep a notebook as well. Just remember whatever happens this is not the death sentence and they have come a long way with the cure and treatment of this disease. My mother had breast cancer in the late 80s. She passed away a few years ago but NOT from breast cancer. Remember to read, research and ask questions. You are our own advocate but it would be helpful go with you to take notes. Trust me you will be so overwhelmed with all the information they give you it will be hard to keep focused. Obviously we were all focused on the diagnosis. I know when the radiologist told me she immediately began telling me about stages and risks, etc. I dont recall a single thing she said; I was still in shock over the diagnosis. We are all here pulling and praying for you. Keep us posted. Diane",

Think about it she has to if she wants to be employed there. Look what Robin has endured and she's back looking great. Just saying.

When she did order the test a year ago her nurse reassured me that the test was fine. I am like what test? Good thing they didn't tell me about it beforehand because I am a worrier anyway so I didn't know yet another test to freak out about. Since I found out about the test I asked her nurse why she didn't order the test and she said there were no indications on the blood test to prompt them to do so. She also said the same thing Momine wrote...a lot of Oncologists don't particularly like to keep track of markers because there are so many factors that can affect the numbers. I understand your fears but I wouldn't assume it is indicative of something dire. Do you typically have scans following the bloodwork? I have Stage 2, Grade 1 IDC. I have never had a scan and my Oncotype score was very low - 11 so according to my doctors I am not a candidate for additional tests or scans. I guess that is a good thing...for now. Good luck.

It would be easy to say it is because....but as one person said so well cancer is so unpredicatable...women do everyone right and it still progresses and the reverse is also true. They dont know why we get breast cancer so I am sure they are just as stupified as to why some treatments just defy the odds. Why do people who dont smoke or havent been around smoke or smoking get lung cancer? Happened to a friend in my jazzercise class. Perfect health but a cough came out of nowhere not due to a cold or allergy and she was constantly fatigued. Finally went to the dr - Stage IV lung cancer. She passed away years later when the cancer went to her brain. Unexplainable. Doctors are now saying 60% of the lung cancers they are seeing are from people who dont smoke. It is a total crap shoot. I have early stage breast cancer followed by a lumpectomy and radiation. I am relieved for now because my mammogram was okay(first since DX) but confident I will always be okay -no. We all have to look over our shoulders for the rest of our lives because we have the C word. Your friend has the right to decide and I agree with others it is her decision and her life.

My husband has also gone to the 2 mammograms following the surgery and was there for the biopsy so all in all he has been right there with me. He even went with me to my first ONC visit. I appreciated and needed his support because like you I do everything and was working too up until the breast cancer dx. I took medical leave and can still return to my job if I want to. Its a PT job. I get an early retirement check and SS too so after we crunched the numbers it is cheaper for me not to work. Anyway on the verbal side husband does not talk about it much. I am outgoing and very upfront with my feelings. He is the polar opposite. I turned to friends who have gone through the same thing and family members as well. They were my lifelines. I do think your husband is scared; mine probably is still too. I do have children but only one is at home and he is in college. He took the news very hard. If you can get him to talk about what he is feeling it would obviously be helpful. It is time we women  have our husbands take care of things once in a while. diane",

I was told the same thing that it would show up as negative because it was so small but like you I am worried because the cell \"travelled.\" My oncologist, whom I have not seen yet but will this week, recommended the Oncotype test. The grade of my tumor is Grade l. The Stage is 2 because of the node involvement. My BS said that meant chemo. My oncologist again has decided she doesnt want to overtreat me so she wants to wait for the results of the Oncotype test which should be back this week or early next week. One thing my BS said that has stuck with me is...they are more concerned with the biology of your cancer than anything else. The oncotype test does just that...it tests how your particular tumor reacts and the likelihood of recurrence. It also gives the oncologist another tool to use in deciding treatment. If I were you I would definitely consult an oncologist. BTW I am going to get a second opinion whatever my oncologist decides. Sometimes too chemo can be a deterrent rather than a help in fighting cancer that might be lurking somewhere. You have to weigh pros and cons and your oncologist should be the one to help you do that. Good luck...",

I get you are angry because maybe they should have stuck with the 6 month protocol but also doctors typically use history to determine frequency of mammograms. I\u2019ve never been told to have 6 month mammograms despite a family history. Would it have made a difference for me? I\u2019ll never know either. Just so you know mine was early stage non-aggressive and I was DX almost 7 years ago. I had no idea one of my breasts was bigger than the other. Go figure.

Genomic Labs called me and told me but they said they were appealing it and to have insurance companies pull a stunt like that was not unusual at all. MY BS was furious. He said my treatment would be determined by the test results and if things turned out ok on the test, which they did, radiation was far less expensive than chemo. We are all dealing with the C word - something none of us obviously asked for and then get treated like you have as if we are asking for something we are not entitled to.

Also I do have health insurance although a large deductible too. I met that deductible in 2 months so everything after that was covered 100%. Fortunately for my husband and I radiation was included. The cost to do radiation was in the 30k range. 33 treatments. We could not have afforded to pay that. Smurfette gave you some really good advice about funding your cancer and treatments. I do live in the USA so things are different here to be sure but I can't imagine there aren't agencies that offer financial assistance. It is unthinkable that someone who has been DX with BC doesn't have every resource available to treat the disease. Granted it is expensive but there is a lot of press out there of groups and agencies offering help. We shouldn't have to endure financial worries on top of fighting this disease. Since I didn't have chemo I can't speak to the side effects but I know women who have. They said it was no walk in the park but it was the go to treatment to prolong their lives so no question they were doing it. Your doctors can advise you how skipping chemo can/will affect your condition now and in the long run. Frankly if I had your DXI would be afraid not to but it's your life and your body and your decision. There are no guarantees even with chemo. Just don't look back and say I wish I had.

To me it is child abuse but a zillion years ago it wasnt. It was the cliche...spare the rod...My husband and I have not been as strict as we should have been with our youngest who is in college so we are paying at least in part a price for that. He is a smart kid and for the most part has a big heart but every now and then he parties too much and you can guess the rest. So parents on this forum who dont want to pay for it later apply and enforce discipline when they are young. It is a lot more difficult to do it when they are older.

I am sure they know their stuff so if the doctor is giving you his take on your DX you can pretty much count on him being right.

My radiologist started the dialogue with me by saying...\"you aren't going to like this....\" I am like really? I was braced for the worst and it was the worst.
