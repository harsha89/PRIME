      "Content": "Puppers wrote: I am having trouble finding a comfortable bra to fit me, as my incision is on the lower part/edge of my breast and the scar tissue building up under the incision is very hard and painful. Any suggestions as to what type of bra would be comfortable?  I have ordered a small prosthesis/form to put in the bottom of the bra cup to help \"even me out\" - I wonder if that will help with the comfort issue? Thanks for any ideas!
