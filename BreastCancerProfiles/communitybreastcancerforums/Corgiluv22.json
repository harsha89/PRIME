My left breast is larger than my right and seemed to happen suddenly. I am 37 years old btw. Anyhow, got mammogram, and radiologist gave results right away. All looked normal and his exacts words perfect, he deferred on the ultrasound and sent me home. About a few hours later after dinner, I've been vomiting profusely ever since. Now, there is a bug going around my office. but my question is could the radiation, as small as it was, have caused me to become ill? Anyone else have vomiting or stomach issues after the mammogram?
