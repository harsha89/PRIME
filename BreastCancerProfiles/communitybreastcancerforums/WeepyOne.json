No biggie i have had them before and they go away. on 9-11 the lump got alittle bigger and began to hurt. By 9-13 i was in so much pain. My breast had gone up a cup size, swollen and red, buring pain, nipple inverted and i couldnt lay down or lean forward. My breast was hard a rock. On 9-15 i went to my doc and yes by then there was alittle discharge. She said it was mastitis. And started me on antibiotics. It is now 9-19 day five of being on the antibiotics. My breast is still bigger then the other. Stings off and on. Nipple is still inverted. I lift my arm and my breast pulls up and inward. It is bruised all around where the lump is. (About the size of a lemon) Itches off and on as well. There is alittle dimpling right under my nipple, and in the morning it isnt there, but by the end of the day the dimpling is there and spreading all over where the bruise is. Shouldnt the lump be getting smaller by now? Is this really mastitis? Im starting to worry... Log in to post a reply",
