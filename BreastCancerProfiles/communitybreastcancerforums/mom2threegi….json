In the past three weeks i have had the EXACT same thing. My hot flashes have completely stopped, I have been feeling very pre-menstrual, and I have had some light spotting. I have had a lot of pressure in my perineum too. I am going in for my Herceptin this Thursday so will check in with my oncologist. I am on Tamoxifen so I worry about uterine changes with that as they can be rapid and significant. I will let you know if I learn anything of interest at my appt on Thurs. Hope you are feeling OK today.",
