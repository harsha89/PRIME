I would ask your doctor if Xeloda is an option for you.  I am finding it quite tolerable from a side effect perspective, and it seems to be doing the trick, for now anyway.  I check the Xeloda thread often, and there are many members who have had success for several years, after other treatments failed.  Just remember, there are a lot of treatment options available, and more and more getting approved. All the best,  Anna",

Breast tumour was unchanged, and the 2 lymph nodes had decreased slightly, but my lung nodules had increased in size and number. Described in the report, as \"significant interval progression\".  I had only been on Tamoxifen for 2 months at this time.  I have not tried Ibrance yet, as I am still pre-menopausal, so I'm not sure how long it takes to start seeing a response.  You may want to pose the question on the Ibrance thread.  I'm sure there will be some members who will have some feedback for you. The waiting is the hardest part, but rest assured that there are many treatment options available, and even if it ends up being chemo, it will come with side effects, but your doctors will help you manage those side effects.  Your team will work with you to make the right decision based on your disease characteristics, and how you are feeling.  I was given the option of Xeloda or Taxol, and after discussion with my MO, we decided that Xeloda was a good second line treatment option for me.  I have continued to work full time, travel, and live my life, relatively unchanged.  I have also discussed what my next treatment option will be with my MO, as I like to maintain at least some sort of control.  I've been told that Kisqali will likely be the treatment option. I would try to get some answers prior to the 29th if you can, if only for some piece of mind.  I always feel a bit better, when I know what the plan is. Hope all goes well.",

Thanks,  Anna ",

Glad we had the opportunity to connect. Anna ",
