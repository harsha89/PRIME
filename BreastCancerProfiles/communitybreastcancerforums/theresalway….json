I'm just a little paranoid about left eye symptoms of my mom...which the oncologist thinks is nothing...she's had no drastic changes in vision...but her eye becomes difficult to open when she's getting up from sleep...and slightly smaller than the other one somedays at certain times.there's no ptosis...her condition seemed similar to apraxia of the eyelid.the opthmalogists think its eye dryness.she's had this for about a year now...before the bone mets were found this may...I hope its nothing and just paranoia.
