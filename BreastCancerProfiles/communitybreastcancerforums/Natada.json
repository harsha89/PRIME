I remember communicating with you because we have had a similar spread of cancer to the peritoneum and I have stents in my ureters.  I have also had ascites drained in December. I started chemo after that, taxol, and it has not come back. I am not sure why a doctor would base your prognosis on the presence of ascites and i would also suggest that you seek another opinion. I have been following the development of palbociclib and believe that it will be approved for us later this year, but  you can probably get it now on a compassionate use.  Also the immunotherapy trials called PD-1 hold great promise, several large cancer centers are allowing breast cancer patients to enroll. Of course this is your decision,  I will be praying for your well being.",

My CA15.3 became elevated 11/12,.  The only thing that showed on PET/CT was hydronephrosis, right kidney. It was stented open but probably too late.  Then a urologist tried to remove large left kidney stone, suddenly that needed to be stented, I have had the left stent replaced 3 times, and the right one twice in the last 7 months for various reasons.  My tumor marker keeps going up, especially high after someone touches my kidneys.  PET/CT all clear as of March 31. Going in for another in july.  Right now I have 2 ureteral stents.  We thought no function in the right so took stent out, but it swelled up, so there is some function, so stent back in. My BP goes up when stent not in and I have pain.  The right kidney probably has less than 10 % function.  Suddenly left kidney became sluggish.   Turns out that the renal pelvis was infected w/ a yeast needed to go on anti-fungals.  The stents attract these things.  The left kidney still stented open but it has improved creatinine now.  I do have right stricture in right ureter, that can be seen by dye test not PET/CT.  My GYN thinks it is damage (and scarring) from complete hysterectomy 4 years ago, that was exacerbated by the painful passing of a kidney stone on right, and the removal of stone on the left.  I have switched care because of poor onc and urology treatments.  Now is just a waiting game.  Is the tumor marker going up because of cancer, or because I now have stage 3 kidney disease and do not clear things that well?  I hate the stents, I exercise I bleed, my urine is always cloudy, tons of inflammation going on.  So make sure you have no infections as that is what caused the left kidney to go sluggish.   Also be aware, CA15.3 expressed in kidneys and bladder, which are usually damaged w/ the stents.

A good pathologist can really help direct the course of treatment.  Good luck, natada",
