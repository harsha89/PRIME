Ask the nurses or the doctor if they can give your Mom some ATROPINE drops under her tongue. Sometimes this will help dry the secretions, but not always. If she is truly near the end, there is not much to do, other than morphine that relieves the sensation of being short of breath or not being able to breathe. If they have to go the morphine route, then make sure everyone says what they need to, as she will be asleep probably until the end. God Bless, and hope you find some peace soon.",

Ask your doc if you can start some Nexium for your stomach. I took it thru chemo, and it helped, then I thought it had stopped, and doc hiked it to twice a day. Made a WORLD of difference. I felt much better. I believe the dose was Nexium 40mg. twice a day. Not sure what effect it will have on the tykerb if any, but I know it will help your stomach thru the xeloda. Goood luck, and hope this helps some !! ",

Then I would start a routine of daily cranberry juice, even if you have to disguise it in something. Also, drinking a lot of water and frequent bathroom trips (even if you dont \"need\" to go) will help to keep the bladder empty, giving the bacteria little if any place to grow. She probably isnt emptying her bladder all the way. Lastly, check her blood sugar, if she is diabetic she will be more inclined to get the UTI. Hope that helps some !  Good luck !!",
