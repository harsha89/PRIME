      "Content": "Kgmomma1013 wrote: hello all, I posted on this forum a while ago during my pregnancy. I had a lump that showed up under my arm while 19 weeks pregnant. My ob got me an ultrasound of the entire underarm and right breast. All was well. I have since had a beautiful baby girl who just turned 6 months! I breastfed my daughter for about 4 months, stopping in the beginning of January. I did experience what I assume were clogged ducts in both breasts that resolved within a day or two with home remedies. Weaning was also very easy and I was able to relatively painlessly. So about a week ago I started what has been my 3rd cycle since ending breastfeeding. Right before, my right breast started hurting horribly. Barely rubbing the side has been horrible. My cycle is now over and the pain is still very bad. It radiates under my arm as well. I don\u2019t think i feel a lump, but my breasts feel different then I\u2019m used to obviously. My question is, should I give this another cycle or get it checked now? I also had a chest ct and X-ray a week postpartum because they thought I had a blood clot. Nothing was shown. Thank you all and god bless Log in to post a reply",

She did a very thourough exam (actually sore) on both sides to see differences. She said she felt no lumps or thickening. And obviously no outward change. She did order an ultrasound of that breast during my pregnancy which came out normal as well. She did say it\u2019s possibly an infected duct, but definitely not mastitis (which I agree with) so I\u2019m to do antibiotics and see if that clears anything up and go from there. I\u2019m pretty satisfied with that and will see if that helps. If pain persists will go for imaging. God bless you all and you are all amazing",

I had no idea, I didn\u2019t breastfeed my first so I don\u2019t know all the ins and outs, but it would make sense, it\u2019s in an area that I got a blocked duct before. Which tended to be more underneath my breast. I know mastitis can become serious if left untreated, so I will definitely be contacting my dr. I don\u2019t see any visual difference and although both feel more fibrous since weaning they aren\u2019t too far off from how they have always felt. I guess I expected some swelling or redness or something, but makes sense and will be following up sooner then later.",
