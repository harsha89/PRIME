I was scheduled for my routine mammo a week after Hurricane Katruna (I live right outside New Orleans and had other things on my mind then!). I skipped it in 2006; went in 2007 where they found some suspicious areas. I was diagnosed with DCIS in 2 places (one close to the nipple, one near the chest wall). I had the core needle biopsy where the diagnosis was made. It's difficult to relax when waiting for tests but remember that 80% of the further testing is benign. Hope for the best!

This site is filled with wonderful, strong women that will support you throughout everything you're going through. The waiting sucks and unfortunately that's pretty much all you can do until you meet with the doc. It feels like forever no matter how long you have to wait. I got my diagnosis/results from my gp at 4:59 on a Friday! I was devistated to have to go a weekend nervous and scared. I can't imaging having to wait a week! Maybe you can call the office and see if they have any cancellations and talk to his nurse about getting you in sooner (in my own experience they can do more than the front desk in this area). Reading everything about others experiences is both good and bad...good in the sense that you can see we've all been through some of the same things and fight everyday, but bad in that hearing many of our stories can scare the dickens out of you! Everyone has their own unique experiences and how they handle things. Some of our experiences are better than some, worse than others. Whatever the experience, it is unique to that person and shouldn't be taken as the \"gospel truth\" about breast cancer. Everyone's cancer is different to them and they have to handle things in their own way. It is unnerving to have to wait to see the doc. However, the majority of call backs are not always breast cancer. Many times they will tell you they just want to watch the lump or do more testing (such as a needle biopsy) just to err on the side of caution. Telling to you take a deep breath and relax probably won't help (but that's what I'm telling you!). I hope you are able to get in sooner. Please post again to let us know how things went. Take care.

It's a tough decision and getting lots of opinions may help but at the end of the day, you have to be happy with whatever decision you make. There were days when I'd change my mind about 100 times...one minute no recon, the next recon. It just got so tiresome trying to decide. I kept playing the \"what if game\"...What if I look funny with just one boob? What if I look funny with an implant? What if people stare at me? What if hubby doesn't desire me anymore? What if made me nuts! I went ahead with the recon and once I made a decision I was fine...until now. I'm playing the \"what if\" game again myself, asking the same questions and it does suck!

I just haven't adjusted to the implant. I have almost as much muscle pain as I did with the expander and I wasn't expecting that. The nurse practitioner at the ps' office said the implant may be pressing on a nerve and that's what's causing the pain.

I have talked to a few others that were deconstructed and their docs had them wait 2 yrs. before they'd do it. I guess because our bodies have been put under so much stress with surgery and recon it may take that long to get used to everything. If I have to wait another yr, then that's what it'll be.

My children are old (28 and 25) but I have 3 grandchildren (8, 4, and 2). The 2 year old I didn't say anything to because anything not Elmo or Dora she doesn't understand. For my other 2 grandchildren, I told them that Maw-Maw had a boo-boo in her boobie (and yes I did use boo-boo and cancer) and that the doctor needed to take it out (of course there was an immediate song from my grandson about boo-boo boobies which was great!). That was enough. I let them ask questions (\"Does it hurt? Can I see it? and my favorite \"Can we still go to Chuck E. Cheese?) and answered them honestly (the trip to Chuck E. Cheese after surgery was interesting and definetly when you want to have 2 things: help with the kids and pain pills!). You kinda have to tell them enough so they'll know (they always know so hiding things is never a good idea) but you also don't want to overwhelm them with too much info. Play things by ear and let their question be a guide as to what you'll say. After the mastectomy was completed, they came to the house and had other questions (\"Can I see it?\" \"Why don't you have a boobie and where did your nipple go?\" and \"Will it grow back?\"). I did show them the scar (after it stopped being \"yucky\" as the 4 year old would say) and was very honest with them if I was tired or in pain. They liked seeing the new boob get bigger after the fills (I told them it was a very special balloon in my body so the doctor could give me a new boobie). The 4 year old was fascinated by that. She crawled on my lap one night when I still had the expander and told me \"Maw-maw, that boobie isn't squishy like the other one\". When I told her I was getting a soft boobie for christmas, her eyes lit up and said \"From Santa?\". It was toooooo cute. I broke into song and started singing \"All I want for Christmas is my new boob-ie, my new boob-ie, my new boob-ie\". It was funny and got funnier when her pre-k teacher asked me about the song when I picked her up one afternoon because they were learning \"All I want for Christmas is my 2 front teeth\" and she told her teacher that wasn't the song and proceeded to sing her my version. I know this is an overwhelming and difficult time for you and your family. Shirlann is a pro at this and always gives good advise and I agree with her and Cynthia. The only pearls of wisdom I can offer is this: Cry when you need to, try to keep a sense of humor because it really helps especially in the dark days, and hug your little man as much as you can-it'll make both of you feel wonderful!

When we're young, our breast tissue is usually very dense and as we age and go through menopause, the tissue becomes fatty.  Some studies have linked fat in general (being normal weight with fatty breasts or just being overweight) to increased incidences in breast cancer. Also, some women going through menopause may take hormone replacement which could increase their chances of developing breast cancer. We are also exposed to estrogen-like chemicals in the environment (such as some cosmetics, foods, plastics, etc) which some suggest could lead to an increase in breast cancer. In the end, cancer is cancer and it doesn't matter how one \"gets\" it....it just sucks! Hope I've answered some of your question. I'm sure someone who knows more than I will come along shortly!

I have a ps appt tomorrow afternoon to see about being deconstructed. I have a silicone implant and the boobs do look wonderful but feel awful. The mast side is always sore and feels almost as uncomfortable as the expander. I saw the ps 6 months after the exchange and told him I wanted it out then and he said \"No, it's too soon\". I thought I had a say in this!!! I'm to the point that I should have a few strong Bloody Mary's and hop on the kitchen table and take this thing out myself! If he doesn't agree to remove it in December after my semester is over, I will find another surgeon to do it. Barbara, I love the breastfree.org site! I wish I'd see it BEFORE the recon so I wouldn't be in the pickle I'm in now! I think it provides a very needed service for people so they can truly weight all their options for recon or not. I'd originally decided against recon but others I knew that'd had breast cancer and recon kept telling me how much I'd regret not doing it, etc. I should have trusted myself more on that for sure. No worries though...everything in life is a learning experience and with that, I learned to trust my own judgement. Thanks for devoting so much time and energy to that site (and this one too!). Thanks for listening. Yall have a good night. Margaret",

I had a silicone implant \"installed\" in Dec 2007 and I HATE IT! While the ps did some beautiful work on the recon and lift side, I hate the feel of the implant (and no temperature control...that thing felt 10 degrees colder in the winter!). I was going for my 1 yr. check up last week and to ask the dr. to remove the implant (he said \"No it's too soon\"). They found a 1 cm. mass at the mast site so maybe my wishes will come true and I can get this puppy out! Best of luck on your decision. Margaret",

I opted for the mast because I couldn't deal with chemo/rads and possible additional surgeries if they didn't get clean margins (unlikely because one was close to the nipple and the other the chest wall). I'm very happy with my choice. Best of luck! Margaret",
