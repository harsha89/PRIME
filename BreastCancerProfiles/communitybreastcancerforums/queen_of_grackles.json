Last year I had two core biospies 5/18 and 6/18 on the other breast because they found a suspicious mass against my chest wall and could get to it well enough the first time. So fast forward to today, where I am noticing a sizable lump on the side of my breast. In the same area that I had the biopsies. Curious if anyone here has had this experience. I understand swelling and lumps after a biopsy, but 10 months later? The other breast returned to normal several months after DCIS surgery, so why wouldn't a biopsy site heal just as fast? Of course, I'll schedule a mammo because I'm almost due for my annual. Just wondering if this sounds about normal for a core site to still have a lump. Thing is, I only now just noticed it in the shower. Hadn't felt this before. So I'm wondering if I just wasn't self examining well enough before or if this is a new problem. If it is something newly developed then I have a problem because it is more than a marble sized. Not necessarily worried, but somewhat concerned. Probably nothing. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
