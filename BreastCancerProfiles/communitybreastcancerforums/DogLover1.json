    "Content": "DogLover1 wrote: Hey ladies! I need some advice. I had a duct removed approx 6 weeks ago and it's been nothing but problems ever since! Within 2 1/2 weeks I had a seroma with over 150cc's drained. It immediately started filling back up but the surgeon decided not to drain it again for fear that it would continue the cycle. Well now at 6 weeks post op it's definitely filled up and my breast is red with a fever ranging from 99.5 - 101 for the past few days. I have an appt this afternoon but wanted to get some insight from anyone who had gone through something similar. They've mentioned a few options, ranging from leaving it alone and taking more pain medications to draining it again to surgically removing the pocket where the fluid is building up. What did you do and did it work? I should add I've been on two rounds of antibiotics with this ongoing infection...they work while I take them but it comes back within 2-3 days after stopping each time. I'm concerned with needing to take a narcotic still at 6 weeks out as I know it's not great to take them. Granted I am only doing one a day at night. Any insight is welcome - I feel like I'm going to lose my mind if this doesn't resolve soon! Log in to post a reply",
