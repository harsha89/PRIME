She tested neg for BRAC genes.  I had a biopsy which was negative in late 1988 but 6 months later had a lump under the scar from the biopsy, waited around for another 4 months thinking that it couldn't be anything, I just had a negative biopsy in that same area!  Had to be scar tissue....then it grew more and attached itself to the skin.  Daughter started having mammos at 20 because of my history, she did not feel her lump but primary care doc did and also showed up on mammo.  Exact same size as mine, 1.8 cm.  She had a clear mammo the year before and breast MRI two years before also clear.  No history in our family other than me, now 20 years later her.  Doctors believe there is some mutation other than those they know about that must have started with me.  I worry more because she hasn't had a family yet and wants one....doc said she would be able to go off tamox after two years to try to get pregnant.  Hopefully there will be no problem with infertility after FAC, taxol.  I haven't told her this but I would rather she wouldn't risk pregnancy as she is very ER/PR+, and would adopt instead....but that is a few years off.  Have to stay in the present!",
