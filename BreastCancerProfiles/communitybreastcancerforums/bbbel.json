Doctor suspect TB instead. She said that my lump is a rare case, and the lump is not a lymph node. However, there are 1-2 swollen lymph nodes there. I had needle biopsy on both the lymph node and lump. Results came back, they did not find any cancer cells. Doctor asked if i want to get the whole lump removed and biopsy on other areas just in case but parents do not want to have surgery. Currently i am waiting for TB results which wont be out so soon. I also don't have any symptoms related to TB. A month later, my armpit is achy and uncomfortable.. if i keep pressing on that area, it will become sore. i am not convinced about the results. i am only 19 this year i am very scared. i do not have any other symptoms.. Right now, the lump has been there for 2-3 months. Does anyone have a similar case to mine? i am very scared right now. it feels like the lump is growing. Also, it would be nice if any of you can teach me how to create my own forum? thanks!",
