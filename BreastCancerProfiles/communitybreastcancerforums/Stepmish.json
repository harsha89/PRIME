Waiting for pathology report to find out if i need Chemo. They were not able to do the implants as planned had to put tissue extenders. They said if I don't need chemo they will do the implants in 3 months if I need Chemo them 6 months. I am leaving the hospital today. I am very sore but I know that will get better in time.
