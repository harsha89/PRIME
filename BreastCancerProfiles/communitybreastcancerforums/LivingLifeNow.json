    "Content": "LivingLifeNow wrote: What was your Oncotype DX score? Did you choose to have chemo or not based on your score? This question is especially for those whose score was in the intermediate range. For example, my score was 19, just one point from the border of low and middle. I chose not to have chemo because my ONC said it would only reduce my chance of a distant recurrance by 1.5%, but increase my risk of dying by .5%. Given my aversion to all kinds of meds, including vitamins, I said \"No.\" However, I do have to take tamoxifen. I'm doing OK on it. Would love to hear from more intermediate gals!
