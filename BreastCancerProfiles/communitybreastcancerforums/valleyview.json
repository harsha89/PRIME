In December 16 left breasts was full, would not drain properly no matter how much son fed of it, for about two weeks. On and off since he. Son says the milk is yucky in this breast. March 17 start getting chest pain, left breast, close to the sternum (but on breast still) find a small hard lump that is he cause of the pain. (Don't stress to much as it could be a blocked duct, trauma, alien invasion ;) (also dealing with partners Testicular cancer at the time) Some times my left breast feels heavy. I keep an eye on it as its sore on and off each day/week/month. One night middle of June I feel the hard thing and it feels bigger. Not by much though. It's right next to a rib and if I hold it wrong it feel like the rib (when people feel it) some times I can get the little lump to be clearing felt but it's quite small. I'd say the size of a pea (or less) I went to the dr and she sent me for an ultrasound, technician felt the rib not the lump. The lump is very small, and right next to the rib. He said it's probably Costochondritis. After his I did feel around all of lymphnodes (last Wednesday night) I had lots of sore ones in my groin, one sore one on each side of my chest. The very next morning (5:30 am) I am feeling all of these lymphnodes I am in hospital with suspected appendicitis. Appendix was fine, had blood in the urine and high white blood cell count (16.8) had a ct scan (no contrast) to see if I had kidney stones (none) I was also unable to poo until yeasterday I did it mention the lymphnodes as I was in so much pain I didn't remember. I did tell them I had the ultrasound to check lump the week before. ---they can't be sure but treat for kidney infection with antibiotics--- The chest side lymphnodes are still sore, sore is the breast one. Groin ones not so bad, still bigger. I have been on antibiotics since Thursday. The stomach pain is gone. I think they are connected. I'm not sure how though. some days I can't get out of bed ( and only do due to the fact I have to feed my son, my partner yells at me to get out of bed) Questions I have 1) will breastfeeding make it hard to see anything on ultrasound? 2) will that small lumpy thing be a lymphnode? Or a part of the cartlidge 'Costochondritis' I can't find any information about if the cartlidge has lumps coming off it or it's one smooth piece. ---edit--- also they said I had either elevated 'Leuks' or they found leukts. From the print out from the hospital it says -Urine - leuks ++, blood -Bloods- WCC 16.8 Thank you if you got that far Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Feb 6, 2018 02:01AM - edited Feb 6, 2018 02:02AM by valleyview Hi, (I didn't have any follow up with the dr after the costocondritis*)  Back to the Drs today.  Last 3 months, pain in the left breast, different spot. Headaches left side of my head. Pain abdomen, right side. Neck pains, back pain. Nauseous Not hungry Lost 2kg in the last month (not trying)  On urine tests had mild UTI (antibiotics prescribed)  Breast exam lump in left breast (I didn't know it was there) and she said swollen lymphnode in my armpit.  She ordered a ultrasound and mammogram and fine needle biopsy. I had to push the point with the booking for the US/Mam. The receptionist said as im under 30 they usually just do an ultrasound first. I said no, the dr has both here, I want both. Also that they don't do the biopsy till they have both the ultrasound and mammogram results, regardless of age. I said that's fine, but i will be getting both. I don't think cancer discriminates by three months (till I'm 30) THe dr said once I'm done with the antibiotics for the uti and get the results of the tests we can look further into the headaches and abdomen pain.  Bit nervous, aware that all these things could not be related. Aware this could be a cyst or something completely benign.  But I'm still pretty grumpy that it could be something, after all this time.",
