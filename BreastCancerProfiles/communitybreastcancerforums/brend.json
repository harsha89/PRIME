She told me on the 5th, she wanted to start chemo SOON. I'm thinking, tests the next 2 weeks, then seeing her for chemo date, isn't soon. I guess I want to get this krap started. Sooner I get it started, sooner I get done. I do NOT understand why they can't all be done the same week, and see her later that week! Feel as if I'm being drug through the mud way too long. Nerves are wrecked anyway. Bipolar doesn't help either. Meantime, since I know most loose their hair with chemo, l ordered bangs, and looking at halo's. Anyone dealt with tlcdirect.org?

Closest thing that even looks comfortable right now, would be a nursing bra I saw online from Target. But its online only. I think I need to try on in store, due to some say I'd need a medium, and I'm thinking Large or XL. I want minimal coverage, and don't want that super wide strap like is on most post surgery bras. Looking for something with a small band too, as I don't want it hitting and rolling up where the drain tube was. Most have the 1\" bands which will roll up on me. And I need something VERY low price for sure, as with the bills from chemo, and the ones coming for surgery are killing me. Most of what I've seen looks like being in jail, LOL. And the price of the surgical bras I've seen is way out of my price range. I'm 1 week and 3 days out of surgery, and the drain tube is out because it moved. Suggestions anyone?

I'd tried those fruit of the loom ones after having silicone breast implants removed, when one ruptured a few years ago. They ran REALLY SMALL, and rode on my stiches (which would also hit my scar from the drains). I wanted something to at least let my one boob \"breathe\" and not feel squashed and confined. . Did the comfort revolutions too, they rolled up on me. I still have some genie bras, which the band rolled up on me too. I went ahead and ordered some of those \"nursing bras (lol, I'm 58) from Target website. They are criss crossed, SMALL STRAPS, and had back closure. Since some said they ran small too, I ordered XL. This isn't going to be fun when I shop for a \"real mastectomy bra\". Those are the most ugly, expensive things I've ever seen! I sew, so when it comes time for a real bra, I may put a pocket in the bra's I have now. Thanks you all.",
