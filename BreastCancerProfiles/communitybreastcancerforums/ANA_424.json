One night in that first week or two, I decided I needed to email some friends who live out of town and let them know what was going on. After I sent the emails, I had this moment when I thought, \"Did I just tell them that I have breast cancer? Why would I do that? That is not funny.\" Then I remembered, \"Oh yeah, I DO have breast cancer!\" All within the space of a second or two I suppose. It was sort of funny and sort of disconcerting at the same time. Later I decided that when something \"big\" happens, it can take time for the conscious, subconscious, intellectual, physical, emotional, etc. to all get back in sync.",

This did not turn out to be painful for me at all, but it was by far the most stressful part because of all the things I had read. That is why I came back to post my experience. Everyone is different and so are the protocols at different hospitals. I gave some suggestions about who to talk to, questions to ask, what you can do to prepare. Best of luck to everyone. Ann",

I took 2 weeks off for mastectomy (unilateral) and reconstruction with expander - end of May, beginning of June. I was able to work full time after 2 weeks. I'm now having chemo and planning to work as much as possible. I just took 1/2 day off for first treatment. Granted, I don't have an hour long commute - that would make a difference. I'm also able to work from home if needed, but have not done that much. No radiation for me, which also helps. One other thing to figure out is insurance. If you have it now, if you will have to wait to get it at the new job, etc. You don't want to be dealing with this and have insurance issues, if you can help it. My first thought is - follow your heart. If this is your dream job, see if there is some way you can keep it. You will get through treatment and how great it would be to have your great job to look forward to at the end of it :-). If not, then trust that the right thing will come along when the timing is better. Best of luck to you. Ann",
