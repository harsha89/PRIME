The white skin is very white and the red, red. I kind of itches but I have put a cream that is like a hydrocortisone cream on the small area so it doesn't really. It was kind of starting to do this a couple of days ago. But it is very visible today. There is no skin breakage. The rest of my skin is totally healed. Has anyone experienced this? I can't get to a doctor until Friday...?",

I got mine at Landsend and Marks and Spencers. They fit nicely around the breasts and protect the underarm by not having it be skin on skin. That's the trick. I didn't like anything at the end that was camisole like, sleeveless. Now I am back to sleeveless. I am very fair, smaller breasts, left-side, and no chemo. Everyone is different. I was so careful to keep my skin aired and creamed with what the docs suggested. I would go topless after treatment to let the creams soak in and then put on a top. You have to try things. It may be that you can put a bra over one of those \"tightish\" elasticized t-shirts. That may work. The bra won't be directly on your skin. I think that is the key. They marked me when I had my boosts daily so I wore navy so I wouldn't damage my tops. I am now recovering, skin is pinkish-tan, feel fine and am not over-tired. I think my daily walking helped me.",

Then later in the summer, in August, I really want to go and see my mom who lives in California and that means long flights ( a 5 hour one and then an 11 hour one). Would it help in this case to make a stopover and spend a night before travelling on the 11 hour flight or just going straight through? Anyone have experience with this? I am a seasoned traveller out of necessity who now feels as if my wings have been clipped. I am going to get sleeves fitted as soon as my radiation finishes. I will get whatever I need.
