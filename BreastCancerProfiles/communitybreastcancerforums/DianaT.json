Also, there is a clinical trial that is phase III for Her2+.  It is a vaccine that is very promising and will also lower the recurrence rate.  I have not had any problems with my heart being on this medication, just a runny nose.    Your oncologist needs to be as comfortable to you as your best friend.  I would get a new one, if I were in your position.",

No need for surgery now! I had originally asked for 3 treatments of avastin (it would have been 9 weeks then) but the onc won.  My RN started to grow 2 yrs after the cyberknife too, weird! I had the Brain MRI with profusion (not sure that is spelled right but that is how it sounds) and they couldn't say 100% what it was but the avastin and repeat scan confirmed it for everyone.

In the end she agreed to call me back, no call until this morning.  My CA 125-27 was 16 and my CAE was 1.0.  So I ask her if that is all ok, she said 'she thinks so'.  I have a f/u PET scan on Thursday and in the past my nurse has called me in the evening and gone over the results, so I request this again and the same nurse said, ' I won't call you, someone else will probably on Monday if you need us to'.  Am I the only one that requests this? My other nurses made it seem as if it was not a big deal to give me the results.  Even my very first PET scan after diagnosis but before treatment, my nurse gave me the results.  Am I being overly dramatic in needing to know? I think I need to get back on my anxiety meds again, because this is causing my blood pressure to rise.   Anyway ~ I am going to google the tumor markers to see if it is normal, but in the meantime, if any one knows off hand, please let me know.
