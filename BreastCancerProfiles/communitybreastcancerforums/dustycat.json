    "Content": "dustycat wrote: I had a bilateral mastectomy in Oct 2011 and I do not plan reconstruction. I have these flaps or \"dog ears\" left over from the surgery in the rear-armpit area. My surgeon tells me that she cannot remove these or revise these and that the only way to minimize them is to have reconstruction.  I do not believe her. I 1. want to know if anyone else has had these removed and 2. does the existence of these \"dog ears\" mean I have breast tissue remaining. Any insight/suggestion would be appreciated. Thank you.   Log in to post a reply",
