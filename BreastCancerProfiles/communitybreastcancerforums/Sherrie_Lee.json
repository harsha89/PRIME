He is not sure when chemo will start but it will be for about 5 months depending on how well he is doing. They found a spot on the liver and they scraped it off and cut another piece off.  They removed 15 inches from the small and 18 inches from the large.  He does not have to wear a bag so that is a good sign. Thanks so very much for all those wonderful prayers. SMILE and KEEP the FAITH Sherrie Lee",

He is a man of faith and knows that God has some wonderful plans for him.  He informed us all that this cancer has given him a chance to witness to us all about God's awesome love for all of us. Sure wish when I was going though breast cancer I could have had an out look on life as Don has. Oh I now this is a breast cancer board but in my eyes cancer is cancer no matter where it appears.
