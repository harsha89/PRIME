I have been wearing bright green marks under clear tape for a week, even on my upper chest for all to see. Can't wait to get those off (all but two will be tattoos after today), but mostly, it has been okay. My team is great but very young. I keep thinking, 'we need an adult in here!' but I am pretty sure they are skilled and well-trained. I was told I would not feel anything, but I have to say, it seemed I could feel something afterwards in the area that is targeted. We'll see after today's session again. I also feel a little sick- nausea- is that possible with breast as a target? They said not. I am having headaches and am tired - this just after one treatment so far. Does anyone have any idea if this is normal- and what else may I expect (even though I realize everyone is different)? Thank you for any input you may have. I appreciate this site! Elizabeth",

They can't be as bad as the huge blood marks on my arm from blood tests, and the staining of my veins from taxotere, and the four inch scar in my armpit from the lymph nodes, and the sizable dent and discoloration on my right breast from the lumpectomy. One bruise/blood mark is two inches long and one inch wide! They tell me I have scar tissue from so many blood draws. I look like a junkie on my left arm! I swear, I can feel something after the radiation. Any others feel anything? I have had two sessions. I think  I feel something. Am I crazy? I am laughing as I write this. I am 59 years old in three months. I am past bikini days and if someone my age wants to see me naked, I am sure he won't be perfect either. :) I DO feel for the younger women though.....",

They have so much more to deal with...I felt really bad.",
