This weekend we met up with friends and had dinner. I did not want to talk about my choice not to partake in 'reconstructing' my body, so I didn't. While we were at a restaurant, I went to the bathroom and watched a server look at my flat chest. It was interesting. I guess that my bottom line is that I am female and love being female. I am also an individual who had to make a choice that changes my life. I have never made decisions that would be considered 'normal' or mainstream.

Not in the least.  It is the ambiguity of not having breasts and how that is perceived by others and then by myself that interests me.   I have always felt feminine in my own way, with my own, personal constructs. But before no one else could see, experience or question my thoughts because they were 'hidden' behind a 'normal' facade. I know that generally, people don't look at or see my (new) body. And for as much as I question what gender means to me, no one has mistaken me for a man. Not yet, and they may never. But gender has come to the forefront of my mind and  so I am thinking about it. When I was growing up I wanted to be able to be androgynous.  But, from a very early age I had large breasts, 34D, and there is hardly a way to be androgynous with large breasts. In a way, I am living in a perfect world for myself. Now I can have it all. I am a woman, I can go androgynous, I no longer have large breasts that nail down a specific gender statement. I know there is room for whatever this new version of me is. ",

I used to feel quite modest about my breasts, they were large for my small frame and I never really liked them. I still don't like what our society makes of breasts. But at the same time, I had them, so I accepted them. Now that I don't have them anymore, I do (at times) feel conflicted. Confused about my body and my relation to it in the past and conflicted by society and its focus on gender and accepted norms (in this case getting reconstruction after breast cancer treatment) But I want to go with my original thought. No more modesty. Perhaps my hesitation in wanting to fully embody what my current experience is, lays in the fact that I used to have large breasts, perhaps it might be easier for an A cup woman to go flat, rather than a DD. Maybe not though. My mom was trying to tell me that as you get older that you tend to care less about what other people think, but then, she has not had to go through a life changing experience, where your form is not what you have related to for the past 42 years.",

I have a slight hersheys kiss on the inside of the right scar, but I like it. It seems to be flattening out by the day and if it stays as a kiss, I am OK with this. Last month my Man and I went to a yoga retreat center that we have gone to several times over the last few years. They have a whirlpool, that I have loved and is the big draw, beside the yoga and food. I never wore a suit before, so I made a point of not wearing a suit now. Needless to say, when I entered the pool and dropped my towel, the room went silent. Two nights in a row. Laughing, talking, I enter...crickets. I am not really one to recite an autobiography like, 'I am a cancer survivor and this is my decision, I feel comfortable with it and hope you do too'. So that was really difficult. I came home, made an appointment to have nipples tattooed and here I am. Now? I don't know. Visually, I think it will be soothing to have the look of a normal body. Everyone has nipples. But then, I am flat. I do not look like I have breasts, I don't. I have scars, my unaffected side is still red, which will fade and become skin colored, but scars. Nipples on top of scars? Vinnie Myers (the tattoist I have the appointment with) has one double mastectomy without reconstruction in his portfolio: http://vinniemyers.com/artwork/2058326_Spring_2011.html Her scars are more red than mine and her surgery not as flat.   Last week I was in a restaurant and I leaned forward, revealing my chest. I caught the eye of a man as he saw. In this scenario, I think having nipples would sooth me. So to nipple or not to nipple. should I go for it? I am an artist and the visual is important to me, but I also think embracing my new form could mean not suggesting nipples and not caring what other people see and how they react.

Sometimes I think I feel more female because I had something so profound, so intrinsic to what I percieved as my female identity become diseased. It is almost as if I connect to a broader sense of what is female. I think of the earth as female, fecund and fertile and our planet is also at a crossroads of dis-ease. For as much as I miss my breasts, I don't want silicone implants, I don't want to move body fat from here to there (not that I have much right now), I don't want to play into the concept of normality. I mean, this is normal. I am normal.  Removing my breasts seemed to me to be the simplest solution. Yes, it does make me wonder about my previous idea of gender and I am working on a new construct, it gets confusing, it isn't always easy. But I think with time, the more my body heals and lets go of the pain, the scarring, the range of motion issues, the less I will think about gender, society and perception. It certainly is a whole new landscape. ",

Now, I feel like I look more female and feminine than ever before. But I still have my masculine moments, I think most people flow between the entire spectrum of our collective human experience.  As for how I feel with the lack of hormones in my body. I don't feel sexual. I do enjoy it, but if I didn't want to have it, or resume sexual intimacy within my relationship,  I might forget that I like and enjoy it. I don't know if this has any standing or basis in reality, but I think pushing myself, my mind and my body to expand and explore new ways of thinking, enjoying and being is half the battle. For example, I was in a panic because I felt as though my brain function with at a low just a couple of months ago, so I began looking for games and puzzles. I like to sew, so I found some Japanese pattern books, now that is a puzzle. And it sure did help me feel as though I were gaining control over my circumstance. I wonder if this could also be the case with the lack of sexual drive. I will have to give it some thought. ",

You may find that you want or need to have reconstruction because you can't see yourself (in your mind's eye) in 10 years time without the shape you expect and would like to see in the mirror. I suggest you might check out the 'I look for flat chested women. A Rant' forum here in the non-reconstruction forum. There are half flat, flat, flat women who are considering reconstruction and another who is considering having the other breast removed for symetry. So there are a bunch of women in these forums that might help you with this portion of the equation. And of course, read up on the Reconstruction forum as well.",

Choosing to have a bilateral mastectomy without reconstruction brought the idea of gender identity up for me and I wanted to ask what other people thought about the topic in order to figure out what it means (for me) not to have breasts. The discussion has evolved and that is a good thing for all of us. Societally gender is imposed, learned, expected, taken on or not. We who have seen the changes to our body and spirits because of cancer, might feel the need to evaluate what the changes mean for us.  For the most part, I do feel empowered as a woman, a person, a human because of my choice. I know that won't be the case for everyone but I do feel it is a good idea to be able to voice our thoughts, no matter how ill formed, vague or sussinct they might be and to know that other people struggle too. ",

I have a slight hersheys kiss on the inside of the right scar, but I like it. It seems to be flattening out by the day and if it stays as a kiss, I am OK with this. Last month my Man and I went to a yoga retreat center that we have gone to several times over the last few years. They have a whirlpool, that I have loved and is the big draw, beside the yoga and food. I never wore a suit before, so I made a point of not wearing a suit now. Needless to say, when I entered the pool and dropped my towel, the room went silent. Two nights in a row. Laughing, talking, I enter...crickets. I am not really one to recite an autobiography like, 'I am a cancer survivor and this is my decision, I feel comfortable with it and hope you do too'. So that was really difficult. I came home, made an appointment to have nipples tattooed and here I am. Now? I don't know. Visually, I think it will be soothing to have the look of a normal body. Everyone has nipples. But then, I am flat. I do not look like I have breasts, I don't. I have scars, my unaffected side is still red, which will fade and become skin colored, but scars. Nipples on top of scars? Vinnie Myers (the tattoist I have the appointment with) has one double mastectomy without reconstruction in his portfolio: http://vinniemyers.com/artwork/2058326_Spring_2011.html Her scars are more red than mine and her surgery not as flat.   Last week I was in a restaurant and I leaned forward, revealing my chest. I caught the eye of a man as he saw. In this scenario, I think having nipples would sooth me. So to nipple or not to nipple. should I go for it? I am an artist and the visual is important to me, but I also think embracing my new form could mean not suggesting nipples and not caring what other people see and how they react.

I think this is an extra tough decision. I know I made the right decsion not to reconstruct. That I know. Right now I am finding it difficult to see people react to my body and lack of breast forms, I am not interested in wearing them. But still, I find it difficult to experience people checking me out. I could easily decide not to get the tattoos based on something as frivolous as money. I have the money to do it, so I am putting that argument aside. Knowing how I set up the decision to have the tattoos is one thing. But on the other side of the equation I am quite excited to think of seeing myself with nipples. I think I will feel more confident with 'nipples', and I think it will help me not feel so... medical. I especially like to think of them as art to help me heal. And, I would like to have something to feel modest about (not that I will wear a suit in the whirlpool next time!). So I guess I feel a bit vain too. Perhaps I should just tell myself to try the rub-on nipples and be gentle and compassionate as I figure out if I am making the right decsion for myself. breast cancer and all the details can be so messy.  Thanks all.",

I appreciate your words and thoughts on this topic.  Please do not think that I am anti-reconstruction,  I am not. I think each women who faces the decisions we need to face once diagnosed, should be able to have the time it takes to make a decision that is right for her. I would hate to see women who might perfer non-reconstruction, rushing into construction because her doctors or support system do not even think of non-reconstruction (with the use of breast forms) and/or going-flat as an option.  By all means, women should get reconstruction especially if it makes her 'comfortable in her own skin'. I am advocating on behalf of women who feel the need to conform to the assumptions of our society, but not necasarily wanting to. My main contention is, this too, is part of the female experience, once diagnosed with breast cancer. For my part, I would -not- feel comfortable in my own skin with silicone implants or fat transfer, I would not feel comfortable wearing forms either. I no longer have breasts and I do not want to wear forms in order to look like I once did or to make others feel more comfortable with my choices. I just want to live as I am, a woman who, unfortunately, had breast cancer.",

I didn't like my breasts before, they were fine, they weren't pretty, they were too big, they were what they were. My husband supported me throughout my decision not to reconstruct and he has said that he doesn't feel he would feel attracted to fake breasts, and I believe him.  This week, I started to think it would be nice, it would calm me, to have 3d nipple tattoos done on my chest. When I brought it up with my husband it was almost as if, the air was let out of the room. We both felt really comfortable with the idea. I would have never thought this to be an option for me, I am low impact, under the radar, not too concerned with beauty of societal expectation sort of person. But I do think, that I expect to see myself with nipples, and that it would make me feel more comfortable to see them and to know they were there. If I were to wear a lower neckline and I leaned forward, it would please me to be seen as 'normal', and to have eyes skate past. This feels like an indulgence in some respects and an act of beauty in another. I know it is just tattoo, not real nipples, but I can use art to help heal my mind and calm my relationship too.  I keep feeling like I need to justify this decision, but I also feel like, if this works and I have found a tattoo artist that I want to work with, why not? I am also suprised that my husband is open to the idea without much reservation, if any at all. We both want to see nipples, like it is more humanizing, less medical. Tomorrow I am going to call the tattoo shop and set up an appointment. ",

My man and I had just come back from a yoga retreat center where We have found solace for years. Prior to this, I had always enjoyed the whirlpool at that facility without a swim suit (women only), so I went buck naked again. I was not prepared for the reception I would get. I guess I had thought that I would receive more evidence of compassion, instead, you could have heard a pin drop when I lowered my towel. My husband, beautiful man that he is, just wants me to be happy. So when in a fit of panic, I came home to announce I was interested in getting 3d nipple tattoos, he was all for it. Whatever it takes for me to embrace my flatness. I have since calmed down. Thankfully. Back to my husband and how he responds to my flatness. I am a little more than a year out from BMX, he would not have my body any other way. He is hesitant to touch my chest, he does, he will, but it is still tender, tentative and light. We have been embracing sexuality again and I have to say, sex is better than ever for me! I don't know if it is because he is more focused on the downtown area, or that my body is more receptive to touch, but my goodness.",

She listened as I sorted my thoughts on taking chemo, as I processed my thoughts on needing a mastectomy, not wanting construction (I ended up getting a bilat without reconstruction), not likeing any of my options. She listened as I talked about my fears related to radiation. She talked too. We talked. She was a great support.  When we first got to the house she asked if I would consider wearing prosthetic breasts. I am not interested, I think they would just take up space in my drawer and cost alot of money, so I said so. I don't really see this as offensive, I think of it as something a friend would ask. So I showed her a garment I have been working on. I went into my room and privately put on a snazzy glittery tank, and came out to the livingroom where the top was, so I could put it on. My scars were covered, this was/is an outfit I would wear to a dress up event.  She looked at me and said, \"Your body doesn't look mutilated, you just look flat chested.\"  Then she realized what she said and said, \"I didn't mean to use the word mutilated like that.\"  I figured I would verbalize it here and get it out of my head.  Log in to post a reply",

Maybe this is because I am from New York City. I don't know. I need to come up with a cutting remark, to cut them off at the pass.",

I think I wore myself out, I was doing PT with a woman at my hospital. She just kept upping the exercise list, 3xs a day. I got tired! I changed PT's and like this new one alot. I am also relaxing on stretching as often and aiming for a quality stretch with each. I am limited but I can carry groceries, make the bed-with some struggle, go about my day.  My scars (double mastectomy) burn each day. I am almost 9 months out of surgery, 6 months from my last radiation.   I look forward to having ease in my body. ",

Needless to say there isn't alot of information out there on the later. I think the thing is, you should start exercising by doing the bare minimum of a full workout. Like if the goal is to do 20 reps of something, do 5 the first week, 10 for the next two weeks, 15 for two weeks and then start doing the twenty. Always in your best form, form trumps numbers.My OT/LE specialist says I should be able to do whatever I could before surgery, as long as I treat my body with care and let it know what I am going to do before I jump in whole hog.",

This is just me, a new me, but me. If I feel like discussing the surgery I can. Once your hair grows in, you will just be a flat chested or small chested woman, not a survivor. I think hair (or the lack of it) plays into the idea of being a cancer survivor, not dress. I don't worry about the concave. And I think the people who will notice that you have no breasts will be compassionate and probably have history that would make them notice and understand what is going on for you. But mostly, people will not notice, nor will they judge you or steer clear of you.",
