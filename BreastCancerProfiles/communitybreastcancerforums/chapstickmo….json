    "Content": "Oct 1, 2010 05:52PM chapstickmom wrote: The risk of breast cancer in both DES mothers and daughters has been proved. The study was by Palmer and Hatch I believe. I will try to post a link. In daughters the increased risk is for DES daughters over age 40.  There is good information on the CDC.gov website. Search for DES. Also I would encourage all of you to join www.desaction.org to keep up with latest developments. You should discuss with your doctors options such as anti-estrogen drugs such as Tamoxifen to reduce risk. Decreasing your weight to a BMI of no more than 24. Avoiding animal fat as animals store estrogen in their fat. Avoiding alcohol.  Increasing exercise to 4 hours a week. Also be certain to have mammograms yearly and follow the special annual gyn exam also found on the CDC website. ",
