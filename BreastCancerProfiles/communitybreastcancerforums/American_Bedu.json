    "Content": "American_Bedu wrote: Due to the growth of my cancer and my bodies negative reactions to many previous treatments, my doctor is proposing starting me on Gemcitabine.  Can anyone who has had this type of chemo provide some input?  I'm worried as I hear it is more of a \"palliative\" chemo.  I know my condition has continued to progress and in the last six months I've fought both liver mets and brain mets in addition to growth in the chest wall and bones.  However, I am by no means ready to give up the fight. I guess that segues to my next question....has anyone ever felt that their oncologist has given up on them and available options?  I do have confidence and trust in my oncologist but I guess I'm feeling shaky with treatment options becoming more limited.
