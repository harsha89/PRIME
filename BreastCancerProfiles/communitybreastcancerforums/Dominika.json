I'm celebrating my hairs 1st birthday today :D I'm 13 months PFC but i have shaved my head about month after  final chemo to get an even coverage. I always had a straight hair but after chemo i need to always blow dry them  otherwise they are too big :) I'm always using spray gel to keep them in place as they are much thicker then they used to be. it's hard to believe that it's been a year already! i had only one trim so far about 6 months ago but now my fringe is getting longer i will need to cut it regulary . i'm getting married next August so hopefuly my hair will be long enough to make a nice hair do ! :)  x   ",

I always had my Chemo on Fridays and on Mondays i was back at work . None of my friends or family knows about me being sick. Somehow my wig looks almost like the hair i used to have so never anyone aksed me about this and it's been 6 months! :) i just left work one  Friday with my own hair and returned on Monday with wig lol haha the only comment i heard was: o, u got haircut, it looks nice'  i'm pretty sure my co workers suspect something but I'm acting like nothing happened so i'm not getting any special treatment cc4npg:  I always had light blonde hair but few years ago i dyed it very dark and couldnt goes back to blonde....so there you go, i can do it now as they are dark blonde, just like my sons hair",
