I work for Verizon but my wife works for a different company. I think the only solution to Verizon's arrogance is a multimillion dollar law suit. I have worked for Verizon for almost 25 years. And in the past 8 years the company has lost compassion for their employees. The paper work is important not the person. In my case it is the undue stress of FMLA paperwork. Last year and this year I had to go through the \"Verizon Appeal Process\" because my wife's doctors were slow on submitting the paperwork. In the meantime, my absences were building up, and if they were not eventually approved by the \"Review Panel\" I would have been fired under Verizon's absenteeism policy. After discussing the situation with my supervisor he offered no help or suggestions for my situation. Verizon does not pay me for the time off under FMLA. In the past, any of my supervisors would have told me not to worry about it and they would have just given me the time off without pay. Today it is almost like they want you to fail so they can get rid of you. Ready2win, you are also right to watch out for retribution from your supervisors if you go above their head. My only suggestion to you is to get your ducks in line as if you were going to have to do battle. Have a definite plan of action for when Verizon blows up and be ready to Follow Through with that plan. Start right at the top with Ivan. Verizon has no compassion or conscience in this millennium.",
