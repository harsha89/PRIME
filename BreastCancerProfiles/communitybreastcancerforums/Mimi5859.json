I had surgery on breast 2 1/2 weeks ago. I had 4 drain tubes that got kinked and dr took them out so I been drawing on my own. For the last couple days it is pouring out along with loads of blood and dr says just bear it that is normal. I don't think it is and also my pain is still unbearable especially at night. He wrote me for 20 pain meds and I called this am and the nurse said he will not rewrite my script. This is crazy and if I had knoWn I would of gone a different route. Please help. Anybody gone through this? I am to peices right now n can't start chemo until wound is closed up. All love n prayers , Melind Log in to post a reply",
