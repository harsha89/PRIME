Other than that (and my hair being gone), no nausea, no fatigue so far. Appetite is good,  As for wearing wig and scarves, I've adjusted in one day.  It's not ideal.  It's not that fun to wear a wig.  But, if losing my hair is my worst side effect, I would be very happy (so long as the chemo is working its stuff on the cancer!). I am thinking of you all and what we all are going through and sending as excellent vibes as I can.",

It makes you look like you know what you are dong in the scarf tying department. FWIW, what's working for me physically (so far no nausea and no fatigue) is (along with getting Emend, Aloxi and Dexamethasone in my infusion and Dexa and Emend to take by mouth on Days 2, 3 and 4), is 1 tool softener on Days 1-4; two Pepcid a day on days 1-5.  I do take the Atavan (generic: Lorazapam sp?) at night and I sleep very well.  I also try to eat dried fruit; yogurt, lots of protein in the am including smoothies and a generally lo carb diet. I also have accupuncture twice a week.  I have only been walking my dog and to and from work for exercise and I probably could do more but been taking it easy. To all of you losing your hair this week, I am so pulling for you to adjust as easily as I did.  You all are going to look so pretty, strong and, yes, even sexy, in your scarves and, when you feel like wearing it, your wig.  Best to all of you for a good week.",

It was quite crowded in there, presumably, as Drim pointed out,due to holiday on Monday.  I am still pretty lucky in the SE department (basically no nausea or fatigue.  Yet.)   Also, had my hair buzzed on AC-2/Day2.  The really good news is that, because my chemo is neo-adjuvant (prior to surgery), we can see how the tumor is reacting to the chemo.  My oncol measured yesterday (after 2 AC treatments over 4 weeks) and, apparently, Mr. Tumor does not like the \"medicine\" we have been giving him.  He has shrunk by almost 50% (I'm melting, melting do you hear me?).  So for those of you who already had your surgery and wonder if the chemo is working, I'm here to tell you that, even those of you who think you should have worse side effects so you can be sure it is working: The Chemo is Working!!  It's not fun.  But it's way less fun for the BC cancer cells that may be lurking.  Chemo will hunt them down and kill them too!   The vibes I am sending out to all of you are so good you can't believe it. Just saying.",

Marmalade-skies:  Did you get emend, dexa, etc. in your infusion?  Did they give you some dexamethasone and emend to take home for nausea?  Everybody's different, but my oncol says that they can manage the nausea and vomitting.  I am so sorry for what you are going through.  Please call you oncol and see if they can give you something.  I got the full court press and it worked (at least so far). I think I can report that the Claratin (Loratadine) worked to ward off joint/bone pain after Neulasta.  I had shot on Tuesday and so far all I've had is slight pain in my shoulder this morning.  But I have coincidentally been taking Claratin every day for years for allergies.  So that might have helped me fight off the joint pain from Neulasta. Also, am managing constipation with lots of dried fruit and a mild stool softener taken each evening at 5 (sorry if this is TMI but you gotta stay ahead of the constipation!!).  I am taking a Pepcid each morning and evening as I was getting crampy stomach and acid indigestion. Still drinking tons of water and white tea. Berry/yogurt/protein smoothy in am helps. I hope you guys don't mind me putting in these tips on what seems to be working.  I just find the tips I've read on these dialogue boards have been so helpful and I want to pass along the ones that do seem to work. I am very aware however that I cannot expect all my chemo cycles to be smooth sailing.  Like I said before, just trying to appreciate the good days and steel myself for the bad days.  Love and good vibes to you all.",

Nanaof2: I love the idea of the birds using your hair for nests. When mine was buzzed last week, they told me at the Fantasia Salon that they were donating all the hair to help with the oil leak/spill in the gulf.  Apparently, hair's good at soaking up that horrible oil.

Neulasta boost yesterday.  I will be receiving AC x 4 (8 wks) followed by TH x 12 weeks, then lumpectomy, rads, and more H.  First chemo infusion included Emend, Alaxi and Dexamethasone for nausea.  Sent home with oral Emend and Dexa for a couple of days.  Monday and Tuesday were fine.  No nausea at all.  Feeling a little fuzzy and stomach crampy today but nothing too bad.  My chemo nurse said that not everyone gets the Emend and the Dexa.  Please make sure you get it because I think it really has helped stave off nausea. I know it is early yet, but at least the first two-three days have not been too bad. I am steeling myself for bad days ahead but trying to appreciate the good ones I have had so far.  Also, drinking tons and tons of water which is highly recommended by everyone I know.  It flushes the bad stuff out more quickly.  And another thing.  I don't know if it will work but I chewed on ice chips during the infusion.  It's sort of the same theory as the cold caps. Like your hair cells, cells in your mouth duplicate (or is it replicate?) quickly so these drugs affect them like the fast growing cancer cells.  If you keep the cells in the mouth cold during infusion, they might absorb less of the \"medicine\" that they don't need.  I'll keep you posted.  Finally, in other good news, the results of Friday's SNB came back late yesterday and they pulled three nodes, none of which had any cancer.  So I'm 0/3, node-wise. I hope this post is not too factual and long.  Best to you all.  I'm thinking about you and sending good vibes.",
