      "Content": "Ewallace wrote: hello everyone, I've been silently reading post and haven't had the courage to post and decided i should. I have bad health anxiety and worry a lot. I just started on some anxiety medicine also. I have an indent in my left breast in the middle and it is next to a thicker vein. I know I've had the vein there for a while, but noticed the indent 2 months ago. I had two different OBGYN's look at it and neither one of them seemed worried. I just can't stop looking at it and wish I knew what it was. I stopped breastfeeding a year ago and have lost about 80 pounds in the last year. Should I chalk it up to that? I'm 26 and have 3 children. I am also a size 36DDD. Big tatas! Should I trust the drs and call it good? Or ask for more testing? I don't feel any lumps and both obs checked and didn't feel any lumps. Advice? Log in to post a reply",

I can only pray it is nothing, because it is all I think about day and night. I hope that the ultrasound is re assuring. Can the ultrasound be done at the OBGYN? Or would I need to go to a breast surgeon? Thank you again for your response!",

I know it sounds silly after being told twice that i am okay, but it is a legit fear and I am hoping the ultrasound will confirm that everything is okay. Seeing the symptoms of breast cancer and the articles and news stories about women who have found an indent and it turning into cancer is what freaks me out. Thank you for your feedback though. I really appreciate it!",
