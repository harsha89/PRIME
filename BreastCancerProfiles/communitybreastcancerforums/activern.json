Sad but true.  I will continue to pray for her and all of you - this too shall pass.  All my Love.",

I will not go away completely since I have made some very great friends here in the last few months but I cannot risk my self and increase my depressive state when I have to think several times before saying the way I feel when I thought that this was the essence of a supportive group.",
