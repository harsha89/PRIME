I caught my cancer very early as it wasn't even a tumor, just a collection of cells about 1/2 inch long, clear margins and clear lymph nodes. I didn't know how to read my pathology report so yesterday, at my post op appointment, my surgeon told me it was very agressive and nasty. It was Grade 3. She was pretty nasty herself when she gave me this news. Scared the living daylights out of me. Should I assume that all will be OK? I've been on the internet today (big mistake). I'm scared to death. Log in to post a reply",

One day about a week ago I got the weirdest phone call saying they were from the health system I go to and after that all I heard were the words \"genetic testing\" and \"urgent\". It flipped me out. Well, what had happened was the insurance turned my test down. I just can't believe it. Apparently the doctor's office fought with the insurance company but I'm STILL waiting for the test. They're saying it should come in on July 27. Crazy when my surgery was well over a month before. Also desperately want to get started on whatever treatments I have to have.",

The radiologist said I could just watch them for six months, as they're no big deal. Or, she said, if I wanted I could have a biopsy but not necessary. Yes, biopsy, I said. I got a call from my OBGYN that it was breast cancer and I had two major panic attacks. My surgery was June 16. I had a lumpectomy and will have radiation. It was hell waiting for the pathology results. Making people wait for medical test results is some kind of horrifying thing that someone made up. Everything came back clear - clear lymph nodes, clear margins, 1/2 inch area was removed. It couldn't be better news but I'm still stressing, worrying that it will come back, just worrying, worrying, worrying. My husband died five years ago from ALS. We all went through a nightmare. My kids and I are not over that one. And now I have to tell my kids I have breast cancer? They're in their 20s but very immature for their ages. It's a double whammy and doesn't feel very fair at all. I'm worrying so much because I can't imagine my kids being without any parents at all. Needless to say, I'm looking for a therapist right now!",
