I feel like you can get a well-rounded perspective by reading here if you keep an open mind. About ten days ago, I found a new lump in my left breast. It is oval. About 2cm x 5cm. Hard. Not exactly smooth. Painless. Mobile. Deep. No discharge. No breast changes. I usually have very smooth breast tissue and had a clear 3-D mammo in Feb of this year. My doctor *really* believes it is just a cyst (and made that clear) but admits the characteristics are very mixed. Her reassurance was a bit disturbing to me. None of us know what this is until we get the imaging/biopsy. She\u2019s sending me for a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound next Thursday. That day cannot come soon enough!! I\u2019m a bit of a brainiac. I absorb knowledge. Even though I know ALL the statistics, I am worried. Iwant answers so we can make a plan. It might not be fun, but I can tackle anything. (That sounds good, right?!?) Anyways, thank you all... for sharing and giving me a place to share where I know others know exactly what I\u2019m going through. Reading the different stories and experiences has given me hope. -Lisa Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "leighbea wrote: Hi, I had an excisional biopsy on Dec 21. The pathology came back as benign Phyllodes. In light of the dx, my surgeon here at Vandy wasn\u2019t comfortable with the margins. So, she went back in on Jan 18 to get clear margins. My first surgery was super easy. This second one has been tougher. I was more tired and have had much more pain. My follow-up is on Friday and I\u2019ll obviously talk to her about this but I\u2019m interested in others\u2019 experiences. I have nerve pain that originates in my arm pit and goes directly down my arm to the middle of my palm. It tingles and all, just like typical nerve pain. My pain meds help it some but not completely. Is this normal? My lump was fairly big (5cm x 3 x 4). It was in the outer area of my breast, near my arm pit. My surgeon told my parents that there was a lot of fluid in the cavity that she might have to remove when I see her on Friday. Other than that, the surgery was straightforward and went as expected.

I saw my orthopedist on Monday (I have a torn rotator cuff we have been waiting to treat until the breast is healed). My surgeon and ortho are working together. They both think my nerve got damaged because of positioning in surgery. My surgeon has been so caring and so sweet!! I\u2019m taking a steroid dose pack to help heal the nerve. It hurts but I know this is a process. I\u2019ll heal. :-",
