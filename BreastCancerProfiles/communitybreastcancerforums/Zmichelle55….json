I have pcos which messes with my period and I'm due any day now for aunt Flo, so I'm hoping the lump goes away once my period is over. Crazy part is my mom and I both had mammo done the same day and they did find a lump for her which they u/s and told her to followup in 6 months. So I guess she and I can wait together. Haha (she's very rational and a super calm person) My Pcp did ask if they preformed an ultrasound but he said since the radiologist didn't recommend one it probably isn't necessary. My Pcp also did not feel my breast I just let him read the results. I just still find it crazy that a 2cm left lump and a 1.5 cm right lump can't be seen on mammo when I have fatty breast, I feel like one of them should have shown up. I am trying to believe that it's probably just my weird boobs. Haha they've always felt lumpy and odd which is why I never did many self breast exams. Heck I don't even really feel the one in the right breast and if my doc didn't make me feel the one on the left I may have not felt it either. He was also concerned because both my armpits are puffy. However I told him that they have always been like that and tend to seem bigger when I gain more weight. (Just had 3rd baby in Feb 2016 and of course have not lost the baby weight, lol) I do also trust the radiologist who read my mammo. He has been working at the hospital for years and has read most of my test for other things in the past and he seemed very confident when he gave me the results. Thank you all for replying, I greatly appreciate it. :) I'll stop rambling now. üòÅ",
