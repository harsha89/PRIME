    "Content": "eameier wrote: I am currently a graduate student in clinical psychology obtaining my PhD at California School of Professional Psychology in San Diego, CA. My passion is to work with women who are breast cancer survivors and improve quality of life during/after treatment. I am conducting my dissertation research study in the area of breast cancer survivors and predictors of depression. I believe that the mind and body should be treated simultaneously.  I am seeking women breast cancer survivors between the ages of 18 and 80 to participate in my study investigating the predictors of depression. Eligibility includes completion of initial breast cancer treatment (chemotherapy, radiation, surgery) within the last 4 years.  If you are interested in participating or would like more information please contact me at: Emily Meier  eameier.research@gmail.com 619-365-5160 I am located in San Diego, CA, however, it is possible for participation outside of San Diego.  I think it is important that we don't forget survivors in the fight against breast cancer! More research is needed to understand what difficulties breast cancer survivors may experience after diagnosis and treatment. Please feel free to pass my information along to any woman breast cancer survivor you feel may like to participate.   Log in to post a reply",
