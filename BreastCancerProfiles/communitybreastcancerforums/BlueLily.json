The leftover markings are not visible with a scoop neck.  They change the clear tape upon request but told me to request prior to treatment when they are lining me up.  \"Crystal\" is widely available (RiteAid/Walgreens/organic section of the grocery store as is Tom's...

I will be doing full scans this week to ensure no mets. I understand that grade 1, low onc score are the reasons behind the no chemo. The way it was explained was that the chemo does not attack the renegade cells only those that have attached and started reproducing. Thus the scans... its a pick your poison scenario.",

(premeno but on the older side at 46 ... as a grade 1 with low onco of 15) no chemo.  Went for the PET scan yesterday as an added precaution regarding metatsis.  As it turned out .. insurance questioned paying the onco test ... but after I called they are reviewing since it is being used to determine the benefits of chemo.  The grade and oncoscore are changing early stage treatment for many of us.  On a side note, I wish I had brought a driver for the PET scan, the headache and nausea made for tough drive home.    ",

No chemo.  I'm feeling like a thief in the night... like I got away with something that I shouldn't have.   My choices ... go with the progress of medicine or the standard practice of medicine.  I'm choosing the science. Here's the info:  I am 46 yrs old, premenopausal, stage IIa (1.75cm), grade 1, 1/3 nodes SN, ER+/PR+/HER-.  I am working with a BS & Onco at the Breast Center.  They ordered two assays; the oncoscore was 15, the mammoprint 7.5 ... both tests concurred a recurrence rate of 9% with or with out chemo.  Translation - 0% benefit of chemo.  This goes against everything I read about nodes & chemo.    I am having a full set of scans done (CT/PET) and if all clear I will do rads followed by 5yrs tamoxifen and 5 yrs AI.  I asked about ovary removal.  Current clinical trials are showing for stage 1 & stage 2 patients that ovary removal works best after a short term (1-2 yrs) of tamoxifen.... but the jury is still out on that.  I also asked about the UK not using the scores to determine chemo... she said that at the last ASCOP (????) that had changes.  I have to \"sleep\" on it (as if!). Anybody else have a similar story?    (note:  they told me never use the surgery arm for blood pressure, needles, blood,etc for at least 5 years.)",
