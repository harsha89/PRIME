She has bone mets and although she feels great, yesterday her doctor said her tumor markers went up and issued a PET scan to make sure they are not missing anything. Her scan is scheduled for next week. We have been told not to stress too much about tumor markers because they constantly change but of course it's stressful. Plus insurance is trying not to cover these PET scans! Our doctor said we can do CT scans instead but from our research PET scans are more effective than CT scans. Can anyone offer some advice? Thank you, Ryan Log in to post a reply",
