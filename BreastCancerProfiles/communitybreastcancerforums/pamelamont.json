My name is Pam and I am so thankful for everyone on this website.  I spend my entire day on this and I have found it to be a Godsend.  I too will be doing chemo the 2nd week of April due to my OncoDx score of 35.  I will be taking 4 TC's and radiation following the chemo.  (which I do not understand why radiation is required after chemo, any thoughts????). My onc told me that the chemo I will be taking has less side effects but, what I have learned about taxotere I find that hard to believe.  I am also entertaining the idea of having a port installed in my arm.  I am terrified of needles!  Does anyone have a port and what are any thoughts on a port? Also, is there anything I can due to build up my immune system or whatever else to prepare for this journey we are about to undertake? Thanks to all of you! Pam",

Did you have a lumpectomy or masectomy?",
