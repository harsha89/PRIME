My wife was diagnosed with Stage IV breast cancer last year. She has been receiving the most fantastic medical care here in Singapore. Before my wife's diagnosis, we were planning to return home to the U.S. since our children were getting older and we were missing home. My wife's treatment has been radiation therapy, chemotherapy (Vinorelbine) and targeted therapy with herceptin and perjeta (pertuzumab) we have been extremely fortunate that she has responded very well to the treatment and with all of her incredible hard work fighting this. Right now she is no longer on chemotherapy but only on herceptin and perjeta. Since my wife has responded well, we are now re-visiting our plan to return home the U.S. since that is home and where we wish for our children to spend the rest of their childhood growing up. However, this past week my wife's Dr. told us that my wife will need to be on herceptin and perjeta for the next 5 years. My concern is whether my wife will continue to have the same level or better medical treatment if we were to return to the U.S. I used to think as an American that the U.S. had the best medical care in the world but after living overseas for a while I realize that sadly that may not necessarily be true. I understand (but I am not sure if it is true) that the chemotherapy drug that my wife was given (Vinorelbine) is not approved in the U.S. for breast cancer treatment but approved in Europe and Singapore. If you are not familiar with Vinorelbine, it cause little to no hairloss and relatively milder side effects compared to other chemotherapy drugs. My wife had very little hair loss and no one noticed or even aware that my wife is battling cancer. I am hoping to gather information from the community on whether heceptin + perjeta is easily available for treatment in the U.S. and covered by most medical insurance and the costs for treatment. Right now we have a Singapore only medical insurance policy that covers the entire cancer treatment including immunotherapy (up to an annual limit of approximate US$450,000). The annual renewal premium I just paid for my wife's policy was Singapore $2,175 (which is approximately US$1,550). We currently do not have any U.S. medical insurance since we made a financial decision a few years ago to terminate it because the premiums were extremely expensive. Unfortunately, now that my wife has cancer she now has a serious pre-existing condition and under the current Administration/Congress plans to replace/nullify the ACA I am not sure if she would be able to get any medical insurance coverage when we return to the U.S. The costs of each treatment for my wife has been herceptin = SG$5,400 (approx. US$3,840) and perjeta SG$8,600 (approx US$6,120). She is now on a 3 week cycle now so the total expenses are US$10,000 to US$20,000 per month. I look forward to hearing the community.
