      "Content": "KMP wrote: This is my first post. I'm 36 and was recently diagnosed with Stage 2, infiltrative adenocarcinoma in my right breast. It's been a tumultuous road to even starting chemo. I moved from Chicago to San Francisco last July to live a healthier, more active life. In November I felt a lump and immediately called my PCP. Since I'm uninsured, it took a couple months to get me into a program to see a surgeon to do a biopsy. Both my PCP and Surgeon told me that the lump didn't feel like a tumor, so I was optimistic. After the first biopsy came back, the surgeon called and told me it was cancer. I was devastated, but continued to stay as positive as I could. Then another biopsy was taken with an ultrasound and another, smaller, tumor was found. Luckily, none of my lymph nodes had been taken over yet. I met with my oncologist and she suggested neoadjuvant therapy because of my age, size of tumor, etc. I agreed. Finally, I started chemo (Doxorubicin aka Adrimycin, and Cyclophosphamide for 4 rounds then 4 rounds of I don't know yet/can't remember.) I also get the WBC boost shot after my chemo treatments.  I've been through 2 rounds so far, and am not doing well physically or emotionally. After the first round, I felt ok (nausea/vomitting a little...not too bad) for the first few days and was relieved. Then about day 5 I started feeling awful. The anti nausea meds weren't helping. If I ate, I would vomit. I was having problems sleeping, headaches, constipated (and the lovely side effects of that)...I was incredibly uncomfortable, no matter what I tried to do to help.  Finally, I got a fever of 102 and ended up in the hospital for 7 hours getting blood draws, ua, xray --- they could not find the source of infection -- but I was very neutropenic. They put me on Levaquin (antibiotics) and I started to feel better. I lost 8lbs after my first round of chemo. After the 2nd round, my hair started falling out immediately. A s ock, but I knew it was coming. I basically had the same thing happen to me again...around day 5 - fever, chills, vomiting, nausea --- except it was worse. I couldn't move or sleep because I was so uncomfortable. Additionally, I developed some throat soreness deep down near my clavicle that felt like a huge lump. I ended up in the ER, where they did blood draws, gave me fluids and antibiotics and then also gave me morphine, viscous lidocaine for my throat soreness and now present mouth sores -- neither helped, so they gave me dilaudid (which is supposedly 10x stronger than morphine) and that didn't help. I couldn't swallow...couldn't eat for several days. After spending another 7 hours in the ER, they sent me home with nothing making me feel better...just sleepy. The next morning I went back to the oncology floor to get more blood draws and found out that my wbc count dropped even lower, even after receiving antibiotics. I got prescriptions for Levaquin (antibiotics), and Oxycodone (for my still present and unexplained throat pain) and was sent home with strict instructions not to go outside unless wearing a mask, and wearing a mask at home if other people were present.  I literally felt like I was starting to die. In four days, the only thing I could keep down was 2 saltine crackers and half of a yogurt. My stomach was a mess from all the meds. I wasn't sleeping because of the pain. I've been on anti-depressants for over a year now, but I'm sinking into a deep depression. I don't know how much more weight I've lost.  I don't know if I can handle my third round of chemo coming up on Thursday. I meet with my oncologist on Tuesday and I'm going to discuss possibilities of postponing the next round to give my body a break. I just don't know how that will go over. I honestly don't think I can physically handle it this week.    If anyone has had these drugs and can offer any guidance or help, please let me know. Thank you!  Dx 4/1/2010, ILC, 3cm, Stage II, Grade 3, ER-/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

My dad was in town for the horrible week after my 2nd round, THANK GOD! I also have a few very good friends that have been helping me with everything from cleaning to running my 10 month old lab puppy.  While I still very alone, especially in isolation, I do have a good support system. As of now, I'm on Ondansetron and Prochlorperazine for nausea, and Docusate for constipation. Plus all the pain and antibiotic meds. I'm going to discuss this all with my onc doc on Tuesday and try to get some changes made. Thanks again for your support!! It means so much! And I will keep you posted... ",
