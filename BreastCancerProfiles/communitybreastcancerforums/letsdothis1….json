I have a very early stage small tumor in left breast but had radiation 15 years ago to the chest area for Hodgkins Lymphoma and am not really a candidate for lumpectomy/radiation...after much discussion, I decided to do the right breast too as it cut my future chances of breast cancer way down to almost nothing. I am so glad to have found this thread- been reading for hours and hours! You all have made me laugh and cry and stop and say a prayer. I also have a question and welcome any input! I haven't decided whether I will do a TRAM or DIEP flap reconstruction or Tissue Expanders and implants. My PS couldn't tell me for sure that he wouldn't have to take muscle and kind of leaned toward the TE's for implants later. I am 45, overweight and a 38DD/40D. I like my breasts- they've been good to me until now, lol. I also want full symmetrical breasts and wouldn't mind at all if they put them back up where they used to be! ;) What is implant with fat grafting? Is that what I need? The PS also said implants would be smaller than the FLAP. HELP!!!! I can't decide!",

Comfort and Strength prayers to you! You got this! Tall and Terrific- what a beautiful post! I have a copy of Jesus Calling and also haven't been attending church for several years. It's going on my hospital list. Thank you! Brithael- I just copied and pasted a paragraph in your post about the regret and the way this disease/diagnosis/path/treatment/journey changes our outlook and puts us in a position for authentic empathy in general and sympathy for those who are in our same shoes. For everyone who is having technical difficulties- hang in there! Your body is fighting back from the trauma! I got my new surgery date- It is December 8th- please feel free to visit me in the December surgery thread if there is one and I will stay here and follow everyone's progress and hopefully offer some support or uplift someone!  Have a very happy Thanksgiving! I went through chemo and radiation and a stem cell transplant 10 years ago for Hodgkin's and family traditions and holidays become so much more. I just like to breathe them in and enjoy! :)",

I had surgery 3 weeks ago and am doing pretty well. 2 of my 4 drains are out now. One isn't putting out much at all and the other is a little cloudy- kinda worried about it but no smell. My appointment is Wednesday. Debridement doesn't sound like something fun! :) I hope everyone is doing well! I had 420 cc of air put in at surgery and they switched it to saline last week. I am hoping I can get a little more this time. they are funny shaped but my PS assures me it's temporary.  Happy New Year! May our 2016's be much better than our 2015's!  Cindie",

It had been a month. I have had pneumonia and my sweet 94 year old grandmother passed away in the midst of everything which has slowed down progress but TE's are filled to 550 and supposed to go Thursday to Houston to get another 100 cc's or so. I've been catching up on Game of Thrones, though. lol Live4them- pay $10 a month. They can't do much if you are attempting payback and your insurance is paying a ton I am sure. My insurance covers 80% and I just really don't worry about the rest. I am on a payment plan with my local hospital for the mammo's and biopsy, but MD Anderson is very good about accepting what you can give. I haven't returned to work- which is fine with me. Still can't drive (driving me crazy) but over-all I feel pretty good. Sorry I disappeared and Mominator- thanks for checking on me. Through these trials this month, I have decided to cherish family more- even the family that gets on my nerves. ;) Life is precious and I pray you are all healing and soon to be thriving!

So, I guess I will be a December Surgery Sister but hope to still stay in this group too. Praying you are all doing well and pain is minimal.
