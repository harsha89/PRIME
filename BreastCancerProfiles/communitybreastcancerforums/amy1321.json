      "Content": "amy1321 wrote: The topic should say SYMPTOMS, but my fingers are not working today!... Hello! New to this site! This will be pretty lengthy, but please read and offer any reassurance if possible... To begin I am a 29 yrs old, I have 3 children whom were all breastfed, but have not breastfed in the last 2 years. No history of BC that I am aware of... About 2 months ago I started feeling little minor pains in the side of my right breast/armpit and occasionally a hypersensitve nipple. I brushed it off as ill fitting bras and pms. And only occasionally noticed it. ....but then the other night while I was brushing my hair I got a sharp pain near the shoulder blade/rhomboid muscle. Almost like a snap and stab at the same time.. Due to my hypochondria I immediately went on google (poor choice) and found a million causes, but the only one that stood out was BC. I started poking and prodding my right breast and of course...to my horror, found a lump about the size of a small marble, rubbery, firm-ish, but not rock hard, and seemingly attached to the chest wall, although I can move it slightly. The lump itself is not painful when pushed on but I do have general pain in the breast...I dont feel anything else like this in other areas of either breast and I am freaking out. I could not wait for my appointment this Thursday, so I went to my walk-in for piece of mind until then and the doctor felt both breasts, said he felt the lump, but said it \"did not have a cancerous feel to it.\" ....said to wait a month and see if it changes or goes away, as it could be due to just finishing my menstral cycle...OR follow up with GP, which I was going to do anyhow... To say the least, that wasnt reassuring at all and all I do is cry, poke and prod, which is probably causing more pain, which is causing more anxiety, and I am a total mess. Can there be benign tumors that cause back pain? Could the backpain be unrelated completely? It is very localized behind the breast in just one spot unlike the breast pain which seems to hurt in various spots... and I cant tell if it seems to be radiating from the breast or not...the back pain is not sharp like it was initially, more of just a dull ache now unless I move my arm a certain way, which in my mind has me thinking \"it only hurts when the shoulder blade rubs on the tumor\"...and I dont even know if theres a tumor yet! But in my mind, I have this lump in my breast, which has somehow spread to my back or causing back pain and I just feel like I might as well plan my own funeral. Even IF there lump I am feeling is normal fatty tissue or something not concerning, where is the pain coming from? I just dont know where to begin or how pushy I should be with testing when I see my doc. Ugh... Thank you to anyone who made it to the end of all this blabbering...I appreciate it so much as I am just a nervous wreck and keep worrying about leaving my babies. Any input or reassurance would be wonderful! If you have any questions to help get a better idea, please ask away! Log in to post a reply",

I have an appointment with my GP tomorrow, but it really isnt a relief as I know she will definitely feel the lump and certainly just send me for further testing, which will just keep my anxiety levels rising. I just want to know what this is and move forward! I hope your tests all turn out fine and please keep us posted, as well!",
