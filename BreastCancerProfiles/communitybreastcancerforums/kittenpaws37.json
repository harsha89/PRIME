Is it fully absorbed by the breast?  As I understand it, the radiation's goal is to injure all the cells in the breast, both healthy and any cancer ones, the healthy cells are able to recuperate whereas the cancer cells cant and die off.  So, i just wondered is it best to do something to \"detoxify\" oneself during radiation treatment?  I hope to be able to exercise during it etc.  Can one have a massage during treatment? Massage moves fluids through the lymph system as a detoxification process so is this safe?  Im dealing with DCIS so not invasive cells but in general, wonder about the idea of massage and cancer.   Ive seen a study somewhere that said massage can be helpful for patients but physiological wonder how it doesnt harm/ Dx 1/3/2013, DCIS, <1cm, Stage 0, Grade 1, 0/0 nodes, ER+/PR+ Surgery 3/7/2013 Lumpectomy: Right Log in to post a reply",

Knowing how my dcis 0 could potential return as would be very helpful in decisions I need to make. I like and trust my surgeon ...would making an appt just to see about this be ok? What do you all do when you find yourself with questions? Do u make new appointments ?

I know rads are supposed to cut risk by 50% and every women's risk is different but I am still curious about undergoing radiation treatment and then finding a recurrence or new breast cancer in the same breast.  Have you all encountered many women that this has happened to? Since you cant get radiation on the same breast twice, although apparently in some situations you can but i dont know what those situations are, you are left with mastectomy as only option. Did this make anyone with a dx like DCIS Stage 0 forgo radiation? What are the options if it does come back and youve had radiation?  I assume that only if invasive would a mastectomy be done or if multfocal DCIS ? Otherwise , would only a lumpectomy be ok?  Im trying to come to peace with the best way to avoid a mastectomy as preventative method. I want to try and conserve my breasts for as long as possible at this point being still young and to be frank, not sexually active and the thought of losing breasts withouth having had much in that realm as of yet, saddens me a great deal. So I feel my situaion is actually unique and hard to explain bc I dont want to share such personal info with everyone.  I dont want to make a stupid decision though an forgo rads if i really shouldnt. Its just boggles my mind that if i choose a treatment now, it can affect my future since there is no way of knowing at what point a recurrence or new bc. can pop up...years later or sooner. Or never...which is preferable! Thanks for any input. Dx 1/3/2013, DCIS, <1cm, Stage 0, Grade 1, 0/0 nodes, ER+/PR+ Surgery 3/7/2013 Lumpectomy: Right Log in to post a reply",
