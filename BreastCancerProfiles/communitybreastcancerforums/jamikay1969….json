    "Content": "Jul 8, 2018 12:21AM - edited Jul 8, 2018 12:23AM by jamikay1969 I am just a little over 3 weeks out from my lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy and am having a great deal of pain in my breast. The pain I had initially was just post-op pain, but I actually felt really good. This amount of pain this far out is very concerning for me. I, too, have to lift my breast up and apply pressure against it to make it feel better. It is so odd and actually hurts all the time. I meet with my medical oncologist on Monday and my radiation oncologist on Tuesday. I\u2019m not sure if they will be able to help answer any of my questions or if I should get in touch with my surgeon.",
