I understand that this will be outpatient and I will be home that same day, so I am grateful that I won't have to deal with major surgery. My question is how soon will I be able to work? I teach at a community college but will have a reduced class load this spring (two classes, one of which will be online). My surgery is on a Tuesday, so I wonder if I could expect to be able to teach the Thursday following or if I should wait until the next week? Thanks, and am both glad and sad to be joining this group!",

I can't imagine going through this while being pregnant, too. To everyone else, thank you again for sharing your stories and support.

Mercy Hospital in Baltimore was wonderful, can't say enough good things about them. I had two lymph nodes removed, with only one showing positive signs, so I feel ok about that. I had about an hour session yesterday with a physical therapist about the risks of lymphedema and exercises to do. Thanks for all of your support. Oh, and I did come home today and am very glad I did. Also no drain! Yippee (and sympathies to those of you still struggling with them.)",

Does anyone have any advice about whether to drive 70 miles after a lumpectomy? Well, actually my husband will be driving, of course, but I have had advice to stay one more night in a hotel in Baltimore rather than have the surgery, recovery, and 70 mile drive all in one day. I know we can just play it by ear but my husband and I both like to know what our plans are. We're not very spontaneous people. Joan",

You have hormone positive and HER2 positive cancer, so that actually means that the treatments out there now will really target this cancer well. I just got my path report and found that my 3 cm tumor was really 4 cm and what I thought was grade two was really grade three. But then I discovered that aggressive, fast growing cancers are actually targeted better by chemo and herceptin than slow growing tumors, so there is always a silver liining. I have found great hope in reading women's accounts with far greater problems than I have living many long years. You will get through this and we will all be here to help you. Hugs to you and your baby. You will be there for that baby for many years to come, I'm sure of it.",

I am glad to see that many are doing well, and my thoughts are with those of you still struggling with fevers, pain, and other problems. My lumpectomy went fine. Tumor was a bit bigger than originally thought and it was grade 3 instead of grade 2 but those are minor, fixable issues with chemo. I didn't even need pain meds and was back to work by the next week. I should start chemo in about three weeks. I'm getting a port put in because I will need Herceptin for a year, so that should happen within a couple of weeks. I've been following theÂ  Feb. 2013 chemo thread as I move on to the next step.",
