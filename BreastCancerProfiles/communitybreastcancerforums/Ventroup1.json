I'm glad I found the site either way and hope I can be of comfort to anyone and maybe get some support myself! Here's my story. I'm 37, never had children, but am on immune suppression for severe ulcerative colitis. For about a year I was having clear discharge from my left nipple. Then around December of 2015, I started having pain with the discharge and it turned yellow/orange. I was told it was mastitis because Im immune suppressed and was put on antibiotics. It kept coming back. I was on antibiotics off and on for 6 months. I was having pain under my arm and through my nipple and into my back. It always seemed to happen around the few days just before my period. All my mammograms and ultrasounds came back clean, as did the core biopsy performed. So we went ahead with a total duct excision this past June. All was going great until about 2 days ago (just before my period) when I noticed a bit of discharge in the left side of my bra again. I thought was seeing things because I thought the whole point of the excision was that there would be no discharge anymore. Now 2 days later the yellow discharge is back, as is the pain from my underarm through my nipple and into my back. But I have no ducts! I plan to call the surgeon Monday, but has anyone else had this? I feel like I'm going nuts. Log in to post a reply",
