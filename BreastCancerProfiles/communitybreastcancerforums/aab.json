While I would honestly categorize my level of apprehension as average or normal, I'm sure it's impossible to truly predict how I'll feel after surgery.  So I'm reaching out to you who have been through it to try to help prepare myself for the range of emotions that I might expect afterwards.  Any advice, thoughts, or experiences you can share would be most appreciated!

I will receive my pathology report this upcoming week. I have already had chemo, finished in December. I am also scheduled for radiation. Having already gone through chemo, is there a chance I will have to again since my lymph node was positive? I'm not sure if they typically remove the nodes and hope radiation gets any remaining cells. I was just curious about the potential of having to go through chemo again. Any thoughts are appreciated!

Thus far, it seems lumpectomy then radiation therapy will be the likely treatment. I have been very pleased with the medical facility and physicians I've seen but have been told by others to get a second opinion. I am worried this will only delay the process and I am anxious to get this done. Does anyone have advice or reasons why I should seek a second opinion that would help me make this decision?  Dx 6/6/2010, IDC, 4cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, 1/1 nodes, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Neoadjuvent chemotherapy was successful at reducing the tumor size. My tumor was sent to pathology for additional testing because both invasive and non-invasive cells were found. I was told 10% of my tumor was made up of ER Positive cells. I will most likely have to take tomoxifen once I complete radiation. I am a bit confused by this because all this time I thought I had triple negative breast cancer, both hormone negative. What/ how can a tumor have both types of cells? My oncologist is wonderful and I know she will do a great job at provided the clarity I need but thought I could get some insight before I meet with her. Your help is appreciated!
