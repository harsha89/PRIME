I've tried hot bath, hot water bottle, ice, meds and I'm at my wits end. On Thursday evening I discovered a chickpea size hard lump in my lower, inside left breast. Friday I went to the Dr and he has referred me for an ultrasound but have eto wait 3weeks. Wake up this morning, with a real intense gnawing/ache pain in left breast that just won't go away. This evening I noticed redness around the outside and underneath breast which is warm to touch. My breast feels swollen but this pain is driving me mad. Any advise would be great! Thanks Oh. No fanily history of breast cancer as far as I know but colon, bowel, lung. Log in to post a reply",
