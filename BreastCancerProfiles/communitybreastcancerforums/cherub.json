It is crap to be in this ABC Club but I prefer to call it the Sisterhood! Elaine - try reading the book by Eckhart Tolle - A New Earth (Oprah's bookclub)  I am wading my way through it and it has brought me to a better place (Podcasts on itunes are great & free to down load)  it is so much easier to deal with Stage IV diagnosis when you only look at today  love Jennifer ",
