Had not thought of wearing it for other activity.  Good to know.  I was told it didn't matter how many nodes were removed. I had 7 out. Had my MX on May 29, 2013.  I'm just now beginning to feel more, but not completely, under my arm.  At first the best way to describe it would be to say it felt like  a huge piece of cardboard was under my skin.  I don't have 100% of the feeling back under my arm (from arm pit nearly to my waist), but it doesn't get in the way of life.  Perhaps I have 50% back now.",
