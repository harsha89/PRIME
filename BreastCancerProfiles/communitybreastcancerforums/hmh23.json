I also have more pain when I work out so I've been avoidiing yoga right now and lifting any heavy weights.  They both seem to aggravate my symptoms. Hope that helps. ",

Like MBJ, I too had terrible constipation... recommend taking a stool softener before you have your first chemo and continue to throughout the first 5 days following.  Also, take your anti-nausea meds as soon as you get home.  Good luck....Heather",

On another note, my 'woodstock' hair is now about 1\" in length especially on top.  Along  the sides of my head (male patterned baldness) it is very fine with a great deal of white, black, brown mixed in and also about an 1\" long.  I see some new growth, darker hair growing in on top as well.  I'm just not sure if I should just take the trimmers and cut off the 'feathers' because it is really itchy under my wig when I wear it (only to meetings or out for the evening) or just leave it.  Any and all advice welcome.  Thx so much, Heather",
