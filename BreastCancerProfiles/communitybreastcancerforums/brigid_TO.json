I will be entering my 3rd week of radiation on Jan 3rd and thought I would check in here as a bridge member between Fall and January Rads. So far my treatments have been generally uneventful although I think that is a typical course for early days. I thought I would review for those starting out in January a few things I have gleaned from *lots* (probably too much) reading. Reactions to radiation treatment are varied and not necessarily attributable to the type of lotions, activities etc you use. As you all probably know by now it is more a reflection of other factors including size, grade, previous chemotherapy etc. I took a brief look at how treatments are calculated- definitely over my head-crazy complex math and individual practitioner judgement involved. It is a fine line to give radiation that normal cells can recover from but gives the whammy to the cancer cells. My 2 cents on things to pay attention to that will support your body in helping the normal cells to recover and minimize skin reactions- please understand that your mileage may vary: -sleep or simply rest if you have difficulty sleeping, is key to your body repairing damage. -water-keep yourself hydrated-drink, drink, drink! -more protein (for myself fish,nuts and eggs). -exercise- word is that 30 minutes per day keeps the radiation fatigue away. -lotions and potions- right now I am using lavender hydrosol, aloe vera, lubriderm, green tea soak. In the wings if needed I have cabbage leaf and salt soak (0.9 percent sodium chloride solution). The lubriderm and salt soak were recommended by the radiation treatment team. The salt soak is used when you start showing more symptoms than I have right now. I am very interested in others plans or experiences here so please share if you are able. ok final oddball thing is that I do carry a malachite stone around as a charm. Enjoy the first day of the new year and Onward.... ",

Hello and welcome to all the new posters this week and everyone else still making it through... Checking in now 3.5 weeks past finishing radiation my treatment. My breast looks pretty much/mostly matching the untreated breast. The extra colour has significantly faded and the swelling is way down. Too early to say how the size will match up yet between the lumpectomy and radiation. My nipple is still sensitive and I get a few tweaks of pain here and there. My energy is good- still get a moment or two of radiation fatigue but it passes. So all in all I would say recovery has been pretty good. I have moved on from all of my lotions and potions to switching between coconut oil (organic, virgin, cold press) and shea butter (raw with lavender) a few times a day.  Avoiding fibrosis is trickier-it is most likely to surface within 24 months but can be a problem for up to 10 years. Stretching, massage and aerobic exercise can be helpful. Other than that I am turning my mind to anti-hormone therapy and have an upcoming MO appointment to make a decision on how to proceed. Hang in there everyone. I read all the posts and send best wishes every day.    ",

There is not much to the treatments themselves-they really just take a few minutes and you don't feel anything. Early on the treatments are easier-later treatments may be less so with possible skin effects and fatigue. You can read back to see the range of what people have dealt with. Myself? I just gritted my teeth and got through without too many difficult moments. Before you know it you are on the other side of them. It is important to take care of yourself, rest, drink lots of water and exercise the best way you can. Treats are good! I was a fan of popsicles (mango, cherry, strawberry)- the fancy ones. I had a calendar I drew and marked off each day after treatment. Sounds cheesy but -one day at a time- you got this.",

I keep it in the fridge so it is cold and it seems to pull the heat out. I have a few other things I am using but that is one. ",

So far my skin is pretty much ok- gets a bit pinkish after treatment or after a shower and then fades back closer to normal. My nipple is definitely swollen and sore. One of the radiation therapists recommended a very light two finger circular massage on the nipple to help. I have also added the salt soak into my routine at the recommendation of the RO nurse. I didn't mention (and she didn't ask) all the other things I am using (green tea, lavender hydrosol and aloe vera etc) and I will keep using those. I have moments where waves of fatigue wash over me- it feels like my whole body is vibrating and I could lay down right there and fall asleep. I have been sleeping more than usual but I do get my 30 minutes of exercise in each day. I highly recommend that as a way to keep your head clearer and energy level up. My personality is such that I will put up a protective shield and just try to power through this treatment. I got a reminder of my interior fragility when I had to wait quite a while to get through my RO appt. I really felt like I would melt down at one point and not for any particularly good reason. I feel like I have a limited amount of emotional energy these days especially when relating to others. I am happier staying quiet and interior right now. Welcome to all the new posters. @Lorrie70- that is crazy that they are not recommending any lotions for you yet. I am so curious as to how that works out. Maybe they recommend them here just to make us feel like we are \"doing something\" and participating in our treatment and they don't actually make a whit of difference. :) Everybody keep drinking that water....

But I am now 2.5 weeks from my last boost and things are healing pretty nicely. The tannish/brown skin is working its way off. It is only left on the boost stripe. It doesn't peel it just gets replaced-hard to explain. My nipple is still swollen and sensitive but it was somewhat like that before radiation from the surgery/biopsies. Still using the lubriderm and aloe. I am feeling much more like my old self. My mood is brighter and I am catching up on neglected things. Energy is definitely better. Caligirl we are all cheering for you to get past those last boosts. Congrats SuMarie and Lorri!!! Lorri you are the poster child for less is more. Amazing that you did not use any lotions and mostly missed out on the skin se's. JShannon yes fatigue came and went in waves- first week of rads and the week after finishing were worst for me. I exercised 30 min every day even when I ab-so-lut-ley did not feel like it- I think that helped. Keep drinking that water...staying hydrated really helps.  ",

I did point out some tightness in my shoulder/armpit area. The RO response will be familiar to anyone who has gone through this treatment. \"no that can't be from the radiation\". :) She suggested a 1 year final followup appt which I am ok with. Other than that tightness I don't have any ongoing side effects to report. I continue to use the shea butter and coconut oil to moisturize/massage. I also stretch and do some light weight lifting. My right (treated) breast is about 1/3-1/4 smaller than the left. Probably some from the lumpectomy and some from the radiation. It is manageable and I don't think that noticeable? I run 3x a week and have increased my distance since diagnosis. I have not noticed any breathing difficulties-knock wood. I gave the Tamoxifen a try and ended up stopping after 5 weeks. Lots of side effects that left me exhausted and not functioning at anywhere near normal. Now contemplating trying again with a different manufacturer to see if that helps. I did discuss recently with MO who again was supportive/lukewarm as to whether I should try again. She would be fine with me calling it a day with any anti-hormonal. So still thinking it over. I have a few other things I am trying. Don't want to overload as this is clearly a long marathon and not a sprint. There are so many things that may be helpful to avoid reoccurrence. I am part of D*Action and have increased my Vitamin D intake, eat lots of broccoli sprouts (Sulforophane) and now have only a very occasional bit of sugar or alcohol. I am dipping my toe into the world of time restricted eating and may post elsewhere in the forum about my experience with that so far. How is everyone else managing? ",

It doesn't feel too bad more of the occasional shooting pains many of us are familiar with-the kind that make you wince for a second. Some itchiness at the clavicle, soreness under the armpit and nipple. A word of advice for the about to be or newly radiated be certain to get your lotions/potions under your armpit- I think I was not as diligent there and can see the difference. I am also just plain tired out this weekend- still doing things but not a lot of motivation or energy. The above was my short whine- really it is all not too bad- definitely do-able, hoping to truly turn the corner soon. 3 more boosts left this coming week (18/21). For those just starting or waiting to start- you can do this. You just grit your teeth and wait for the time to pass and it does pretty quickly. Best to everyone who reads this.

I had fewer days/fractions of treatment but each treatment was stronger than the ones for those whose treatment is stretched over more days. I can no longer call my breast any shade of pink it is definitely lighter to medium red depending on the time of day and lighting. it is about a third larger than the untreated breast although it never returned to normal size from the first core biopsy in September. Little bit itchy, very sore nipple and underarm but everything seems \"intact\" (as they say). My breast is throwing out an amazing amount of heat. I am tired and feel low level crappy. My stomach has been messed up for weeks. Fortunately my shoulder and arm feel pretty good- that was my worry prior to start. Saw the RO this week- she said I was fine and would see me one final time in three months. I have had low expectations of my interactions with the staff since my first visit-they are pleasant but not particularly engaged. It is a bit of a radiation mill here-16 machines -400 treatments a day. There was no bell to ring.... Mango popsicles are now officially my favourite food. I have a few more weeks of keeping up with the lotions/potions. I have read enough posts here to know that I am not out of the woods as far as skin reactions. I worked right through treatment with a few 3 day weekends. I didn't mind really- work was a good distraction. I was hoping to travel to Washington for the Women's March this weekend but better to lie low and go to the local. Would hate to have a reaction far from home or push myself more than I should.

Just a caution to not fall into thinking once the actual rad treatments are done you will be immediately back to normal. I know you all know that already but I guess I am reinforcing. Last Thursday (1st day after finishing) was one of my toughest days since starting with fatigue, pain and soreness. Symptoms may remain or get worse for a week or so after treatments are finished. That being said I am definitely feeling better today but still a good amount of fatigue. Parts of my skin (outside edges) have started to heal turning sort of a tanny light brown. Under my arm and going straight down is still red and sore. The skin is different there and I think that combined with arm movement makes it worse. If I reach up it feels like a bad sunburn pain. So put extra lotions on there. I now have a bright red stripe right across my breast where the boosts were directed. My nipple was part of the boosts and is just sad- I will spare you the description. I have a few more days before I turn the corner on all of that. For weeks I ate popsicles like nobodies business and now they don't seem that appealing. I think my body was trying to cool itself down. Keep moving, keep hydrating and sleep/rest!

I was told it made no difference and I could apply Lubriderm right up to the time of treatment but I stopped a few hours prior anyway as that seemed the most common advice on this site. The Aquaphor should certainly absorb, dissipate, soak into your clothing within that 6 hour time. :) 2. I believe you are describing a bolus. You can do your own search but I think it is common for those with a mastectomy? The radiation techs are usually good at answering questions especially if you find a chatty one. I had them showing me all my treatment slides and calculations. They only have a few minutes between patients but you can learn a lot in that time. @annoyingboo probably worth reading through the thread. There are a lot of different things everyone is using and some are using none at all. I used (am still using) a whole bunch of things based on reading through this website. But your milage may vary. My RO recommended Lubriderm and salt soaks (0.09% saline solution). To that I added aloe vera, lavender hydrosol and green tea soaks. Towards the end,per my RO, I added Proshield Plus which is an extra goopy silicon based salve.",

Bottom line the distraction was good for me and I think I moved around a lot more than I would have staying home. I also wonder if that bone tired feeling is any better from staying home or working as it is not really related to exertion but to the radiation. I have never heard of ce ferrucil before. I see there is some science behind it but I bet you would run through a bottle pretty quickly-$$$. And of course as many here know RO's are often resistant to anything but the 2-3 things that they know. You can bring reams of reports , double blinds studies etc and the answer is still \"no\". Now many of us do things off label but that is a different thing entirely. I received imrt and the techs were out of the room for about 2 minutes total each time. The machine moved around me and each zap was about 30 sec. For the boosts the machine moved around a lot more, the table moved and I think photos were taken each time- but still about 3 or so minutes total. They were very efficient there and I rarely had to wait more than 5-10 minutes and they would often take me if I arrived early. it is frustrating when appts are consistently late- my MO and SO both run an hour or more late with appts. It is built into their schedule to double/triple book each time slot. Welcome (you know what I mean) to the new women posting today.  ",

Kattis and Postive2strong I wouldn't worry about your exercise-you will get there when you are ready. But I think it is always good to do a little something every day. My next decision is on Tamoxifen. My MO was not recommending that I take it although they said it would not be \"unreasonable\" if I did. So wtf! I guess I need to figure this out on my own. I see the numerical benefit, know the potential side effects. I asked for a prescription but I haven't filled it.

The low level hum of the fatigue really keeps you from interacting with the world normally. I am still using the lavender, lubriderm and aloe. In maybe another week or so I will start to switch to maybe shea butter or coconut oil. I did some reading to see what can be done to prevent any of the longer term side effects (eg fibrosis) -not so much-it's a bit of a dice roll.

I continue to use shea butter and coconut oil 2 x per day (1 morning/1 night). It keep my skin smooth and I do a light massage and stretch through the process to keep everything moving around. i would say my breast looks and feels pretty normal. I still have a very small patch of tan colour that looks like it is here to stay. My treated breast is now somewhat smaller than the other one. Not sure if it is from the 2 biopsies and lumpectomy or the radiation- probably a combination of the two. At first glance you wouldn't notice it but if you look more carefully it is easy to see. So this is the \"new me\" I am still coming to terms with. And my nipple is larger than the untreated one but otherwise fine. My breathing is good although I am still watchful for any fibrosis. I have increased my exercise a bit to try to push my breathing to capacity more. I signed up for something called d'action that monitors your vitamin d levels over a 5 year period. I haven't gotten my levels yet but I suspect they may be low. Nothing else for now although from reading these boards I see there are about 100 other things I could be taking or doing. One thing at a time for me... I have moved on to stressing about the Tamoxifen which I have started although only a partial 5 mg dose (decided on my own-not authorized by MO!). I'll save that for another discussion though. How is everyone else??? ",

I know I am not out of the woods yet as far as the potential for trouble but a definite milestone. The boosts will cover a much smaller area and will not be quite as strong. (2 vs 2.6 Gy I think) I am at a light sunburn stage with some itchiness in the cleavage area. They say that happens because that area likely had the most previous sun exposure. There is also a small sore area in my underarm. Finally my nipple is hella sore but manageable. I am still using my usual regimen- lavender hydrosol, aloe, lubriderm and green tea soak. I stopped the salt soak-it felt like it was making things worse and I did not care for the sulphury smell. The RO fellow gave me a sample of proshield plus- it is an extra goopy silicon based lotion to protect the skin. I put it on at night and it feels good. @ warrior6-I have worked right through my radiation treatments and have mostly functioned ok although no way at my usual ability. I am definitely grumpier though. I found myself just furious today over not very much- I need to watch it and promise that I will count to 10,000 or more before reacting so I don't end up regretting an over reaction. I also have waves of all over tiredness that passes after a few moments. The work is distracting and keeps me busy. How is your work going Caligirl55? I am not quite up to checking in with everyone but please know that I read all the posts and am sending my most positive thoughts your way. ",

For DCIS the standard is 2mm. BS said it would not be possible to re-excise as it was to the fascia. This was reviewed by the hospital tumour board (group of bs, mo and ro's) for discussion and decision was to proceed to radiation. I had 16 treatments plus 5 boosts. I believe the boosts were due to the close margin. So far so good. Best wishes to you.",
