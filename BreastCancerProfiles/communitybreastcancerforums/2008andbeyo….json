My best advice: you'll be seeing so many Dr's. Get your notebook out. It gets very confusing with many to consult. Don't let one medical professional tell you something you don't understand. When you get home and let it all sink in call the office later to verify what is not clear. Regarding the MRI: mine showed my right breast with the tumor and the left breast clear. Bad margins on lumpectomy gave me option for another one with rads to follow. Because my Mother had IDC earlier and unhappy with radiation burns I opted for bilateral mastectomy with no rads. Lab results did find DCIS in my left breast post mastectomy. My gut feeling was just get them gone. It was right for me. Since that time 2 cousins and Mom's sister were diagnosed with breast cancer. Negative BRACA gene for me. MRI was useful but not conclusive. Follow your instincts and research your diagnosis. I was prepared at 51 to lessen my stress with bilateral mastectomy. You need to get Drs to coordinate their procedures based on what you intend to do. Any doctor that won't work with the group needs to go. Immediate reconstruction was done. Less that optimum results but I can deal with it. I am ready to deal with new PS and insurance challenges. (That is a whole other topic). Karen  ",
