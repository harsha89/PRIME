With the smalll size of my tumors( I had two 4mm) clean margins and clear node)  I am hearing that the chemo is more to help effectiveness of Herceptin that anything else.  Any thoughts???? momof2in ME - Good luck with your haircut. I found the strengh to get through my mast 4 years ago through my son, who was then 8.  I am terrified of the whole hair thing too.  I told my son...it is just hair...it will grow back.",

After 5 weekly treament of taxol I was switched to abraxane (which is basically taxol without the synthetic stabilizer) because of an allergic reaction.  The strangest thing about both drugs is some weeks I have sailed through and other weeks I have crawled through!!!  This is a crawling week.  First I thought I just overextended myself (went to NYC for a couple day and did museum and restaurant and pro conference).  Since I have been back I have been exhausted (the last 5 days)  Saw my onc yesterday and she said I could skip next week if I feel this horrible (refered to as profound exhaustion).   don't want to skip....I want to get through what was planned!!!

I am a big animal lover but I really didn't know what to do...looked like it had been hit.  Anyway it started to run up road and I am blowing my horn to try to alert traffic and big truck comes over hill and runs right into him in front of my son and I!!!  Long story short..we pull dog out of road and watch it die.....horrible So I finally get to infusion and I am already pretty shaken.....I have had no chemo school and am told to find a seat.  IT might as well be an auditorium!!!  I had no idea there was no privacy and I would be sitting with a whole bunch of people in a busy room.  Told me mom \"nope I can't do this\"   went to front desk and said I am really not comfortable in this environment.  She went and got my nurse...who was wonderful and she sat and talked to me and got me through the whole thing.  The rest was uneventful. WHY couldn't a nurse have met me at the door?????  Would have prevented alot of anxiety for nothing????? So sorry about the rant!!!!",

Peggy - I was told with 12X taxol...no neulasta.  There is another drug they use that works quicker because it is a weekly infusion.  Have a nice day  (: I am stopping taxol and will start abraxane tomorrow.  For anyone having trouble with taxol check out abraxane!!!  It is very expensive but no need for pre meds or worry about allergic reaction! my insurance covered because I had a reaction to taxol.  From what I have read I think its a shame that it is not first course of treatment.  All comes down to $$$$$  very sad",

Anyway your a good man!  Chemo today...going to try to switch off taxol to abraxane.  Doctor is worried since I had reaction last week.  They LOADED me with steroid today and I got through the treatment but she does not want to give me the big doses of steroid.  My reds are down slightly and blood sugar is up and liver enzymes are up..she thinks I am getting more SE from steroids and my weekly flu is bad crashing!  If I am weened off it again there is potential for anaphalatic reaction.

Someone asked me \"why rads\" with neg nodes.  It is my understanding that with lumpectomy, rad are always a given. I am thinking about all of you and sending hugs!!!! My MO did not want to give me my last treatment yesterday because I have seased to have ankles!!  I notice swelling in my feet two night ago when I took off my socks at end of day but yesterday at 11am they were huge.  She said she thought I had enough and maybe we should just quit.  My thought was \"finish the plan we set out to do!!\".  Then I remembered I had drank a pile of fluids that morning because last week when they were trying to put in my IV my veins kept blowing out(got it on vein three).  I hate IVs.  Anyway, she agreed to give me the last dose.  Lots of leg pain last night but today I feel pretty good (that is relative for a person under chemical warfare of course, lol)  The leg pain and fatigue has gotten worse every week - cumulative 12 week thing, I guess. Going to take my boy for a bike ride on the coast. Could be wiped out tomorrow!! Nancy - I am starting an excellerated Grad/cross endorsement program in May and I am really nervous with rad and work!!  See you are plugging away at grad school too.  (: I too am sick of my reflection.  One thing this is teaching me is how uncertain the future is...carpe dium.  Not planning on kicking the bucket any time soon but HAVE been thinking about 'my bucket list' and thinking\"no time like the present!! I am about to start Grad school, apply for my italian citizenship and plan an interesting trip(thinking Turkey).  Cancer will not define me,  I WILL define me.",

I feel so bad for all the girls that are having really bad SE. I just feel generaly crappy right now and know I am doing too much.  it is very hard for me to rest without incredible guilt.  I was soooo sick over weekend had no choice.  I havn't had a lot of nausea but when I do it comes over me quickly(too quick for med)  Almost barfed in stop and shop...lol (chemo is charming) I agree with all of you that hate wigs!!! I am going to hospital to try on one I ordered last week but I swear I feel like Rue Paul in a wig.  Think I need to buy some scarfs and turbans. Nancy - I had a slight allergic reaction to Taxol last week. Felt loopy then bad back pain for a few minutes but they are so cautious about the potential of allergic reaction with Taxol that I wouldn't worry if you are going to get it.  I get Benedryl and steriod with each infusion and the first was given very closly.  Each week they speed things up. #3 is tomorow, then only 9 to go!!!!",

I have been sick since Saturday ( se and brochitis) and struggling to get through the work week( Wish I could sleep!) And I think that has made me more emotional. cat - I am sorry about your kitty too! So hard to lose a beloved pet. jenn- great news so far! Congrats! Bela- I had mast 4 years ago and was terrified too, but got through it. The surgery itself was not as bad as the fear of losing a breast. I feel your pain, but you will get through. Hugs to you",
