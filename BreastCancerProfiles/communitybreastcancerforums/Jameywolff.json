    "Content": "Jameywolff wrote: I finished my ACT chemo 1 1/4 years ago and  and continue to have some mild neuropathy in the soles of my feet that accupuncture doesn't eliminate.  I had some thickening of my nails and discoloration right after chemo but it seemed to be improving until I lightly buffed my toenails last month.  I immediately developed hematomas under several nails, subsequently lost the nails and now have more discoloration (probably blood) in others.  When I showed my oncologist, she called them \"funky toes\" but did not give me any suggestions for treatment.  Any suggestions for either the neuropathy or \"funky toes\" would be welcome.
