I would really like to know more just in case i am going for the surgery. I am glad that it's only typical cells for you. I hope you fully recover soon :) By the way, have a blessed christmas in advanced!",

Around April-May this year, i had a lump in my right breast  near to the nipple area and there's bloody nipple discharge so i did an ultrasound and was going to have a biopsy while taking the antibiotics which my doctor prescribed me with. The day of the biopsy, surprisingly that my lump disappeared and so i've escaped the biopsy. Occasionally i have  yellowish discharge from the same nipple and sometimes just white. Recently i went back to my appointment and my doctor squeezed the nipple and she got alarm by the yellowish discharge worrying that might contain blood or cause new lump. Therefore she sent me for ultrasound again but they didn't find anything from the ultrasound and today i had appointment again. My doctor told me that today's discharge was white and it's fine and asked me to come back and see her in three months time. She also mentioned that it if's happening again, she will want me to do a breast duct excision. I was so shocked and went on-line to do some research. Some people's first attempt was not good and had to remove all ducts on the second time. I have lots of questions in my mind because i have never had a surgery before, like, is it really serious that i need to remove the duct? how does the surgery work? will it solve the problem once i have the surgery done? is it better to remove all instead of one to save time and money? And what do i need to do before the surgery if i really have to go for one? I am so worried about this. I really need some answers and truth from people who have gone through this.",
