The tumor was 2CM and the sentinal node was affected. The surgeon told me that she took out 12 nodes because they were all shriveled up but the pathology on the  nodes and tumor which was down to 1mm came back with no cancer cells. The chemo REALLY worked well..but it leaves questions. Before surgery they said probably late stage 2 or early 3.. I am also Her2 and Hormone rec +. Also does anyone have any ideahow soon the cancer will show up again, having that Her2 I understand  is very bad..Elena",

The Tamox..is better in that area but has other issues. I was excersing but then I started with a hip issue and had a shot for that..now its the lower back and my knee is also giving me trouble. The Dr. said its very likely due to effects of the chemo. I feel like everytime I try to start a excerise routine something gives out. Its very discouraging because I know how important excerise is. Im going to call my onco today and let him know that my balance is off. I did read an article about Tomox that considered that a severe side effect. It scared me a little...Thanks again ladies the support is wonderful...Elena",
