Anyway, my therm showed my radiated breast was still hot after 6 months. After one year, it was still showing more heat than my normal breast! But at least the therm was reassuring that there was nothing abnormal. As you know, scar tissue is hard to differentiate from cancerous tissue on a mammo, but a therm shows vascular abnormalities. If there is cancer, there will be lots of blood vessels feeding it, which will show up on a thermograph. So if you want more peace of mind, you might want to try it. It really reassured me.",

I have been trying so hard to get this out of me, because it just freaks me out.  Add up all the radiation we get from xrays, scans, mammograph(which I will never have again) and flying in airplanes, and we end up with a lot of this stuff in our bodies. NAC is a supplement that my holistic dentist recommended that helps to chelate out the effects of toxic metals and radiation that builds up in our bodies. I know it works because I only did it for a couple of days and I am detoxing so much it freaks me out. I keep starting and stopping. For instance, the first time, my face broke out, and the next time my jaw hurt, which gives me the idea that my dentist is right and I need to get the fillings removed from my teeth and my root canal taken out. I know I sound obsessed, maybe I am, but I want to get my body as healthy as I possible can. I have come a long way in all the other areas, but this radiation detox has been the one that has been the hardest. I am still working on it, over 2 years after I finished. I am just hoping that maybe you all, will get a jump on it sooner. Find a doctor in your area, who practices holistic health and will help you detox. It can be dangerous if not done properly, so it is important to have a doctor's support. Now finding a good doctor, is another story. It took me months of searching. Good luck. Oh, and while you are going through rads, use pure, organic coconut oil on your skin. It does not have any dangerous chemicals like all that other stuff does. Also, exercise everyday. I kept walking each day, and I never got the fatigue. I actually had very few physical side effects. Most of them were emotional. I just hated the whole procedure. Luckily I had a wonderful rad onc, She was the only thing that got me through it.",

When I talked to my surgeon about thermography, he admitted he knew nothing about them. This is a top surgeon who specializes in breast surgery! Doctors do not have the time to look out of the box. They are too busy to keep up with all the latest studies. In essense, we are on our own to advocate for our own health at times. Twenty years ago, the standard of care in the US with any size tumor, was a mastectomy. It was because French women were so upset about losing their breast(s) that they began to demand that only the tumor be removed. This eventually led to the lumpectomy being accepted as a standard of care because the French found it to be just as successful as mastectomy. It took a lot longer for it to be adopted here, but it is now considered a standard of care. As more and more women  make other choices, there will be more statistics that doctors can go by and the standard of care will continue to evolve. I have also chosen to forgo using estrogen blockers like arimidex because I did not feel it was right for me. I have been able to balance my hormones naturally, which gives me the same insurance against recurrance. But until there are many more women like me, and they bother to study us, we will be considered outside of mainstream medicine. I find this ironic because many drugs now being used are based on small studies but they are still accepted. For instance the armidex study compares arimidex and tamox, it does not compare lifestyle changes, so what I am doing would be irrelevent to their stats. The bottom line is, we all need to do what we feel is best for us. I am not trying to convince anyone out there to do what I am doing. I am just saying if you are uncomfortable with a treatment, as I was, it is better to try something different than to do nothing.  This is from my doctor's website. drnick.net Breast Thermography and Mainstream Medicine With the amount of research supporting the use of infrared thermography, it probably seems odd that mainstream medicine hasn't embraced this innovative technology. Most physicians have not heard of it, and those who have dismiss it, claiming thermography is inaccurate. This misconception is the result of the Breast Cancer Detection and Demonstration Project (BCDDP), the most frequently quoted reason for the decreased use of thermography. The BCDDP was a large study that ran from 1973 to 1979 and collected data from many centers in the U.S. Its goal was to evaluate physician examination, mammography and infrared thermography. From the BCDDP's inception, there were significant flaws in the study design with respect to thermography. While the mammographic protocol was extensive and described in great detail, the entire protocol for thermography was outlined in one paragraph. The study required all mammographic centers to be trained and have expertise in mammography. The opposite was true for the thermography guidelines, where no training was required. In fact, only 5 out of 27 demonstration project centers had any expertise in infrared imaging [14]. Another substantial flaw with the BCDDP was that there was a lack of quality control in obtaining thermal images. Because infrared imaging is providing information relating to breast temperature, the environmental conditions in which the imaging is performed must be controlled. As a result, many of the thermograms included in the study were of little diagnostic value. To compound the problem further, no standardized reading protocol had yet been established for infrared interpretation. It wasn't until the early 1980s that standardized interpretation guidelines were developed. Due to the numerous flaws in study design and quality control, the initial thermographic results were disappointing and infrared imaging was dropped from further evaluation as part of the BCDDP. Consequently, mammography was found to be a useful screening tool and became the standard-of-care in breast screening. It is unfortunate that the substantial thermography research performed in the 1980s and 1990s was never enough to overcome the bias of hospitals and diagnostic centers who had invested in mammographic equipment; nor was it enough to convince the physicians trained to rely on mammography.",

The infrared camera picks up the vascular system. My doc showed me what a diseased breast would look like. It shows up with lots of blood going to it, not necessarily a solid mass. He compares  the two breasts for symmetry. The cost is about $150 which most insurance will not cover, but I felt it was worth it for my peace of mind. Next year, when I am back to paying my huge deductable, this cost will be moot for me, as I would have to pay for most of the mammo. One thing that I found really interesting in my therm, was how hot my breast was, as a result of the radiation, which I finished almost a year ago. It has dimished a lot since my first therm in July, but it still looks different from my healthy breast. I never got over the sense of boreboding during rads. From the first to the last day, I was so scared about what it was doing to me, because I kept hearing my inner voice reminding me that radiation causes cancer. So I just do not want any more of it. I know that I will be more likely to do followups this way, as opposed to mammos, which I would probably find an excuse to postpone, so for me, this is a safer alternative. I know it is not for everyone and I would never tell anyone to follow my course, but  I just wanted others to know that there are alternatives. Doing something is better than doing nothing because of fear. Even if you choose mammos, they are only as good as the tech who reads them, so make sure yours is qualified and experienced if you choose either.",

It is especially good for dense breasts because it looks at blood vessels feeding tumors, not for just a mass. I have had 2 and it is the only way I will go from now on. It is painless, cheap, and no radiation. If you have a good, experience tech, they can look for any suspicious changes over a few months, then have you go for an ultrasound or MRI. I will never do a mammo again. It did not find my lump, I did. Now I feel confident that I have a back up with the thermography. Go to termography.org or breastcancerschoices.org to learn more. Good luck!",

I have been following the protocol that Dr. David Brownstien and Dr. Derry have come up with and it has helped me to detox all the toxins that I know caused my bc. I have so much energy now. It took me a while to find a local doctor who supports the use of iodine and natural thyroid but I did. I also have a compounding pharmacy where I get my iodine and lots of supportive information. Blackjack, if you are interested, I can give you the names. The doctor is in Wheaton, and the pharmacy is in Naperville.",

I found the only way to deal with it was to put some of my favorite tunes on and take a long walk, I walked so much, I ended up losing 30 pounds! My biggest advice is just to not make any rash decisions. You are ahead of me because you are researching answers already. I just blindly followed my doctors and now there are things I wish I had not done. I also caution you to take it one step at a time. Do not make yourself crazy by thinking about every worst case scenerio. Cross each bridge when you come to it. You will come through this. Stay positve. Eat healthy and I hope that you will someday feel as I do: I am not glad this happened to me, but I am a happier and healthier person now because it did. My best to you!",

Even though my side effects were minimal, I never got over the fear of them, and I still wish I had not done them, since I had clear nodes and wide margins. But I would probably feel differently if my cancer had spread. Start getting in lots of fruits and veggies before you start to build up your immunities. Do all you homework and make them answer all your questions. And since you are in CA, get out and walk away the worry. The fresh air will do wonders for you physically and emotionally. Good luck.",

This was the part that took the longest to heal. I also had thermogram done at 6 months and my breast was still showing that it was hot. My last therm, 1 year out, showed that the breast was cooling but still had some effects from the rads. I could not believe I still have tissue damage after so long. Oh well, the reason I love therms, besides the fact they I will not get any more radiation from them and they are painless, is that they show things like the effects of rads that a mammo does not. I wish this technique would finally be accepted by main stream medicine. But I doubt that it will because they cannot make any money off of it. It took a year before the hair grew back under my arm. That is a good thing. I think?",

My doctors kept telling me it would hit, but when I got to the last week and was feeling fine, they sat me down and said \"OKay what are you doing?\" I had such a phycologically tough time about rads, that I needed to walk every day afterwords to get it out of my head. I took in lots of long deep breaths of fresh air, and walked at least an hour. Even in the dead of winter, I hardly missed a day. It was something I really needed to feel I was doing something good for myself, because I was so upset about getting radiated. After my walk, I ate an apple in the car before I got home and then I was able to forget it all until the next day. I had a lot of morning meltdowns, and the nurses helped me get through all the emotional part, but it was the walks that helped me the most. My doctors now hold me up as an example, and there have  been studies done that exercise diminishes the side effects of treatments. I also took omega 3 and vit e supplements, which my rad doc was okay with, and I had very little skin damage. However, it did take many many months for my breast to feel normal, and the hair under my arm did not grow back for a year, so keep in mind that the effects of radiation build up and do not end when treatments end. I am still trying to detox from it all. Good luck!",
