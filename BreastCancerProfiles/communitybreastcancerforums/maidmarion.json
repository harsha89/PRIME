They managed to pick a vein after much deliberation and it was a direct hit, thank goodness for good technicians! All the staff were super nice and the head of the Dept. turned out to be a client of the Animal Hospital I work at, so I was assured that as we take good care of her baby so she would be looking out for me,lol. So I am drowning in glasses of water and feel pretty good right now, steriod high I imagine. The dog will be happy..a long walk coming up for her later when cooler..84 degrees at the moment.

We had a great time and spent four days down in Key west, was hard to say goodbye at the airport on Friday though. I ordered some headgear on line today from planetbuff and chemosavvy, and I managed to get a wig last weekend while my son was here, I know he wouldn't let me get anything that didn't suit. So now back in the real world and anxiety rules! May have to crack open the bottle of xanax, wait, did someone mention a cannabis pill?  NanaA I know exactly what you mean about dreaming about chemo and SE's! So... Tuesday looms and I keep in mind what all you brave ladies say ....it's DOABLE... Good luck to Sakura73 on Tuesday and all those that are having treatments next week. Hope you feel better soon Nasharayne. Crusader1 Thanks for being there...x Julie",

I Know I have read that some of you had cravings for salt, I didn't first time round but sure did this time, and for mashed potato and gravy! So along with that I had the junk food you all said you had wanted, I actually had MacDonald's, something I don't usually buy, not a burger but a fillet -o-fish sandwhich and the fries were so good!  Se's were about the same as last time just seem to hit a little quicker, I do have a ongoing problem with skin issues though in that I suffer with psoriasis, I don't have too many patches thankfully at the minute, but the ones I do have are like burns after the chemo and are really sore, my Onc gave me some cream that helps and usually takes about 10 days to Calm it down. Friends.....well I had an experience before this pathway about four years ago that kind of sorted out who my true friends were which is another story and would fit on another forum if I ever felt the need for it, which I can say I don't. Anyway I am not in touch with those so called friends and I am left with a few close and dear friends that have been a constant support through both of my life changing times these last four years even though they are miles away in the UK. And since moving here I have made a few more friends that have been very caring and offered help in whatever way they can. I am equally touched by people that I have come across at work (clients) that have been supportive too either because BC has touched their lives or someone they know of. I do think that some people don't know how to handle certain situations until they see how you are dealing with it, so I decided to be out there and open about it, even bringing humor into it, especially at work. One young colleague even said I was her Hero the other day, I was touched, but you just do what you have to do to beat this B*****d disease. Janet...yes I'm liking the not shaving bit too! Well it's another beautiful day so I am going to make the most of it, some errands to do , fog permitting, then R&R with a bit of Vit D. Have a great Sunday everyone. Sending healing thoughts as always Julie",

As for the head wear, well I have resorted to wearing buffs all the time, at first because of scalp issues, I mentioned before I have Psoriasis and boy does the chemo make it angry, takes about 8 days with treatment to settle it down, and now its just too hot here to wear a wig. At home I don't wear anything except to sleep in, my partner has to have a fan going all night and like so many of you I have the hot flushes and when it gets sweaty the fan makes my head freeze! Ricki Sorry you are having a hard time,  I can only imagine how difficult this is living alone,  if ever there was a time though to let people help if willing, this is it. Doesn't mean independence is lost just makes this journey a little easier, and I think others actually feel better if they can do something to help. I have even had offers of help from clients at work, as they know my immediate family are back in the UK,  one client has insisted she makes me chicken soup after my next treatment, even though I explained I have support here, I didn't refuse for two reasons because I felt this would make her happy to be able to help in some way, and it will. Hang in there....this too shall pass.... we are always here for you! Sakura......Yep Tuesday is Tx 3 of 4 started my steroid trip this morning! I hope the Emend works out for you this time round, it certainly has been the best for me so far. Hope all goes well for Se's after...I will probably be craving my mash and Gravy again . I know you had said you love gravy. Do you think it's a Pome thing we took over to you all?  My partner & family here don't go a bundle on it.

My situation is similar to yours, only 1.3cm tumor with no node involvement. The reason I am having chemo is not by the oncotype which is another story! That was sent off by my surgeon but when it came back as 39 I freaked, only to find when I had my appointment at the Med Onc that it should not have been sent off as I was ER- PR+ and it did not pertain to me, the test kept talking about a patient with ER+, the Doc  called the Lab In California and asked to speak to someone about it, she asked them right then and there in front of me why it was done, why would they have done it, I gathered the Answer came back that it was probably because it had been recommended! Total farce, What a waste of Money,not to mention my state of mind! Anyway at this point I am thinking yay maybe I don't need Chemo, as my surgeon had said in the beginning I might not, and I guess I clung to that, but no, she put into her computer all my details using what ever formula she has and came back with a score of 29% chance of reoccurrance. So at first she was telling me I had to have TAC6. when I read up about the Adriamycin I spoke with her about the family history of heart problems and told her I did not want to take it, she said that was ok, I then asked again about how many treatments I would have she said usually 4-6, I said 4 sounds good and again she said ok, hope to goodness it stays that way! So mine was based mostly on the aggressiveness of the tumor I am gathering 3/3 and age etc. Here's hoping they don't put you through two more sessions! Went back the Hospital today to get my Neulasta took advice and had Benedryl, little nap this afto and feeling ok thus far, BM's good and still drinking gallons of fluid, Little bit of indigestion, but manageable. Have to go see radiologist Doc tomorrow for follow-up from treatment (mammosite) all seems well so don't anticipate any probs. Still on the steroid high and making the most of it. Dayla Sorry your feeling foggy right now hope it passes soon......hate that feeling of not being able to concentrate, had it when going through menopause, come to think of it it's still with me, bugger, I don't stand a chance do I?

I know It's hot where I am (Miami) but phew the sweating is bad, just suddenly comes on. GinaGina I had some itching on my hands day three in the morning but no rash and even now I get a little itching on my hands and wrists but it doesn't last. My face and chest was red the day before Chemo day of and day after I Looked like I had been in the sun, I figured it was the Steroids, Glad to hear you have it under control now. Tattoos...when my son visited, just last week, he showed me his latest tattoo, one he had not told me about, seems he has a whole mural thing in progress on his upper right arm. I know he had an Angel there, now he has two cherubs and was going back on his return home (UK) to have the background finished. Didn't like the thought of him getting Tattoos at first, he has a few now, but he's old enough and daft enough as my grandma would say, and they are in good taste I have to say. He did suggest we get one after together after all this is done ....I love you son but ...Not with you on this one.....Yet!  My daughter visited Miami ink last year when she was here, apparently it's a popular show over in the UK as well. I go the Onc on Tuesday one week after tx bloodwork and chk up. I get finger prick and chk up by Doc day before tx then Neulasta shot day after, then I am to have blood check each week. Well I'm going to try get a few errands done this morn while I'm feeling ok, afternoons seem to go downhill a bit. am sleeping somewhat better though, save for the trips to the bathroom..all that water...Oh and on the alc drink front I was advised not to...but I won't give up me morning cup of coffee! You girls keep me afloat thank you....I'm doing the DOABLE...keep it going Sending out healing thoughts as always Julie",

Then yesterday I got a call from my Onc who says that the last blood test taken Monday when I saw her says that my Tumor markers are slightly elevated, which they were before Chemo, and that she wants me to have another PET and CT scans done on areas that were in question before surgery etc, I had a slightly bigger than normal node in the right side of my neck, and a nodule on my adrenal gland which they said was more than likely benign. it totally threw me into panic mode! I hated each procedure the first time round, bit claustrophobic.  Hopefully it won't be anything guess she is just being cautious, so I am going to do some retail therapy with friends today to keep my mind of it!

But i have taken the decision not to wear any head coverings and go to work with my Sinead O'conner hair style, too damn hot to wear anything here. I started Arimidex in July and so far it seems ok no real SE's as such , a bit stiff in the morning but not quite sure if that is down to age now! I had a call back in July from the Onc after my visit to say that my Tumor markers were elevated, so I had to have another PET scan and abdominal CT scan, much to my dismay, hated them first time round with the false positives! Anyway much to my relief it came back \"unremarkable\" and the Onc nonchalantly  said \" oh  must have been a false positive!! We love those don't we! So finally after three weeks of worry until the tests were done and back, I thought, OK now we just get on with it, five years of Arimidex and lots of positive thinking, get myself into shape eat better, lose a bit of weight, get rid of all that comfort eating pudge. Hmmmm like you say not so easy....we have a Wii and we bought the fitness center, cough... cough, it's been out of the box once to set it up, I am just so tired when I get home from work that it's hard to motivate myself, especially after the dog has been walked too! So, it would be great to carry on in this thread and include Motivation and health tips. I know i don't post much but it has been a real help and a comfort zone to come on here throughout all of this, you all are so inspirational and supportive!  Anyway upshot is I do not have to go back to see the Onc for another six months. I can relate to what most have said regarding an emotional crash of sorts, something i also had just after Chemo finished, but like Diane says each day gets a little better, I try to keep myself occupied and always give myself something to look forward to, now and again i get that surreal feeling of what has just happened and i pull myself up and tell myself it's behind me I am a Survivor! Tomorrow the Dog will get an extended walk, that's a start eh? Sunday I am doing some retail therapy with friends at the Mall and may even get out the Wii resort when I get home! Have Great great weekend everyone! Cheers, Julie",

As for scans I have been lit up so many times it's a wonder I don't glow in the dark!...My surgeon had me going for every thing possible. First an MRI on both breasts with contrast to make sure there was nothing else lurking but IDC in my left breast. Then a bone scan, which came back OK, followed by a PET scan which threw up some areas that she wanted  CT scans on my neck chest and abdomen, Namely for a small node on my adrenal gland a slightly enlarged node in my neck on the right side and a few spots on my lungs, all of which freaked me out of course, but on the whole it turned out to be nothing. My radiation Onc saw the PET scan and said she had a hard Job seeing what they had! My Onc doc was not even concerned about the node on my adrenal saying it was really small and most probably benign as they mostly are, but that will be checked regularly most like. It was all very stressful at the time getting all these scans but at least I know my body inside and out pretty much now...oh and get this I have gall stones apparently but I have no problems with them. I agree with Diane and Pickle, push for them if you can for peace of mind. Diane and Patti Last one...so happy for you!   Patti well done on the Run/walk you deserved to be a couch potato for the rest of the day. I just sponsored some friends back in the UK who are doing a power walk half marathon in London next Saturday for Breast cancer research and care, walk the walk 2009. Slightly different to the norm as they will be doing it at night, its called The Playtex Moonwalk, yes in decorated Bras no less! Hope its a warm night! the one in the middle is my friend beside her on her left is her boyfriend! Thanks for all the good wishes for my third TX today..... they only had to stick me twice this time to get the IV in. Weird thing happened though I was eating a sandwich while getting my meds and I suddenly found it hard to swallow, didn't hurt but for some reason I just could not swallow the food, I could drink OK but the food just would not go down. I asked the nurse and he said it can happen but that if I am breathing OK it shouldn't be a prob for too long, anyone else had this prob?  Talking of exposing baldy heads, I showed mine to my four year old Granddaughter the other day, I talk to her by Skype as they live in the UK, She kept asking about my hair as I was wearing a scarf, and I told her I was taking medicine to make me better but that it had made my hair fall out oh she said then at a later date she had asked to see, I was a bit hesitant at first because its different when you are so far away don't see them regularly, didn't want to scare her off, I needn't have worried, she just threw her head back and laughed out loud!  You look like Granddad (my Ex-husband) and Ian (daughters Boyfriend) Kids eh!  Here's hoping for minimum SE's girls...sending healing thoughts as always Julie",

The day went off without a hitch, just the usual hunt the vein. Dawn...I usually take something to eat too, but this last two times I have struggled, I have had this weird swallowing problem going on and then today i just felt full like you said. Marshall2000 ........ I had a lumpectomy in Feb. then ten days later I had mammosite radiation therapy for 5 days, so glad I was lucky to be a candidate to have this procedure, it is so quick and relatively easy. I am going for a Bone density scan on the 11th of this month so my Onc can decide which Meds she will put me on, I don't see her until the 29th. There was talk of Arimidex last time we spoke, that or Tamoxifen, I am hoping it will be the first one, I would sooner take my chances with bone thinning, I understand there is something that you can have every six months to help with that anyway, name escapes me just now. I understand you wanting to get on with it...I wish you all the best on the rest of your journey, keep posting on here let us now how you are doing. Michelle  .....So glad to hear of your good news, your son is going to have a blast I'm sure. Its great that your your Daughter seems to be turning a corner, talking is definitely good..I hope it continues. Sakura....Glad to hear your last AC went well and hope you continue to feel good! Diane... Thanks for the message on Facebook...yes just so happy to be done..just need to get past this next few days and find some semblance again.  Hope you manage to sort out a Holiday for the Family, you definetly deserve it!  In fact I echo Dawn's sentiments to all those planning trips enjoy, y'all deserve it!

I am planning on a trip on July 11th though to my partners Nieces wedding in Port St. Lucie FL. K. signing off for now I actually feel like I might get some sleep...decadron had me up at 4.00 am this morning! wishing everyone that have just had Tx's a minimum Se time! Julie",

Try to remain afloat, hard I know right now, but we are all here sending our Love and thoughts to you. You will get through this and you will be the better person, this is something he will have to live with. Big Hugs Julie ",

Everyone looks great! (o; Next year maybe Miami? Francine...So sorry to hear of your loss Sakura..as far as my impending wedding...it is of course in the UK since it is not legally (federally) recognized in the US. My partner's mom and a couple of friends...will be flying over with us to join with my family and our collective friends for our civil ceremony in Nottingham. We met almost 5 years ago now on eBay. Longgggggggg story. LOL. I had to venture electronically across the pond to find my soul mate. Fate as it were after 29 years of marriage to a very nice man, but I was meant to have my 2 children. I am now where I should have been. Better late than never as they say, and I have to say that she has been a 'brick' and a constant source of support all through this. She is such a positive and optimistic person and always lifts me if I feel myself sinking a little. Anyway the ceremony is May 9th, is was set for September 09 originally but of course the BC postponed it! Hugs Julie",

      "Content": "Apr 16, 2010 05:38PM maidmarion wrote: Thanks for the congrats ladies. Yes, it is a very interesting story. Where to begin...as I said I had been married 29 yrs, with 2 grown children and 1 newly born granddaughter in Jan. 05'. I had been a seller on eBay for some time. Mostly selling memorabilia for a well-known TV show in the US. The name of the show was Xena, Princess Warrior! Anyhow, I had sold 2 photos; 1 to a woman in Germany and 1 to a woman in the US. I did something I had never done before; sent the wrong picture to the woman in the US, which happened to be MJ. When I realized what I had done I had emailed her to apologize that I had sent the wrong photo. She responded by offering to forward the photo to the woman in Germany. Thus began email correspondences, which opened up confidentialities. We wrote emails at first and then IMd on AOL. First a couple times a week and then progressed to daily. Even with the time differences we did not miss out in keeping daily contact. Some months passed and I was spending increasing time on the computer,while my husband had his own activities; he ran a local football (soccer) team. The children had their own lives, which left me to rebuild mine. Things came to a head and I confessed to my husband things I had only spoken of to one other person, my best friend Sue. All my life I knew something was not quite right, but went with the flow as you do and was meant to have my children. So we built a decent life together and raised our children. While he was trying to be supportive and wanted me to be who I was meant to be, he might have been a bit disillusioned by what he thought the outcome would be...as though a passing phase. However, it was not a passing phase. By this time MJ's mum had planned a trip as a gift for her to the UK and since we had been corresponding for months we offered to have her stay with us and finally meet face-to-face. She was to begin a doctoral program that August and arranged a collaboration with Nottingham Trent Univ. at Brackenhurst...so it more or less was killing 2 birds with one stone so to speak. It was really planned as anything other than friends meeting and my husband thinking MJ being gay that she could help me work out these inner feelings and thoughts. Like a sounding board. The crux of the matter was that we were very attuned to each other and it became apparent to us that we were meant to be together. Maybe fate had intervened...meeting on eBay...sending the wrong photo...then talking endlessly for months....no one can say when love happens...it just does. It is each of us who decide the course of it and I chose to make the leap. Not that was an easy time after the leap was made...the upheavel...the affect on everyone...stress...changes...another country...but it is what you do to be with the one you love. My ex moved on and remarried very quickly and MJ and I have waiting almost 5 yrs. LOL. In between that time was last years' life-changing event....which makes next month's event all the more significant and everlasting. Hope I haven't waxed on too long, but that's it in a nutshell! Hugs, Julie",
