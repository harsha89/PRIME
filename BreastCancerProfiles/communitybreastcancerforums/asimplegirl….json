The breast center that I was referred to did another ultrasound, and they actually found three \"lumps\". The doctor said that they were all fibroadenomas (one looked a little bit different, but they said it was fine) and they want me to come back in six months to see if they have grown any. I may have them removed in the future, but as of now they aren't bothering me. Hopefully this will ease the feelings of any other girls that are having the same problem and haven't had it checked out yet.",
