      "Content": "Jul 2, 2013 10:35AM - edited Jul 2, 2013 10:36AM by brandall I know in my case that they did radiation locally to my chest wall in hopes for a \"cure\".  There is some evidence out there that treating people who have very few mets aggressively from the very begininng have had benefits.  Because I only had one lesion in my liver that was taken care of by chemo, they decided to do the chest wall rads (which they would give someone with a lesser stage) in hopes that treating aggressively might put me in that 1-2% of people who are cured of stage IV breast cancer.  I think a lot of factors swayed the tumor board into making that decision.  One, I was 36 (now 37), two, I already had the mastectomy before finding out stage IV status, three, I only had one liver lesion, and four, that lesion disappeared with chemo.  Will it work?  Who knows, but I do appreciate their optimism ;) It's my understanding that you meet some of that same criteria...so maybe that is why? Also, I think they can only radiate areas once, so if you have no evidence of disease in those areas currently, they might wish to keep radiation in their \"back pocket\" in case the mets do return to those areas. And...the biggest risk of reoccurance, for the same cancer and a new occurrance are in the same area of your original tumor (which now would be along the mastectomy scar).  That is why they do the boost to the mastectomy scar, to try and kill any of the small cells of cancer that might be hanging out there. I'm certainly no expert on this subject, so I might be wrong on some of the points above - it's just my experience :) P.S. are you getting rads in Denver?",

For every red meat meal I eat that I should eat 4 non-red meat meals.  As far as sugar goes that it is okay in small doses but to definitely try and limit it. I have to confess that going to a total vegan diet would be very hard for me.  Mostly due to the limited dairy thing.  I think I could give up red meat.  Limiting sugar would be tough, but do-able.

I posted this in May of 2013 freaked out because while still in the normal range, my tumor markers were rising. I can tell you that I did NOT have progression until February of 2014. So I think the answer is YES, you can have rising tumor markers still in the normal range and be fine. As I recall, my tumor markers did go down again a little bit and fluctuated quite a bit in the normal range. My tumor markers are very reliable. When they started creeping above the normal range I had progression visible on scans very shortly afterwards. Hope this helps!",

I VERY strongly feel that there will not be a cure for a breast cancer.  I really think that it is going to become a chronic condition that will have to be constantly medicated.  We may have to constantly change medication, but there are going to be more and more inhibitors out there to choose from.  I am just hoping for time out of each medication for science to keep creating new drugs.  The expert I referenced above explained that the current approach to breast cancer in the lab (I go to a research hospital) is that estrogen positive breast cancer is like a bowl of alphabet soup.  We currently have shut down the ER (estrogen - with ooph and drugs) food source and unfortunately cancer is smart.  So the cancer says, \"Well there is hardly any ER to eat, so let's start trying to eat CDK or P13\".  We have to then shut down those pathways and try to get the cancer to seek out ER again, since there is so little there to begin with.  They eventually hope to find out how to shut down all of the \"letters\" in the alphabet soup and keep in in the bowl so to speak.  Thinking about it that way really helped me. So I guess to answer your question, I believe the answer to cancer is going to be more in the \"continuously treating throughout my life\" approach and I'm okay with that.  Hugs!",

I had a PET on Monday and called for the results today.  There was a small amount of metabolic activity in the right hepatic lobe.  It was only slightly greater than the background liver and this type of activity can be seen in a normal liver, but given my history it is concerning for the beginning of a new metastisis and should be the focus of my next PET. I'm scared :(  I'm tired of the \"is it or isnt it\" roller coaster.  I'm just tired :(  I have a regularly scheduled appointment with my oncologist on Monday, so I guess I'll know more then.  He'll let me see the scan too, which is always nice.  Plus I will get to pore over the written report vs. just getting it verbally from the nurse.  To be honest, once it sounded like there might be something bad on the scan the ringing in my ears was so loud it was hard to focus on what she might be saying. The SUV to that area was 2.1.  Does anyone know if that is good, bad, terrible?  I'm having my tumor markers drawn again tomorrow, so I guess we get see if they are still rising. Ugh.

All of that said, I do not believe it is a celebrity's job to educate the public.  She is just a woman who got terrible news like you and me.  I'm sure she is scared and it is not a requirement of her job to share her heath history.  Would I love it if she decided to really dig into this story and do some hard hitting journalism on the actual truth - YES!  Is it requirement because she is a celebrity and has breast cancer - no.  I can absolutely agree that I wish they would stop touting the early detection crud.  I was 36 when I was diagnosed.  I had no family history and was too young for a routine mammogram to be recommended.  I had a normal breast exam by my gynecologist in January at my annual exam.  Yet by the time I saw a doctor in July for a lump I felt, it had already spread to my liver and I was stage IV.  So frankly early detection mumbo jumbo makes me see red.  But, I guess if it gets just one person in for a mammogram who is sitting at home with a lump, then it is worth it for them to make the comment.  *sigh*",

However this last progression, I have been in a lot of pain in the liver area. I pretty much knew my latest scan was going to show progression based on my pain levels and it did. Although my oncologist does not believe the pain is coming from the additional tumor in my liver, but rather the nodal mass in my abdomen is growing and pressing on other things causing the pain. So in this case, yes, I do feel pain from the progression. But I will also say that I had hip pain before that was so bad I was convinced it was cancer, but it wasn't.",

My MIL also has stage IV bc and she goes to the Rocky Mountain Cancer Center and loves her oncologist too!  Feel free to PM me if you want the name of any of the 3 oncologists I referenced above :) Also, I know that the University of Colorado is doing a lot of the Androgen testing that bestbird mentioned in another thread.  That is looking promising for triple negative.  I believe Dr. Elias was listed on that particular study.

      "Content": "brandall wrote: Hello!  I'm new to this forum.  My name is Brandi and I have a wonderful husband and two beautiful kiddos ages 6 and 3.  I was diagnosed with breast cancer this past July.  I do not have a history of breast cancer in my family.  Ironically when I was diagnosed, I was feeling better than I had in years.  I had started running and finished 2 10k races and was training for a 10 mile race that my husband and I were going to run on a trip we were going to take to Walt Disney World this past fall.  Sadly, we had to cancel that trip :(   I found a lump in my left breast in the middle of May.  I was sitting on the couch and felt an extremely sharp pain in my breast, when I felt the painful spot there was a rather large lump there.  I had had an unremarkable breast exam at my yearly physical in January, so this lump was definitely new.  To be honest, it seemed so large that I can't believe I didn't notice it before that moment.  I e-mailed my doctor and she said that I should definitely be seen, but it was likely a cyst since cancer doesn't hurt, she told me to come in during the middle of my cycle.  Well I had just missed the middle of my cycle so I didn't get an appointment until the early part of June.  I had to cancel that appointment when my step-sister suddenly passed away at age 30.  I needed to go home for the funeral.  When I got back to Colorado I waited a week before I called for a new appointment.  I couldn't get in until July.  I went to my OB/Gyn's office and she felt the lump and referred me for a mammogram and ultrasound.  By the time I was in the parking lot of her office they were calling to make the mammogram appt.  When I went to that appointment a week later, I honestly wasn't worried.  My lump had been throbbing this whole time and EVERYTHING I read indicated that cancer doesn't hurt.  I had the mammogram done and while waiting for my ultrasound, the nurse came back in and asked if they could get some more views for the radiologist.  This was the first moment that I felt some doubt that my lump was nothing.  After I had the ultrasound, the radiologist came in and sat down in front of me.  He grabbed my hand and told me that my mammogram was very disturbing and the ultrasound found 4 masses in my left breast and a suspicious lymph node in my armpit.  He told me he wanted a biopsy done immediately.  He wanted it scheduled that day, but they couldn't get me in until the next day.  While worried, I honestly still felt it could be a cyst.  Well, 3 days later they called and told me that all of my biopsies came back with cancer :( A week later I was in a surgeon's office and 2 days after that I had a left radical mastectomy and an axillary node dissection (7/10 postive nodes).  I kept asking for a PET scan and they said the oncologist would do that.  I wasn't able to get in to see the oncologist for 4 weeks.  They ordered a PET scan, which I had 2 days later and bam a small hot spot in my liver.  Suddenly the doctors stopped dishing out the hope they had been giving me previously.  Very depressing.  The spot was in the middle of my liver and too small to biopsy.  I had 2 MRI's to try and confirm that it was cancer.  The first standard MRI was inconclusive and the 2nd was done with Eovist and the radiologist felt that my \"spot\" as I call it was likely cancer.  I have never had 100% confirmation, but the fact that it responded so well to chemo and that tumor markers that were once elevated started dropping as it responded, pretty much confirmed it was cancer.  Although, I have to admit that some days I still pretend they were all wrong and it's not cancer.  I did dose dense AC-T chemo for 8 cycles and just completed those in December.  I had a PET scan at the end of December and it came back with \"no active cancer\" and my liver spot \"resolved\".  YAY!  I'm about to start radiation on my left chest wall/armpit on the 21st of January.  Then in March I will have a hysterectomy.  I'm so scared of the cancer coming back that I freak out at every little ache and pain :( Well, sorry for the novel!  I'll end this on a positive note.  The trip to WDW that we had to cancel in September due to chemo is back on for May.  I signed up for a super sprint triathlon at the end of June and I just feel like I'm getting my life back.  Having little kids during this process is hard, but also a blessing.  It's hard to lay around feeling sorry for yourself when your 3 year old wants you to play with him and make him some mac and cheese :) Life goes on and it's so beautiful.  I WILL be around to see my kids graduate high school and get married and have kids of their own, I WILL :) Brandi - Mother of 2 - Daughter age 6, Son age 3; Liver mets Dx 7/24/2012, IDC, Stage IV, Grade 3, 7/17 nodes, mets, ER+/PR-, HER2- Surgery 8/2/2012 Lymph node removal: Left, Underarm/Axillary; Mastectomy: Left Chemotherapy 9/11/2012 AC + T (Taxol) Radiation Therapy 1/21/2013 Breast, Lymph nodes Hormonal Therapy 3/1/2013 Tamoxifen pills (Nolvadex, Apo-Tamox, Tamofen, Tamone) Surgery 3/20/2013 Prophylactic ovary removal Hormonal Therapy 2/21/2014 Femara (letrozole) Hormonal Therapy 5/31/2014 Faslodex (fulvestrant) Targeted Therapy 4/9/2015 Afinitor (everolimus) Hormonal Therapy Aromasin (exemestane) Log in to post a reply",

I'm currently waiting for new scan results (and freaking out). The palbociclib is a 125mg dose given by pill every day for 21 days and then you have 7 days off. I am not sure I'm on the actual drug because I don't really have any of the neutropenia that is a common side effect of this drug. I feel pretty awesome actually, like I'm running a half marathon in a week kind of awesome. I feel a lot more like myself than I did on Femara. The trial coordinator and my oncologist keep telling me that the neutropenia has really only been a problem for about 30% of the trial participants, so I suppose there is still a chance. It is my understanding that if this drug gets approved with the current approval they are seeking, it will only be allowed to be given as stated in the application. Which I believe at this time is just Letrozole + palbociclib. For it to be given with the faslodex (like the trial I am on they will need to reapply for the new use once the results are in for this phase.

I frankly don't understand why you would WANT to read these heartbreaking emotions when you don't have to.  I don't really understand what you would gain by posting here and why you would want to come into this thread and aggressively start campaigning to post here.  Why?  I would also like to say that I am not one who really even cares all that much about non stage IV people posting here.  I think this thread started out very respectful.  I don't even care that you disagreed with the original poster, you are certainly entitled to those feelings! I do think your disagreement was written in such a way that you wanted to be controversial.  It is very clear that you feel anger about not being able to post here and I guess I just don't know why?  The problem isn't that non stage IV people want to post here.  The problem is that when they do, for every 20 people who respectfully post and add things when they have advice or feelings that are very valid to the conversation, there is also that one that comes in just to stir things up.  It feels a bit like bullying people who are dying. I won't be coming back into this post.  The original topic already caused me too many emotions, and then the aggressive attack tone of the post caused me to feel sad, defensive, angry and left me sobbing while typing this.  I frankly need all the energy I have to just focus on being a good mommy for my kids when all I want to do is lie down and sleep. All I will say is that ladies on this forum saved my sanity.  Thank goodness this place exists. In my next life I want to more like Fitztwins and respond like she does :) I also apologize for the horrid, grammatical errors in this post...but frankly I'm just too tired to go back and proofread.",
