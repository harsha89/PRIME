I had my first chemo yesterday 5/3/18 and it went much smoother than I thought. It was a long day, which they said the 1st day usually is. My husband and I were there for 6 hours. I got that metal taste in my mouth, so I sucked on hard candy and water seem to intensive it, so I switched to soda. Afterwards, I had some nausea, tingley feelings on arms,feet, and hands, hyper due to the steroids (didn't sleep well). I drank tons of water and tried to lay down when I first got home and had to sit back up. Not dizzy, just the feeling when you had the 3rd drink when you said you were going for just 2! Lol. I just need to sit up for awhile. Which was good cause I was going to the bathroom a lot. I added Gatorade with my water (again still had that taste of metal when I just drank water),I am thinking I might switch to pedialyte.",

      "Content": "May 7, 2018 08:34AM - edited May 7, 2018 08:35AM by SAW66 Hi everyone, My first round of chemo was on 5/3 and I posted what the day was like earlier in this thread. Day 1- woke up nausea, ate crackers- was fine. Face was flushed. Had a headache at night and toke Tylenol pm and went to bed. Day 2(Saturday) Woke up with a headache and was nausea. It was pretty much like that all day. Tired, napped in the afternoon. Sharp pains in the left leg and teeth hurt (?). Walked around a lot to help with the muscle ache. I took Advil and ate crackers and finally took nausea meds at night. The nausea meds took forever to kick in, that is why I haven't taken them. Maybe I need to take them sooner? Day 3 (Sunday)- mild headache and nausea. Again toke Advil and ate crackers and felt pretty good the rest of the day. Was hungry...muscle aches are still there, continued walking. Today ( Mon) I felt fine. So, if I went by this first go around for treatment, my bad days start day 2. I always heard 3-4 days. I'm sure it can change. I think I will stick to either Thur or Fri for treatment so I can have my bad days for the weekend, in case I want to try to work. I just figure life is going to be on hold for awhile and this too shall pass. My port has been bothering me, anyone else? Like it just feels strained..I cant really describe it..But I have it for a year, so hopefully soon I will just get used to it. I am not getting the AC, just Taxol and herceptin for 12 weeks. So, my symptoms seemed to be milder than some of you. So, for those of you going through the AC, stay strong!!",

Just finished 6 of 12!! Half way there! It put a smile on my face today, I'm just so ready to be done. I had my son buzz cut my hair today when I got home. Before chemo I had a very short pixie cut, but it started looking patchy and every time I touched it I had a hand full of hair. So, we got the clippers and put the no 1 on it and toke it all off! It kinda felt liberating. There is something about the advise everyone said about being in control and I felt it today for some reason. I didn't get a wig, I am just going to wear hats and scarfs. I already scared myself going to the bathroom...I didn't recognize myself! I also am having a hard time sleeping. I know tonight will be bad cause of steroids, but this week my feet has been tingly and some pain. It also seem to travel to my legs. So, between hot flashes and having to move my feet to stop the pain, I don't get much sleep. Anyone else going through the same thing? Any recommendations on how to help stop it? Hope everyone has a great weekend...its supposed to be hot here.",

I am glad we have people to talk to while we are in the waiting room! Ingerp- looks like our dx is similar and our regiment will be the same. I will probably stick with Fridays as well. You inquired about my GI- for the past few days I have had loose bowels, not diarrhea or cramping. Now, I have been eating some spicy foods (Mexican), so I think I will start doing the bland diet to see if that helps. I also woke up today with a sore in my mouth and started the baking soda/salt mouth wash. I was brushing my teeth after every meal, but got lax on it. Plus my teeth have become sensitive and ache.",
