Re: mammograms \"saving your life\" I've had them since I was 30, and am now 55, and they didn't do anything for me, except cost a lot of time, money and painful procedures. I felt some thickness in early '09 and my dr. sent me for a mammo & ultrasound. Report came back reading: \"numerous microcalcifications, dense breasts, difficult to read, presumably benign.\" One year later the thickening had progressed, and that's when they decided to do a stereotactic core needle biopsy and discovered DCIS on one side. Even a subsequent MRI didn't reveal the other problems. Only after two surgical biopsies did they have enough evidence of BC: DCIS, LDIS, Tubular BC, and other abnormal tissues, on both sides. One Dr. has suggested I may have developed the abnormal tissues due to all the mammorgrams I had almost yearly for twenty five years. No one I  know who has had BC had it discovered by mammogram, only by self-examination.",

My mother died of it, my friends died of it, and my clients have died of it. Seen, and been care taker to lots of end of life horror due to BC and other cancers & AIDS. So relieved to see there are other women out there, and here, who share my sentiments. I've been called a hero, survivor, herione, brave, smart, inspirational woman, etc. and while I appreciate the honor, don't feel like I'm all that. Life happens and you deal with it, including falling apart at first trying to figure out how to go about dealing with it. Was invited by a woman I know who had BC a few years ago to run a race or take a walk for BC earlier this month. Why? For whom? In two days it will be November, National Suicide Month. What color ribbon is that? My brother killed himself in March, six weeks before I got the DX with BC. I'll soon deal with Novembercide, and then be done with it come December 1! Do all of our tragedies and traumas now require colored ribbons to be officially ackowledged? Thanks for hearing me out!",

Saw a wise girlfriend tonight at a party to watch the fireworks off Malibu Beach, all four displays - they were beautiful. She asked how am I doing and I said \"flowing down the river watching everything pass by and remembering from time to time that I'm approaching the waterfall and will soon go over the edge.\" She said, \"good, good, I'm glad you're doing so well.\" ha ha. Guess sooner than later I will join you in bed rest, pain pills, constipation, and drain patrol and control. At an earlier party a friend brought the poofies that fit into the soft cammies she gave me that she used when she had her LMX. When she first gave it to me a month ago I gave her back the poofies, but now realize since I'm having half size TEs I won't have much there for a while, even though I'm small, a 32C, so the poofies will pad the wounds and give some semblance of something there. Also, the oncology center where I had a consult with the onc dr. gave me a medical MJ letter to take to the dispensary. I didn't ask for one, but their pharmacist said it was best to use \"multiple modalities\" so more to explore! Am concerned that the PS said he will do a neurectomy on the Major Pectoralis, and since I am a very active, rather athletic person, that won't do, as it will make me lose strength and the muscles atrophy. So have to talk with him at the pre-op Tuesday and see if he will forego that part of the surgery. So complicated! I hope you are all resting well, and comfortable as possible. Liz, will call you - thanks so much for reaching out! Love to all! Melissa",

Finding I must become more accepting and less judgemental of everyone around me now. So it's a good spiritual practice, yes? Went to the PS today for a consult, and she will be the one I choose. Have seen three already and here's what they all said when I took off the robe: \"you have perefct breasts.\" Well, yes, and it's nice of you to notice and then tell me the implants won't be like them and maybe different from one another as well. Not wanting to sound crabby, but due to genetics and not having children my breasts have been nice, and I used to model for artists (nude, yes) and photographers. Oh well, at 55 it is something to have \"perfect breasts with zero droop\" and now I am a grown up and can say good-bye, I've enjoyed you and so have others! The PS office will coordinate with the BS office tomorrow and let me know possibly by tomorrow if June 21 will be my date. Let's hang in there and take the high ground with these comments as these folks just don't know any better, and perhaps by our behavior they will learn to be a bit more careful. A few think now my chance is to get bigger ones - h#ll no. Prayed last night in the sweat lodge for all of us, and sending special prayers to our sisters who just went through it these past few days, and also, today gettinpastthis had her surgery, too. Fast healing, peaceful rest to you all! For those of us still yet to go, let's hold good thoughts, calm down if possible, and know the healing hands that will transorm us will do so with intelligence and love.

It's wonderful how you can get on the other side of the fear of the unknown and arrive in a place where you have completed the surgery step, at least for some of us, and move forward with a different perspective. Was disappointed at first when I didn't get a June date, but now, upon reflection, think it may be best so I will have a month to continue to decompress from the double shocks I've had since March, and get organized without rushing. Getting to an alternate state of \"normal\" sounds good...cleaned house, watered & fed plants, & colored my gray roots this weekend, so, as we say out here, poco a poco, little by little.  Laurie, I hope you do find something in your thrift store, maybe looking will keep your mind off of other \"things.\" Living in beautiful New Hampshire might just be a trade off for high class thrift store duds, huh? To have the woods in your backyard sounds so lovely. Have #2 appt. with the PS tomorrow so she can get photos of me before surgery Tuesday, and I can see some example of her work. 1st appt, when she tried to show me her work, her laptop shut off ;~) Thanks to all of you for wishing me well on my surgery Tuesday. Waiting to hear back from Helenap, too! PS wondering if any of you, like me, has stopped taking her hormones after being DX, and now  having full on hot flahses & night sweats. I was taking Prometrium & using the Vivelle Dot estradiol patch, both bioidentical hormone replacement therapies. Wow, these sudden and frequent sweats are really something!",

With dense breasts you can't be sure. My BS thinks there is infiltrating in there, too due to the multifocal & multi- centric presentation. Since it is early, it's good to take the time to be mentally & emotionally prepared, yet take care of business, so we can be part of the great statistics your doctor offered, free of disease! Well, finally some form to this crazy diagnosis. Visited the plastic surgeon today. Did I mention she's wonderful? and a real, human being? We were able to set up her schedule with the breast surgeon and hospital for July 22. Yeah. Not really. But it's good to know there's a point of departure from this anticipatory purgatory of waiting to find out when I get to go under and get rid of the several different types of early cancer that live in my breasts now. At least it will happen when they've both returned from vacation, and the appt. is the first one of the day, at 7 am. That means showing up there at 5 am. And being finished by probably midday. This gives me time to get my life a bit more organized and to also get serious about \"training\" for surgery.She took photos of my breast from every angle imaginable. So possibly she will create a reasonable facsimile out of what is left behind after the breast surgeon does her thing. Ordered a special front zip sports bra as recommended by plastic surgeon. Both my surgeons are young, smart, beautiful, and compassionate. What more can you ask for in a situation like this? Tomorrow I take the breast surgeon on a test run with this subareolar disk resection, and besides this procedure revealing what is under those nipples, and if they can be saved, it will also promote vascular growth that, come July 22, will have spread nicely to insure a better chance at blood supply to the skin remaining after this upcoming skin-saving, possibly nipple/areola saving mastectomy.

Glad to have the help and company and yet it will be good to have my own space again, too. So at this point, I'm thirteen days out from surgery. No complications, both drains out. Sore as heck, and trying to cut back on meds. The three I'm alternating are 600mg Ibbruprofen, 5 mg. Roxicodone & 5 mg. Valuim. The Iron Maiden bra thing is really rather much at times. Not allowed to exercise yet, so doing gentle short walks. Have great range on movement, and will have a complimentary lymph massage at my PS office tomorrow. May have first fill on Tuesday. Signed up with PT before surgery but can't start there until PS signs off. May not need much - we'll see. My path came back 100% clean. Have a order for a catering job for August 15 and hope I can do it - can really use some work/income these days.  Glad to see you are all getting on with your lives, albeit some of you with further treatment and others with work, kids, etc. to incorporate back into your lives.  Miss you guys and hope to post more when I have more time to do so without neglecting helper/guests. Will take my first trip up to Monterey Bay Aug 28/29 for the birthday of some friends children, a weekend at a beach house they've rented, so that will be fun, and will see how the magnets of the TEs go through security at LAX and San Jose airports.

Laurie, I'm glad your \"old life\" is coming back again and that your family harmony is bringing you happiness for everyone in your family. What you wrote really touched me as I also lost my mom to BC when I was 37. Took a leave of absence from UCLA when I was ready to graduate to do hospice with her, on my own, and she died in my arms. It was so hard to process that for about three years. We do say we're lucky, and we are, and yet it is true that we have suffered sorrows and losses and important to acknowledge that part of our experience and lives. My hope is that it helps me to develop into a more compassionate and thoughtful  and wise human being who can do more for others while I'm here. I do miss my breasts and feel strange having these plastic balloons in my chest feeling so much pressure, and being tired. These things will change as everything does, but its good to be present with our feelings as we float down the river of time, don't you think? Just had my first dream of my brother who died in March this morning, so putting the grieving on hold for the BC surgery worked, yet now that grieving work is back to be attended to as well. Grist for the mill, and am glad to be alive and well.  Hope you all have a nice weekend! ",

It does amaze me sometimes when I tell them I am in the process of BC reconstruction, mostly people I've befriended this year who didn't know, but in the process of getting to closer, I decide to let them know, especially what with hospital dates, drugs, etc. that are hard to hide to some you have more frequent contact with. But I get a lot of responses like, \"oh, my dog/cat has cancer, too\" It really blows me away, but I sort of chuckle to myself, as I require all the positive, loving energy inside of me to continue to circulate and heal. Going into anger mode just makes me feel bad in so many way. This has been/continues to be an enormous lesson in compassion and loving kindness. I am a Buddhist, so these teachings have become so much more real to me in this, as I realized I had a choice, and going the \"middle way\" has brought deep insight, and heart opening. It is a very spiritual experience, and I'm so grateful. Also grateful for you gals here. Couldn't have gotten this far without you! As far as the exchange, Laurie, I'm one week out. They took my drains out and tape off today. I was crying in the office, I think out of sheer exhaustion, as I haven't been sleeping much, but also relief and grief, etc. from everything, and the realization that I lost my breasts. My new ones are beautiful! Am so lucky to have this wonderful and kind doctor who takes great pains to make them look gorgeous. I am sore & stiff, due to pocket work, and swollen on top. They don't project as the TEs did, but they are the perfect size for my petite frame. Will post photos as soon as some swelling diminishes. I put away the wedge pillow that I've been using for months,and find that I can sleep okay with several regular pillows. I think Getty worked out the sneaky side sleep technique. I prop up a pillow under my ribcage, and have my head pillows elevated so that the breast hangs free, sideways. I was told not to sleep on my side or stomach for at least six weeks, not to break a sweat, or let my heart rate go up over 90 for the next three weeks. And I must wear a bra 24/7. Have a couple of cotton sports bras which are fine. You'll be so happy to get those TEs out, it is like everyone says, night and day!! As for recovery, I have laid low for a week, and will continue to be easy and gentle with myself. But I have energy and am doing some walking, but gentle walking, not the power stuff I usually do. Hope this answers some of your questions. Feel free to ask anything else, since I'm the guinea pig of late :~) Wishing everyone a wonderful holiday, and Getty, have a blast on your cruise. You'll thaw out nicely! Will be with you in spirit, soak it up!! It will take you to another world and this will be forgotten temporarily. I'll bet you'll look great in your swim suit, too!  I actually bought a bikini the other day, something I had planned to do before all this stuff came down in March. I've given myself the gift of a personal retreat by renting a little place on the ocean in central California, Cayucos, a tiny, slow beach town that I love to visit. I'll be there for three days before Christmas and have some quiet uninterrupted time to reflect, pray and renew.  Yes, may 2011, the Year of the Rabbit, be kind and loving. The year of the Tiger has bared claws and teeth, yet if we survived it, as so many I know have had big challenges, we will be rewarded by the Rabbit/Cat....many happy returns everyone! xoxo Melissa ",

Had my double lumpectomy yesterady, under general anestesia, not so good, but better after water & food & a few hrs. sleep. Piece of cake. Ready for the big one - BMX - come July 22. How's everyone? Sounds like your soreness is where your drains were, yes? marmalade? Glad you are getting out and about.",

Circe: just underwent a relatively new procedure prior to BMX I'll have on July 22. It's called subareolar disk resection. They take tissue directly beneath nipple/areola complex to see if they can get a clean 2cm margin. I'll find out Friday if I get to keep one or both, as my L. has DCIS close to nipple. I'm told this technique gives more comprehensive path results than frozen slide in OR, plus stimulates vascular growth to provide better blood supply, if done several weeks beforehand, for your skin sparing, possibly nipple/areola sparing MX. You might ask your doc if you can have this preventative measure. It is like a double lumpectomy, and today I'm rather swollen - where's the ice?  MistyJ: Glad your relatives are coming to care for you. Are you listening to any guided visualizations? The BellRuth Napastek ones are great. Have been listening to the prepare for surgery and stress ones so far. Also have the pain one.  Just found out yesterday that the PS will be leaving town for two days following my surgery. Not pleased. Will call to talk with her today and insist that she replace herself with another PS for those days or perhaps I'll go to the other one I liked, who is her colleague. Don't think it's too much to ask a PS to be around right after surgery. I've already delayed my surgery once due to her vacation in early July.  gettinpasthis: sorry you are having pain from lymph incisions. not sure how you got the scar tissue where your ll level nodes are. glad it is all out of there, and that you have better mobility with your arms. am sure pain will decrease with each day. have you tried the lidocain yet, or numbing creams, as mentioned by others? ",

Let us know when you take you first drive behind the wheel! Laurie, Webstermom, and anyone else who is interested, I'm happy to share my alternative pre-op program if you want to send me a PM - supplements & diet. It works really well, and you can pick and choose what to do or not to do as any little bit helps. Best to take the Vit. C leading up to but stop a week before as it is also a blood thinner. You can take Vit. C up to bowel tolerance or take more by getting the buffered C powder. I'm taking about 3 grams a day. Can somebody - Jsmiley? update the June Mastectomy list at the top of this forum? Misty: thinking of you today & holding you in the white light and knowing you will emerge and be well. Jilly: take care in your journey and will be holding you in thoughts and prayers tomorrow!  Joystars, beautiful smiles! Praying for you and your baby, it will go so well, and you have the best care and lots of love. slcardsfan: Hope you are resting peacefully and painlessly and look forward to your first post-surgery post.  Went to the dentist today for teeth cleaning and told them what was up - they were so caring and loving, as I've been going there for years, and they're all women. They said they would all come see me in hospital, even the receptionist, and they put my date in their auto calendar on the computer. Bought a sports bra and am \"practicing\" wearing it. Have been blessed to not have to wear one, - now it's time to practice for a different kind of bust. Making lists, did pre-op blood/urine. Did everyone have to give blood for a reserve before surgery? Anyone having pec spasms with TEs? Feeling more acquainted with the emotional roller coaster and doing my best to say \"yes\" to whatever comes up and trying to remain fluid, soft, and loving through this...so much is so unpredictable, at least in my life right now . . . meltdowns happen and it just seems like they are all part of the natural balancing of it all.",

Unless I had aggressive BC I will stay away. I respect the choice of any one who feels the need to take it, so may we all remain disease free, whatever the methods we choose. joystars: yay! you and your darling little baby are safe, and it's over now, you can move on without worries! glad you had such an easy time. it will take time to get used to the new chest, and I'm so happy your DH is there to give you deep love. getty: do as much research as possible. i see your dx is dcis stage 3. i was told that i needed no therapy afterwards, although the only onc I've seen recommended hormone therapy. the damage just isn't worth it to me, and if the surgery removed the bc, why take toxic drugs? It's certainly a personal issue, but my PCP supports me in refusing. I'll see another onc after surgery. one doc I went to for consultation said tamox. is a current \"trend\" BC treatment, and not a definitive preventative, but very dangerous. laurie: I took valium for my surg. excision, night before and morning of, and not for my more recent lumectomy, and the valium time was so much better.

Thanks for the drain tip, every little bit helps, and being prepared makes the anxiety so much less! jsmiley: glad you got out and into the world. remember to take it easy, we all heal at our own rates. happy you are on the other side of it now.",

My instructions are to not do much activity at all for the first two to three weeks, then start mild aerobics, if allowed. I'm glad you found out Liz what was making all that fluid flow! About the generics. Having been on this road for a while, earlier on I was taking Ambien to sleep. They gave me generic and it was horrible stuff, not at all like real Ambien. I took it back and made a declaration that it was junk, and they took it back and replaced it with real Ambien. At Walreens here in misty, cool Santa Monica. Yes, it has been lightly raining for the past three days. I love it, as it keeps things more quiet and people more subdued, but there are those who insist that July be SUNNY. Oh well.. Today I was at Walgreen's again,  getting my RXs for the big surgery July 22. I insisted on all name brands, and the pharmacist acted like I was bit of a problem as she had to look each of them up. Seems Big Pharma is in bed with Big Med Insurance Co. and they are setting everyone up to just take generics. The pharmacist said they \"punish\" anyone who orders name brand by charging huge amounts of money. I'm of the mind that I'd rather pay $100 for the real deal, because I'll only be on these drugs a short while and might as well have the ones that work properly and are effective. The young guy pharmacist I sometimes get there said wistfully that he wished he could afford name brand, that he'd get them, too. So I have ordered name brand Valium, Oxycontin plain, without aspirin, tylenol, or any other \"filler\" and then the antibiotic is also to be name brand. I must wait a week for the Oxycontin, but why not? it's true those generics have a lot of leeway to put only a % of the real stuff in there and fill it up with other junk the rest of the way. This must be a part of the decline of Western Civilization as we are getting to know it first hand. I'm sorry you got left in the lurch, Liz! and then got set straight by your Dr. so those drains will come out sooner than later. Good for you for having such a great workout routine! Glad you've got your drains gone, stlcardsfan - onward and upward! Laurie, sounds like you are being a very good patient and have a darling husband taking care of you. Glad you are doing so well and you two got a break to yourselves. MRDRN, sorry you are having those pains, I'll be following you with the SMB arm thing most likely. I know it will relieve soon, though, and hope you are trying some of the \"cures\" for constipation as offered here by others. The warm prune juice sounds like a winner. Think I'll pre-dose with stool softeners, and then take more magnesium than usual, as that relaxes the peristalsis pretty well. And then keep prune juice on hand. JBL10 sounds like you are doing very well, and repeating the mantra, BE, not, DO, for the time being. Great advice for a fast recovery. Am glad someone mentioned looking at their boob. I saw photos of a woman who had the expanders I'll have, low height, and they look pretty deformed for the whole time, as there is no upper pole, but the end result will be good I trust for all of us who have TES awaiting exchange. Oh, yes, that's another forum! Oh, my surgeon said it will be an eight hours surgery. Three for the BS to do the BMX & SNB, then the PS to do the recon w/ TEs for four to five hours. Cannot imagine what that will be like, but I'll be alseep, so guess I will never know except the aftemath. Hang in there, everyone, and sooner than later you will be enjoying some cocktails and guacamole with chips by the pool while I drink, my prune juice and sleep all day and night on a pile of pillows. So happy you are all doing so well!!! ",

Congrats on making it this far and for leading the way, encouraging us that we will be soon on to the next thing like you are. The postiion in the chiropractor office sounds perfect. Reneemac: Those vitamin shots should be helping a lot now, as the adjustment of your med schedule, and so happy you have the vacation to look forward to.  Robin: 300cc sounds like a lot but I didn't know what size you were going into this. Hope you are finding ways to cope and that your energy for work is holding up. Glad the company is treating you so well. Yes, am familiar with those electric cables, ice pick man, and the like. Do find that PT helps tremendously, especially for dispersing the cording that feels like wires pulling your skin. Stretching is saving me - a lot - so hope you go to PT soon and get some of this relief. Jeanne: I can so relate to missing your breasts, especially when the replacements feel like wires wrapped too tight, around and through. Was feeling that way today, kind of sad, and my TEs are pumped up to beyond capacity now, so feel like I have these Barbie boobs sticking out and up, a bit self-conscious, & skin really right, too. This too shall pass, and we will have those soft squishy ones someday, as Getty keeps reminding us. Carolyn: so true if men had to have testicle expanders they would have designed things differently... ;~) Will definitely go for the nipples, yet I haven't seen any tattoos I like - they all look the color of raw liver to me. Wondering if there are any realistic tattoos being done. Mine were more pale and more pink. Check out the photo gallery if you haven't already - great examples of all of this recon. For TE insanity: Hot showers, gentle massage, even using the vibrator, as suggested by the PT, helps. I've been taking long brisk walks and stretching upper body while I walk, doing standing push ups on fences, etc. Moving seems to help keep it moving! Deep tissue massage works great, too. Am having that once a week - made a deal with the therapist. Fabric and any type of bra feels very uncomfortable, except for the Costco camisoles, but I have tags of skin on each side of my scars that look like alien double nipples if I don't cover them up, so am trying to wear the camisole, then something loose over it. What if we could take these out, and have a break, just for five minutes? ReneeW: Regret that your BMX experience wasn't easy for you - they shouldn't have let you go home so soon. Do keep us posted on your throat spot. I understand and support you not wanting to go for the chemo or hormone protocols. Holding good thoughts for you.",

I am scheduoled for out patient surgery - subareolar disk resection on the 15th, to see if the nips can be saved, so am thinking at least the BS (and I can give her a test run - ha ha) will have less to take in the big surgery, and I'll find out ont he 19th about the nipp. Less stress, I guess.  You are a dear one to mark me in your calendar - thank you xo renneemac: happy time now that you are post surgery. sounds like a funny time, and great results, and a very nice set up for after care. many blessings to you. keep us posted and thanks for the list of lifesafers in the hospital.

Gettingpasthis: we are not alone - thank heavens - and I'm glad to hear you got out in nature. I, too went to stay overnight at my friend's house at the beach. She and her roomates, guests and helpers all proved a delightful distraction, as well as lots of good vibes and hugs, plus the ocean waves crashing through the night and the salty air got me back from a bit of a glum place. Like Tina Turner sang, big wheels keep on moving, proud mary keeps on moving\" we're moving and rolling on that river. Focusing on being as flexible as yielding as possible through this. Loving this June thread, it's keeping me sane. stlcardsfan: you have the same date as I (tentatively) have, so let's do it together.

Congrats on your drain-free status. Robin & Laurie et al: will see BS Friday for path report, doing well, ran errands this morning, icing nips now, and only took one percoset this afternoon. Feeling so much more ready for the BMX! PS office called to say she will be going away the day after my surgery for two days, but the BS will take care of me, so I think I can feel good about it. So hard to schedule two busy docs plus a busy hospital at the same time. Full speed ahead... JSmiley: this roller coaster will bring you up and down, hope tomorrow you feel better. if you feel like crying, let it out and those endorphins will calm you. And I agree about looking at the incision, best to skip it until the timing is right. The steri-strips helps mask it until we are ready. almagetty: speaking of steri-strips, after my April biopsy I pulled off the top layer a few days later, but then that area swelled a bit, and started hurting, as it seems the pressure was stopping bleeding, too, so now I  know better and am leaving it on, however uncomfortable. Maybe the nurse can take it off?  So happy you are healing up quickly and have little need for pain meds. Sounds like you are doing quite well.   MistyJ: how are you doing as you approach your surgery date on the 22nd? Hope you are feeling encouraged and  as calm as possible. Got your bag packed? P.S.

      "Content": "Jun 26, 2010 09:28PM - edited Jun 26, 2010 09:28PM by orchidgal  Hi Ladies, I've been caught up in the cliff-hanging drama of changing PSs, and think I finally got the right one and was able to save my date, July 22. Still a bit ill from the anesthesia, & sore, of the bi-lumpectomies, but better everyday. You gals knock me out with your energy, enthusiasm and encouragement for those of us yet to go! I hope you are still with me, or join me over on the July forum when my time and the other later MXs come due, so we can join you as being DONE. I've already added a June 30 to our July forum. Such an incredible group of women, why not let June & July be one big party? Thank you, thank you, thank you! Love & blessings to all of us! reneemac: so good to see your smiling face for the 1st time! So happy you had a great trip to Las Vegas - it's a wonderful wacky place, huh? Glad you are up and about and getting back slowly to your life. MistyJ: so happy you are cruising just fine. sorry about the constipation - it happens to me with one pill! Same as you, the hydro makes me feel like I'm in a Freddie Kruger film, whole oxy makes me real mellow and pain free. Gotta find what works for you, and good to taper off. Have you tried flax seed meal? It works really well, and senna combined with fiber like flax or bran does great. Just have to drink lots and lots of water to bulk up the fiber. Psyllium seed based products are good, too, so I just might to stock up. They say my surgery will be eight hrs.  Laurie08:Oh girl, I'm holding good strength and healing thoughts for you as your date nears. One Dr. said to take a valium the night before and then again the morning of to be relaxed and you will also require less anesthesia the more relaxed you are. Am gonna ask for it myself. You'll do great, as you have all these sisters who have gone before you, preparing the path.  lizzymack1: Hi, I hope you find some relief to your situation. Bravo for making it through the surgery and now in the healing phase. Not an overreaction! It's your body talking to you. Glad you got some mental relief on this board. jblcsw10: I would be nervous, too, as you are going another route. Good you are surrounded and cared for by family, and that you will be close to the hospital. You can always go back. I asked my BC about paravert. blocks Thurs. and she said they did them all the time when she was in school, but not in practice. I asked my new PS about them Friday and he said he uses a frontal block, and that the Dr. administering ParaV.must be expert in it, as is your case. I'm positive that your Dr.s & hospital have their techniques down pat, and that you will do quite well, as the other women on this board have, plus, you'll sleep way better not being interrupted by nurses 24/7! Will be praying for you and holding you in my thoughts come Monday. That's so nice your mom gave you your dad's shirt, and you had a sweet party. It's good to grieve, then move on. I'll wear one of my dad's cowboy or Hawaiian shirts afterwards. He died three yrs. ago come July 14, so will be with me in spirit. speech529: hello! what type of surgery are you having? so glad your dad will be there. and your mom in spirit, too. webstermom & joystars: here's to you for making it through! hope you are both resting peacefully and rejoicing that you are on the other side and DONE! Ducki: Sad to hear of all of your DXs. I, too keep think of all the normal things that will be put aside after surgery for a while. Have so much inspiration from the ones who went before. Keep the faith! almagetty: How are you doing? Still writing here, so you must be healing well and getting better everyday.  Love to All, Melissa, aka orchidgal ",

      "Content": "Jun 3, 2010 03:12AM - edited Jun 3, 2010 03:13AM by orchidgal Hi Ladies, This is my first post. I have a likely permanent yet currently tentative surgery date set for June 21: BMX, SNB x2, TEs. My DX is L. Breast: DCIS Multicentric,  R. Breast: ADH, DCIS, LCIS, Tubular C. Pathology is all good, that is, as good as you would want it to be. ER, PR + BRCA 1 & 2, Neg. Have already had Mammo & Ultra, bi-lat core needle biopsies, R. surgical excision biopsy, MRI. Now the surgeon I'm choosing wants to do an outpatient surgery before MX: a subareolar disc resection to determine whether the nipples can be saved or not before surgery. Has anyone ever heard of this? I will meet the PS she works with a lot and recommended on Monday. My brother died by suicide 6 wks. before my DX. He was my last relative, so it was a very difficult few weeks of meltdowns, sleepless nights. I'm feeling more positive and ready to move forward. Not sure who will be there to help me, but I do have friends. The hardest part for me is asking/accepting help as I am usually the one helping others. Deep gratitude for this website and to all of you who are posting here. I don't feel so alone  knowing we are all in this together.  Sending blessings and prayers to you all.",

Rest well and hope it is easier than you thought. Laurie08: Can relate to how you feel stressing on the aftermath of not being able to do all the things you do. Keep hearing people who've been through it say that patience is the best thing to cultivate as well as being in the moment. Working on that today, preparing . . . Getty: Thanks for the wise words. Hope we all have a good weekend. Summer Solstice and all. Update on me: Got the path reports from my double lumectomy yesterday, Friday - the nipples can't be saved as there is DCIS, LDIC, ADH, etc. all through each. Cried and felt so sad, as this gen. anesthesia threw me for a loop - still not right from it, but at least a redeeming factor is the incision won't be across my breasts now that they can use the nipple opening. Bye bye nips! Hello one more surgery. Also, the plastic surgeon's office called to say she'll be away two days after surgery so am trying to sort out why she won't agree to have another plastic on call for her. She says the onc. breast surgeon can do it, but the onc. said she should have another plastic as back up. Next week will work on resolving this. Any suggestions, comments on this? Went to Costco after the path report, teary eyed, and bought a nice microplush plush body pillow and a microplush throw. The pillow for my bed after surgery, the throw to take to the hospital to stay cozy, as I'll be there for three days. Since the doc  will be away, it's mandatory. Have a great weekend everybody.

My  mom died of BC, and there are so many women I know, including my mom, who had lumpectomies and rads, then the BC came back and reconstruction was hard to do because of rad damaged skin. Plus going through treatment again. I was never offered the wait and see, as my three opinions all think there might be more in there. I hate to lose my breasts, but want to live without the stress of wondering and getting more painful checkup, etc. It's a tough one, and took me several months of intense research and seeing many doctors to choose this. Make your choice then move forward and don't look back. All the best. Melissa ",

      "Content": "Jul 3, 2010 08:42PM - edited Jul 3, 2010 08:50PM by orchidgal Hi July Ladies, I haven't been posting lately, but am reading your posts. I was originally to have surgery in late June, and it got changed to July 22, so that's why I am still on the June Mastectomy, as well as the July Mastectomy forum I started. A foot in each month, so to speak! So I just got plain tired out after a bi-lat. lumpectomy I had on the 15th of June. Still very sore and a little wiped out, so don't have much to say right now, though I am with you in spirit and know you are leading the way that I will follow after July 22. Meltdowns interspersed with good days. Thanks for all of your info. And congrats on all the milestones and celebrations, and visits with friends and family you are having. I guess the worst part is anticipating the surgery, and I've been doing that for over two months now, and still three weeks to go - yikes! Was DX'd April 20! Am in the process of getting things ready at my apt. for post surgery. Got a body pillow, a soft, poly blanket for the hospital and then for home, and a friend who had BC gave me her two large size stretchy, soft cammies (I can step into them) with the drain bags and puffy fillers. next purchase is a wedge pillow to sleep on. I am also a side & stomach sleeper, so this will be an adjustment, for sure. Plus the American Cancer Society sent me two cute, little pillows for underneath each arm. And I have a couple lanyards from back stage passes at concerts ready to those blasted drains. Am single, 55, no kids, currently not in a \"relationship,\" and all of my family members have passed away. I am fortunate to have good friends and a couple of neighbors who will take turns taking care of and helping me in the hospital and at home. Have never stayed over in a hospital, so am scared, yet building the courage to march right in there and get this over with. I was so enthusiastic on this June forum initially, but now emotionally & psychically feel rather burned out. Excuse me for not being more supportive right now. I do hold good thoughts and pray for each and every one of you as your healing process continues. I'm glad we have these monthly mastectomy groups, and know we will all get through this safely, soon, and heal well.  That is my wish for us all. melissa orchidgal ",

And am glad to hear you are all making your way through the healing parts, slowly yet surely. Wanted to say re TEs, I asked which ones my PS will be using and he said Siltex low heigth 7100s. I couldn't find them online, so I asked his assistant. She said they were brand new ones that have \"tabs\" to suture them down so they don't migrate! Re the green tea, you can buy a bottle of green tea extract with \"concentrated polyphenols,\" and just squirt it into your mouth or in a glass of water or a cup of herbal tea. It is decaffienated, too! An excellent hi-dose anti-inflammatory bromelain supplement is by Karuna, called Bromezyme 2400, it is super potency. I'm taking about 6-9 a day. Also, Thorne buffered C, you can take as much as you can up to bowel tolerance. Thorne Medi-Clear is an anti-infammatory Super MultiVitamin MIneral Amino Acid & More powder you can buy online. Pronogynol is a proanthocyandins supplement made from grapefruit seed extract, standardized, for reduced infections and increased immunity. Oncoplex ES is a concenttrated broccoli seed extract. Curcumin is also a potent anti-cancer plant you can buy in capsules. BRM 4 has triple effect NK (killer cell) activity. Also, R-Lipoic or L-Lipoic Acid, & tocotrienols. Uzzi Reiss has a wonderful book called The Natural Superwoman that outlines this stuff and more. Just a few things to consider when putting together a natural yet potent program to prevent BC from coming back. And yes, organic everything and healthy oils, raw, organic, unfiltered olive is best, - no canola, safflower, soy oils, please. Now to sleep! Take care everyone!",

Ducki & Marm, patience and good luck with your continued treatments, Speech, hope you get to deep relaxation at the yoga retreat - wish I could join you. Hi Joystars & Robin... Am still resting a lot, wishing I could do more, off drugs, walking a bit each day, hurt like heck when I tried to ift something heavy, move a bookcase, OUCH!! -so learned my lesson. My TEs are half size so not up on my chest, but after one fill so far of 50cc each they are about the size I was before surgery, (170cc each) but w/ projection. Doc set exchange date for Dec. 7,and will get at least one more fill, next one is Wednesday. PT going well, great range of movement, yet so tired of sleeping on back,  surrounded by pillows, so uncomfortable, tight back, neck muscles, I guess a small price to pay for replacement breasts; Barbie breasts are okay for now, look fine in clothing, yet so uncomfortabel and painful at times.

It seems I'm going through some post-mastectomy \"feeling a bit down\" time, & I guess that's normal. Have had lots of good results from deep tissue massage, physical therapy, stretching, and self massage w/ oil. One PT suggested using a vibrator on the sore parts and I did it last night and got good results. Have had some cording (piano wire!) underneath breasts and on one side underarm where they took three nodes, but very slight. They had me buy and wear a lymphedma sleeve on that side when I took a weekend trip via airplane. Have had no swelling so it's okay, just to be safe. Got my sleeve in leopard skin print and got a few compliments from people who didn't know any better! ;~) Take care everyone, holding good thoughts for us. xoxo ",

Friends ask how I'm doing and some admit they can't imagine all I've been through, and one can't unless you've gone through it So grateful that we can share our feelings in the raw here. Sorry Jeanne, you are feeling down. Don't know of any books, yet going to a group, if there are any in your area helps. I go to a cancer group and everyone is so supportive. Robin, I lol'd at seeing \"chesticles\" - an apt description my friend! Glad you are progressing and things are getting better. Laurie, it sounds like you could use some help. Is there anyone you can ask to help out at times? It must be hard being younger and wanting to dance all night and feel okay afterwards. Am so sorry, yet know you will get your energy back, and hope you get some sleep soon - that's most important to feeling good. I guess taking it slower, if possible can help you feel better. I can't imagine all the tasks you have on hand now. Feel free to vent any time as Getty said, we are here for you and support you getting through this, and we know how hard it can be at times. Ducki, hang in there, we'll get through this.  Am wondering how much recovery time there is after exchange surgery. Realized I hadn't asked questions of my PS on this, and read some today on EC thread. Didn't know you would have drains afterwards - drains - again? Oh well, getting closer, so guess it's time to look into it, and make an inquiry of the doc. Have to have fat grafting as the BC took lots of fat from my side that had a little IBC. Not wanting lipo, but guess that goes with the territory. Getty, you had lipo for fat grafting, didn't you? How was that? Are you feeling tip top now? Feeling a bit overwhelmed anticipating another surgery. Have had four already and I know some of you have had many more, plus chemo, rads, etc. Wish we could click on the \"refresh\" button and erase the memories of those treatments and surgery to start anew from where we are now.",

It is such a confirmation of your intuition and decision to go ahead, as some of us didn't know if our condition merited such a big operation. This will definitely boost your immune system having this knowledge. And getting more reconstrucion will probably feel better in April after some time has passed. Time is our friend here! LG: Sorry to hear of your infection. Sounds like the antibiotics are taking care of it. Glad you posted the Darvocet info. Saw that today. It makes me so mad that they allow so many dangerous drugs for us then only take them away years after so much damage has been done I remember my first breast biopsy in '97 for a cyst. They gave me Darvocet. I took one and felt so ill in my gut from it I threw the rest away and went cold turkey through the pain. Renee: that would upset me, too, to hear my PS get confused. But then they are doing so many surgeries all the time. Your surgery is just a few days before mine on the 7th, so keeping good thoughts for us. My PS said it will be a four hour surgery, so I've been taken aback these past few days thinking it was only gonna be two or so. But I know he will do a great job, and that's what counts. So sad to hear that your vacation got canceled. Getty: I'm so excited about your nipple, and can see you are in the honeymoon stage, checking to see if it still there. What a miracle of modern medicine that they can fully reconstruct our parts. Is your foam removed, yet? How do you camoflauge it in your clothes? Laurie: I\"m so GLAD you brought up this mindlessness thing. I have it too, and have been wondering why as I'm usually pretty sharp, and have put myself on a regime many years ago for mental clarity with diet, exercise & supplements, smart nutrients. Now I feel like I am partially senile! Renee, I have the same thing like forgetting the name of a common object, or someone's name. Have two cooking classes scheduled for the new year, so hope I don't blow it in front of my students! I  agree with Getty that all the stress, meds, and anesthesia we've been subjected to takes its toll, and want to believe that in a year or less our minds will clear up. Having chemo, rads, or post surgery hormone therpay only adds to this, so hope you find the right thing to do for those hot flashes, Renee. Friends keep reminding me that gen. anesthesia really gets our mind numbed out for a while. I figure since I've had three surgeries while being under, not counting that horribly painful stereotactic core needle biopsy, that so far in the last  seven months I've been under general anesthetic for at least ten hours. In a couple of weeks there will before more hours to add to that. I guess as strong as these drugs are, (hello - Morphine!) plus the stress on so many levels we aren't even aware of all adds up to having brain freeze. LG: I agree that the Valium does do a big number on our brains, although it is sort of necessary going through recon. Yesterday I went to pick up my surgery meds at the pharmacy, and didn't realize they'd also called in for Valium for me. I bought it, then saw when I got home that I still have a lot, and since I get name brand they were $100. The pharmacy wouldn't take them back, so I have some very expensive pills that I won't be taking, and attribute this to my brain being so numb. Normally I would be on top of it for something like this. My plan is to do a lot more aerobic exercise, hiking up hills is my fav, and maybe that will renew the blood flow and promote better circulation, especially after all these hours laying around and in bed! Let me know if anyone has anhymore ideas on this. Sorry you guys are experiencing this, too, yet glad I'm not alone!",

Renee: So sorry to hear of your infection and disappointment with your foob. The meds will take care of the infection, though, and I'm sure in time the foob will transform and look much better as this is so early yet. Sounds like you are in good hands with your PS and DH. Laurie: It's true, this surgery is so much easier than the BMX. Sure, there is soreness, and in my case, drains, but it is so much easier, no hospital stay, less drugs, easier to move, and soft, squishy breasts. Expect about 70% less trauma than the BMX. I took off all the cotton batting and ace bandage around my torso at 4:30 a.m. and put on a mastectomy bra I had bought but never used as the hospital had given me one. You'll be thrilled to get those TEs out.  Thanks Jane for the shout out. We've all come a long way. I\"m proud of us all...  Getty: so glad your check up went well. I saw my BS last week and will again in six months. Whew. We're all okay now...",

It must be so sore from all the work they did, but I'm sure it will look wonderful soon. And that it is nerve racking not knowing exaclty what to expect! At least it is only on one side. Look forward to marking your progress.Hope you feel better and better soon. Last time I checked in with you from the wilds of New Mexico. My road trip was wonderful in so many ways. I did get a toothache in Taos, partly due to the elevation and barometric pressure, and by the time I got back to LA I was in howlng pain, and my dentist sent me right away to the oral surgeon and they pulled the tooth! And then put in a cadaver bone graft to grow back bone so I can get an implant in three months time. So weird, now I have cadaver tissue in two (three!) places, and soon will have three implants! Think that the last couple of months have been tough on me as I am still not working and have had time to mull over everything that has occurred this year, including my brother's suicide this past March. So taking the road trip helped sort things out a bit. Am excited about exchange surgery coming up 12/7, and hope to get some semblence of my life back in the new year.  Had some dry injections today in my teres minor muscles due to the unending pain and soreness in those muscles ever since BMX, esp. on the left side. PS said it was due to SNB and the repair he did. The dr. who injected is a facial pain specialist, and she's brilliant. It may just have gotten rid of that soreness for good. I hope. Hope everyone is hanging in there and doing well.",

I also packed my nostrils with Polysporin the night beore. No problemo, as they say here in LA. Not sure whht your doctor says, but mine had me take valium the night before, then again at the hospital while waiting to go to OR. It reallty helps be calm so you need less anesthesia.

Met the PS yesterday, and she is wonderful, but the nitty gritty of it all hit me, and I got scared. Got up early and fast-walked three miles to the ocean and back. Feeling so shaky and not wanting to eat. Don't have a surgery date yet, and being single living alone and having devoted, supportive friends who have complicated lives, am not sure who will be able to stay with me in hospital and afterwards. Now, connecting with you gals here I feel better and have faith that we all will get through it. And those of us in the waiting room will be fine once we've our surgery. The assistant to the BS said today my surgery would take six hours. Three for the BS and three for the PS. For BMX & SND w/ TEs. How does this sound to what yours has told you, or how long your operation lasted? mistyj: my breast aren't perfect. Have had dozens of cyst aspirated, some got infected, had a surgery to remove on troublesome cyst, they were painful, swollen & hot before each period, but this all subsided after menopause, so I though I was free of any more trouble. The \"perfect\" part is that the PSs measured and I have zero slope, and they are small, nymph-like symmetrical breasts. Not perfect in other ways though. Still cystic, and after all these recent biopsies, painful. jsmiley: We're with you, and it's true, it seems that everyone who has gone before us says it is normal and after surgery will be so much better! Do you have any relaxation or guided visualization recordings to listen to? I have one I used before called Prepare for Surgery/Heal Faster by Peggy Huddleston. It really works. That is, if you use it! reneemac, almagetty & maramalade: Wow, you inspire me so much. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for writing your experiences here and giving us the knowledge that yes, there is an end to this anticipation anxiety! Praying for you all, sending lots of love and reaching out with cyber hugs, too. MRDRN had her surgery today, thinking of her and holding her in the light.",

I ask myself the same question, but then, we have breast cancer, so naturally our minds are working overtime trying to get a grip on it all. I had a mammo & ultrasound first, that led to stereotactic core needle biopsies. The radiologist was only going to do one side, but my PCP insisted on both. The L. showed DCIS multicentric, the R. ADH. I went to a BS who said she wanted to do a surgical biopsy on the R. as she thought more was there. That turned up DCIS, LDIC & tubular carcinoma! A second opinion BS had an MRI done, and that shows lots of DCIS on one side near the NAC, so now my 3rd BS, the one I've chosen, will do a \"lumpectomy\" actually a subareolar disk resection, on the 15th to see if they will keep the NAC during BMX surgery, the date of which hasn't been set. Who knows what that will turn up! Must say it was a shock to hear \"you have stage 0 cancer - , and you'll need to have a double mastectomy to take care of it without chemo or rads.\" What a mind trip! We will deal with it as we are dealing with it all so far, no matter what happens with the path after surgery. Are you having SNB also? I do hope you and your husband get some intimate time this weekend! Almagetty: thanks for speaking your truth and letting us know how you feel on all of this post surgery. Have seen two different versions of the film Alice in Wonderland, the recent one and the 1933 version. Somehow it seems all so familiar to be through the looking glass, and down the rabbit hole!  Marmalade: Congrats on a clear report - yea!!  stlcardsfan: hang in there. the 21st was my tent date, but now it seems not. still waiting.

Will you have SNB, too? Welcome Jane, this warm group of lovely ladies will hold you up and through your surgery. Sending greetings and best wishes to all the ladies who have already had surgery. Hope it's going well. Still don't have a date myself. They offered me June 29 today, but since the BS & PS are both going on vacation a few days later, I don't feel safe being left alone after this major surgery! So I declined, and now it looks like I'm getting bumped to July, after they've returned from their vacations. I requested July 19, so I guess I don't really belong here anymore, but will keep reading posts and replying if that's okay. It feels so safe here and very real! Am having surgery on June 15th, Tuesday. Subareolar disk resection. When I opened a letter from my insurance company that said \"partial mastectomy\" I freaked out. They will take approx. 2 cm from underneath each nipple to analyze whether they can be saved in the skin/nipple saving BMX that will take place next month. This will also allow for angiogenesis, too: new vascular growth to support the through thte nipple mastectomy & recon. next month. Will let you now how that goes. If they keep taking little bits at a time maybe it won't be such a shock to let these small breasts go. Bought two shirts at a thrift store for post surgery as I had no loose fitting button up tops. They look like new, and are really nice. Maybe now that BC is burning through my bank account I can find my fashionables at the thrift store like we did in high school. Walked over to the hospital today where I'll have my BMX. It is two blocks away. Went up to the onc. floor and they had closed a section to convert it into \"vip\" rooms - so LA - previously birthing rooms, so they are spacious. So then I went to the regular post surg. rooms, checked out the nurses station, and an empty room, trying to visualize waking up there. Flat screen tv! So much work to get a grip on this stuff. Listening to Bell Ruth Naparstek guided visualizations - really wonderful. Have a great weekend everybody! xo Melissa (Orchidgal)",

So many who've had lumectomies have it return, then after having rads, hard to recon. getting it out seems to be the best revenge! subareolar resection is to check to see if the nipples can be saved, and to stimulate vascular growth so when I have my bmx in July, there will be better blood supple, but mainly it is to find out if bc is under the nipps. apparently it's a new procedure some docs are doing these days. wish they were doing the snb today too, and get that out of the way. oh well, have a wonderful day everyone.",

Also used my other pillows to support arms, plus a body pillow for my legs to go over so your posture is comfortable being elevated at your upper body. It is a cozy nest and I still sleep that way. The American Cancer Society sent me two little mastectomy pillows to put under my arms - they were a god send, especially to use when in the car under the seatbelt. Didn't have any trouble expressing the drains. I just put my laptop on a pillow on my lap, but slept alot in the beginning so didn't use it that much. Also, straws to drink from are good. I splurged and ordered glass drinking straws. I had fresh juices diluted 50% with water, like apple pomegranate. Also got Netflix, but didn't read very much. You'll be sleeping alot. The note pad right near your bed is essential. I turned the caps of my pill bottles around the other way so they were no longer child proff, then wrote the initial on the inside of the cap with a black permanent parker, I for ibuprofen, V for valium, etc. That helped alot. I had a drain cami, but never wore it, Found that a lanyard worked best for me, and didnt need a stool for the shower, either. I wore the bra they put on me in the hospital. Having a couple of loose tops will be good. I usually wore stretchy work out pants each day. As for hair washing, washed just before I went in and braided it as it is long, so it wouldn't get tangled up. A week later I had it washed at a local salon. I dried it myself. They only charged me $8 becasue they have a special for BC patients. I didn't know until I asked, so you might ask around. It made it so much easier. The next week I washed it myself. One more thing that was nice that was suggested on this site is a very soft synthetic throw to take to the hospital. I loved the way it felt and also when I got home used it all the time and didn't get under the covers as I needed to move aorund easier in and out of bed. Your skin will be extra senstivie so soft fabrics are really good. All the best, I know you will get through it and will be so much happier when you are BC free. Best, Melissa",

I'm sad that you are revisiting BC, and glad you have your family and kids to be there for you. tory: Welcome, and sad to meet you under these circumstances, yet happy you've joined our group. The PS I'm going with uses crescent shaped TES, as I wanted to avoid the protruding upper pole, and have small breasts. Also, he fills in the dent left by SNB, and removes the fat pad in front of the underarms. He also doesn't cut the pecs, yet does do a neurectomy on them so they are \"quiet\" as they tend to \"jump\" a lot. Also takes more time between surgeries to avoid capsular contraction, and to let implants settle well before nip recon. Thanks for mentioning massage. Am wondering when it is okay to start getting the scars left from SNB & drains massaged. Does anyone know? I will ask to see the PT before surgery and ask and let everyone know if I get any info. Rose: Good for you to be in \"training\" for your surgery. I am too, and being a nutritional consultant, am maybe a bit overzealous, but it does work! Eating lots of veggies gives your body great immunity against infection, eliminating sugar & refined & gluten containing foods does this as well as reduce inflammation. Also quitting stimulants and alcohol helps your body require less anesthesia. I aim for 40-60 grams of protein a day. Also, I just bought a hard foam roller to lie on vertically, and do very slow snow angels to stretch out the pecs. You can also stretch them by placing your hand around back of you flat on the wall, then pulling you opposite shoulder back, and do both sides. A PT taught me this. Re SNB Dye: I asked my BS and she said she does it all after you are under. I'm sad to hear of anyone suffering needlessly with this procedure. Not sure why they differ so. I heard one reason is the equipment is in another room. I think it is all in the OR at my hospital. Clarity: I hope you are now resting peacefully, healing well, and feeling so good to be DONE! Hi DiDel: Thanks for injecting us with your positive spirit and kind words. It is so appreciated to be cheered on by those who have already gone through it. What I keep hearing over and over is the worst part is the anticipation (and the DRAINS) but I hope to be able to joke at least some of the time about the drains...DiDel, you can be our JULY Ladies mascot! zenith: Glad you were pro-active in asking for lidocaine and will spare yourself the shock. Many of us were taught as females not to speak up yet having BC demands it! Since I'm the List Lady, everybody let me know what you want put up or changed, and I'll take care of it.  Melissa / orchidgal ",

Catwood, I found a lightweight fluffy soft polyester blanket at Costco for about $12 that I will take to hospital to cover myself if it gets too cold. Welcome: youngmomof3, KatherineNaomi, peppercook - this list sure is growing fast! Hope you find some solace and support, warmth and love here - I know you will. We'll get through this together - the ladies of July. Clarity: so glad to hear you are getting some answers soon re your labs. I hope the doctor will also address your rash and make it go away.  Jsmiley: You are doing so well, and are an inspiration to us who have yet to get over. Keep up the good work and we'll be following you soon. Shawn: Thanks so much for the permission to let go. After all this it just got to me and today I saw the PS. He seemed like he was ready to fall asleep! Must get answers re: the pectoral major neurectomy he said he will perform. I am very active, and do weight training 3x a week, lots of push ups, etc. Not sure if the neurectomy will disable my pecs to that they atrophy, and/or I lose upper body strength. Anyone heard of this? Just want to put my attention of cleaning the apt. getting everything ready. Oh well... gonna turn in and try to sleep. Eileen: feel ya on everything your wrote - have had three bx and they did give more info so that the BS has been able to make proper decisions. Surprised at how much was revealed through these bxs. Not having a date really sucks! Hoping your date comes soon. Let me know and I'll put it up. Robin: so glad to hear you are going to private insurance =  yay! Now you will get a date and soon, I'm sure of it. YIPPEE! Sapphire: thanks for your kind words. It is lonely doing it on your own living alone. Enjoy living alone normally, but this BC really twists things up and around! Luckily I friends who are calling more often, making plans to meet up more often. Maybe BC is stimulating my social life for the good, in the long run! Glad your daughters and friends will help you out. I've got a a handful of good ones lined up and back ups too.  Incognito: Thanks for your support - did have a great weekend. We are all in this together and am so happy for those of us who have already gone as it gives a sense of relief that it's not so bad and the recovery is slow, but at least the pre-surgery anxiety is gone and there are other things to focus on.One of my biggest issues is not being abe to be active: work out, hike, walk, run on the beach, etc.for a couple of months. I guess accepting this will get me to a better mood. Deep gratitude to all of you, xox Melissa",

The oncological pharmacist at the Oncology Group I went to earlier in my DX gave me a recommendation letter from their oncologist to use medical marijuana. I decide to go to the MMJ pharmacy today to check it out. They registered me, but couldn't complete it, since it is Saturday, the doctor is out and didn't answer her page. So I didn't purchase any medications. But the young kid behind the counter was trying to help me figure out what to get for post-surgery. The onc. pharm said to use \"multiple modalites\" and cycle the narcs, MMJ, muscle relaxers and anti-inflammatories. The kid asked when my surgery was and I told him when and that it would be an eight hour operation. He said, \"Oh, something wonderful and fun, then?\" and I just looked at him and asked if he thought having a double amputation was great and fun. He didn't get it. I think he's been sampling the goods too much! Is anyone else planning on using or using MMJ? I hadn't planned on it, but they offered it to me. Seems like a good idea to try as suggested, the drinkable teas, and the edible goodies like the chocolates, cookies, etc. a a way to taper off narcs. They also had extra \"un-virgin\" olive oil! ",

And marmalade, thanks for letting us know that pain and rug burn stuff will go away sooner than we know! Ann, congrats on now being drain free! photobug: I'm regret hearing about the quick change of plans as you went into surgery. That is unacceptable in my book. I trust that the recon you are getting will work out well, though, and that the decision, although you had no part in that, is the best one for you. Am getting everything ready for my surgery on July 22, and am almost excited, having waited so long for this, but scared, as any normal person would be. Thanks you all for your continued support. xo Melissa",

I trust you and Clarity will be fine in your surgeries and the timing post chemo. What a time to worry about your folks. My brother died by suicide six week before I got my DX w/ BC. The double shock has been so hard to manage, but I'm doing better these days, limping instead of crawling ;~) We are strong women, and it's okay to cry when it happens, too. I had a few stressful days as I decide to not go with the PS I'd scheduled, so it was a quick change, and I just met the one I've chosen Friday. It will cost more $ but he does the surgery the way I had wanted it as per my research. Anyway, hope to forget about this for a day or two and enjoy the lovely weather!   Have a nice weekend everyone! ",

I saw three breast surgeons and they all said I have to have mastoctomies as the breast would be deformed otherwise. keep copies of all tests, pathology reports, etc. Take them to your all your doctors appts. Chemo is only used for invasive cancers, so perhaps you have early stage?  Have faith that you will have treament to get rid of the cancer and keep researching, and go to different doctors for opinions if you aren't sure what one doctor tells you.

I wake up everyday and look at them in the mirror, touch them and say, good-bye, thanks for the memories. Wish I had a boyfriend now who would help me say good-bye.;~) Clarity04: Thoughts and prayers to you as you prepare for your surgery - we will all be thinking of you and looking forward to our first post from you when you can write to us and tell us what the \"other side\" is like. Rose; I feel for you being torn between your job and the \"endless homework\" of having been DX w/ BC. How much time off will you be able to take? Are you getting recon, too?",

Good you are resting up, and hope you let go of thinking about the weight/wait. You'll probably lose it after surgery if you eat lots of soup. Sounds like a good choice to not have SNB. I'm choosing to have it on both sides as they found a small amount of tubular BC on one side, so although not likely to be invasive, it is stage one. The other side is so dense with DCIS that it will be done too. I work out with weights and am very healthy, so keeping a good thought for not having any complications from the surgery. My surgeon said she hasn't had one patient get LE from her SNBs. I hope you find a way to calm your mind. Been told that taking a valium the night before then the day of surgery helps a lot ;~) too. BIG HUGS and lots of prayers for a safe surgery and calm awakening tomorrow in recovery! We'll be waiting to hear from you when you are DONE - yay! I'm glad you're not entirely losing your breasts!

DONE Ladies: wow, you have come back so fast to tell us what your experience is like. So Happy to hear you are doing well.scrabblelady, calamtykel, clarity, zenith, regina, ann, photobug, catwood, lymphtherapist: you are all healing well it sounds like, managing pain, and sharing your good vibes with us, so thank you. zenith, I'm sorry about your node DX. ladyblevins, hope you are feeling as well as can be. ducki, glad you are coming along so well.  For those of you coming up, the count down is so hard sometimes! sespebadger, shawn, debpurple, youngmom, you're next. Prayers for a peaceful and distracted weekend hope you get a chance to unwind and laugh a bit. Kim, and all, I've been freaking out after having hit such a nice calm a week or so earlier.I don't think it is at all self-absorbed or narcissistic to mourn the loss, or feel bad, or cheated about losing your breasts. Whether or not they \"define\" you, or whether they are large, small, whatever, they are a part of you, and I too am sad to hear of you younger gals as I am 55, and have enjoyed my breasts for many years, but still feel young, and so do my breasts, they look great, and feel great. So sorry you are leaving them behind so soon in life. My hope is that they can rebuild some bionic ones in the near future that we can trade out for the silicon or whatever your choice may be. So this surgery & aftermath/healing/recon. process is a reckoning. With the DCIS, I also have gone round and round on that one, and they keep saying the only treatment to be sure is BMX, as I have it in both sides. You'd think there would be something they could do to treat Stage 0 BC without taking them away! We are fortunate to have such great health care at hand, and to have this forum. If not for this forum I would be so lost in this all. No matter how friends might want to be supportive, they cannot understand what it is like to have to go through this unless they've had it themselves. Even then, some are so stoic, they don't want to talk about it or express emotions. The most healthy way is to express it, let it out, say your truth and be heard, and accepted. We are doing this here. Thanks to you all for being here everyone, even those who don't ever reveal themselves. It is truly amazing how many July Ladies are appearing every day. ",

      "Content": "Jul 12, 2010 01:18AM - edited Jul 12, 2010 01:23AM by orchidgal Hi Ladies, Thinking and praying for those of you who are going got to have surgery tomorrow: sespebadger, debpurple & youngmom. May you find peace knowing your BC will be removed, and wake up in recovery with a smile, rest well, and come home soon. Shawn, Mary & sunnydaze, you're coming up this week, too, so BIG HUGS to all of you - sending (((good vibes))) your way. I know you'll do fine and come back to report. Can't wait to write a big DONE after all of your names! Regina, when I was in Arkansas in March I noticed they called MJ a \"narcotic\" on the news.So strange to see how much laws and attitudes vary from state to state, region to region! Hope you have your \"personal massager\" well hidden from the morality police...I would have corrected the PS on the spot, although I realize how vulnerable we all feel sitting there in a robe while they are fully dressed. They have no idea! A few people have suggested to me it's my chance to \"go big\" as I am small. This DX continues to teach me to cultivate patience and compassion everyday, what a spiritual boot camp BC can be. sespebadger: I have that booklet and a lot of others that ACS sent to me, along with two cute little pillows with tags on the cases, \"Made with Love by the Women of the Eastern Star\" that are to use under my arms after the BMX. Have been trying to make appts with the phys. therapy office and they are so booked they can only say they'll try to see me beforehand. I did speak with her and she said the most important thing is to not do any weight bearing at all in the beginning, or that could cause cording and scarring that are hard to make gone. She said the gently raising the arms to the sides, finger walking up walls, and arms out to front are okay, but no pushing. I'm sad to hear of your dad. My dad died three years ago, July 14, and we were very close. He was a veteran of Wll, Korea & Viet Nam, a large, strongman and it was so sad to see him get smaller and in pain. Am so happy he opened up to you. My dad's last words to me were \"I love you.\" Am glad you had as much time as possible with him.  My prayers and condolences are with you and your family. May your memories bring you warmth and consolation. Zenith, I'm so sorry to hear of your DX and impending chemo. I hope you do what sespebadger suggests and research so you can go into this phase of your treatment empowered and able to ask the right questions and feel like you are also a partner in the process. Hope you get released from hospital soon, and that your DH is there by your side until then to care for you. My friend said when he was in for a heart attack in the ICU that the nurse was ignoring him, so he used his cell phone to call the hospital, asked for the ICU, and got his nurse on the phone, and said please come in here. I'm looking at you right now! nkrun: wow, I'm surprised you have a surgery date and yet not sure what they will do. Am sheepish to admit I'm so glad there is someone to go after me. I was last of the June Ladies, then got changed to last of July, until you showed up! I was DX w/ DCIS on R at first, after a bi-lat. core needle biopsy, then had a surg. excision on one side that revealed more  on L, ADH, DCIS, LCIS, tubular carcinoma. Then another surgeon did a sub-areolar disk resection to see if the nipples could be saved, not. So now that all the avenues have been exhausted I'm having the BMX. Saw three different BSs & four PSs. With MX you ususally do not have to do rads or chemo, with lumpectomy, oftentimes they want you to do rads and/or chemo. If you have damaged skin from rads, then later require an MX, that skin is hard to work with if you also want recon. I hope you find out more. It's too bad your onc was out of line with you asking about MMJ. And your son is being a California boy, and I would be upset, although I did the same things at his age. And you would not be a hyprocrite to join him, although he probalby has no reason to have it, but at least he is quasi-legal now. Haven't smoke for ages, but I think when I get the paperwork finalized and can buy something, some of these \"edibles\" and \"drinkables\"  will be good. Heard about it from some little old ladies in a therpay group that it worked well for them. The pain from recon apparently merits \"multiple modalities,\" as the onc. pharmacist told me. She's the one who suggested she get a letter for me so I can get it. I, too have led a very healthy, active life, and am seeing this eight hour surgery coming up as a challenge. Am in \"training,\" exercising everyday, and eating an anti-inflammation diet w/ lots of protein, taking lots of supplements and listening to guided visualizations everyday, as well. You don't have to be perfect forever, but it seems that leading up to and healing after such surgery is a good time to be really, really good. Then practice moderation with a very healthy baseline later, and I'm sure you'll be fine.",

I'm getting ready for  my surgery this Thursday, at last, having been DX'd in April! It seems like the journey to BMX w/ TEs has been so very long and interesting, lots of ups and downs, many doctors, meltdowns, a couple fender benders, four parking tickets, a couple of surgeries, and connecting with so many friends and strangers who are there for me - finally, now, I feel at peace!

Ditto in_cognito's advice. I had hospice care when my mother was dying of BC in '92. I did it alone, with a little help from a couple of her friends, burt hospice set me up with everything I needed and I had a 24 hr. nurse to call whenever I wanted to. My mom did not want to go back to the hospital and she died peacefully at home. It is so much more sane and humane. Best of luck with it all.",

The doctor are so wonderful, as are the nurses and the staff, and the hospital is like a boutique hotel! Woke up in recovery with no nausea, but the nurses were changing shifts and although she set up my pain pump, forgot to give me the button, so I had a bit of intensity lasting a small while being transferred to my bed in my room. It was so dreamy being on that morphine, and now I am on oral meds. I choose \"perconone\" which has no fluff or filler, just oxycodone, and not salicylic acid or tylenol, just pure, plain, synthetic morphine, plus valium, the great muscle relaxer. The nurse are dolls, yet they seem to leave it up to me to ask for the pain drugs so sometimes I fall alseep and wake up with an owie, sore like I did one thousand push ups,nothing unmanageable. I'm so surprised at how good I feel and all my guests say I look great and have good color, etc. I can see some breast mounds, too. Doc said he filled them 50 %. Have a tight bra on, and will see the PS Tuesday to check up on that. Get the path report Thursday at the BS office. She told my friend that the nodes taken, I think 2 on each side, seemed good and pliable, soft. Hope for the best there.  Thank you for all of your loving and kind words, well wishes and encouragement. You're all right - this was the easiest part so far! Having never been in the hospital it is actually fun and delightful in some ways - large plasma TV, not bad food, either. A nurse gave me a little shower, sponge bath and & foot massage today. Am rambling as these drugs are wont to make one do, so will close now wishing you all the best. Without this board I would have felt so lost! (((BIG HUGS))) to ALL. xoxox orchidgal ",

I'm doing fine, just resting a lot and having various friends taking care of me and dropping by to visit (most of the time I forget they came by!) seems like it takes up so much time! I miss hanging out with you gals, my bc.org pals, discussing the nitty gritty of it all. I shall return and be more involved. Please send me a PM if someow I missed your mention of having finished your surgery, or you want me to post you here having already had surgery in July,  so I can write you in as DONE!. Got my path report today and I am 0/4, so absolutley cancer free. So relieved. Sending lots of love and letting you know I am doing fine, it just seems to take so much time answering the phone, eating meals, measuring drain fluids, charting meds, dr. appts., Thank goodness my dear friend who was here from SF made up lots of healthy, tasty food that is at hand in fridge & freezer. I trust that the days and nights will open up when I have all that time some of you seem to have to watch tv, etc. Do take care and know my thoughts and prayers are with you. Can't wait to compare notes on all this \"after surgery\" stuff. So far I am doing well. I guess since the TEs are sewn onto my chest wall they don't move around, so minimal pain. They are already filled 50% and look great - It's hard to believe it, but true. And they say the real thing will be incredible - bring it on, baby! Great range of motion, but am laying low, not exercising except for small amounts of walking around the apt doing little things, and taking short slow walks. Seriously Constipated! so it looks like it's gonna take the big guns - already tried lots of stool softener & magnesium caps - now it will have to be COLACE - to get things moving. Hope you are all doing as well as can be expected and then some. Much love & big hugs, Melissa aka orchidgal",

I also think it is good to have the surgery after the drs. return from vacation. That's why I passed on the 6/29 date they offered me because the PS was leaving for a trip in 7/1 and then the BS leaving on 7/5, so that means the first week they'd both be gone for three days. For having a six hour major surgery I don't feel good doing it that way. Eileen1955, do let us  know when you know and we'll all line up and cheer each other on.....it does sound good to wait until your grandchild is born.",

We were able to set up her schedule with the breast surgeon and hospital for July 22. Yeah. Not really. But it's good to know there's a point of departure from this anticipatory purgatory of waiting to find out when I get to go under and get rid of the several different types of early cancer that live in my breasts now. At least it will happen when they've both returned from vacation, and the appt. is the first one of the day, at 7 am. That means showing up there at 5 am. And being finished by probably midday. This gives me time to get my life a bit more organized and to also get serious about \"training\" for surgery.She took photos of my breast from every angle imaginable. So possibly she will create a reasonable facsimile out of what is left behind after the breast surgeon does her thing. Ordered a special front zip sports bra as recommended by plastic surgeon. Both my surgeons are young, smart, beautiful, and compassionate. What more can you ask for in a situation like this? Tomorrow I take the breast surgeon on a test run with this subareolar disk resection, and besides this procedure revealing what is under those nipples, and if they can be saved, it will also promote vascular growth that, come July 22, will have spread nicely to insure a better chance at blood supply to the skin remaining after this upcoming skin-saving, possibly nipple/areola saving mastectomy. Whew!",

I know you'll get through it as so many others have. One gal on here said that her pastor told her to just keep sight of what's right in front of you. It helps me to do that, stay focused, keep it moving and don't get hung up anywhere, and not expect to solve everything at once. Baby steps. I've posted your data. calamtykel: wow, what a story! sorry you got the wrong drugs! what do you use instead of morphine? the last anesthesia I had was for a double lumpectomy in June and didn't feel okay waking up, but never threw up, just felt cranky and fuzzy. other times felt great. Am sure they use a different cocktail per the occasion. Maybe I'll get lucky and get a \"margarita\" like you did! love the time warp/no memory part, though. my friend said she would push the pain pump for me when I'm sleeping! Rose: Glad you ddi fine coming out of it. To each their own, huh? My arrival time to check in is 5 am - surgery commences at 7 am, & goes on for about 8 hours. I passed up another date as it started at 2:30,and I feel better having them first thing in the morning fresh. . .

Now thirteen days out of surgery, and still have bursts of energy, then get tired soon after doing a few things. Not driving yet as still on meds, but trying to get off meds. It hurts though, so that is the \"rub\" huh? Have TEs, and  not twitching, as my PS did a neurectomy of the pecotralis major, actually he severed three or so on each side, but still feel the \"iron bra that is too tight\" feeling and aches and pains that come and go. Had a pre-op PT eval. and am waiting for the PS to get back from vacation to sign me on to actually go get the PT. Meanwhile tomorrow will get a lymphatic massage that apparently comes with the surgery, one free one, that is. The two drains are out, thankfully. Am not feeling weeping, but have had friends staying all this time, taking turns driving me and cooking, etc, so little alone time which I'm starting to miss, but sure grateful for the  friends helping me.When the friend who is here now leaves Sunday then I will be on my own and I plan to be off the meds that prevent driving so I can be self-sufficient again. Finding that a three hour nap in the afternoon does wonders. Don't have a recliner, but created one in my bed with a body pillow on one side, and a wedge, then lots of other pillows. Being a tummy sleeper it's actually not bad, and no back ache. I have good range of movement but not sure if I should be doing any exercises now or not. I can easily run my fingers all the way up the wall and hold my arms out straight forward and out to the sides. Takes effort to stand up straight and pull shoulders back. Had hair washed at a salon a week ago, now I can do it myself tomorrow maybe in the shower. Hope you guys are hanging in there. It seems that maybe the two or three week let down feelings may be a combo of people thinking you're okay now and the attention becoming less, also feeling more pain as you are taking less drugs and the numbness i wearing off. Not to mention the reality that your breasts are gone and in their place area  couple of rock hard plastic bags! I feel grateful to be able to have recon, so not complaining, but the reality is setting in and I find myself feeling a bit strange walking around in public holding my chest up but not \"leading\" with nipples, as they are gone. Am not in a relationship, so don't know what that would be like to introduce a mate to the new situation, or in the future when I do have a boyfriend again,but that is not really something I'm thinking of these days. Want to get stretched and strong again and look forward to the exchange which will be for me around December. Not allowed to do exercise until three weeks, then it's light aerobic only, then at around six weeks back to regular exercise - seems like forever! Sending love & hugs to all. orchidgal, ~Melissa",
