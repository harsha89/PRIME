My question is difference between hypoechoic and isoechoic; also what \"questionable through transmission means\". When measuring a tumor does it go LxWxH? Any help would be appreciated.

First on ultrasound I had two weeks ago; they found two areas of interest in left breast (1130&12); but the Mammo didn't pick up anything and the MRI only stated that there was diffuse and stippled background which has increased since last MRI. They also stated about a previously obscured mass on the right breast; but for the last two years there has been no mention of any mass or non mass enhancement on this side. Should I be asking in further about this? Didn't state size or anything. Log in to post a reply",
