Her stats:  42 years old invasive ductal carcinoma;  single 2.1 cm tumor in right breast; 6/18 axillary nodes positive for cancer, no extranodal involvement or attachment to each other or fixtures; Grade 2; er/pr positive; HER2 negative; lymphatic and vascular invasion She has had a double mast (with reconstruction); underwent 6 cycles of TAC chemo and is beginning 33 radiation treatments. Bone scan and PET scan were clear (post surgery and prior to chemo). We asked about the next scans and the oncologist said no bone scan or PET scan for a year. Huh? Reasoning is that if there are symptoms we would do a test, otherwise wait a year. Studies show that when symptoms present and if cancer found you only gain on average 2 months then if you were doing frequent testing. This sounds like a cost-saving scenario. Isn't risk the greatest during the first 2 years? Or first 5 years? And if, God forbid, cancer does show up somewhere else isn't it best to get to fighting it as soon as possible? I had envisioned a test every 3-4 months post-treatment. What is your opinion? Log in to post a reply",
