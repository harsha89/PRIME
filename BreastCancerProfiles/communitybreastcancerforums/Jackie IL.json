    "Content": "Jackie-IL wrote: I received a call from the Dr. that they found a 2mm mass in my right lower breast.  There is \"something\" in the upper breast that they can't see clearly.  I have an appointment  for a nother mam with the radiologist present and and ultrasound to follow. In 1998 I received a call from my OB that I had a tumor in my uterous and the shadow around it indicated ovarian cancer.  After the tumor was removed the results were negative, no cancer. Can I be lucky twice?  Can I defy the odds of escaping cancer twice?  The odd thing about it is I have colon cancer in my immediate family.   I am thankful for this web site, for information and inspiration.  Bless you all.
