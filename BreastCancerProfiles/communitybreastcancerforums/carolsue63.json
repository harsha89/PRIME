Glad to hear you're responding so well to this treatment! That's awesome news!! So you're just on h/p now, without the taxol, right? Did the worst s/e's ease up after stopping the taxol?  I was on TCH 4 years ago, and TCH+P now. The s/e's haven't seemed too much different with the addition of Perjeta. I had diarrhea with terrible abdominal cramping both times, so hard to say if the Perjeta has anything to do with it when I know the Taxotere is perfectly capable of making me that miserable all by itself. Chemo has been much harder overall this time, but I blame that on the fact that I was SOOO, SOOOO, sick going into into it this time. Lung mets with pleural effusion, I had been coughing and short of breath for months, and was getting sicker by the day leading up to the time I started chemo. Thinking I also had a bad case of reflux, my regular doctor had me try Prilosec, and I had a terrible time with it. It completely killed my appetite -- I think by stopping the acid production in my stomach, food wasn't moving out, so I had this constant feeling of fullness and could barely force myself to eat. In the 2 weeks prior to finally getting the cancer diagnosis, I dropped 15 pounds in 2 weeks! And I was at a healthy weight to begin with. Luckily, I was at the high end of my healthy range, so I just ended up toward the low end of the range, but still a healthy weight. So I got the phone call that it was cancer on a Wednesday, met with my MO on Friday, had my port put in on Monday, and started chemo on Wednesday. Talk about a whirlwind! That first infusion was ROUGH. Had to stop the Perjeta for 30 minutes because my O2 sats dropped into the 80's. They put me on oxygen and started back again. Then I started having breathing problems again with the very last med (Carboplatin). Doc decided I'd had enough and called it a day. They ordered an oxygen unit for my home, and I was on oxygen 24/7 for several weeks. Those first couple of rounds of chemo made such a HUGE difference in my breathing symptoms, and I was able to go off the oxygen completely. As tough as chemo has been this time, it's been such a blessing to actually feel my health improve with each treatment. It's been a nice trade off for the yucky side effects. Round 5 was yesterday, so I just have one more to go in 3 weeks, then on to maintenance! Sincerely hoping it will be H+P and that the s/e's will be manageable. I think I'll be getting Arimidex, too, so I won't know what to blame. LOL  Sorry to have rambled on so long. Blame the steroids. LOL  Thanks again for your response -- it gives me a lot of hope :-) Carol",

I'm so happy for you getting to NED. That's awesome!  I just got the results from my first PET scan since starting treatment (after round 4), and while not NED, they said it was dramatic improvement. The lung infiltrates were nearly completely resolved, with just a little bit remaining in the upper lobes. The pleural effusion on the left size reduced in size by 50%, and the one on the right was completely gone. A lymph node reduced from 3x2 cm to 2x1 cm (normal size) and it didn't \"light up\" on the PET. The bone spots I had were stable on the CT part of the scan, which my MO said was good -- it can be hard to make those go away, and they weren't lighting up on the PET, either. NOTHING lit up at all!  So overall, we're very happy with the results so far. Hope to see even more good news next time!",

I had to be on oxygen 24/7, but only for a short time (about 6 weeks). I had a unit in my home that kept the O2 flowing constantly, but for when I was out and about, I had a small tank that I could carry in a pack over my shoulder. Instead of running constantly, it somehow sensed my breathing and would push a \"burst\" of O2 whenever I inhaled. It worked great and allowed me quite a bit more freedom. Do you have any support groups or volunteer organizations in your area? I belong to a BC support group, and the women who have completed treatment are very often helping out the women who are going through treatment with transportation and such. Our local hospital also has a list of organizations with volunteers who will help out with transportation. I wasn't able to drive myself anywhere for several months, and having to ask people for help was very uncomfortable at first. It took me a while to get past the idea that I was being a burden to people. People LIKE to be helpful, and they so often don't know what they can do to help. So I tried to start seeing it in a different way. I wasn't being a burden -- I was somebody's opportunity to do a good deed. I eventually got to the point I'd just post on Facebook: \"Hey -- I need a ride to a doctor's appointment Tuesday at 9:00. Anybody available?\"  I actually had a wonderful friendship develop out of me needing a ride. (Somebody that had previously been just an acquaintance.)  ",

My PET scan is scheduled for the 1st week of April, and I hope to hear that after I finish with the TCH I'll be going to Herceptin + Perjeta like you. Since I've been getting Neulasta shots since my first round of chemo, I haven't been quite as careful about avoiding crowds as I was in 2010. I attended my son's band concert, and I go to church when I feel up to it. My son even had a stomach bug last month, and I didn't catch it. Of course I let my husband do the cleaning up part. But when an 11-year-old doesn't feel good, he still needs mom for snuggles, and how can you say no to that? Once I'm done with chemo and just getting H+P, I plan to go back to my normal activities again. At least I assume Perjeta is similar to Herceptin in that respect. I'll ask one of the nurses about it when I go for chemo tomorrow and see if I can get a more definitive answer than the one you got. Congratulations on finishing your chemo!

(I'm a big believer in the power of prayer.) I got out of bed at 5:30 and found my second wind. I'd had doubts that I'd be able to even finish the survivor lap as weak as my legs had been feeling during chemo, but I ended up walking 3 laps!! One of the ladies from my support group was complaining how out of breath she was feeling and for some odd reason, that gave me such a boost. Here I am, Stage 4 with lung mets, just finished my sixth round of chemo, and I want to keep walking!! It made me hopeful that some of my breathing issues aren't from the lung mets -- they've been blasted to smithereens! -- but from all the chemicals pumped into my body and from being so out of shape. I've started wearing my Fitbit again, and yesterday I walked 6,000 steps. That's the most I've walked since early October!! Here's a picture from last night -- I'm the tall baldie holding the banner.

Spent all Fall with a cough that I thought for the longest time was just a symptom of my ragweed allergies. But when the ragweed finally went away, my cough got progressively worse. And worse. And worse. Finally had a PET scan that showed fluid around my left lung. Had thoracentesis done, and they found cancer cells in the fluid. I started chemo January 15th. TCH + Perjeta. My first infusion was pretty rough, partly because I was in such bad shape going into it, plus being 2 days post surgery (had port put in) didn't help. Started having trouble breathing with the first drug (Perjeta). They put me on oxygen and had to stop the infusion for a while. Managed to finish up the rest of the drugs, but it ended up being an all day affair. Well, almost all the drugs. About halfway through the Carboplatin I started having trouble breathing again, and my oncologist decided I'd had enough for that day. The good news is that I saw almost immediate improvement in my cough after that 1st chemo treatment. And once I got through the nasty S/E's, I was actually feeling much better than I had been in quite some time. My 2nd treatment on February 5th went much better. No problems at all with the infusion, and again I feel like my cough and breathing continue to improve. The cough isn't gone, but it's WAY better than it was. I can actually take a deep breath without having a coughing fit. I stopped using my home oxygen unit this week and my O2 has been staying in the 97-98% range without it. A big improvement over where I was a few short weeks ago. I still have this uncomfortable feeling in my chest when I breathe that's hard to describe. Not painful exactly, just uncomfortable. Keep hoping that will get better soon. Next chemo will be next Friday, and I'll be halfway through. I think I'll be having another PET scan at the end of March and hope to see this cancer in full retreat. I'm off to read through some of the older posts in this thread. I'm still feeling pretty clueless...",

Couldn't do basic household tasks like emptying the dishwasher. Forget speedwalking -- just walking up a single flight of stairs, I'd have to lay down for 5 minutes to recover. I was pretty much homebound. Never went anywhere because everything was too much effort for me. Couldn't go through the grocery store without an electric scooter. (And a few short months before, I was in great shape, walking 10-15,000 steps a day, every single day!!) I never dreamed I'd actually look forward to having chemo, but even the thought of chemo was preferable to how bad I felt. I noticed significant improvement after my very first chemo treatment. My cough wasn't completely gone, but it was much, much better. My oncologist put me on oxygen when I had my first chemo treatment because I started having trouble breathing during the treatment and my O2 sats dropped to 86. I got an oxygen unit at home and carried a portable tank with me everywhere I went. But by the time my third treatment rolled around, I was off oxygen completely. I still cough some, but I it's a very different cough now that I attribute to chemo side effects (throat irritation), and I still get out of breath pretty easily, but I think that's to be expected having been as inactive as I've been for so many months. Hopefully as soon as I finish chemo I can work on building my stamina back up again.  ",

What an exciting time for you!  I'm about 3 weeks out from my last chemo (yahoo!), and aside from 2 fingernails that look like they're about to fall off, I'm feeling pretty good. :-)  I felt good enough to attend my son's spring band concert last week, and I'm so glad I did! The band teacher gave out awards that night instead of at the school's end of year award ceremony, and my son got the Director's Award!! I was totally blown away and got all teary. Didn't even know they gave awards in band, so having him come away with the highest award was a HUGE surprise! And he followed that up with making A/B Honor Roll.  I had my follow up appointment at the MO this morning, and all my labs looked good. She suggested keeping my two nails trimmed as short as possible. One of them is like oozing underneath the nail bed a little (so gross), so she said to soak it in a half and half water/peroxide mixture. Hope I can keep them from falling off. That would just suck. I also talked to her about how uncomfortable it is to breathe. It doesn't exactly hurt, it's just...uncomfortable. How else do you describe that? She said my lungs did sound a little \"tight\" when she listened to my breathing, so she suggested I go back to using my inhaler to open things up a bit. (My regular doctor prescribed an inhaler for me last fall when the original diagnosis was just bronchitis.) And you know what? It actually seems to help. Keeping my fingers crossed that as I continue to feel better and start getting a little more activity in my day, maybe some of this is just because I've gotten so deconditioned and my breathing and SOB will improve over time. I can hope anyway.",

I made reservations for our summer vacation this morning. After all we've been through lately, we deserve a really nice vacation, so by golly we're doing it!  (On top of me going through chemo, my husband just had his hip replaced.)

Not sure why except that I guess at least it's understandable that I'm pretty much incapacitated for about a week each cycle. I agree that the worst SE I get is the stomach cramping diarrhea. They gave me donnatol (sp?), and it really helps with the cramping.  I've also found that Phenergen works best for the nausea for me -- I like that it helps me sleep through a lot of it.  Days 5-7 are the worst for me. Oh, and another bad side effect I get is instead of mouth sores I get throat sores. It makes it hard to swallow pills for a few days. They gave me \"magic mouthwash\" for the sores, but when I tried to take it, I threw up. I'm going to have to come up with a different way to get my pain and nausea meds in me next time.",

I've mostly been hanging out on the Stage 4 lung mets thread, but  it'll be nice to have friends to talk to who are at or near the same stage of treatment, too. A little about me... I'm 51, and this is my third time at the rodeo, so to speak. The first time was in 1997 -- got off easy with DCIS. opted for a BMX, and I managed to stay cancer free for 13 years, when it came back in the same breast (what little was left of it) as stage 2B. Had my pectoral muscle removed and reconstructed with my latissimus dorsi. Did six rounds of chemo (TCH), and radiation (x33). That was in 2010.  Back around Labor Day, I started coughing. Doc said it was bronchitis. The cough wouldn't go away. I was convinced it was ragweed because everybody I knew seemed to be having the same symptoms as me. Only when they started getting better, I was getting worse. Coughing non-stop, short of breath, quality of life non-existent. Got to the point I couldn't go to work anymore. It was all I could do to walk across the room without getting completely out of breath. Chest x-Ray showed nothing, CT scan showed possible pneumonia, but pulmonologist suspected something more and ordered a PET scan. PET scan showed a pleural effusion, and when they drained the fluid, they found cancer cells. There were also spots on a few bones, but they were very small. They started me on chemo scary fast. I had my appointment with my oncologist on a Friday (1/10), had my port put in on the following Monday, and my first round of chemo on 1/15. I started having breathing problems during my first infusion. My O2 sats dropped into the 80's, and I had to be put on oxygen. They set me up with a unit at home, and I was on oxygen 24/7 for several weeks. But after the very first chemo treatment, I noticed a dramatic improvement. (You know you're in bad shape when chemo actually makes you feel better!) My cough started improving, and after the second treatment, I started weaning myself off the oxygen. By the time the third treatment rolled around, I was completely off oxygen.  As miserable as chemo makes me, I'm extremely thankful to feel better than I'd felt in months. But I have to say, chemo has been a LOT harder this time than it was 4 years ago. I'm sure being in an extremely unhealthy state to begin with makes a huge difference, but I also wonder if just having been through chemo once before just takes a toll on your body. When I did this the first time, I was able to work part time during weeks 2-3 of each treatment cycle. This time, it seems the fatigue never lets up. Last cycle, I was so proud of myself because I went to the grocery store and managed to do all my shopping without using one of the electric carts!  I must say, having had this experience, I will never ever again judge people using those electric carts. You just don't know what somebody's situation is. It's not that I couldn't walk, it's that I didn't have enough stamina to complete a shopping trip under my own steam. I could maybe make it through the produce department before I'd be too exhausted to go on. And until 6 months ago, I was very fit! I wore a fitbit pedometer and walked anywhere from 12,000-20,000 steps a day!! Sorry, didn't mean to ramble, but this has been a very eye-opening and life changing experience. So last week I had another PET scan. Haven't gotten the results back yet. Praying it will show that the chemo has wiped out every bit of cancer. Friday, I go for chemo #5. Only one more after that, thank God. I'm so wiped out already, I'm not sure how I'm going to make it through round 5. This is supposed to be my feel good week, but I still haven't made it past so-so. This fatigue is killing me. I sleep a good 9-10 hours at night and still need to nap during the day. Is anybody else dealing with this level of fatigue? Or is it just more of I'm having a particularly rough time because I was in such a bad state to begin with? Sorry so long -- I had a lot of weeks to catch up. :)",

My BC support group signed up as a group and we're planning to meet for the survivor dinner and walk the survivor lap together. My church will have a tent there, and I almost always see a group from my radiation oncologist's office there. It's like a great big reunion and my son has a blast running around with his friends. I really really hope I'll feel good enough to go.",

My pre-chemo hair color was a pretty medium brown with just a bit of a reddish/gold to it. My post-chemo hair color is a much darker brown with no red/gold tone to it at all. This time, I'm just letting the crazy white stuff go for now -- even baby-bird hair is better than nothing. ;-)",

There's no way for them to remove 100% of the breast tissue, so my cancer came back in what little breast tissue I had left and was growing into the pectoral muscle beneath it. So for my second surgery (in 2010), they removed my pectoral muscle and replaced it with muscle from my back (latissimus dorsi). They were able to leave the implant in place. Marren -- I did 6 cycles, too. Looking at your dates, I think we were only a couple of weeks apart. My last round was May 2nd, so I've been finished about 2 months now.

I agree with you, it's rough. Really rough. I had TCH back in 2010, and now TCH+P. It's the only chemo I've had, so I can't compare. But the good thing is TCH+P works really really well. My PET scan in December showed mets to my lungs, pleural effusions on both sides, spots on my pelvic bones and vertebrae were lighting up, and a lymph node somewhere in the middle of my chest lit up, too. My PET scan last week shows the lung infiltrates nearly completely resolved, the lymph node is gone (or rather the cancer is), the pleural effusion on the left is half what it was, and the one on the right is completely gone. Spots on bones are stable and not lighting up anymore. NOTHING lit up on the PET scan! I'll put up with the awful side effects because it works so incredibly well. The diarrhea and cramping is awful, but I've found that Immodium AD helps tremendously. And if that doesn't take care of the cramping for you, ask your nurse about Donnatal. One thing I learned the first time around is those nurses can help you with pretty much anything. If there's a side effect, they have (or will find) a solution for it. Hang in there -- only 2 more to go!",

Never lost the nails, and they got better after finishing chemo. The only lasting issue I had was that the white portion of my ring finger nails ended up extending halfway down the nail. Basically, the top portion of the nail wasn't attached to the nail bed. Didn't look pretty,  and was very hard to keep those nails clean. Ironically, the problem resolved itself FOUR YEARS LATER! Yup, my ring finger nails finally went back to looking perfectly normal. A week before I started chemo!!! And here we go again. Grrrrrrrr....",

Marren and birdlover -- Once I was 5 years out from my BMX, my breast surgeon stopped monitoring me and just said to call if I had a problem. My first recurrence wasn't even considered a recurrence, because it was SO far out from my original DCIS (12 years). They called it a new primary, and I was the one that found it -- it was a very noticeable lump. After finishing chemo, radiation and a year of Herceptin, I went to being monitored by 3 different doctors -- my medical oncologist (every 3 months), and my breast surgeon and radiation oncologist ( both every 6 months). My breast surgeon would sometimes do an ultrasound, and once did a biopsy, which turned out to be nothing. My MO examined me and did blood tests -- tumor markers were always good. Even with all that monitoring, nobody caught it until I was symptomatic from having it spread to my lungs. It's hard because you don't want to worry about every little thing that comes along, but apparently a cough that won't go away is cause for concern. I've responded well to treatment, but I'm not bouncing back from chemo quite as well this time. I hope to keep improving though. I see my MO every 3 weeks (still getting Herceptin and Perjeta), and I have a PET scan done every 3 months.",

My son is 11 -- the same age I was when my mother died of Breast Cancer.  My father asked me recently how much we've told Thomas. I think he has regrets that he and my mother kept me completely in the dark about my mother's illness. It was 1974, and people didn't talk about BC. I told dad that Thomas knows as much as he needs to know at this time. I suppose I might have a little bit of denial going on, but is it really denial when there are so many treatments available to us, and more being developed all the time? I see so many women living years with Stage 4. I figure I'll face the possibility of dying when somebody tells me I'm dying and not a minute before! LOL My son was 7 when I was diagnosed with Stage 2B, so he got to see me go through chemo and radiation and come out happy and healthy on the other side. One of the nurses at my MO's office was really helpful when it came to explaining my illness in terms a 7-year-old could understand. I enlisted the help of the counselor at my son's school, too. As it turned out, he really didn't need any \"help\", but it gave me peace of mind to know that she was keeping an eye out for him. When I got my Stage 4 diagnosis in January, I told Thomas that my cancer was back and explained that having cancer is kinda like playing whack-a-mole. It pops up, you whack it with a mallet. It pops up again, you whack it again. He got a kick out of the analogy. I've never uploaded a picture to this site before, but I'll give it a try. If it works, this is a picture of us dancing at his Jr. Cotillion Spring Ball a few weeks ago.  ",
