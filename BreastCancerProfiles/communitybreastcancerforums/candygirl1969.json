THe result was suspicious microcalcifications and 2 other \u201cmixed Echogenicity structures\", which led to my having a stereotactic biopsy yesterday. I was bi-rads 4. hey didn't do biopsy on the 2 solid nodules but rather the calcs as they didn't seem too concerned about the 2 nods. Anyway the radiologists said 50/50 chance. I've read so much on here that say the odds are in my favor but I'm worried about the other \u201cstructures\" found in the same breast as the microcalcifications. Am very confused, very sore from biopsy and just looking for any information with anyone in similar situations and what your results were Thank you!! Patty Log in to post a reply",
