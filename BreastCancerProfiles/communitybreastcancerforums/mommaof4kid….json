I am one of those people who never cries and after my 3rd treatment I found myself crying over anything and everything. My emotions were crazy! Somewhere around 2-3 weeks after treatment I had the thought \"wow, I haven't cried for 2 days!\" For me, it took about 3 months to feel like I had control of my emotions again. Hang in there! You can do it! ðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ¹",

Now 6 months post rads it's not so firm, yet still not back to normal. For instance, I still have my \"rads tan\" in that area and some fluid retention.My RO says eventually I won't be able to tell I had it done, but not sure how to translate \"eventually\" into a timeline. I would think that if you want them to match, it would be beneficial to wait until there is sufficient healing from radiation before proceeding with the next surgery. Best wishes!",
