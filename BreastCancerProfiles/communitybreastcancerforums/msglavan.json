    "Content": "msglavan wrote: I was diagnosed with mastitis last Wednesday and have been taking antibiotics. What's odd about that is I am a virgin (aka not breastfeeding) and I didn't have a fever which seems to be a big indicator of mastitis. I am 23. I showed my right breast to my roommates a few days ago. I think my nipple might be inverting and when I told my roommates I was researching the topic- without telling them my concern- they said that mine had already been dimpled and that was the first difference they noticed between my healthy breast and the infected one. I've been trying to find out how that happens: do you wake up one morning and find the change, or will it happen over weeks? I also can't find conclusively whether nipple inversion is just a symptom of IBC or if it still could be the mastitis...? Thanks, All Log in to post a reply",
