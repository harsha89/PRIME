I was surprised it hit so early on. I perked up a bit over the weekend, then a couple hours after rad treatment, it came roaring back. I wonder if it will get more intense with each treatment or if this is the level it stays at. I will be walking or sitting and my eyes just close. If I'm sitting, I will cat nap. Also, I have trouble finding my words. It's just intense fatigue. Then I'll bounce back for a little bit",

Today was a unique experience....or maybe I'm running on empty. Whatever. The procedure ended and the techs came back into the room plus a new gal. The new gal completely ignored me. Gee. I'm only a patient, therefore I don't exist. I'm just there with my boobs in the breeze. THEN she begins to rattle on about a dinosaur bone exhibit she went to. Quote, \"The jaw and leg bones were broken. I knew before the tour guide said it. It was because the dinosaur had CANCER! It was sooooo neat.\" She went on and on. I could tell the two regular techs just wanted her to shut up. One of them walked me out, which they hadn't been doing lately. I know there are many, many people who have no clue what it means to a person to be told they have cancer, then walk through the tests, surgeries, and treatments, only to live the rest of their lives with the nagging concern of recurrence. But, also.....I suppose it bothered me a bit more because my Dad had multiple myeloma and, yes, his bones did fracture. Ah well. I keep telling myself I can give grace to those who haven't had this experience.",
