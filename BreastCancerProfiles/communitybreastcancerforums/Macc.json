I'm currently having boosts...first one today...having had 25 breast and node treatments.  I didn't get a choice as to what type of treatment as I'm stage llb but understand that there have been trials on the 3 week course which have shown good results for early stage bc which yours is. Glancing thro the articles it seems that the overall does is lower in the 3 weeks but the daily does higher. I should ask what dose you would be getting with each type of treatment. There's probably more about this on the net but these are the only two articles I had read. Good Luck with your treatment. http://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/news/20070604/less-radiation-breast-cancer-works http://www.nhs.uk/news/2007/January08/Pages/Lowerdoseradiotherapyforbreastcancer.aspx",

Google radiotherapy and click on images at the top when the results pop up. You'll see a picture of someone lying under a machine. The staff will need to either draw lines on you or put small tatooed dots so that the machine can align itself correctly. After the first exam by the rad onc no one should need to manhandle your boob  unless you have a problem. Mine is a bit sore inside after 25 sessions and the rad onc did prod it abit today. The staff could be men or women I guess. Mine were women altho there was a male trainee for the last 3 weeks. I don't think you should be manhandled too much by anyone there....certainly not compared to a followup with the surgeon who usually does a good bit of manhandling in the whole area. I hope it all goes well and try not to worry too much about it. I know it's easier said than done, but I hope we have reduced your concerns abit. All the best, Macc",

Everyone reacts differently as you no doubt know already but I was glad not to have the nausea with TH that I had with AC. My bloods also got hit hard with T so I had the immune boosting injection, Neulasta. I suffered Hand and Foot syndrome too which makes your hands and feet go very red and peel, altho I think this is less common. I had some of the nerve damage too which affected my feet more and is almost gone in my hands (last TH mid Nov) but my toes are still a little numb. You  need to see how you are after each treatment. My onc said I could go onto Taxol or lower the does of T if it became an unbearable problem. My nails are peeling...they went very thick and the tops layers have come off to reveal a thin layer underneath. It's more inconvenient than anything as I have to put bandaids on them to stop them catching on everything I touch. For me I don't think that H made much difference. I'm on just that now and I don't have SE's except slow hair growth and I also had a problem with very watery eyes which could have been either T or H or a combination of both together. Steroid drops have almost stopped that now. Some people get bone/joint/muscle pain which I didn't get at all with any of the chemo or H altho I did  get a little with the Neualsta, but it wasn't much really for me anyway. I hope you get on well with TH. I was very anxious beforehand too. Vit B6 is supposed to help prevent nerve damage, so you could mention this to your onc to see if he is happy for you to take it. Good Luck! Macc",

Each angle directs the radiation to an area of the breast i.e. a field. This will vary according to whether the lymph nodes need treating and also to the shape of the breast since they try not to overlap the fields. E.G. I am having 4 field radiation and have a dose from each side of the breast which zaps the lymph nodes under the arm too, one to the lymph nodes near the collar bone from the front and one to the same area from the back.  Hope this helps.",
