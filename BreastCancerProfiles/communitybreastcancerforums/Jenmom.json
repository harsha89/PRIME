I told him I'd been looking at maligancy rates on the internet for complex cysts and saw a big variation. He told me the actual rate is less than 1 percent, and that is it pretty rare for a complex cyst to be malignant. This radiologist, who is in his early 60s, so has been practicing a long time, said he's seen \"maybe one\" complex cyst in his entire career that was malignant. He said the higher rates I had seen on the internet of maglignancy for complex cysts were \"wrong.\" He said there are a lot of bad studies out there and a lot of incorrect info on the internet (which apparently I had been reading.) But these guys know it could happen, even if uncommon, which is why they like to do biopsy anyway, it's the only way to know for sure. So, really, I don't think you should worry. Have a good weekend and relax. The weekend before I got my biopsy results I was a wreck, so nervous, and now I wished I had calmed down more. I also wish the radiologist had told me the percentage rates when I had my biopsy and maybe I would not have worried so much!!!",

I'm 50 and have been called back for tests for every single mammogram I've ever had and it's always been nothing. They send me home and tell me not to worry. Most recently I got called back and ended up having a breast biopsy, for the first time. I really freaked out and worried I had cancer, but the results were B9. It was just some cycsts with some solid material mixed in, which is common. When talking with the doctor, he said he never thought it was cancer and that it didn't look like cancer, but he wanted to be sure. And you want them to be sure. Try not to worry.",

Reading stuff on the Internet will do nothing to calm you, and it's not going to give you the answers you need anyway. Also, there is some false information out there that will only make things worse. Stay away! I read too much before my biopsy which was B9. Do things you enjoy and try to relax. I found the busier I was, the less time I had to think about it.",

Sometimes there may be things in there that they don't tell you, perhaps because they deem it's not relevant or important. But you might find things in there that you'd like to know for the future. I have learned to ask for copies of those reports. Mine didn't say anything significant, either, but it did include the scientific jargon for the specific type of benign breast lump that I had, so I looked it up on the Intenet and read about it so that I would know for the future. I just believe that you should have all the infoabout your own health that your doctor has.",

Gamma Knife is a little different than SRS, but it's essentially the same treatment, just a different type of machine they use. What is it that you want to know? It was very easy, he spent the night in the hospital and we went back home the next day and on Monday he went to work. No side effects at all. Today he is fine, six years later. It is much less traumatic than having a craniotomy, which he also had before the GK. ",
