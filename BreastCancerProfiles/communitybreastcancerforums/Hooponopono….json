God bless ",

      "Content": "Aug 16, 2010 06:58AM - edited Aug 16, 2010 07:06AM by Hooponopono Hi BcMomOf3, My girlfriend was diagnosed with malignant breast cancer (two tumors) and was adviced to have a mastectomy, followed by chemo and radiation (Mammo, April 2th, 2009 - biopsy, June 2009). We found out, a few hours before the operation, about German New Medicine (GNM) - and later about B17/Amygdalin. She didn't have any conventional treatment (not even drugs), but went along with GNM and B17/Amygdalin and now, 16 months after the mammo, she feels better than ever. During the last year I've taken a deep interest in alternative therapies (not only for cancer) and been doing alot of investigation/research. It's my personal conviction that conventional medicine not only hasn't got a clue about disease (they only treat symptoms, which is a very lucrative business), but I'm afraid that more people die (or atleast remain ill) because of conventional treatments, than are getting cured. Of course this sounds harsh, but there's just alot of information out there, your doctor/oncologist either doesn't know about, or doesn't want you to know... Maybe you could take a look here, for instance (I have the two books this guy wrote on his experiences with cancer): www.healinghut.net/Liars.html  I do believe that Protocel and other alternative cancer therapies have helped many people to get rid of cancer, but that's my personal opinion, after reading many books on the subject (many written by doctors who turned away from 'modern medicine', Ph.D's and/or cancer patients who got cured by alternative means). Wish you all the best. Ronald ",
