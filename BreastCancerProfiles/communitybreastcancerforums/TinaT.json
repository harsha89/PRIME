Blue dye is not radioactive and is injected by the breast surgeon at the time of surgery USUALLY after the patient is already under anesthesia. Some surgeons like either the radioactive dye or the blue dye.  Some use both. I had four injections with no numbing cream or lidocaine.  It was uncomfortable (like a hornet sting), but very briefly, and I did fine.",

I had two cancers in one breast (ILC and DCIS), but chose bilateral mastectomy due to the nature of lobular cancer.  At surgery more early lobular and ADH were found so I know I made the right decision for me.  My Oncotype DX was 18, right on the borderline, but because my cancers were very early and fairly \"well-behaved\" and because I have no family history I chose to skip chemo with my oncologists full support.

It seems many women develop adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder going through all of this.  It can range from annoying to extremely painful, but I don't think it is typically associated with swelling.  I've had it in both shoulders and never noticed swelling. You might check out one of the lympedema or LE threads here.  Best wishes for a smooth surgery.  Please take care of yourself and keep us posted on your progress! ",

The Mammaprint test is not to determine if radiation is necessary.  It is similar to the Oncotype DX test and helps to determine if chemotherapy is necessary.  Here's a page on BCO that describes it: http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/types/mammaprint.jsp My case is similar to yours (except I had ILC and DCIS).  I had BMX so no radiation.  My Adjuvent! Online and Oncotype DX both indicated that chemo would only add a minimal increase in protection over hormone therapy alone so my oncologist didn't recommend it.   I will be having 6 month oncology visits and bloodwork, which will include full metabolic panel, blood count, and tumor marker levels.  Other than a baseline bone density test (because I'm taking Arimidex instead of Tamoxifen) I haven't have any scans at all, even after BC diagnosis.  Since my cancers were quite small, found early, were \"well behaved\", and I had no other physical complaints the BS and MO felt the radiation of PET, CT, and bone scans wasn't warranted.  I was a little uncomfortable with that at first, but I'm OK with it now.  I'll be in close tabs with both of them over the next 5 years.

Today is my first cancerversary.  One year ago today I had my first round of biopsies and I got \"the call\" later in the day about the first cancer (ILC) that was diagnosed.  Totally floored because the MRI a few days prior was not done because of anything suspicious, but because I had very dense breasts and was tired of the non-diagnostic needle-in-a-haystack mammograms.  I fought for 6 months with my insurance company to have it done.  No lumps, no family history, \"normal\" mammogram - I just got it in my head that I wanted an MRI as a baseline screening and had no suspicion that anything would actually be found.  Initially thought that lumpectomy/radiation/hormone therapy would be the treatment, but all changed later in the month when the rest of the biopsies were done and the DCIS was also discovered.  To celebrate, I emptied all the pre-BC bras out of the lingerie drawer a few days ago to make room for all the pretty new ones.  And it seemed a good time to pack up all the \"get well\" and \"thinking of you\" cards that I've had displayed all year to remind me of all my supportive family and friends.  Make room for the beautiful holiday cards that are rolling in.  I have a very nice bottle of wine and I'll splurge and maybe have TWO glasses tonight! I know you all get it.  My wonderful DH, some of my family, and one friend (diagnosed 2 years prior to me) really do get it.  Now that implants are in most everyone else just wants everything to go away and be OK.  Despite looking at 5 years of side effects from hormone tx and more corrective reconstructive surgeries in my future I keep hearing from those that don't get it, \"Yay, you're ALL DONE!  You caught it so early it's like you didn't really have breast cancer at all\"....huh?????  As I said, I know YOU LADIES GET IT so 'nuff said.  Thanks for listening.  Even though I'm not a frequent poster on this thread I do keep up with it.  Have a great day!!! ",

My Oncotype DX was also 18 so I know EXACTLY what you're talking about.  My cancers were supposedly found so very early that I expected to land squarely in that low range.  Wouldn't you know it, 18 is right on the cusp of that dang intermediate range!  But, no chemo for me either and I'm good with that decision. As I mentioned in the other thread, I think there's sort of a weird phase after all the hubbub of diagnosis and surgery.  For me, things really started sinking in once most of my decisions were made.  I suppose it is a simple matter of having more time to think about it all in general rather than focusing on specifics.  At least, that's the way it's been for me....",

Our Oncotype scores are pretty close too!  I was hoping to be solidly in that low range...wouldn't you know, my number was right on the cusp of the intermediate range.  Still, at 3% extra protection I opted against chemo with oncologists whole-hearted support.

Yes, please check out the TE thread.  There you will find women who go through the reconstruction process pretty quickly and others who have had TEs for a year or more for various reasons.  Everyone definitely seems to be on a different path due to insurance, surgical complications, chemo or radiation, or their PS preferences.  You're only 8 weeks post surgery, you've definitely not been left behind!",

Sounds like you've taken a deep breath and are ready to move on to the next part of the journey.  I hope you finish healing soon and that all goes according to plan.  Best wishes!!!",

Nipple sparing surgery is still considered unproven by many surgeons (there is a lot of speculation by patients that \"unproven\" is a pat answer given by surgeons who simply haven't learned how to do the surgery).  You're right, the nipple is technically considered breast tissue.  However, it has been performed for a number of years now and I believe it gaining steam and statistics have not proven that there are higher percentages of recurrence due to leaving the nipple.  In my case, the BS made the mastectomy incision below the breast (NICE!) and really cored out the tissue behind the nipple.  There is both a preliminary check done during surgery and a separate, more thorough pathology report done on that tissue.  I went into the surgery knowing that I would come out without one or both if the initial pathology wasn't good and that I would have to go back for nipple removal if they found anything on the more thorough path examination. All patients are not good candidates - breast size and shape, size of tumor, proximity of tumor to the nipple, prior breast surgeries, etc. all come into play.  Also a surgeon can't simply decide to start doing them.  There has to be a program in place because the BS turns the patient over to the PS to finish.  All forms of reconstruction need to be available at the facility since it is started right away.  In my case, I was unable to have performed locally not because my BS wasn't able or willing, but because the hospital is not outfitted with the equipment or staffed with plastic surgeons able to perform flap microsurgery.",

The nipple/skin sparing BMX and lymph node biopsy went well on Feb. 16.  No nausea or vomiting from anesthesia, pain meds, or antibiotics.  Had a little difficulty finding the pain control that worked best for me (Percocet every 4 hours was the key for me).  Otherwise, everything went like clockwork.  I'm home moving around and my husband has to keep reminding me to take it easy.  Honestly, I'm doing much, much better than I had anticipated and probably would overdo if my husband wasn't here to tell me to chillax!  My PS put in 600cc TE and instilled 350cc on surgery day.  It's odd because I feel like I'm wearing a tight sports bra, but I've been instructed to wear a loose shirt and nothing else on top.

I thought the Oncotype DX was for Stage I or II invasive cancers with negative nodes and HR+.  I read nothing on the Oncotype DX website about the tumor size.  Does anyone know if this is true (the test is not designed for tumors under 2 cm) or if this is simply a \"guideline\" my insurance company uses to decide on payment?",

Honestly, I attribute much of my good attitude to the fact that I was able to have nipple-sparing surgery.  Also, I cannot believe how wonderful and kind all my doctors have been...my breast surgeon, plastic surgeon, oncologist, and all their staffs have been unbelievable.  It has made my journey pretty smooth so far.  Take care, everyone!!!",

You can do this - step by step, day by day, hurdle by hurdle.  Allow yourself to have a bad day now and then and pat yourself on the back when you have a good one.  A lot of it is your frame of mind.

When the DCIS was found my lumpectomy option was gone....no double lumpectomies!  So I was faced with unilateral or bilateral MX.  For me, that was a much easier decision and I chose BMX with reconstruction.  Somehow the thought of one \"good\" breast and one \"cancer\" breast was more upsetting than imagining a matched set of reconstructed breasts.  At surgery I had more areas of lobular neoplasia and ADH sprinkled throughout the tissue of that same breast, but that was enough to convince me that I made the absolute best decision for me. I am having post-surgical healing issues, but I believe that nipple sparing BMX has had a lot to do with my outlook since my surgery.  I still have a long way to go with reconstruction, but I like what I see so far and I believe I'll be pleased with the final outcome. ",

One friend doesn't understand why I would ask such a thing and wondered if I was in denial (huh?).  Someone else (a former coworker who has breast cancer and with whom I haven't spoken in at least 5 years) who heard very early on emailed me that she didn't understand why I didn't want everyone to know, that it wasn't good for me to \"hold it in\".  I tried to explain that just because I wasn't sharing with everybody (like former coworkers from 5 years ago) didn't mean I wasn't sharing with anybody! I have coped very well by trying to live the rest of my life as normally as possible.  I am not in denial, but I don't want to discuss cancer 24/7, have people be afraid to talk about happy things, or stare at my chest trying to figure out what sort of surgery I might have had.  But, that's just me...",

Please don't jump to conclusions that you'll have to get chemo and that your treatment will be horrible.  Even the \"worst\" that you're imagining is doable - you will get through this!  Sounds like your tumor was caught at a pretty early stage so take a breath and try to go one step at a time.  Surgery and treatment is so individualized now and there are tests that can be done to help decide if chemo is necessary. There are different ways to do the SNB and each facility and surgeon seem to do things a little differently.  It will be difficult for any of us to tell you exactly how that will work.  If you can get a little more info - such as will it be done with a radioactive tracer OR blue dye, will you be awake or will they do it after you're under anesthesia, etc - you'll know more about what to expect.

I had very dense breasts and had multiple areas show up on my MRI (none showed on mammogram).  Most MRI findings are benign.  In dense breasts they usually turn out to be fibroadenomas.  So, chances are this new area is benign, but they likely will have to biopsy it with MRI guidance since that's the only way it showed up.  I am a huge fan of breast MRI for dense breasts.  I credit it for finding my cancers at an early stage and it is a big reason I have done so well.  If it would put your mind at ease you could pursue having one as well.  Insurance companies don't like to pay for them for screening because they do find lots of \"things\" which end up having to be biopsied and usually are benign.  As you mentioned, however, you now have a family history so it might be a little easier fight.  Just a thought as you sound very worried... Have a lovely cruise.  Sounds like a nice family vacation will be great for all of you!!!",

I had no scans, no CXR, etc. before or after my diagnosis.  I'm basically a healthy person (non smoker, no diabetes, no hypertension, etc).  All I had was a pre-surgery physical with basic bloodwork and, of course, all the breast imaging that led to my diagnosis. Am I missing something?  Seems every time my brain is in a good place with all of this I read or hear something that makes me go \"what??????\"  I'd be interested to hear if it is still routine to run imaging tests for staging/treatment planning so I'll know if I should be pushing the issue with my docs.

If you're having the blue dye used, that is USUALLY done by the surgeon after you're already out.  Again, each place seems to have a different protocol so could be different where you're having it done. Ask your surgeon which type of SNL he/she will be doing...could be both.  There are threads here for sentinel node localizations.  Be prepared to see opinions from \"it was nothing\" to \"it's the worst thing I've ever been through\".  There is great variation in protocols and also in people's pain tolerance. Don't worry about the freaking out part - I'm pretty certain we've all been there...perfectly normal.  The waiting is the worst, but you can do this!!! All the best!",

It's all rather confusing at the beginning as we crash course our way into a whole new world.  Once all your results are in and your treatment plan is in place it will get a bit easier.  So, chemo will depend on the Onotype results even though you had positive nodes?  Initially, the Oncotype wasn't used for node-positive women, but I realize that it is now so things have changed even in the 1-1/2 years since my diagnosis. How are you doing with the tissue expanders?  I hope you're tolerating things well and not too uncomfortable.  You might read on the TE threads from women who are having difficulties, but try to remember that many who breeze through simply don't write about it.  Best wishes!",

You might find it helpful to check in on the Nipple-Sparing with Immediate Reconstruction thread.  The title is a little misleading, but there is a mix of both women who are going the TE route (reconstruction started immediately after MX by having the TEs put in) as well as some who have had direct-to-implant surgery.  Lots of nipple talk over there  .

You don't mention what type of surgery you had in February (lumpectomy?  mastectomy?  reconstruction?).  Regardless, I'm sorry you're dealing with an infection and another surgery .  I had a rather rocky healing course after my bilateral nipple-sparing mastectomy surgery.  It's hard enough to deal with all of this and especially hard when things don't go according to plan. Best of luck tomorrow!",

I can only speak from my own experience, but the best thing I've ever done for myself was to fight for that MRI because of my dense breast tissue.  I feel I'll have a much better fighting chance because my cancers were found years earlier than they would have been if we had waited for a lump to be felt or for something to finally show on a mammogram.  Chances are that if you have one it will be fine, but at least you would have peace of mind and know for sure one way or the other.  Since you asked  that's what I would suggest. I don't know what to say about your grandmother and I suppose it really doesn't matter - your mom has been diagnosed so now you have a family history.  I know this is all very upsetting and it sucks and it's not fair, but it is doable and your mom (and you) can move through this one step at a time.   ",

I'm happy that you're being so supportive of your mom, but sorry that it's causing some family tension.  It's tough, all of it, so keep gathering all the information you can. ",

I have had a very long career in healthcare so probably do delve a bit deeper into things and have a bit easier time understanding terminology, etc.  I'm sure it all helps me to absorb and process the information.  And you're right - very profound, I might add - some of those who posted frequently when I first signed on only check in once in a while now.  Makes me feel good to think that they're moving on with their lives and not so focused on BC these days.  And the newly diagnosed keep checking in.  You're absolutely right - all standing together as one, some moving on and some just starting the journey....",

I am on BCO because I was diagnosed with a different form of cancer (ILC) in the opposite breast in 2010 and I chose to have a bilateral mastectomy.  The reason for mentioning that is not to frighten you more, but to let you know that the pathology on the breast that had the calcifications in 2009 was normal!

Obviously, I don't know your whole history, but you mention that the radiologist said that \"it doesn't look like there are any more masses\" on your mammogram.  IF this comment was made because they have difficulty reading your mammogram due to dense breast tissue PLEASE consider asking for an MRI before making your final surgical decisions.
