I got 2 of my 4 drains out yesterday, and I go back Friday to have the final 2 removed, then a week \"off\" from doc visits, then I go back to get assessed for healing and to hopefully get my first fill 8/13 (they didn't put anything in during surgery). I was told to not lift my arms higher than shoulder level until that \"first fill\" appointment and that \"at that time they'll give me stretches/exercises\". I'm going nuts at home though, I have two small kids (they'll be 6 and 2 in Sept) and while the older one understands what's going on, the 2 year old just wants \"momma up\" and it kills me that I can't lift her up. I know the lifting restrictions are in place to not overdo anything, but I'm curious what the harm would be given that I had everything done pre-pectorally, so my muscles weren't cut. I'm going to ask at my appointment Friday, but I'm hoping maybe I'll be given the green light to start lifting things sooner rather than later.",

My mom had the same thing in 2003, which is how we first found out about BRCA. I decided then (at age 19) that I would have a prophylactic DMX (we have no history of gyn cancers) once I was done with kids. Fast forward to April, I'm done having and breastfeeding my kids and go in for my first baseline mammo when they found the DCIS. Because of the location of my DCIS, they can't save the nipples (and I don't think I'd be comfortable keeping them regardless) but my surgeons are going to do areola sparing. Just curious if anyone else has done this, or is planning to? It seems like a relatively new procedure, and cosmetically I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around what I'm going to see. I'm barely an A cup now, but at my biggest while nursing I was almost a C, so that's what I'm hoping for with TEs, if all goes well. It's super encouraging to read all your posts and realize what I'm feeling is normal, and to get insight into the future! Here's to clean scans and healthy futures!",

I'm 2.5 weeks post-op, and for about the last week or so the sunburn/raw feeling has been the worst symptom to deal with once my drains were gone. I had read before surgery that this was a common issue, but I just assumed it would be at my incision sites - but for me, my incisions aren't the problem, its the area on my front both where a bra band would sit, as well as above my expanders up towards my collarbone, then the backs of each armpit, and my entire upper back. Wearing anything feels like sandpaper! I asked the PS at my last appointment (to have my last 2 drains removed) about continuing the Gabapentin, they OK'd it, but it's not helping. My next appointment is in a week for (hopefully) my first fill so I plan to ask for other options (prescription or non), but I'm wondering if anyone else is having this same problem? Or is far enough ahead of me in timeline to say whether this ever goes away?",

I had read about the discoloration/scabbing with NSM but it wasn't until a few days ago that I realized I'll have the same problem! In my mind since I'm not keeping the nipple it just didn't click they're still going to be cutting the areola! Do/did you have any sensation during the healing process? I've read other people saying they don't necessarily feel pain, but the remaining skin is highly sensitive/easily irritated. I'm so small currently I have a feeling they won't be able to fill the TEs at all during placement, so as not to stress the stitches - I feel like the areola skin is so delicate. I'd be worried about those stitches healing properly first before trying to stretch the skin, but at the same time that same area takes a beating during breastfeeding, so maybe it's stronger than I think! Our bodies sure are crazy.",
