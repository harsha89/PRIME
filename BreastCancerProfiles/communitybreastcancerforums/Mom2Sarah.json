I\u2019ve not had any issues and it\u2019s been smooth sailing, so I can\u2019t complain! The only way I know how to describe it? It feels like it\u2019s in my veins. And I don\u2019t know what is normal anymore and what isn\u2019t. I hate to constantly keep asking my same friend for help? So I came here instead! I feel so stupid some days!

All of my appointments are this week, and I thought I would have a better picture of what things would look like? Instead, I'm still in a holding pattern. I have to wait until after surgery and the Oncotype DX test results to know if I have chemotherapy or not, and I do know that I will have to have some sort of estrogen blockers for the next 5 years. I have no idea what reconstructive surgery will really look like, and I'm just feeling very lost and frustrated.

      "Content": "Mom2Sarah wrote: So my wait for answers has been prolonged. Ugh! Someone at my breast surgeons office dropped the ball and the oncotype test wasn't ordered, so I'm looking at another week before I have the results. My boss is pushing me to get a second opinion, his wife had a huge scare and he lost a nephew to cancer. He wants me to go to MD Anderson and we're in St. Louis. And like I have that kind of money! But my primary doctor and oncologist are already telling me that they don't think I will need chemo. I'm 48 and was a stage 1, HER2 negative, estrogen/progesterone driven, lymph nodes were clear, tested negative for ALL 46 genes and I had a BMX almost 4 weeks ago. But my maternal Grandma had breast cancer (survived) and I lost my maternal Aunt to breast cancer last August. Even if my oncologist says no to chemo and straight to Tamoxifen, how do you know that's the right choice? And if I say I want chemo, will the oncologist agree to that? I'm sure the biggest thing is to wait and see what that score is, but can one push to have chemo? Is it the right choice? Or do I just get a second opinion? You all know, everyone has an opinion on this and I just want to do what is best for me and family. I just want to kick it, kick it right the first time and to never, ever have to look back! And one last question...\u2026. how do they test the tissue? Is my tissue or tumor in a container just sitting on a shelf with my name on it? I am so confused and just wish I knew!
