I did feel fine until around 7:30 pm when the nausea hit with a vengeance I felt awful all night then went for shot next day was feeling some better. I woke up with my left knee hurting real bad thought it was just my arthritis but the pain kept getting worse until my whole body hurts head to toe. None of the shots were like this for me before, still in a lot of pain today and nothing seems to work on making it less. I took Vicodin, later Darvaset and Aleve. If this is how some of you felt before no wonder you said you wanted to quit, all night I kept thinking I don't think I can do this any more although I know I don't have a choice really. If anyone has found any thing that would help with this pain please let me know, for those who had it really bad how long did it last? I'm about to go find some morphine lol wish I could. Hang in there Carol I'll be thinking of you and praying you will have an easy time of it. Also holding up everyone else as well Take care Hugs Jan",
