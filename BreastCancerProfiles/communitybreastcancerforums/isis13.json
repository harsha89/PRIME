First time around it was on right breast and no node involvement but ER+ PR- HER2 +++. Lumpectomy, 7 nodes taken, 4 a/c and 4 taxol and 35 radio and arimidex for 5, thought I was home free. This September I was diagnosed with IDC in left breast, lumpectomy and have sentinel node involvement, ER+/PR- HER-. Stage 2. I am now 66 years and started Cytoxan/Taxotere last week. Will have 6 cycles and then radio. etc. Although C/T is not as bad as the \"red devil\" I find I am very tired, fluish, achy and depressed.... Is this normal? Had Neulasta Injection day after first chemo. Any words of advise are most welcome.",
