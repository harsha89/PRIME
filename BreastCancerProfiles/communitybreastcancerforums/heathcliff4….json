BiRads 5 rating, the other for calcifications 4b) and I was so sure I'd hear early that I basically ignored my surgeon's warning that it would take 3-5 days.  I've been on pins and needles and I'm sick to my stomach w. anxiety.  Just needed to let it out somewhere.   I've called the surgeon's office yesterday and today and I KNOW they will call me, but I keep hoping that at least they will say, \"Yes, the results are in and she will call you this afternoon.\"  But, they don't.   I have my follow up appointment on Monday and I'm just praying I don't have to wait through the weekend.  Fwiw, my 6 year old just started a new school today and my 2.5 year old will start preschool in another week.
