After one year of Herceptin, I was initially cleared but then rediagnosed last May with METS to liver, lungs and bones. After 17 rounds of taxol, Herceptin and Perjeta, I went off chemo but stayed on Herceptin and Perjeta to keep the cancer at bay (along with with Lupron and Letrazole, too) though most had disappeared. But then, five months later, it resurfaced. Now I'm taking Kadcyla with Herceptin. The first round was tough, the second easier. Have yet to have my third. My question is, how long will I have to take this? What are your experiences? Thanks in advance for your responses.",
