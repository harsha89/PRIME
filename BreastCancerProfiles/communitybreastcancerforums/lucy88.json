There is a thread right now called LYMPHEDEMA PAIN in which the women discuss having pain all day. They talk about the medications they take. Do you want to go to that thread and tell them they are liars? I hope not. ",

There is a 49% chance of lymphedema according to Sloan Kettering. If it improved survival, that would be one thing but it doesn't. Did you read the studies the women sent?",

She considers axillary surgery barbaric and will only do it if the patient has pain in a node. This is a serious operation. Please read up what you can. My sister was diagnosed ten years before me and her arm is now useless. There was a lymphedema therapist on the group who was diagnosed six months ago. She saw so many painful cases that she would not get any lymph node procedure. This is a haunting picture below but it could be any one of us. Lymphedema patient",

There are so many studies on this, not just the most recent one. Why are only a few people reading them? The lymphedema deniers must get real and point out the casualties of this disease. It is not ethical to suppress the information. I just found another picture. Please, to those contemplating this surgery, look before you leap. ",
