I was overwhelmed for about 4 weeks after diagnosis then the 2 weeks before surgery I just could not wait to get it over with. When I woke up after surgery, I couldn't stop smiling - so glad it was over.  Even though I was disappointed that the implants couldn't go in right away, I'm thrilled to have the offending lumps and tissue out. I know the lumps were getting bigger each week I stopped touching it a month before I was diagnosed because it was freaking me out. I just wanted to say I understand the feeling of being overwhelmed. I've just started this journey, too, but I already feel better. My attitude (no matter how delusional it may be) is that one year from now this will all be behind me.   I don't see how to start a new topic, but I'd like to reach out to others about fertility -  harvesting eggs before chemo (or the decision not to do so).",
