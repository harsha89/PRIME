She has been doing quite well on this combo until Christmas day. The scans were becoming better and better.  But mid-December she started to vomit, have headaches and problems walking. They discoved brain mets (quite a few I think). They stopped everything and started Xeloda+tykerb right away. The thing is her general state is not good right now. She sleeps all the time, barely eats, seems confused.  Could she that sick from the medication itself? Or is it the brain mets? Thanks so much for your help",
