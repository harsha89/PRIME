My obgyn is great about listening to me and wanting to fix what is wrong rather than ignoring me or telling me its nothing like my primary does most the time. I know that she will refer me some where else I just wanted her opinion on whether she felt anything or not. She is who does me breast exams regularly.  Thanks for the advice. I didn't know about the breast surgeon. I thought you could only go to them if you were going to have to have something done so I will see about getting in to see one to talk about what to do. Thanks again!  ",
