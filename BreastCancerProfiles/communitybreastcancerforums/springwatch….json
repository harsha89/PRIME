One asked when my treatment would finish and another still talks about being cured.  I just read that Bill Gates is giving $50 mill. to fight the ebola epidemic. Ebola has so far killed 2300. Metastatic breast cancer kills 40,000 a year in his own backyard. Over 1 million world wide. There will always be a competition for funds. I am not suggesting that those in the countries with ebola do not deserve help but you do wonder if all the media publicity is responsible for this decision. The bigger question, I feel, is how do we publicise MBC and attract more funding? I don't know how this can be done especially when my own friends don't get it. If it is correct that 1 in 3 women who have breast cancer will go on to develop metastatic disease than why are only 5% of the monies available for breast cancer research directed to treating this part of the disease? ",

Amongst them proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole and lansoprazole, used for treating gastric ulcers and acid reflux. I take the latter everyday so this may be contributing to the problem. Also H2 receptor antagonists (Tagmet, Pepcid and Zantac) can lower levels of Vit B12. I get an infusion of ranitidine  (Zantac) every week with my premeds before chemo!

I struggle to walk very far before I get pain in the fracture site.  I think the chances of me getting ritalin are pretty remote but I will ask when I go for my IV on Thurs. I did see that there are trials looking at ritalin for cancer fatigue and I hope that they get some positive results so they can offer this as a standard treatment for symptoms.  Tapering the dexamethasone is another thing I can look into. Thanks raro. Has anyone heard about using ginseng for cancer related fatigue?  Ginseng improves cancer related fatigue My only problem is that the trial is using American ginseng which is hard to get here. I can get Korean or Siberean ginseng easily. ",

As far as I can ascertain, there is only one study done in 2008 which finds a correlation between CEA and prognosis and that is only if the results are read in conjunction with CEA 15-3 levels.

I have always given in to her just for the sake of peace and often to simply move forward or get things done when she refused to cooperate in an effort to get her own way. Recently my sisters fell out with one another and one sister sent a letter very much like the one you seem to be writing to this difficult sister. Just to let you know that this letter was not received well. It was thoughtfully written and reaffirmed my sister's love for the other but because the other sister did not want to relinquish control of the dynamics of their relationship, she has severed all contact with my other sister and with me, too. She has lashed out at both of us even though I was very careful not to get involved. I think she believes that by withdrawing she will bring us to our \"senses\" and allow her to continue in some very bad behaviour.  I hope your sister is more mature and doesn't respond in the same way.

When these things happen try and ask your doctor more questions as to why they have ordered tests. It could save you a lot of anxiety. I know it is not always easy to do at the time because your mind goes into panic mood when you hear about anything new. I am sorry about your wound and the way you were treated. These things do take a long time to heal so try not to get too depressed about it. I know someone who had a TRAM flap that opened up and became infected. It took weeks to heal. She had to have it repacked everyday initially. Every other day at the hospital and the alternate days she did herself. I will contact her later and find out a bit more about what care she was given, including having the infected area cleaned. She never explained it in any detail except to say it had to be cleaned before repacking at the beginning. Just off for my scans now so don't have time to do it now. ",

I finally got my MRI results back which was ordered to see how well the chemo was working. The report came back showing further regression. Bones are stable. There has been more shrinkage in the liver mets; about 40% more. Was so excited I forgot to ask about my lung mets. I will have to check when I get the report but I assume they were unremarkable. The MRI was read by a specialist radiologist and he doesn't think there is active tumor in my pelvis - he thinks it is dead tumor. The orthopaedic surgeon had ordered a CT scan and the results suggested active disease. It is interesting that the two types of scan and the two radiologists didn't agree. I believe the MRI more than the CT. I have always had MRIs to monitor my disease and the same radiologist to read them each time. He is an expert in reading MRIs for cancer. All this means that we can go ahead with the surgery to replace the rod in my leg in about 2 weeks and I am going to carry on with gem/carbo after the operation. So pleased and happy as this is the first chemo that hasn't failed after just 6 cycles, like taxol and Xeloda did. Although to be fair the taxol did work initially. Xeloda did absolutely nothing. It was was fuel at the wild kegger party my liver mets had last year.",

There are all sorts of things that can cause pelvic pain but only a medic will be able to give you an answer to what is causing your pain. I hope your doctor can find the source of your problem soon and it turns out to be something which can be easily treated. ",

I would be interested to hear what the results were from your additional tests. I have been thinking of getting someone in to help with the house work but have no experience of doing this and somehow it seems symbolic of not being able to cope well. On the other hand, there are days when I seem welded to the chair in front of the TV and cannot do more than go to the bathroom and get myself a drink.

I hope you get approval to start Halaven soon. There is a website, www.halaven.com, which is owned by the manufacturers of this drug and has a lot of useful information if you want to take a look. I have no experience of this chemo so I am afraid I cannot be of much help. Good luck with the radioactive spheres on Feb 9. I am praying that they do a good job on your liver mets. Carla, Each of our cancers is unique to us. The classifications the oncologists give to our cancers is very broad and if we were able to look deep into the genetic profile of each of our cancers we would be able to see how they all differ. Just because someone does not respond to a particular chemo does not mean that it won't work for you. And if it doesn't, there are plenty more to try. You will find one that works and Adriamycin may be it. Helen, Your scan results belong to you as much as they do to your medical team. You are entitled to ask for a copy. Your chemo nurse or breast care nurse will be able to print off a copy, if you can't wait until the 17th Feb. The only thing I would add is that the radiologist's report can take some effort to interpret. Things that look alarming on first sight may be nothing to worry about. Leah, I hope that your scan results are better than stable. I am keeping you in my thoughts. Woody, Congratulations on your great results. WOW and I do mean WOW! your news is wonderful. How much of the 2 to 2½ hrs you mentioned for the PET scan is actually spent in the scanner? I got my scan results today. Good news. Regression in soft tissue tumours. Reduction in activity at all sites, including bone. Last sentence of report reads, favourable response in all disease sites. I am carrying on with gem/carbo. The only fly in the ointment is my HB which is sliding away, leaving me a bit breathless and tired. Some muttering about another blood transfusion. WBC and neutrophils are holding up. In contrast, my platelets are up again so I am going back onto the daily aspirin until they come back down to normal. I am grateful that we have found a chemo that is working.",

I came across this website: http://www.diffen.com/difference/CT_Scan_vs_MRI I have always had MRIs. This week was my 9th! I did have a couple of chest CT scans at the beginning but not since. As there is no ionizing radiation involved with the MRI, they can be repeated more frequently. Just as well as I have had a lot of radiotherapy this year. Obama's doctors probably wouldn't have a problem getting an MRI organised! Leftfoot, I agree also. No news is good news. Especially if your onc normally phones you when things are not right. Good luck with the brain surgery. Don't focus on the up coming op. but focus on where you will be when it is behind you. Hopefully in a very good place. SyrMom, I have neuropathy in both feet and get terrible cramps in these areas. My feet literally curl up sometimes and I have to leap up and walk around on them to get rid of the pain. I have not found anything that relieves the problem but can sympathise with what you are experiencing. Helen, I get bad pain at the site of my bone mets after my ibandronate infusion. I had it yesterday and woke up at 2:45am because my sacrum felt as someone had hit me with a hammer. It was throbbing. If I am not due to take more pain killers I find putting a microwavable heat pad on the area helps. My onc seems unconcerned. Bone pain after the infusion is common, apparently. It happens every time I get it but it will disappear in a few days. Then, I just have my 'normal' bone pain. Thanks again to everyone for your prayers and positive thoughts.",

My Hb has been low and I have been short of breath especially in the week following the carboplatin infusion. My onc suggested a blood transfusion last week but I was reluctant to give up a whole day to spend in hospital. If my Hb is still down next week I will probably go ahead with the transfusion. It's doing a good job on my cancer and I would be very upset to have it pulled because my bloods were poor. I hope your son is feeling better and you get the OK for that trip to the seaside. RonnieKay, I don't like liver. I have tried it several times over the years and have come to the conclusion it is not for me. The way some people can't stand Brussel sprouts, which I love. My father didn't like it either but it was one of my mother's favorites, although she rarely cooked it. My mother grew up on a farm, too, so maybe the outdoor life was a contributing factor in her liking this food item. SyrMom, I guess you will shortly know if the Adria hangover is responsible for your side effects. I hope that you enjoy your week off. I so look forward to mine. What sort of cycle on you on for your treatment? Two weeks on/one week off? Leah, My onc makes always biopsies any patient that returns to see him with MBC because of the concern that the hormone or HER2 profile has changed. I share your concerns about not treating with herceptin if the tumor is now HER2 positive. Well done for raising this with your doctor. We need to be our own advocates. Changes in receptor status are well documented. Jaytee, I am glad you have found someone to share your liver and onions. I can happily munch through the spinach salad, though. Now I want some.... must remember to add it to my shopping list. Take care everyone. ",

My oncologist vetoed the proximal femoral replacement and we are doing the hardware replacement operation instead - femoral nail exchange. They are removing the old broken hardware and refitting me with a wider rod and screws. There is no guarantee the problem won't happen again but I am keeping my fingers crossed. I can't have any surgery until after the 23rd when I have my next whole body MRI to see how the chemo is working. The reason is the one I mentioned before; no MRIs within 6 wks having new metal work put in. My surgeon is leaving for a conference on the 22nd and won't be back until the beginning of April. This means I am booked in provisionally for the 10th of next month. In the meantime, I am to stay as 'non-ambulatory' as possible and under strict instructions not to fall over. I am taking a lot of tramadol which is keeping the pain under control and spending too much time in bed which is frustrating as I feel otherwise well. I am going to complete my 6th cycle of gem/carbo before my next scans and the surgery later. Until I have the operation, my daughters are taking it in turns to run around after me while I sit back and do nothing. I went to X-ray yesterday to have a port check - it keeps refusing to let anyone do a blood draw, except on rare occasions. The radiologist gave it quick flush with saline and it gave blood at the first time of asking. It is a very temperamental port! The radiologist is happy for the port to be used still despite it's misbehaviour, which saves me having a new one put in. I couldn't have faced that with so much else going on.",

I will be starting taxol on Thurs and was wondering if the chemo helps. All feedback and suggestions for treatment will be very welcome. SW mets to lungs and bone (pelvis, spine, femur) .

Was it the CISH test that proved positive for HER2 or did it show up on the genomic profile, too. I am more than willing to pay for it. I had a bone biopsy done 15 months ago which showed I was now TN but for all sorts of reason I am not confident about this result. Even less so today as the biopsy was sent to the same hospital where I was admitted 2 weeks ago which failed to interpret my MRI correctly. Until I see the neurologist I cannot say for sure that it is the thrombosed vein which caused the seizure. It could be the irritated meninges. But the vein is the biggest issue at the moment because it could block completely and cause a major problem so we need to deal with that first. The brain MRI suggested that the skull met over the irritated meninges may be active again but we are not going to treat until I have seen the neurologist. It is so lovely to read that having got your Her 2 status sorted out that you are now NED. Long may it continue. Spring",

You are triple positive according to your bio and I would have thought he would have gone for a hormone therapy and targeted treatments for your HER2 + disease. Carboplatin is a harsh chemo especially on the bone marrow. My Hb levels have been very low on this chemo. Much lower than when I was on taxol. Someone above mentioned that about restricting carboplatin to 8 cycles. I am about to start my 9th cycle tomorrow and will carry on with it as long as it is effective.

I also wish that sometimes those not dealing with MBC were lost for words, too, but that is another story. I am watching out for the early signs of spring from my window. We have had some frost and a bit of snow here but you can see that spring is on the way. When I was having my IV yesterday I was able to look out into a quadrangle where a cherry tree was breaking into a mass of pink flowers. My daffodils are coming up but still some way from flowering and the snow drops under my apple tree have been in bloom for some time. The blackbirds have paired up and the robin has been making frequent visits to the garden making sure that another male doesn't muscle in on his territory. Our robin is very different from yours, which is a much larger thrush-like bird. Our European robin is a small, very territorial little bird. It has been known to fight and kill a rival but I have never seen this. Usually, one of them backs down very quickly. I miss the photos you took of your view down to Lake Champlain.

My younger daughter takes over responsibility from this evening. initforthefight, First of all welcome. As woody has suggested, you must insist on a biopsy of your mets especially as such a long time has elapsed between your primary diagnosis and finding the mets in your liver. They could have changed status. If you haven;t got it already email Bestbird and ask her to send you a copy of her Insider's guide to MBC. It has a lot of useful info. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topic/8... I would not be too alarmed at having to switch from oral to IV chemo. Chemo is chemo, whether you have it fed into a vein or take a tablet. IV chemos are not the last resort as your oncologist portrayed them. I started out on IV chemo (taxol) then switched to Xeloda (oral) which failed and like you I had significant progression, especially in my liver. I am now on gemzar/carboplatin, another IV chemo, which was working well at my last scans. Most oncologists would treat with hormone therapy or herceptin, a targeted therapy first if your cancer responded to either of these treatments but many oncologists will start with IV chemo and then switch to hormone or targeted therapy after. There are no hard and fast rules. Treatment for mets is a forever thing. There are very few cures when you reach this stage. Maybe 1% or 2% and they are usually those who have ogliometastatic disease, a subset of cancer patients who have maybe two or three mets which can be removed or agressively treated. A very few people who are HER2+ have also been able to get a total remission of their disease. Don't be too despondent at this time. There are plenty more treatments out there which can keep your cancer under control. ",

If you are still suffering from nausea and vomiting press your medical team to do something about it. There are many different meds out there for dealing with chemo induced nausea. Some people will respond better to one medication than another so it is worth pursuing this to find out what is right for you. Have they given you anything to take at home? I take odansetron. I am sorry that you are dealing with the stress of moving at this time, too. It can't help. Allyme, Regarding NED status, I prefer to think of it as no evidence of active disease. There is always some evidence of the disease whether it be damage to bones or scar tissue after the mets have been treated. The important thing is that you do not see any progression and your disease is under control or even better, regressing. It is not always possible to remove the tumor depending on it's location. In some cases removing it can be more problematic than leaving it for the chemo, targeted or hormonal therapy to work. Having said that, it is well worth getting an appt. with a interventional radiologist (IR) to see if you are a candidate for one of the treatments mentioned above. I hope an IR is able to offer you something positive. josalive, I would continue to try and get a second opinion. I am afraid I don't like the attitude of your oncologist. No one comes with an expiry date and there are many, many women here who have lived far beyond 14 to 16 mths with liver mets. A lot of research has gone into targeted therapies for HER2 positive cancers and they have been very successful in keeping this type of breast cancer under control. Roberta. The location of the pain does sound as if it is coming from the liver but without the scan it is impossible to tell exactly what is going on. I have had pain from liver met progression and liver met shrinking. I hope your scan today comes back with a good report. ",

My onc has had me doing both simultaneously. The CT scan of my pelvis ordered by my orthopaedic surgeon showed met activity at the site of the fracture. I have a whole body MRI later this morning ordered by oncologist to see how well the gem/carbo is working. The surgeon and onc have already spoken to each other. My onc wants to see what the MRI shows. The radiologist who read the CT is a generalist and doesn't see that many cancers, whereas the the radiologist who will read today's MRI is a specialist in reading MRIs for cancer, so we shall see. If it is cancer, the onc will arrange some more RT to my pelvis. The surgery is still booked about two weeks from now no matter what. Although I am apprehensive about the op, I am more frightened knowing that I am moving around on a leg which has a newly opened femoral fracture and is only being held together by a rod which we know is bent or broken!

      "Content": "May 14, 2014 03:25PM - edited May 14, 2014 03:53PM by springwatch Hi Brenda, My mets are in the bone and lungs. So far my lung mets have been asymptomatic but I have had a lot of pain and issues with my bone mets. My onc did a bone biopsy as the surgeon was going in to insert a femoral rod in my femur. It was when I started trying to find out more about bone biopsies that I found out just how unreliable poorly prepared tissue samples, bone in particular, are for measuring receptor status. My onc could order a biopsy of my lungs but I am having weekly taxol at the moment and we are hoping that the treatment will shrink my tumors. I would have to come off treatment while they did the biospy. It remains an option in the future and he has agreed to do one if we have a met that is easily accessible.  However given the circumstances surrounding my bone biospy, it seems likely that the receptors, if there were any, were destroyed by handling in the OR and subsequently in the path labs.  I took arimidex for 3 years but that failed. We don't know what came first, the bone mets or the lung mets. Personally, I am leaning on the side of the bone mets developing before the lung mets, as the bone mets are very extensive.  The Destiny study was small in number,about 121 participants, but there were two women who apparently converted from TNBC to ER+ disease. One of the conditions of the study was that there had to be archived tissue samples of the primary tumor available to study. When the original primary of these two women was re-examined it was ER+. True receptor discordance was not seen in any patient who was originally diagnosed with TN disease in their primary. In other words, the primary and the met were both TN. When you wrote that you had apparently converted from ER - to ER+, this study came to mind immediately.  I hope that your new treatment plan includes hormone therapy and this keeps you stable for a very long time.  Edited to add:  Tumors are genetically unstable. They can change from HER2 + to HER2 -, and visa versa. Loss of hormone receptors is seen more frequently than gaining a hormone receptor. Loss of the PR receptor is seen more frequently than loss of the ER receptor. ",

I have not read anything to date that suggests you can get a false positive result because of technical issues in the pathology labs.  Chemo will work for hormone + and TNBC, especially higher grade, rapidly dividing tumours. If you get to NED or stable after your chemo it is possible that your onc will suggest going onto one of the anti-hormonals because you have tested positive in your lymph node. I am sure he will monitor you while you are taking them.  I haven't heard of using a blood test to analyse receptors before so I will be interested in you results.",

One suggestion - use a soft toothbrush or take care if you brush your teeth aggressively so you don't cause abrasions which can lead to some very painful sores around the gums while having this medication. Also, I used a mouthwash that you can buy over the counter which contains chlorhexidine. It helped my mouth sores but it did sting sometimes. SyrMom, I think raised liver function tests are not uncommon with doxorubicin. Ask your chemo nurse or oncologost who will be able to put your mind at rest. I am joining next week's scanner party.

SyrMom, I have had some rough moments on gem/carbo. A few days when I have had no energy and find if I stand too long I can feel a faint. My blood work has been all over the place and I had to see a hematologist who just thinks my bone marrow is over-reacting to the chemo. My HB and neutrophils have been low but so far not outside the normal range. My platelets have been the problem. Low one week and then more than twice normal the next. As long as the chemo is working, I should start my 4th cycle on Thurs. I have managed to get a lot done these last few days as I had no treatment last week. I am finding it tougher than taxol which has been my favourite chemo, so far. I hated and I do mean hated, Xeloda. I felt terrible the whole time I took it and it was almost a relief when I found out it wasn't working for me and I switched to gem/carbo. I have never had a PET CT. My onc uses MRI and a standard CT with contrast to measure my lung mets, although he hasn't booked me in for the latter this time. I think he is more concerned with my liver. My lung mets have been stable after initial regression. I would be interested to know how long a PET CT takes. The MRI lasts almost an hour. They have installed a new MRI machine and upgraded the two others they have at my centre. I have been told that it will only take about 40 mins this time around. I don't know why but I have started to feel more and more claustrophobic in those things. I think I will have to ask for an eye mask on Wed. and see if that helps.",

You have enough to deal with. I am one of three sisters. Our middle sister had a troubled relationship with our mother. Myself and my other sister do not really understand why she became like she did but her treatment of our mother was just awful. She blamed our mother for most of what has gone wrong in her life while taking no responsibility for her own actions. I cannot be sure if that is the situation in your case but if it is try and ignore it. It is not about you. Jaytee, I hope you are managing your injections OK. There is really nothing to them once you have done a couple yourself. Joy, Sorry you have had progression with liver mets. If there are two discreet lesions maybe they can do radiotherapy. It is worth asking. In the meantime, I hope the Xeloda works for you. It did nothing for me but I have heard some people get a very good run on it. We had a lady on this side of the Atlantic who got 8 years out of Xeloda following progression to her liver. As I said it doesn't work for everyone, myself included, but for those it does work for it works very well. Chichi, I hope you get clear results on your thyroid. I had was diagnosed with nodules about 14 years ago. They were all benign thankfully and the doctor said that even if they showed cancer the cure rate for this type of cancer was very high. As that was 14 years ago, I am sure things have much improved since then. Leah, What can I say but good luck with your biopsy today. I hope it all goes well and possibly gives you another line of treatment to explore. Benjnate, Well it is 41°F here today so if I do step out the door I won't freeze or fall on any ice or snow. I do hope the weather improves where you are soon. That message goes to everyone else experiencing bad weather at the moment. I am still watching for signs of spring! It seems a lot of us are suffering with back and leg pain at the moment. I have an appt to see the surgeon who put in my femoral rod nearly a year ago but not until Thurs. evening. I am seeing my oncologist on Thurs morning so I should be getting any input from him before that appt. My painkillers are not really helping. It hurts to walk on it. This morning I woke up and it looks like I have half of Beyonce's butt stuck to my own backside. Definitely some kind of inflammation, but why?? I hope it is something easily relieved.",

My onc will definitely want the mri so we can decide on what to do next. More gem/carbo, just gem, a new treatment schedule or a new chemo. It all hangs on that MRI. ",

Only about 1% are cured once they get to stage IV but many, many here have lived with liver mets for years. You only have to read through the forum to see this has happened more times than you would expect. Your dx sounds similar to mine. ER+ at primary at primary diagnosis and TNC when I had my bone biopsied for my stage IV mets. I took arimadex (anastrozole) for three years and was told I should discontinue once we knew the ER status has changed. It clearly wasn't influencing my cancer or I wouldn't have gone onto develop mets. Your onc is retesting for HER2 as it can change status from negative to positive and visa versa. I have read that this particularly true with liver mets, occurring in about 25% of cases. Being Her2 +ve can open up a whole new lines of therapy which has been shown to be very effective.

I hope that the bone scan shows nothing going on and that the pain in your back is just muscle spasm or something similar. If your son offers to take you to Hong Kong and you feel up for it, you should go. I have been twice. I know someone who lived out there and they described it as 24 hour Disneyland and of course, the Chinese food there is the best. I see my onc frequently. He has all his chemo patients in on the same day for treatment and comes in to review their blood work and side effects on a weekly basis. He is occasionally away on vacation or attending lectures but the nurses have said that he is always available by phone, if needed. Bonski, I would get a second opinion on the chemo. Triple negative means the only options you have for treatment are chemo and radiotherapy. I understand that your onc is hoping that the cyberknife will deal with your still small liver mets but I would want the chemo after having cyberknife to mop up any circulating tumor cells before they have a chance to find a home elsewhere. Unless I develop new symptoms, I have MRI scans roughly every 18 weeks. I did not have any scans between finishing treatment for my primary and developing pain with bone mets. I am very fortunate that my oncologist is able to refer my case to the clinical lead at the center where I am treated for a second opinion, if needed. This oncologist has 25 years experience in breast cancer and comes with some impressive credentials, so I trust his advice.",

I want to say hello to our newcomers and say that I am sorry they have found themselves here. I haven't posted for some time as all hell has been let loose here. I had a focal seizure about two weeks ago and was admitted to hospital for 24 hrs. The seizure didn't last long, about 30 seconds. I was admitted to the stroke unit and had a brain CT followed by an MRI. The brain MRI did not find anything in my brain but the dr. there told me the cancer was in my meninges so I thought I had LM mets. I was discharged back to my onc. for follow up. He works at a different hospital and when he requested my scans from the first hospital they wouldn't let him have them unless I went down there in person and paid $50. Rather than messing around any more my onc ordered another brain MRI which I had done yesterday. I haven't had the full results but i did get a phone call from my onc to say that the MRI they did showed irritation to the meninges under a previously treated skull met but more seriously a narrowed, partially thrombosed large vein on top of my brain. How the first hospital missed this I will never know. I think they just automatically assumed because I have stage iv cancer they didn't have to look any further for a cause. My onc was furious and has arranged an appt. with a neurologist to try and get this treated. It is not cancer related. The first hospital gave me phenytoin, an anti-seizure medication which has a side effect of causing bone thinning. Just what I need with a family history osteoporosis and bony mets. I am hoping to get it changed when I see the neurologist. I also had a whole body MRI last week to see if my chemo is working. My bone mets are stable, My lung mets are insignificant but my liver mets have come roaring back after showing regression on the previous two scans. My onc is arranging a liver biopsy to see if my mets have changed status. Oh - I almost forgot my magnesium levels were so low on my last blood tests that I am now on supplements. One thing after another. Woody, you mention ky genomic testing. What is that? I googled and didn't get very much on it. Why did your doctor decide to do this test as well as the FISH test?",

Quality of life is about being able to do the things you want to do sometimes, rather than being always tied down by hospital appointments. If your onc approves it, enjoy! Another forum member, English Major, posted a link to the LBBC conference that took place a few days ago.  How Far We've Come: Advances in Management of Metastatic Breast Cancer It is a bit \"technical\" but very interesting and informative. The segment on TN starts about 45 mins into the talk. Lots of interesting work going on and mention of trials.  The Q & A, which follows, is well worth a listen, too. I was interested in her response to the question on the changes in receptor status & bone biopsies which require decalcifiction giving false negative receptor status. Also, the use of tumor marks in monitoring Stage IV disease. It has made me relax a bit more about mine. ",

There are a few new names here, so first of all hello to the newbies on this thread. Penny, I think of you often. I am glad you are home and hope you are getting plenty of rest. Praying for lower bilirubin levels on Monday. Ella, thank you for the story of the young mother. It was uplifting. I met a lovely young woman when I was having radiotherapy treatment for my primary. She was pregnant with her first child when she discovered a lump in her breast. Her doctor insisted it was related to the pregnancy but she knew instinctively it wasn't. She finally had a mammogram just before she was full term and they discovered a large tumor. Her pregnancy was induced, she had a lovely baby boy, and days later she had a mastectomy. She was frankly terrified that she would not see her little boy grow up but just two weeks ago I ran into in the cafe at the hospital. She is doing well on tamoxifen. Seeing her again made me so happy that day. I haven't heard of anyone doing navelbine and tykerb together. Have you thought of starting a new thread asking if there is anyone else? There could be someone who is just reading here and missed that you are doing this combo. They might respond to a more direct topic header. SyrMom, I am on gemzar/carboplatin combo. I am on a 3 week cycle. First week is both drugs and second week is gemzar only. Third week is no treatment. I have just started my 8th cycle and have to say that the gemzar only week is much easier. I am on my 3rd line of chemo since being diagnosed with mets a little over a year ago and this one has proved the most effective so far. I have had regression on my last two scans but I cannot tell and neither can my doctor which of these two drugs is proving to be the most effective. Benjnate, Hurray for getting rid of that stressful journey! It must have been terrible last winter when you had all that snow to deal with too. I hope the move goes smoothly. Sandilee, So sorry to read of your progression to liver mets. They seem very small from your description and should not really be giving you too much pain. I have been told by several people the hospital that most liver pain comes from the liver capsule being stretched. When Xeloda failed me completely, it never worked, my mets grew to several cms and caused a lot of pain in my URQ both front and back. I could also feel how hard and rigid my liver had become. The edge of it was palpable. However, each of us are an individual and it could be this is how your body is responding. I should also add that a couple of days after starting my current chemo combo (gem/carbo) the pain increased substantially. Happily that was the chemo doing it's worst on the mets. Shetland Pony, Wow! Complete metabolic response to taxol. Congratulations! Debbie, good luck with those scan results on Monday. I hope they indicate a good response. JFL, In addition to the liver being able to function with quite a low percentage of normal tissue, it also has an excellent capacity to regenerate itself if there is not too much scarring involved! Not much news from me. I had a phone call from the hospital late Thursday evening to ask me to call in the following day as my magnesium was a bit low and they wanted to start me on supplements. Looking at the dose they have given me It was more than a bit low! I'll find out for sure next week when I meet with my onc. I'm taking advantage of the steroid buzz and having one hand free while I am moving around the house now to get a few jobs done that have been outstanding and which only I can really deal with. Sorry again if I missed anyone out. ",

Cancer cells can spread through the lymph and vascular systems. We all know that we find cancer in lymph nodes and the blood. The interest in liquid biopsy and circulating tumor cells would not have come about if the cancer cells were not present in the latter. I can understand the concerns of some who feel that pushing around the lymph fluid during massage may be causing the cancer to spread. However, the lymph and blood are not static systems, They are constantly moving around our bodies no matter what. I wouldn't have lymphatic massage to a leg or arm where there is active cancer. Not because of the risk of spread but because of the inflammation in the area from the cancer could be made worse by the treatment. Just my point of view.",

Side effects and how it will effect our disease. leftfootforward, Congratulations on your good scan results!! freebird, I don't have anything to add to what others and yourself have written about how to deal with your situation. It must have felt like a huge kick in the teeth. You can't change other people but you can change how you react to them to minimise any damage. Reading your recent posts, I think you have sorted that out for yourself. I haven't been on for a few days as I have been struggling with the side effects of the my gem/carbo. I was SOB earlier this week. I was fine sitting and resting but sounded like I had some sort of COPD disease when I struggled the short distance to the use the toilet. I briefly considered just peeing myself but knew I wouldn't have the energy to change out of any wet clothes. That lasted about 2 days and I am feeling much better now so we went ahead with my second cycle of gem this morning. My onc asked if I wanted a blood transfusion but as I am feeling better I postponed it. I am coming up to my week off treatment and don't want to spend a day in hospital for the BT, if I am managing OK now. Regarding navelbine and periwinkles, I have always been interested in where some of our chemo drugs come from. Halaven came originally from a sea sponge but is now made synthetically. Doxil was a bacterium found in soil and I think someone else has mentioned the relationship between the taxanes and Western yew. There is a project called Drugs from Dirt. It's not just looking for chemo treatments but other drugs as well. You can sign up and send a sample from your local area. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-30877343 http://www.drugsfromdirt.org/  ",

I think you are doing the right thing moving nearer your family and doctors, particularly if the winter weather is bad. Ronnie, You are so busy! I would check with your drs about the blurry vision. If you have had it before from allergies than it likely to be the same cause again. My eyes have been very dry and itchy. 80% is probably pollen allergy and 20% chemo, I think. It does make my vision blurry at times. With all our concerns of cancer, we can lose site of the fact that we can still get the run of the mill illnesses, such as cold, flu and allergies. You mentioned zero lymph from your previous biopsies. Researchers are looking into this. The theory is that having lymph nodes is a positive. Lymph nodes are doing their job catching these rogue cells before they spread. So now they have started to ask what is special about the cancer cells from people who have stage iv but no lymph node involvement and if they find the reason, could it become a new way of treating the disease? SyrMom, Are they going to do anything for you apart from the titrated steroids? Sorry you are suffering.  I saw my orthopaedic surgeon yesterday. He wants me to have a CT scan of the fracture in my pelvis. The radiologist's report said it could be a fracture or it could be a recurrence of the cancer in that area (inflammation). It was a known met site when I was first diagnosed. The surgeon is pretty sure it is an insufficiency fracture from the disease and previous radiotherapy to the area and the radiologist is just covering himself by suggesting the CT to get a differential. The MRI of my femur showed NED so that lends weight to the fracture hypothesis. I probably won't get the result until after the weekend. He is in OR all this afternoon and evening. Anyway, I now have a whole 5 wks off treatment. Next week is the normal week off in my cycle. Then two weeks off before surgery to let my bloods recover in preparation. Another two weeks off after for a bit of healing. it is the longest I have been off treatment! I have a whole body MRI on Monday to see how the gem/carbo is working but as I feel reasonably well, I am hopeful. My eldest is coming for a visit next week and staying until after Easter. She has morning sickness and is really suffering with it. They sent her home from work twice this week. Running around after my 3 yo grandson isn't helping matters when he is not in nursery and she needs to rest. I am trying to be sympathetic but I may not be doing a good job. I am getting excited by the prospect of a new grandchild.",

Dose Adjustments Based on Granulocyte Counts: If the granulocyte count on the day of treatment is greater than or equal to 1500 cells/m3, then 100% of the starting dose may be administered. If the granulocyte count on the day of treatment is 1000 to 1499 cells/m3, then 50% of the starting dose may be administered. If the granulocyte count on the day of treatment is less than 1000 cells/m3, then do not administer. Repeat granulocyte count in one week. If three consecutive weekly doses are held because granulocyte count is less than 1000 cells/mm3, discontinue vinorelbine. For patients who, during treatment with vinorelbine experienced fever and/or sepsis while granulocytopenic or had two consecutive weekly doses held due to granulocytopenia, subsequent doses of vinorelbine should be as follows: If the granulocyte count on the day of treatment is greater than or equal to 1500 cells/m3, then 75% of the starting dose may be administered. If the granulocyte count on the day of treatment is 1000 to 1499 cells/m3, then 37.5% of the starting dose may be administered.

      "Content": "May 14, 2014 08:10AM springwatch wrote: Brenda, I converted from being ER+ with my primary to ER- after a bone biopsy on my mets. My oncologist is now treating my disease as TNC. BUT I have a big question, are my mets truly ER negative? It was taking a long time for my biopsy results to come through because, according to my oncologist, the biopsy had to be de-calcified. I began to look up how long that process would take because I was anxious to get the results and what I found gave me pause for thought. (Below is some of what I found, sorry it is long!) In my case, it seems likely that the biopsy may not have been treated correctly. I had my surgery at one of the satellite hospitals nearby which does not have a big path lab, certainly not one that does receptor status. I went to down to OR at about 5pm. on a Friday. It is very likely that the biopsy sat on the side, hopefully in buffered formalin, until the following morning at the earliest when it was sent to the main hospital. The main hospital has a weekend, not a full service, working on Saturdays. If you read below, the optimum time for fixation of of tissue to test for ER receptors is 6 to 18 hours. Less than that or more than that can result in a false negative. De-calcification of bone samples will also result in a loss of receptors.  If there was any chance that your primary tissue sample was treated sub-optimally, it may have given a false negative.  Although there is no question that receptors can change and some of these changes can accounted for by biological (true change in receptors) others maybe the result of technical issues giving rise to false negatives.  The DESTINY study published at the end of 2011 found that in 2 cases where the receptors changed from ER- to ER+, a re-examination of the original primary showed ER+ disease. Interesting, no? I discussed this with my oncologist and he has agreed that if we have an easily accessible tumour we will do another biopsy. At the moment, I am on weekly taxol and have bone and lung mets. He hasn't rescanned since I started treatment but I am in favor of treating aggressively, in any event.  Finally, congratulations on being found ER+. Many more treatment options will be available to you.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is some of what I found. Elizabeth L. Wiley, MD, director of surgical pathology at the University of Illinois, Chicago College of Medicine, spoke to technologists and pathologists at Leica Microsystems\u2019 Broad Spectrum Histology Symposium Oct. 9 in Chicago. An edited transcript of her lecture, \u201cBreast Cancer: Prognostic Markers, Fixation, and Processing,\u201d follows. Added Jan 2008. From lab to lab, service to service, person to person, there are many factors that can affect estrogen receptor testing: who is grossing, whether it is a weekend or a weekday, what type of specimen, what fixative is being used, etc. Once the immunohistochemical stains are done, how they are read and reported also vary from service to service. Let us look at preanalytical factors affecting estrogen receptor determination. Even the time that a breast cancer sits in the operating room or on the laboratory bench can affect the results of estrogen receptor testing. Estrogen receptor degrades in unfixed tissue. Tissue sitting at room temperature for four to five hours loses a significant amount of estrogen receptor. It\u2019s very, very important to get the tissue from the patient to the pathology laboratory and from the grossing bench into fixative as soon as possible. If you\u2019ve got a surgery service that operates late into the evening, you need to make arrangements with the OR staff to make sure the tissue is attended to, gets into fixative, and doesn\u2019t sit overnight degrading. The type of fixative also has an impact on the results of estrogen receptor determination. Most labs use 10 percent buffered formalin. It\u2019s a great general fixative. It doesn\u2019t make the tissue too hard, and it fixes tissue reasonably quickly. Optimum fixation time for estrogen receptor activity is between six and 18 hours for buffered formalin. Less than that and more than that, you\u2019re going to get a diminution in estrogen receptor or even a false-negative. The optimum fixation time also includes processor time. Consider your tissue is sitting in a processor over the weekend in 10 percent buffered formalin for up to 48 hours. You may well end up with false-negative reactivity or at least lowered estrogen receptor reactivity in breast cancer. Too little fixation is also a problem. It is a problem that I encountered in testing for estrogen receptor on breast cores. Our breast cores on the biopsy processor were getting a total of eight to 10 hours of fixation. The laboratory changed its procedure and started processing immediately after loading biopsy tissue. All of a sudden my breast cores were getting only two to six hours of fixation. And there was a falloff in estrogen receptor activity. You want to avoid fixatives that go below pH range of 7.4. Decalcification procedures also destroy estrogen receptor. If you are dealing with bone marrow biopsies or bones where there is a question of metastatic breast disease, you need to talk to your hematopathologist about setting up an alternative protocol so that you have some tissue associated with the bone marrow that hasn\u2019t gone through decalcification. ________________________________________________________ When to order a biopsy to characterise a metastatic relapse in breast cancer  T. Foukakis,G. Åström, L. Lindström, T. Hatschek and J. Bergh ESMO Congress Vienna, Austria 28 September \u2013 2 October 2012  why is there discordance in receptor status? The multitude of studies carried out (13 studies with 1773 patients for ER and 23 studies with 2845 patients for HER2) unequivocally demonstrate the discrepancy of receptor status between primary tumours and relapses (Tables 1 and 2). However, the reason for this discrepancy is less clear and both technical and biological explanations have been discussed. The use of various methods for ER (biochemical versus IHC assays) and HER2 (IHC versus FISH), the variability caused by sampling methods [fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy versus surgical excision in the primary tumour] and differences in analysis of samples from different tissues are all possible technical caveats that could cause a false discrepancy. In the study by Amir et al. [36] discussed above, it was shown that FNA and biopsy of bone led to reduced ability to analyse receptors. Even when the same analytic method is used, the reproducibility is suboptimal, especially for ER determination [39], but to some degree also for HER2 [40], which could lead to a false discrepancy rate. ________________________________________________________ A report on the medical advances that have extended survival and quality of life for women living with metastatic breast cancer and a look at promising new research direction. Confirmed Speaker: Julie R. Gralow, MD Director, Breast Medical Oncology, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance Clinical Research Division, Member, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Professor, Medical Oncology Division, University of Washington School of Medicine Streamed live on Apr 26, 2014 (my transcript of Dr Gralow's answer in response to biospy of metastatic disease) I am on the side of at first metastatic recurrence if you can biopsy it, one prove it is metastatic disease and two reconfirm what the ER and HER2 are because it can change. And then after a period of time when the tumour maybe has had many therapies and now it is progressing again, reconsider another biopsy because it could have changed. I think in the United States most of the thought leaders of breast cancer are leaning toward recommending not just a biopsy at recurrence but periodically over the course of metastatic disease. I know we shouldn\u2019t base out practice on single case anecdotes, but just last week I had a patient who all of sudden now with the new biopsy converted to being HER2 positive and she was clearly HER2 negative before and now I have all these other treatment options I can offer her. Bone biopsies are hard. A lot of times if you do a core biopsy of the bone and you have to decalcify, it will make the staining be negative even when the tumour is not really negative, so it is complicated to do.And be careful when you do bone biopsies. We actually do aspirates and we have a very dedicated group where they don\u2019t have to get the calcium out of the bone so they don\u2019t have to process it the same way. And we get much more reliable staining. I have had patients who have had bone biopsies that have said it is ER negative and I have said that doesn\u2019t make any sense. And we have gone in done it by just pulling out cells and staining them it is still ER positive. It is actually a fluke of the way we have to process the bone. So be careful with bone biopsies.",

This woman has overstepped the mark more than once in various areas of her son\u2019s and my daughter\u2019s lives. I have always stayed out of their disputes when she has tried to interfere. But this time she really has gone too far. She was asked not communicate my diagnosis to her family members. My daughter and SIL told her they would prefer to communicate the information themselves\u2013 mostly on a need to know basis. My daughter has discovered that she has told all and sundry about my cancer in order to get them to put pressure on her to put pressure on me to disclose what plans I have made after I have gone. She has spoken directly to my daughter to tell her I need to get my affairs in order; especially my financial affairs. Including advice about what I should do and .. WAIT for IT\u2026 suggestions as to who should have control of the money! I hope I can share with you just how angry I am about this. It has nothing to do with her! Unfortunately given her track record, it is clear that she is looking to make sure that her own future is secured through my money or more specifically what part of my money she can count on her son having to pay for her old age. I haven\u2019t spoken to her since I learned about all this.

Acknowledge their hurt feelings if they need to have them acknowledged but don't take sides and stay well away from sorting out their argument for them.  Don't tell your son that he is being stupid and stubborn (even if he is) or tell your daughter that she needs to be the one to make more effort to put this right (not saying you would but as she seems to be more amenable to sorting this out she could be putting pressure on herself already).   Turn the focus on how all this makes you feel. Express the pain this is causing you in a neutral fashion. Say things like, 'when you argue, it makes me unhappy and sad'. 'It upsets me that we cannot all be together'.  Say that all you are hoping for is that you can all be together for a bbq or a day by the lake occasionally, without revisiting the argument which caused them to fall out with each other in the first place. They don't have to be friendly with each other, if they feel they can't do that, just be there altogether for you.  Maybe in time they will start talking to each other again and their relationship will begin to repair itself.
