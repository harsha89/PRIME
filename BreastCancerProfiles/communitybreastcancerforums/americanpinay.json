The PET scan showed increased activity in the lymph nodes in the right and left neck as well as a \"newly visualized\" thyroid nodule...yikes...so of course more tests (although the following blood test showed that tumor markers have returned to the 20+ range) I had a nuclear bone scan which showed uptakes in the thoracic area but nothing on the neck...so then I had a thoracic MRI as follow up for the bone scan and ultrasound-guided biopsies of the thyroid nodule and the right neck lymph nodes (the ultrasound can no longer find whatever was going on in the left lymph nodes) as follow up for the PET scan... Verdict: negative for malignancy...no evidence of metastatic breast carcinoma... Of course I am really thankful for the end result and for my onc's proactive approach and vigilance but am having some serious doubts about whether the tests, the waiting, the swollen neck after biopsy and the emotional toll of it all is worth it...I wanted to tell my onc no more blood tests as long as no symptoms...but didn't...augghhh... Lessons learned: things show up on scans that are not necessarily cancer...there is a price for vigilance...accept new normal...life goes on... Thanks for listening.  Love and healing to all. Footnote: Except for minor aches and pains from Tamoxifen, I am doing well two years and four months past diagnosis. Yay!

A slightly hypermetabolic (SUV 3) borderline sized right neck posterior triangle lymph node measuring 4 mm in short axis  Med onc asked if I had a cold or infection when I had the scan done (of course I don't remember). He did physical exam of lymph nodes in the neck and can't find anything. He thinks radiologist \"over\" read the film but recommends a follow-up PET/CT scan in three months to monitor. 2. A small 4 mm focus of sclerosis along the lower left posterior T1 vertebral body, without abnormal FDG activity (non-hypermetabolic) Med onc recommended a bone scan and MRI to determine whether bone island or sclerotic metastasis. I am now nrevous that additional things will show up on bone scan and MRI that didn't show on PET? What is the likelihood of that??? Thanks for your help.
