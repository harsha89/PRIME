They did a mammagram of my leaft breast, and I had a plaster with the numbing solution in it for about 45mins.They then did an ultasound of the affected breast and the dreaded biopsy. This involved making a small incision  and then doing two biopsy needle things which reminded me a bit of an ear piercing gun.Very quick, like a stapler sound.Not painful. Had I not been needle phobic, I'm sure this would have all have been fine to deal with, so don't worry guys. However, the nurse said I topped their scales on needle phobia. First I was hyperventalating, jumpy, and sure I couldn't do it.My husband was holding my hand that was behind me, I was squeezing the stess toy(which helped)and the nurse was holding onto that hand. The whole time I was letting out a primal scream type moan,very panacky. They would't give me valium or xanax, maybe they will next time.Apparently a lot of people say they are needle phobic but when it comes down to it they are fine. I don't know how I'm going to cope with all that is to come. ",

I'm starting with chemotherapy for 4-6 attempts(or months);my tumour will shrink from 12cms to very small.I will then have a macectomy which includes the lymph nodes as that is standard practice for this size.Then apparently radio therapy; & then review the following treatment (hormone; the amazing antibodi which is'nt like chemotheapy whin starts with Hy. further chemothrapy) .It will take 1-2 years(if I do breast reconstuction). O.K. when the cancer treatment works i will be here in 10 years time. I've had a continual stream of visitors.  I fell like I've been given the full cancer works.

Usually with core biopsy do you lie flat,or sit up? How long does it last?(I need to prepare my brain to endurance mode) How many times do they stick the needle in?  I can't believe so many women go through this.I only learnt how to switch the computer on a year ago and then have shopped for bargains on e-bay ever since. This is the first time I've ever used a chat room andit's incredible. One thing that may make others laugh is how sweaty my armpits were when the breast surgeon was feeling my lymph nodes there. He had to ask the nurse for a tissue and I had had a shower just before I went.He said it must my state of anxiety and told me not to worry, and it was embarassing.Am I alowed to wear deoderant tomorrow? ",

When I woke up in the morning my mood was fine again, accept feeling embarassed about crying in the road and hoping the neighbours weren't in! And also embarassed about writing that post. In retrospect, I'd had too many beers, the party had been a bit too much of me being hostess with the mostess and had been 8 hours long. In a way it let out the inhibitions to have a really good wailing cry and feel sorry for myself time.I like that about detoxing the emotions.It helps to know that so many of you have been through the same thing. Thanks for all your coments, and sorry again for writing such a depressing post. Jacqubutterfly.",

When the moment came I was crying, Hyperventalating and saying I couldn't do it. I shut my eyes and kind of primal screamed, but it got done. I have breast cancer, and they will need to do a full masectomy with lymph nodes. First I'm going to have 4-6 rounds of chemotherapy to shrink the 12cm lump.A lumpectomy doesn't seem viable as other cancer looking things  showed up on the ultrasound.I'll probably have radio therapy after that. In two days I will get knocked out in hospital with gas so I'm not aware of the needles.I will have an intravenous port put in under my skin by my collar bone & further biopsys done.They will leave the canula in my arm so that I can have a port for the dye for the bone marrow and vital organ scan. The chemo doctor will visit me and explain that, which I believe starts next week. ",

I'm posting again todaay because people with trueneedle phobia like me will log on and see this one day, and I think it important to write down the positive things when they happen. My subcutaneous port works for the chemo 3 & 1/2 hour infusion, but does not give blood.It did innitially, but the last two blood draws had to be done by needle. The nurses and all staff acknowledge that I am an extreme needlle phobic. Actually top of there scale.I have  a need to sort of primal screem  in a controlled moan every time. I think they are pleased I don't run away and yet I know I can refuse treatment at any time. Today for the second blood draw from my arm I loaded my vein area with a whole tube of emla for 1 1/2 hours before ( this is the first day I haven't felt it)I had an anti anxiety pill as well.The chemotherapy is 'doable' and you do get used to the baldness. I thought I' d be over the needle phobia by now, and so did the nurses, but I can only say that it has barely deminished. Surely I'm not alone in this.Do anyone else feel the same? ",

I live in Guernsey in the channel islands between Brittany and the mainland Britain.I'm from a small island community of 60,000 people, and there is only limited medical whatsits, although I'm sure they are all fantastic at what they do. I'm lucky in that surgery, and possible chemotherapy is available on the island; although for radio therapy and breast resconscruction I would have to go on an aeroplane. I think I'm still in the shock stage. I'm continuing with a recognisable routine which around this time of year involves having a couple of beers and putting all at ease.Actually I'm smoking rather a lot of cigarrettes as well, which I know is naughty and that I'll be admonished , and my friend said he'd wheel me out in a wheelchair to the smoking area with leads and all.You have to laugh.I think I'll opt for the nicorette inhalor. The children are asking for more chocolate.I'm intermitantly cleaning areas of the house that need to be as clean as a hospital , sitting in the smoking consevatory with a cup of de-caffeinated tea, and staring into space with the occassional tear. Yes I will get the biopsy done , I needed some way of getting brave.I thought I'd ask them to knock me out and do everything they needed to do when I was asleep.That doesn't seem as reasonable now. I'm going to live for the moment which seems like really good advice. My husband's bringing the little one to bed now. ",

Seeing as I'm needle phobic they reckon they will leave it in for 5 years just incase the cancer comes back and they need it again. Can't just take it out and put another one inthe same place apparently. If my needle phobia was 100% before all this treatment;Youl'd think that after exposiuor to the fear it would have deminished. I wishfully, positively thought, reasoned it away. I'd say the needle phobia has only diminished by about 10% on a brave day.  The after care involves blood tests twice a year or somthing and it's still hard to bear. Thank goodness needle phobics are far and few between!",

I think the doctor was 100% sure partly because my grandmother died of breast cancer when she was 54 after it had spread to her bones, and I have an aunty who has survived it.Also because the lump has been growing steadily for a year and is the size of an orange,hard and irregular,with another lemon wedge one next to it, with an indentation in the breast where it's attached to tissue. Must have been from her experience,there seems to be some urgency to get it removed quickly and maybe she wanted our family to get the shocked part out of the way so that treatment can start quickly.I have 32dd bra size and the lump is obvious without having to feel for it. I wont look at the needle, I'll try the yoga breathing it did help while giving birth and I have practiced yoga for 12 years.I thought that yoga, swimming and going to the gym would be preventative medicine for this kind of thing.My mum calls it the Kampen curse (my mum's maiden name).I have lived a healthy lifestyle, I suppose you can't escape genetics. I will make the medical staff aware of the needle phobia and maybe sedatives are a good idea, I don't mind nausea and have got a relatively high pain threshhold. For me, entering this world of surgery and tests is like volunterily entering the tourture chamber.I like spiders and snakes, but it would be like being afraid of that spider in the bath, and then being made to sleep in a bed of tarantulas. ",
