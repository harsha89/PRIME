Please take the time to check out the various reconstructions offered if you would choose to do masectomy. That might help you in your decision? My MRI did not show all of my cancer, go figure! Mine was ILC, which is in sheets? Or so that is my understanding. I originally had partial masectomy (aka lumpectomy) and they did both sides at time time with a lift to make the breasts match. I forget the name of the procedure. One breast had cancer, the other did not, but they weren't going to leave me lopsided, (and by law insurance must cover this). Anyhow, they found three additional spots of cancer in the margins , which left my margins smaller than they liked, so they wanted to go back in for wider margins. Instead, I am opting for masectomy with DIEP reconstruction. DIEP uses belly fat/tissues/blood vessels to build new breasts. I am finishing chemo in the next month, and then will be setting up my surgery. Not everyone has the same treatment protocols. You are wise to be reading these boards so you can get all your questions lined up. Keep in mind that not all doctors can do the different procedures you might be interested in, so you might have to find another doctor that will be able to do what makes you happy. For example, my original plastic surgeon, that did my reconstruction and lift when the breast surgeon finished her part of the surgery, is unable to do the type of reconstruction I would like. I learned about DIEP from these board. The plastic surgeon never offered it to me as an option! She did offer implants (im not interested) or a reconstruction that involved belly fat and muscle, which I don't want to touch my core muscle as I have a bad back! Continue reading, and I am sure there will be more people here to offer some input. Pat",

I would imagine if you saw the surgeon first, and they don't like what they visually see on the outside MAYBE you would get a surgery date sooner? That is really hard to say. My BS (breast surgeon) had a wait list for \"new patients\"...thankfully I had seen her a few years prior for a scare, so was seen a few months sooner, rather than later. Another way to consider doing it is to book your mammo, then call BS and book them...giving enough time for results to be sent. Thenif your appointment date you \"pre-booked\" can be changed if Maybe they will bump you to front of line if it looks like cancer? Radiologist are not supposed to say anything much. They will definitely tell you to follow up with surgeon. I had one tell me my surgeon does too many biopsies...well it was the biopsy that proved it to be cancer...needless to say I never went there again! I hate to say that the majority of this ordeal is waiting. Or so it seemed to be to me. Wait for mammo Wait to see surgeon Wait for additional mammo with biopsy Wait for MRI wait for mammo,biopsy and placement of marker Wait for surgery date Wait to recover Wait to see oncologist Wait for chemo No one warned me I would need a lot of patience! (I'm not the patient type) I will say this...the \"wait\" was not long...once they suspect something you are pushed to the front of the line for testing....I now will have patience when getting my mammos because maybe they are backed up due to a cancer patient being pushed in front of me! Oh, just read back...how do they know what to biopsy...they will do mammo guided biopsy if necessary (had that), ultrasound guided biopsy (did that) and possible MRI biopsy..(with contrast)did at too! So there are a bunch of tools they can use...we just don't know they exist! Also consider asking WHO is calling you with the results? Or will it be given to you at the office visit? I knew it wasn't good when my doctor called my house at 10:00pm. BUT I was glad she did so I didn't have to wait! (She called that late because she knew I had kids and she didn't want them to overhear results)/reaction) take a look around these boards to see about surgery choices, reconstruction choices, etc...if you are the type that likes to \"know the options before you get there\". . Now it could be for nothing (lets hope so)...but if it is for the worst you will be educated to a course of treatment you would like....especially Important considering you might not be given time to figure it out. To me, this is the \"education phase\"...and if you are fortunate and don't need that education for yourself, you can perhaps one day pass that education onto someone else. Oh, get a notebook, use it. Take notes, everywhere you go. Go back and re-read them. If you aren't a good note taker, take someone along who is. My hubby can't take notes to save his life. When I finally had my sit down with my BS I apologized to her in advance and told her I wouldn't be looking her in the eye because I would be taking notes...and I did. (She didn't mind). Also consider recording the meeting in the event you are not a great note taker. Sorry, this is wordy and long and maybe too much info. I write this for others, not just for you.

I had to wonder if she was getting paid to refer people to some testers out in Cincinnati as she mentioned numerous time if I did not qualify through insurance she would end my info to these people. Any one else sit through a Speech about Cowden syndrome? Anyway, she went and told my doctor I wanted to wait to get my BRCA results. I NEVER said that. So my surgery was out off, as I was told, by only a few days. Then I get a call the night of what would have been my surgery, from my dr. Telling me that the genetic testing hasn't even begun at the lab due to a dispute with the insurance company. Turns out this IDIOT. Genetic counselor was too quiet when dealing with the insurance company ...when asked if she gave the insurance company hell she said\"I'm not like that\". What! But you messed with my surgery date so I could get those results, and now I would still have to wait two weeks! Minimum! Anyhow, dr is going ahead with my surgery without BRCA results,I am comfortable with that,I am \"low risk\" in regards to testing positive for this gene. Honestly,I think they should have took my saliva and called me in for a consult nay if I tested positive. THEN I would have paid attention! My notes all say things like \"why am I here!\" \"Shoot me now!\" \"What is she talking about\" and \"shut up already\". Almost two hours of my life I can't get back! Anyhow,if there are \"normal\" geneticists out there, great! And I am sure if i Went in wanting to write down every detail of \"what if\" situations I would have good notes. Unfortunately she had some bizarre agenda selling me another gene problem and droning incessantly. And, to top it off, my surgery will now be Monday, without. bRCA results, and she calls me today to tell me the lab has now started my testing. Well just great, what is that going to get me. I'm dealing with surgery now, not genetic testing that won't be here for two weeks. If someone asks me about this geneticist on a survey they will get an earful. Anyhow, sorry for the rant,it's still a Fresh wound. Genetic testing IS IMPORTANT.. In my case there is such a small percentage of having the BRCA that I felt it would not impact my surgery decision, even if I have the gene. It's been a month since I have been diagnosed with ILC, I would like my partial mastectomy and reconstruction so I can move to my next treatment stage. I have three kids and need to plan my life!

I am also supposed to be godmother to the newest addition to the family and my sister in Law has waited so patiently to work with my treatment....I finally told her to just book the Christening for whenever she needs to as I may need a follow up surgery to get cleaner margins from my initial surgery, OR I might be on chemo, OR I might be on radiation, OR I might be having a masectomy. I am so tired of the \"mights\". If she picks the date before I meet with my oncologist I will see if I can work around it. If I meet with my oncologist before she picks her dates I might have a better idea of where I will be at. Hurry up and wait! Lol. Who would have thought! But I can tell you one thing, having this diagnosis sure will make me appreciate being a Godmother even more, as it has taught me to enjoy all moments. I'm sure you will enjoy that wedding! Wishing you the best for our biopsy. Pat",

I will say that as stoic as I was through the process I have since discovered the \"after treatment is over I'm in \"lala land\"\" phase of worrying.  There are a few threads on this site that discuss that.  Most of the women from my chemo month group are also \"suffering\" the same thoughts.  It IS a process.  You are surely in the right place.

I was changing my whole negative perception of those \"skinny bitches\" because I finally had figured out the answer, God did not make them that way, they WORK for it! Seems \"dumb\" I never thought of that before! I had started eating right as well. I finally thought. I AM going to be better package. Well, that is now changing. Surgery, 6 weeks no exercising, smaller boobs (but Perkier!) and I still lost weight from eating correctly. Now chemo...but I went and \"bulked up 10 lbs., figuring I would lose it during chemo. I think I am up even more! A shorter haircut. I was NOT happy by the reactions around me. The silence is as mean as if someone said I don't like it! BUT, I always wanted to go shorter! And it is \"growing \" on me...but fate says not for long! Soon to be bald, and facing the next challenges of scarves, wigs, hats. This is some journey! If anything I will try and find more positive in this. It took forever to realize those \"skinny bitches\" don't look skinny by nature. There IS a message in this journey, not only for me and my sisters, but for those watching us, and even for those that don't know us. Each persons message will be different. I'm thinking my inner message is evolving, and right now I am going to fight to get back my sense of who I am. I'm not \"skinny\", probably never will be...but I AM eating healthier than I ever have and I am a role model for my children. My outer message is different, i know my physical appearance isnt what i would like it to be. despite that I hope my outer message is saying to everyone \"despite the ailment I carry on\". \"I am here, ask me questions\". \"I am woman hear me roar!\" And honestly, I have been doing a lot of \"deep\" thinking. Why do I spend so much time worrying about my body image? The lotto is now over $300 million and if I won it tomorrow it won't change the biggest problem I currently face, and it certainly isn't my body image! Sorry, I can't be helpful. Yes, this roller coaster ride is messing with my head!

Same with drinks...plain water is not appealing to me after day 2...so I have been purchasing different flavors of water/drinks. So far i must say anything in the red family seems okay. Lipton lemon iced tea is great (just tried that yesterday). I tried some kiwi-strawberry thing today and it was awful. I just keep trying... I see your wife likes omlettes. I can definitely taste eggs, even egg whites! But the texture of the cheese is not something I like,so I omit that. Biotene makes a gum. And I have read, but not tried, that sugar free lemon drops or other sour type drops might get the juices flowing? Your wife is fortunate to have you caring for her.

Started it on the day of the Neulasta shot and continued each day? I had heard someone was told to start it two days before and continue ((this was after having bone pain the first go around using the above method) There was another person that took Claritan in conjunction with Aleve (check if you are allowed Aleve) and that worked for her. At my doctors they had told me if I had bad bone pain from Neulasta they would reduce the amount they gave me by half. You MUST be aware if that is their plan and remind the nurse, as the \"reduction of the shot\" is giving you half of what is already in the pre filled needle. When I would go for my shot the nurse told me I am her only patient that can tolerate the full shot, but I was also their only patient to take Claritan 24 hour! In regards to hair, I had cut mine to a pixie length (from shoulder length) and when it started to fall out cut it to what I would call a short cut (mans length). I still have not lost it all, but it sure has thinned A LOT. I wear the buffs www.buffusa.com and love them. My hair seems to be growing fast ...what hair I have!....and it actually will stick out below the back of the head covering, as well as near the ears. There are a few people that were disappointed they cut their hair super short (stubble type cut) as they said it was difficult to sleep , the stubble hurt, they also said it bothered them when wearing a wig. The head thing is such a personal choice, no right or wrong answer for sure! I look in the mirror and see an \"old lady\" looking back wheni am without a head covering. I was shocked wearing my buffs the first few times I looked in the mirror...especially when I had my daughter clothes shopping, but I was shocked because I felt so normal shopping and forgot I was wearing the buff!

Lol I saw the room they do chemo in, I guess it is small, there is room for 5, and at times they will bring in an extra chair if needed. Outside that room is a row of about 30 chairs. I was petrified and asked if that is where we go for treatment after our first one. Apparently those seats were for hospital patients! Relief for me, but feel bad those seats look like an assembly line, very freaky. Anyhow, I would have started next Tuesday and squeezed into the April chemo group, but they only had a 2:00 slot, my daughter gets off the bus at 3:00, so that was no good. I am now Monday May 6, but would like to take advantage of all your experience as I have read these boards til my eyes droop, taken notes, and still have not seen an answer (well at least that I wrote down!) 1. Claritin. Is it \"d\", 12 hour or 24 hour? And when do I start and when do I stop. (The oncologist said she heard of people taking Claritin but doesn't think it's necessary as most don't get bone pain and its \"not too bad\"-lol, I don't think so!) 2. Icing- yep, she doesn't go with that idea either. So when exactly do you start it, and when to end it? I am 4 rounds T/C. The other drugs she wrote for are: (I asked for drug sheets and this is what she gave me) Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) Dexamethasone (steroid) Famotidine (heartburn relief) Palonosetron aka Aloxi (nausea). I read here this is a \"good one\" Neulasta (for white blood cells). I know this is why I will take Claritin. So my questions about the above: no sleep aid? I hear a lot of talk about that! The heartburn relief, is anything OTC good? (Have not yet seen if insurance will cover this) Is there anything else I should be asking for? Thank you all in advance, I want to get the shopping out of the way while I can! Wishing you all the best and a successful treatment. Pat",

I was so happy I did that. Hoping the buffs I picked are good colors for me. I made sure to buy some UV buffs so I can wear outside. Also bought one for the gym. If I like them I might have to buy more! Thank you!",

Apparently there are more than a few people complaining at my oncologist office! It is a shame they don't suggest the Claritan 24 as a possible preventative measure. One other bonus of the Claritan is that a number of people have complained of the steroids affecting their sinuses. I think the Claritan has helped me in that area as well.

Steroids can make you stay awake! They didn't for my first two treatments, I slept like a baby. But for #3 and this final I have been up! I also think I made the mistake of drinking coffee late in the day. Oh well. And yes, you CAN gain weight on chemo, steroids make me hungry! Though taste buds are off! Icing, I saw a few people ask. First I would like to say, ALWAYS check with your oncologist prior to taking any advice on these boards. We are all \"just patients\". I ice my fingers using bags of ice and my toes using bags of veggies (same bags each chemo round, will be throwing them out after my final tomorrow!). I sit with soles of feet together one bag veggies between toes and one on either side of the tops of my toes. This is done when the start the Taxotere drip, and during that entire Taxotere drip. I also get ice chips to suck on and have an icee to drink (to avoid mouth sores). I use a cooler bag to transport my ice, frozen veggies and icee to my treatment. Food, find out if your center provides lunch...you will most likely be there a number of hours. Mine does not, so I throw in some protein (healing powers!) into my cooler bag and maybe some pretzels or other finger food. Water, water , water...hydrate, if you can't tolerate water find something else you can. Drink plenty before getting to the treatment center, helps them to find your veins if yOU are well hydrated. Also the liquid will help to rid your body of the toxins. You CAN. Get up and use the bathroom during treatment. The only time you cannot is when they do your first drip of taxotere (checking for reactions the first 5-10 minutes). Don't know about the other chemo a. Just tell your nurses you need a warning for when you MUST stay in your chip air so you can go use the bathroom accordingly. Continue to drink plenty when you get home and for the following days. Bathroom at home. I start stool softeners day of chemo, and continue them. Next day I add Miralax to my breakfast water, and do that for more days too! When I stop all my nausea meds I stop these meds too. That is just me. I have not gotten constipated. I also have baby wipes on hand to wipe myself after using the bathroom those first 3 -4 days. You are passing toxins, I don't need \"issues\" down there! Food...nothing tastes \"right\" as you would think it should. Coffee...eeeew! I don't drink coffee for the first week....BUT I found a international delight Mocha coffee drink in a half gallon at the supermarket that tastes incredible. I throw it in the blender and add ice. YUM! (Higher calories though, here comes weight gain! I also like the McDonald's chocolate shakes and the McDouble (but NOT a regular cheeseburger from McDonalds!-go figure!). I don't eat those on a normal day! And I LOVE my watermelon, cold, tasty and soothing. Also iced tea! Indigestion...mine started as soon as I got home from chemo...despite the meds given in IV prior to chemo. I went and purchased Prilosec and .tums. Between the two it kept me good. I have my meds to take in a bowl on my kitchen table, and have a check off list on my kitchen cabinet, so I remember what i took. Also helped when I was in bed and didn't want to get up, hubb could figure out what to bring me. Additional, \"back up\" meds are in a shoebox on my coffee table..Benadryl, nausea meds, thermometer...I have only needed the nausea meds. I also advise using an empty medicine bottle or other container to throw some nausea meds and tums into when out running around. Claritin for the Neulasta shot. I have read that it can help to avoid the bone pain associated with the Neulasta shot. My onc never heard of it but did not discourage me trying. The nurse said I am her only patient that can tolerate the full amount of the Neulasta shot (they can decrease the amount given if you get bad bone pain). I think it is because of the Claritan 24 one a day pill. I take it the morning of the Neulasta shot and one a day for the next 7 days. Side effects, I will look for and post a sheet of side effects to record/note when on chemo. It comes in handy and tells you when to call your onc. Also handy to refer to when you go back to next chemo. It is from the American cancer society. Not feeling good! Call your onc! Don't wait, they are getting paid to serve! Weekends, holidays, midnights....call! Don't \"wait it out\" there are so many meds that can be prescribed to help you feel better. Blood pressure, blood draws and IV. These things should not be done on the arm where you had lymph nodes removed. It can increase the risk of lymphedema....look it up on these boards. Be sure to advocate for yourself! IV...if you feel discomfort in your vein, or anywhere, when getting your pre meds or chemo, speak up! They had to use a hand vein during one of my rounds and I had burning and pain during Benadryl drip...I was so happy I spoke up, they did something and made it better. Also had other issues that day and they fixed it. Didn't have any problems my other two times! Tiredness...I was tired on day 4? (Day 1 being chemo day). I napped, and then napped some more. You really need to GET UP AND MOVE...even walking in the house, housework, walk down the street....it actually takes to out of the tired fog! I was back to the gym by day 6....I am NOT a gym rat, just like my one machine. Admittedly I took it slower, I was afraid...then I worked my way back up....it IS doable. They say the effects of chemo are cumulative. I didn't really feel that til chemo #3, but my vitamin d is down and so are my red blood cell counts...so that can be the reason...I am still getting up and going though! Chemo brain..I have NOT had any major issues with this. Thankfully! I apologize for the typos, I'm sure there are many and iPad makes up its own words too, I am too tired to go back and fix. Please remember, you CAN do this. Many have gone before you and are here to talk about it. One step at a time. Pat",

There are many over the counter drugs that have been removed to behind the counter and or have been limited in the amounts that can be sold due to their ability to be changed into meth by the criminal minded people. It would not affect the everyday user if following the recommended dosage. Pat",

Both need to be maintained (meaning washed). You need special shampoos , conditioner and sprays for the synthetic wig. Did you go to a Look Good Feel Better workshop? Go try them if you haven't. Here is the link to find one in your area. Scroll down on the link and you will see on your left side to enter your zip code. You will then click on the different hospitals or treatment areas to see what dates/times they offer the program. You MUST pre-register so they know you are coming...sometimes they might cancel if no one is coming! Or it could be filled! lookgoodfeelbetter.org/ Anyhow, they will have FREE wigs, and you get to try them on and check them out! If by chance the one you go to does not have wigs there then they will give you a coupon to take to a wig bank to get your free wig. They also give free makeup and bag and instructions on how to apply it. (Good quality makeup too, not dollar store quality!) mine also GAVE ME FOR FREE, the needed shampoos, wig conditioner and spray for the wig along with a wig stand! (Though I did go to another session at another hospital to go over the makeup again and at that hospital they did NOT give the ladies any wig care products!). If you don't get the wig care products I found that the tlc had a good price for the package. Also, you will want a wig comb or brush (I picked those up in a hair care shop by me) Make sure you measure your head (google for directions). If the wig is too little it will give you a headache and keep slipping, if it is too big it will look odd, you want \"just right\", like Goldilocks! :) Pat",

The wait to see the oncologist is the most difficult (well, for most of us I think!) Your oncologist will go over your pathology with you and discuss a treatment plan based on your specific type of cancer, stage and grade, lymph node involvement, mets, etc. Once you get your treatment plan (chemo?, rads?) you will have a better sense as to what to expect. There are plenty of people here that have gone through treatment and will share what helped them, myself included. Chemo today is not the same as it was years ago, there is so much more known to manage side effects. Try and not worry. It's easy for me to say, I'm not a worrier by nature, I prefer to deal with facts (and keep my wandering mind in check if possible).

I went from should length hair to pixie cut...was shocked and then discovered I actually liked it. Then I attempted to go even shorter and the stylist (different one)wouldn't do it, she only trimmed so i wasted my money. When my hair started coming out i took the barber clippers i own and clipped mynhair, using a number 6., and on the top i chopped away using scissors...what the heck, i wasnt paying for ANOTHER haircut (this was two days after sylist refused to cut me shorter) and i figured not too many people would be seeing it! despite my hair falling out I have not lost all my hair! It cqme out for anout a week (started 12 days after first treatment) and then stopped. almost none came out again until 3rd treatment, and it isnt significant as first time around. Yes, it IS thinned out, but it isn't all gone. I have 3 kids, youngest is 10 yr girl...she has been fighting my hair changes, with tears, but then is quickly accepting, as I think she realizes I am still ME, just with a different look. A number of women on the other chemo threads have shaved their heads and complained of \"stubbies\" that hurt, are rough, and are annoying. They have said they wish they didn't shave it. It IS a personal choice, yes it IS taking control too, but not allof us loose all of our hair. The first thing I do when I am home is whip off my head covering and maybe slip on a yoga band...which pushes up my hair to look like \"Bart Simpson\" hair . I'm fine with that, my kids are good with that and I even let the neighbor kids in like that. (It's so darn hot who really wants to keep their head covered!) Wigs.... Check with your insurance company to see if they are covered. (Mine wasn't). The oncologist had written me a prescription (and darn ifi can remember the technical name for wig! Lol)...some sort of prosthetic. Also check your local Look Good Feel Better program, it is run by the American Cancer Society. They provide free makeup and instructions and provide a wig of your choice (well, based on what they have, which is a pretty decent selection) and if they don't have wigs on site they set you up with a wig bank for your free wig. Here is their link, scroll down in the left side you will see to enter your info. lookgoodfeelbetter.org/ Also, when buying wigs they come in sizes! Petite, Average and large...my noggin is large, so I am not comfortable in the \"average\" size wig I chose, my mistake! Here is a link to reasonably priced accessories and wigs and I believe they get into the description of the different types of wigs too...not sure about that. www.tlcdirect.org/default.aspx... I did go to a professional wig shop, and did not like the idea of a wig for me. Personally I just couldn't see me wearing one. I didn't like anything I tried on, I was miserable and then I found out the insurance didn't cover the $400 wig I \"sorta\" liked....for $400 I BETTER like it! I DID like what I learned from the wig people though...I think a monofilament wig is good, hand tied better...that's for the \"fake\" stuff...obviously real wigs were even better, but a heck of a lot more money. My preference is the buff. I have purchased 4. One for working out in....the others for \"everyday\". What I really like is that I found some shirts that almost match them, so I am practically coordinated! Lol (I'm a t-shirt sort of girl, so this is a step up for me!) Here is their website. Www.buffusa.com. They also have them with UV protection! (Not all though) With my sporty buff and my makeup done (I'm usually a no-makeup girl) I feel really good about myself. There are many ways to wear the buff, I just pull it on and pull the extra material into a high ponytail in the back...which comes in handy when my daughter wants a hair tie when we are out (so now I am sure to put two pony tail holders on my buff) Here is a link to get the idea of a buff pulled into a pony tail...just ignore the hair in the photo! www.itssimplyzen.com/Buff-Head... I have not gotten \"into\" tying scarves. I LOVE the look, but it is so much easier for me to whip a buff on and off. I have also purchased the cotton head coverings and gone to the dollar stores to buy hair bands to layer with. Ive used that look once or twice, and liked it. Even found a black turban in a dollar store and accessorize it with a headband, or a scarf. Yoga bands...my cousin sent me some headbands. These are them. yogitoes.com/tools-accessories... At first I thought, \"what the heck am I going to do with that!\" But then I relized I could use them under my buff to catch sweat when working out, or for everyday to add a layer of coolness...they are stretchy and comfy...these are what I use for my indoor Bart Simpson look. I imagine it could also be used as the hatband \"liner\" when wearing a hat, to hide baldness.... So there are alternatives out there...keep looking! Pat",

I finally wrote it down (as I was taking notes) and realized I better be all set for a pity party! (Even though I don't think I am \"that type\"-I'm guessing this is soooo something that will bring me there!). So when I got off the phone I looked up the \"rules\" for a pity party (and yes, I found some!) and made a poster \"Pity party in progress- go away\" and then an \"all better\" poster. Then I sat down and explained the situation to my hubby and kids so they can know what they might expect at some point. (Better to hear the description from a happy mom, then from a desperate hubby!). I also heard about the \"steroid rage\" and made up a poster that said \"RUN\". Lol, told my kids if they see that they BETTER stay away! Lol Also went and got a shorter haircut, not loving it, but not hating it! And I had picked up a wig from the Internet (had gone to a wig store but $450 for something I didn't love!-insurance not covering)...so I am ready for the hair loss (as ready as one can be?). Garden girl, you are right, everyone keeps telling me it doesn't happen to everyone. I'm glad they are in the denial for me! Perhaps they should have placed a bet with me! Then I would have money to go out and buy a REAL hair wig!

I really don't want to be in pictures with some UGLY wig, and look back and remember my cancer that way. I would prefer to have a little fun. I do have a sense of humor, but the colored wig is so not me. I am looking forward to a little re-invention. I'm grabbing this opportunity to explore! My daughter, age 10, is adamant I cannot wear it near anywhere her friends would see. That's ok. Also picked up two pairs of oversized sunglasses to go with the wig and bandanas. Why not!",

This is my Last weekend to \"enjoy\" myself before chemo #3 on Monday and final exams all around for the three kids next week. Uuugggghhhh! And I wonder why I am tired?

When I get home I put the remainder of my BIG Poland spring bottle next to my favorite chair and try and finish it before bed (which for me is around midnight) I try and drink as much the next day, assuming I'm not sick of water! Or it's not tasting \"eeeew\" . I have changed from water to flavored waters, Gatorade, or other liquids on day after (which I call day 2) and the day after that (day 3). Usually on those days water tastes \"bad\" and I am into other liquids, I also eat a lot of watermelon (juicy, cold and tastes good). It is definitely more than the recommended 8 glasses of liquid a day on a regular day for people (and I usually don't drink that recommended 8 glasses when I am \"healthy\").

I much prefer a hug, where I can turn my head away from someone's face while holding my breath, to a kiss on the cheek. Maybe a fast double hand grab, good squeeze, get that hello out of the way, then go sanitize those hands! I would be as concerned just being in a crowded room, regardless of the hugs, or should I say a hug is as innocent as a crowded room? Everyone is breathing the same air. I had read somewhere that if someone coughs to hold your breath for 10-15 seconds as the germs \"fall\" prior to and as walking past their \"cough path\". I don't know how true that is, but I do that too! Lol Anyhow hand sanitizer, even the pen shaped spritzer one is good (though it runs out quickly). If all else fails you might consider wearing a shirt with spikes sticking out, I would think it would be a good deterrent, and I am sure it is \"in fashion\" somehow! Lol Pat",

(Mine didn't care one way or the other) Regarding the mouth, was it sores? Try chewing on ice chips during the taxotere drip (my drip is one hour)...I have not had problems with mouth sores. I did have maybe 2-3 days of a strange feeling in my throat, which was \"worse\" the first chemo as I had not iced my mouth the entire hour (was talking too much!) My \"so tired I need to sleep\" phase was about day 5-6 on first round and second round was day 4-5. Take your naps if you can. I felt \"normal\" by day 7 or 8. Definitely felt fine for week 3. Are you eating protein and foods that help your red blood cells? At my second chemo they told me my vitamin D was lower and I needed to take supplements. MO told me it would give me more energy and I wouldn't feel so tired. Funny thing was I wasn't tired at all! (Except those few days) One last thought, try and get up and get moving....I had read on these boards that a lot of women \"pushed through\" the exhausted feeling and felt better for it. I did that first time around, just told the hubby I needed to walk around the cul-de-sac...it was raining, I didn't care. Carried my umbrella and did a few to a rounds, and I DID feel like I had more energy. Keep writing those questions down for the MO. You can even call them and tell them how you are feeling (that's what they get paid for!) and they might offer you some good advice, why wait! Pat",

You will notice more in the comb, shower, or your fingers if you run your fingers through your hair. I had cut my hair very short, by myself (after beautician insisted on not going so short so she cut it to where she wanted to). My self haircut was Not a job I want to show people! Lol Anyhow, I had a lot of days I lost a lot of hair, my hair is very fine,but apparently a lot of it. Thankfully I had a sink strainer in the bathtub, which I was cleaning out every shower, with quite a bit of hair in it. I would say the most came out during days 12-19(after first chemo), then it slowed down a lot. In the early stage of hair loss I would see the hair on top of the strainer in the tub, now I don't see it, but I find small amounts when I wipe the strainer clean with a tissue. I start round three of chemo on Monday. I honestly thought I would get that tingling, scalp pain again after round two and go back to losing more hair quicker (as opposed to the \"small amount daily\"), but it hasn't happened like that. I think my hair is definitely thinned out a lot,mid my self inflicted haircut weren't so bad perhaps I would try wearing my faux military cut...but I much prefer to keep my head covered. I think it is easier to let people think I'm losing or lost my hair as opposed to trying to explain my poor haircut, with some thinning spots on my head. Telling you this so 1- you don't go chopping at your own hair! Lol 2-you might not lose ALL your hair, so you need to decide what is best for you. Also look for a look good feel better workshop near you, run by the American cancer society. They will give you a free wig! Pat",

Then I gathered my thoughts and started sending her an email. Why would I see the plastic surgeon before getting my BRCA results if I thought it would change my mind? Why would I have complete pre-surgical clearance if I did not have a surgery date? Who is failing to communicate! Why is the geneticist agenda being advanced and not mine. BTW, I COULD NOT STAND LISTENING TO the GENETICIST, I tuned her out in 15 minutes, my notes all say things like \"why am I here\" , \"this is dull\", \"get me out of here\"! Why , because I had told her regardless of the outcome I would NOT opt for mastectomy at this time, so why would I listen to her! Ugggh, so now they think they MIGHT have my BRCA results by this Friday, and if negative can reschedule me , to \"fit me in\" at some point next week. \"\"Fit me in\"? I'm a surgery, don't \"fit me in\". , I don't want anyone rushing through because I was \"fit in\"! If the results are positive then my surgery will be in April as I will need to meet with the PS again to discuss options, and I told them I would want to meet with an oncologist to discuss options.

I had a relative Facebook me how I was doing, commented back \"well, except I think I have an infection\" and received a flip off (or essentially a flip off in my book!). My own twin called and left me a nasty message to not speak to her about my treatments until they were done. She actually did me a favor by being nasty as she is so self centered the few calls I had prior to surgery were all about her. Only reason I had called her was to verify a diagnosis she had YEARS ago, she called cancer and my BS had said was never referred to cancer (atypical ductal hyperplasia). I only wanted to be sure when I met with geneticist that I had the correct info. Anyhow we had not spoken prior to that in a dispute over scattering my dads ashes. This twin of mine is a \"cancer\" in my mind and cutting her out has lessened my stress. Told hubby if I got hit by a truck tomorrow to not invite her to the funeral!

Finally ordered room service at 7:00 just before the kitchen closed. The nurse kept telling me I could have crackers for my nausea, it turns out I REALLY needed a meal, felt sooooo much better after eating. ILC in right breast removed, left side also reduced and reconstructed to match. right node sentinel node removal, no results yet. Spent the night in a pediatric ward for recovery, excellent nurse to patient ratio. No waiting for anything. Unfortunately heard a two month old crying on and off all night \"right behind my head\". Felt so bad for the little guy and the parents (able to stay there). Hubby would have stayed over in the hospital but he and my two boys were shaving their heads for St. .Baldricks event and we had icy snowy roads. Last thing I needed was him in the hospital too, he is NOT getting out of housework that easily! All the dr.s and nurses were impressed with my breasts, I joked and said even the custodian was impressed as it seemed everyone wanted to see them! LOVED the leg massager thingies. (Used to avoid blood clots). If there was a way to take them home I would have. Nurse told me I would have to take the bed to use the leg massagers, I told her I could arrange that! I came home yesterday. Felt like it was a whirlwind. In the car, driving past all this fresh snow, Made me think of what I pray is a fresh start, nice and clean! Had a \"fever\" of 96.3 last night, with teeth chattering, no idea what that was all about. Tired today. Taking only one Percocet (can have two), taking my antibiotic and also stool softener (thanks to reading that here, but still waiting for some action there!). My drain was removed prior to leaving the hospital. The \"steri strips\" under my right breast are gone, husband said they were gone yesterday. I don't know if they should be. It is also hard to tell if the area is red and swollen on my left breast around the nipple, so I might be making a phone call to the plastic surgeon tomorrow. Next week I see the breast surgeon Tuesday, the plastic surgeon will be on vacation (spring break here) so I will see her the following week.(if I don't see her about potential swelling/redness this week) My breast surgeon called last night to ask after me, she is very nice. No pathology, she says it \"might\" be back by mid week next week. I think she was trying to reassure me. I told her regardless of the day the results come in it won't change anything so I will not stress, concentrating on feeling good right now. Next step is talk of rads...still have not met any oncologist or whatever these next group of doctors would be. Had a much needed shower today. Eating lots of protein for healing, drinking lots of water. Trying to ignore the mess my husband and three kids are leaving everywhere. I honestly can't understand how they can sit at a table with yesterday's crumbs all over the place, and walk on filthy floors, I am sickened. I think the inability to do housework Is going to drive me insane. Might have to go out and invest in blinders. Sending my love to all my sisters for a positive journey. Pat",

Will also have radiation and 10 years tamoxifen. Breast surgeon says needs to go back and get better margins. I seriously started thinking over the weekend to do masectomy, of at least the \"bad breast\". Will be meeting plastic surgeon to discuss. Have been reading DIEP board, will also need to find the other boards so I can \"pre-read\" my alternatives before getting to the doctor. That way I will have my questions ready. Will need the chemo regardless of surgery choice. Will not need rads if I do masectomy (not in my case anyway). Will also need the tamoxifen regardless of surgery choice. Looks like the summer off with the kids is shot! I'm disappointed. This too shall pass though. Life is full of surprises. We just don't always like them! Pat",

I have decided DIEP flap, both breasts as it is a major surgery. Implants seem like too much maintenance, TRAM involves taking a piece of abdominal core muscle and I have a bad back, I need my core strong! If she takes the abdominal stuff for a single masectomy , as i was considering, if I should ever need another rebuild for my second breast she would have to go elsewhere on my body. And if that second breast needed surgery how old would i be? would i be in good shape? i know, a lot of \"what if\" questions. this surgeon is out of network for insurance purposes, (in fact any surgeon that does this surgery is out of network to me). so I need to see what that will mean. (I'm picturing someone hitting me over the head with a sledge hammer). I am meeting with another DIEP flap surgeon in Manhattan on Tuesday, I want to make sure we are on the same page as far as my fat! I recently lost 25lbs, who would have thought I should have kept it! Lol. Thankfully I still have a good bit of belly fat left. I was told from PS#1 I did not have enough fat for two breasts. I was told by PS#2 that I had enough for two smaller breasts, but to make sure not to lose more weight. (So much for my weight watchers membership!). I'm thinking fatten up this chicken! Lol. Still have chemo to face! PS also wants me to resume my cardio , as she was very happy I had been going to the gym 4-5 times a week, doing 45 minutes of cardio. I think she doesn't realize if she is thinking surgery after chemo I won't exactly be in my best shape as I have not worked out since first surgery on March 18! Lol. She will be getting a fat couch potato! I guess I will see what happens when I finish chemo. I still have 12 weeks (plus some) to figure out what's going on for masectomy. I ordered a bunch of chemo hats , wig etc from tlcdirect.org last night. Also picked up some scarves from Target. Gearing up for the next battle. I think a part of my summer has been saved...as soon as I know for sure I will plan a nice vacation with the family before the masectomy, by then I imagine school will be back in session! Stay strong sisters! Pat",

Have you started working out recently?  Could be you are stretching things that haven't been moved in a while, but again,I have seen some \"lymphedema symptoms\" appear in women that are exercising and there is a whole process about it. I only had 4 nodes removed and know that if I get any strange feelings in that side I will be reading those lymphedema threads ASAP.  Also, please remember no needles in that arm and no blood pressure readings from that arm. Not trying to scare you, just throwing it out there, I am wishing you the best. Pat",

However I believe the nurse navigator and geneticist \"played games\" and had me removed from the surgery schedule, saying I said I wanted to await my BRCA results. I NEVER said any such thing,in fact, the geneticist said I should make a point to tell the plastic surgeon I refused to await the BRCA results, so I do, and she didn't seem to have a problem with that. Both the nurse navigator and the geneticist seemed to be pushing me to await genetic results. Anyhow, my surgery was put off, pending BRCA results. After getting over my dismay at their \"miscommunication\" I accepted that. This evening I got a call from the breast surgeon. Apparently my BRCA testing results won't be in by this .friday as there is an issue between the insurance company and the lab. She has no idea when this issue might be resolved, and when it is, it will take at least 10 days to get my results. So, my surgery is back On for this Monday 3/18. The surgeon feels I am at \"low risk\" of testing positive for the BRCA gene as there is no family history. I agree. She did not push me into the surgery at this time, she left it up to me. The surgery seems to make the most sense to me at this time. How long am I supposed to wait for insurance and lab to work it out.! Maybe one day I will regret it? Anyhow, now hoping that when the phone call comes to tell me the time of my surgery it is actually not another cancellation! Pat",

You must have really needed that sleep. Keep ahead of your pain. I found with all the extra water I am drinking I automatically wake up in the middle of the night, so i can re-medicate easily. I found an interesting website, not cancer, but plastic surgeon info which applies to most of us. Has a lot of things I knew, from reading these boards, and a few things I didn't learn yet. Thought I would share. Gardengirl there is a bathroom related solution in there too. www.scottsdalecenterforplastic... ***please don't follow the exercise part as they patients have not had lymph node removal, I would just look at it as a guide to how easy we need to take it when getting back into daily activity and fitness. Hugs to all my recovering sisters, and special hugs to those still waiting. Pat",
