After a chest x-rays, ct scan, bronchoscopy, it was confirmed that I had adenocarcinoma in my lung & trachea. The drs all agreed it is my breast cancer that metasticized.  I was told to stop the Arimidex since it didn't work & my ER/PR was very low + to begin with & is now negative. I'm sooooo petrified! I'm starting Tykerb & Xeloda tomorrow & wondered if anyone else is on it & how it is.  Any feedback would be so appreciated!  Thank you!
