You raise some really good questions about lymphedema risks.  I would discuss them with your onc, and even get a second opinion if needed.  I would have probably made the same choices as LindaLou53 if faced with her decisions.",

Two months ago, several months post chemo, I got severe food poisoning from a local pizza place.  If that had happened when I was neutropenic, it could have been fatal.  So that's the second bit of advice!  Don't eat out unless you've recently checked your WBC!",

I opted to do chemo before surgery though, and that gave me time to learn more.  Because my tumor was grade 3, I wanted to start chemo as soon as possible to try to knock out anything elsewhere, and I also wanted to see how effective the chemo would be (seeing the tumor shrink).  I am so glad I did have that time, because my perspective on surgery changed.  I ended up having a lumpectomy with radiation instead, and don't regret my decision one bit.  I am now facing a scare with a suspicious bone scan, but choosing a mastectomy would not have changed that. One thing I discussed with my surgeon that made my decision for lumpectomy clearer, is that once you've been dx'ed, you are under very close supervision.  I will be seeing  a cancer doc every 3 months getting blood tests and clinical breast exams, and I'll be getting an MRI or mammogram every six months. The first couple months of diagnosis was worse than any treatment I endured, so there will be sunshine for you.  Hang in there.",
