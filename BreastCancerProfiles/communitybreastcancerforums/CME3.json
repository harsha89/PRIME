This is my first post and also looking for support. I found out about the diagnosis about a month ago and have not had other treatment. Just gearing up for getting all loose ends tied up before being out of work, etc. I have three kids and getting them all situated to be overnight elsewhere the night before the surgery. Finally settled that last night and feel a bit of weight lifted.",
