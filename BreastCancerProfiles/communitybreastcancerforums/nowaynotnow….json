My Oncologist is recommending 6 cycles of TAC but I've been reading some bad opinions about it and the fact that I'm HER2 negative I may not even need it. Does anyone know anything about this med? I'm going for a 2nd opinion hopefully this week, I just feel this doc is being super aggressive and throwing the whole ball of wax at me whether I need it or not. She also wants me to follow up with radiation on the nodes. According to my surgeon if the nodes effected are less than 5 there is no need for radiation. Of course then again I would hate to do just the TC and find out later I needed the A!!! I want to do what I can to see that there is no recurrence but I also don't need to get heart problems in ten years because of the Andriamycin, which they my not even being using anymore ten yrs from now.  Dx 5/19/2009, IDC, 1cm, Stage IIA, Grade 3, 3/12 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I started exercising again on day 6 and it felt great. One thing has set me back a bit though. I was feeling so good at the gym that I got a little ahead of myself and started lifting weights. Everything was great, I concentrated mostly on lower body and rode the bike for an hour a day. Well on day three I decided I would do some light upper body exercises, big mistake! I now have what the dr is calling a reactive swollen lymph node in my right armpit the size of a golf ball. The way she put it is that my once six lane highway has gone done to two lanes and it is bumper to bumper. Lifting any type of weights on that sentinal node side is a big  no no. She didn't act like it was going to be a problem but it doesn't seem to be going away either, it will take some time I think.  Just thought I would share that with you before you head out to get some exercise. I wish i had known it before hand as it has set me back on my range of motion progress. ",

He thought I looked ten yrs younger, true or not, it felt good. I even treated myself to an apple martini, I know it is a no no, but I felt I deserved it.  I'm so happy I took matters into my own hands and buzzed it, it really frees the mind and I feel so much better! Prayers and happy thoughts!! ",

Sorry to say I think the heavy shedding is wishful thinking. I started shedding around day 14 by day 16 I got out the clippers. It's not as bad as you think, once you make that decision it is very empowering, plus shedding gets very old very quick. How have the se been so far? I've been very lucky, I hope it lasts!

My reasoning is the obvious, I don't want to do this again. It is not the mastectomy that bothers me so much it is the removal of nodes. I had 12 removed on the left side and feel that that arm will be forever compromised and I don't want to deal with that on the left side as well. I'm going to discuss it with the oncologist today and get her thoughts. Feel better and I hope you get some sleep soon! Julie ",

I'm day 7 of my first tx and so far so go, though my head is tingly already, that can't be good. I am on 6 cycles of TAC. I tried to talk my dr out of the adriamycin but she assured me it was definitely to route to go. If she were in my shoes she would absolutely do the TAC. Being 42 with two kids 12 & 10 this is not something to fool around with, she wants no corner cutting for me. She is going to destroy this the first time and it's never coming back! I feel comfortable knowing that I am in very good hands, her and I are a very good match.  Overall the worse so far has been a little heartburn and I'm not very motivated today. I go Thursday for CBC test to see if I need a shot to boost white blood cells. I'm hoping not, I'd rather go on house arrest until my counts improve. It helps that my kids are at sleep away camp for two weeks, my schedule is clear. Off to hat and scarf shop!",

Evidently they are researching how a weakened immune system increase antibodies and these antibodies lower the recurrence of bc, or something like that...it is called V212-002 by Merck & Co.
