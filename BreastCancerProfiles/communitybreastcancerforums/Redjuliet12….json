I had the report and it said There is an irregular mass And I knew irregular was not good... but mine turned out fine I actually had a few cysts and I have to follow up in six months. There was a lady on here that gave me her phone number because she wanted to come back to say that it\u2019s not always bad news, a lot of times people don\u2019t come back to report when they get good news they just don\u2019t come back anymore. But something she told me is they have to score it as a four or a five in order to get the insurance to pay for the biopsy because if they scored It as a 3 insurance would not pay for it which gave me some hope . Praying for you...",
