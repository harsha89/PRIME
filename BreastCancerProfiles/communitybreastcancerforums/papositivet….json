I'm so thankful for the information I have found here. I'm feeling more in control or at least much more knowledgeable. Found micro-calcifications in my extremely dense, cyst filled breasts in both 2013 and this past July. Stereotactic biopsies performed in 2013 and 2015 and this time found evidence of ADH with recommendation for an excisional biopsy. The pathologist report from the stereotactic indicated 'highly atypical' instead of just atypical so there's a bit more chance of an upgrade. I had an MRI last week and it showed limited abnormalities with a recommended follow-up in 6 months. That has given me a lot of confidence going into this next step. Biopsy was on Monday Aug 24 so waiting for the results. A big plus - my BS told me he was going to take some extra tissue hoping that if it was more than ADH, then he would capture it with clear margins and prevent an additional surgery. I was expecting the worst in both appearance and pain but the recovery has been so easy compared to the last stereotactic biopsy. I had much more swelling and bruising from the stereotactic.. I know I will have questions after receiving the pathology report. I'm not sure where I'm going, but I'm sure I'll figure it out. My best hint - I found kitchen sponges cut in half, made wet and put in the freezer make perfect little ice packs for in my bra. ",
