Plus, it's just getting old.  I keep telling myself that if I want to beat this then I must wrap for now.  So, I do!  When you say your LE is under control, do you mean your arm, hand, ? is normal size?  When it's under control you are still maintaining and wearing the day & night sleeve along with the massage.  Right?  How long have you had LE? Thanks for you help with the sleeve & insurance info. I appreciate your help very much.  Good luck to you!  Keep up the good attitude!! Diane ",

I was so thankful!  My arm was measured for a Juzo custom fitted glove and sleeve.  Five weeks later, I picked up my sleeve & glove to find that it was a made from a heavy material and was a dark beige color.  Not only that but the glove was too tight and my fingers turned purple.  The sleeve itself rubbed blisters on the inside of my arm after wearing it for two days.  The lady (at a Medical Supply type Pharmacy) that measured my arm was very surprised that the glove actually was too small (that it wasn't a change in my hand measurements).  She also acted surprised that I couldn't wear the sleeve.  She took the glove and sleeve back and was going to return it.  The Therapist wrote a different prescription for another type Juzo 2000(? - a newer, lighter material with the gel at the top).  After waiting five more weeks, I finally got a telephone call last week telling me that the company didn't custom fit that sleeve. I also received a letter from United HealthCare telling me they wouldn't pay for the glove & sleeve because the Pharmacy wasn't a Provider. The Therapist was suppose to ask another Therapist what we needed to do now?  What type sleeve & glove to order?  I haven't heard anything yet.  Any suggestions?  What brand do you ladies recommend? I'm thankful for the one I'm wearing but I know it's not the compression I need or the correct fit.  My hand and arm are doing well but I don't want to take any chances wearing the wrong type sleeve.  Having only one is difficult too with cleaning.  Any suggestions you can give will be greatly appreciated.    I'm still wrapping at night.  Is that the best thing to do or is the night sleeve the best route to take?  Thank for your time and help.  Dinosm Log in to post a reply",

The closes one to me is 70 miles away.   Right now, I'm getting massages once a week and I do self massages twice a day.  Together we are trying to figure it out.   Hang in there.  We can do this!  Good Luck to you.  Keep in touch especially it you find a good sleeve.  I think I'm going to try BioConcepts.  It seems as if that's the one others like. ",
