Size of my smallest fingernail. My surgeon said it was \"fluid\" but I got a second opinion and a biopsy and it was Angiosarcoma. .. in my case a radiation-induced cancer. Immediate radical mastectomy which found 3 more tumours inside that sorry breast. I am now 10 years out from that cancer, but always looking for bruises, anywhere on my body. Another surgeon said 6 years from radiation was about right for this to rear its ugly head, so to speak. This is a rare cancer true but I just put my story here hoping it may help another such rare individual to pick up the vague early signs of angiosarcoma.",
