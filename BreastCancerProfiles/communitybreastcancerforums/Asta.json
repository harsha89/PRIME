I had a Stage III tumour removed at the beginning of last year, then had chemo and radio, which I finished last August. Over the past month I've noticed quite a few more moles on various parts of my body, of all different shapes and colours. None of them look particularly suspicious, but two of them have bled a little and a couple of them itch. I live in Britain so the weather has only been sunny for a couple of weeks, and I haven't used a tanning booth for about two years. Does anyone know if the radiation can cause extra moles? I've been told that it stays in your body for a long time after treatment. Â Thanks for reading, hugs to everyone! Asta Log in to post a reply",
