I actually noticed a while back that me left breast is flat,almost pulled up looking along the very bottom of my breast when I lift my arms. The right side is rounded. I noticed it first while doing a exam, but I had lost a lot of weight and thought that maybe they needed to resettle and find their shape after the loss. I then forgot about it because I didn't want to stress. A friend was dx with cancer the other day and of course brought this to mind. I've already got a call into my Gynecologist so I'm impatiently waiting to see if he wants me to come in. I guess I'm wondering if after months (possibly even a year) should I expect this to worsen, or have new symptoms if it was something suspicious? I know the shape is different than they used to be, but I haven't noticed it has gotten any worse since I first saw it and then forgot. I haven't noticed any lumps. Log in to post a reply",
