I don't have to shave my legs everyday like before chemo, but still need to every 5 days or so.  Paxton; great pics.  So glad you pushed yourself to go.  I love the beach so to celebrate my last chemo tx we are leaving for Cape May Court House for vaction the next day.   I just hope my SE continue to remain at a minimum so that I can actually enjoy the trip. Those of you who are struggling with the shaving your head, I found it was the best thing I could have done.  It was the one thing that I had control over and if you make it into a fun party atmosphere it makes it easier.  That was how I got through it.  Now I love look.  No wasted time doing my hair.  I can save at least a half hour or more a day getting ready.  Plus with it being so hot here it sure is much cooler.  I do have a wig but I only wear it from special occasions.  I ususlly just wear a baseball hat.  I haven't worn any scarfs yet because I thought they would be hotter than a hat.  I have actually gotten more compliments on how I look in a hat than I ever did with my longer hair, so guess what I plan to keep my hair short when it grows back.  Good luck to all you who are still struggling with the decision to shave your heads.  I will keep you in my prayers. Now I am going to whine alittle.  I have been doing great up until Saturday.  Very few SE, other the hair and heartburn from the steriod.  Saturday the plams of my hands and bottoms of my feet got very itchy but no rash.  Then later in the day I started to get a rash on my arms. It would come and go during the day.  Saturday night I started to get stabbing pain between my shoulder blades and feeling like I had something stuck in my throat.  Of course I went to the computer to check symptoms.  These are symptoms of heart attack in women.  So I decided to wait and see if it got worse.  I also took a benadryl to take care of the itching.  Sunday I woke up and felt alittle better so I went to church and did a little shopping for father's day.  i got home around 2 and by 3 was in the ER.  I started to have chest pain with the back pain.  They were great at the hospital.  Keep me isolated as much as they could and also gave me a mask to wear.  The did blood work. chest x-ray and cat scan.  Everything came back fine, so they thought maybe it was from the Neulasta shot.  Did anyone else have pain that long after the shot (2 weeks and 2 days)?  So they sent me home.  Felt well enough on Monday to go to Hershey Park for the day.  I still had the rash and by the end of the day my hands were now swolllen.  So Tuesday morning I went to see my onoc and he thinks it is a reaction to the taxetere.  It wanted to switch my T to an A.  I told him I want to stay on the T because of the effect the A can have on the heart, plus I have done so well on this cocktail that I don't want to take the risk of having more SE, especially being sick, I hate to get sick.  He decided to let me try the taxetere again tomorrow and see how it goes, but any sign of a reaction he will stop it and switch.  I said OK.  I did double check with him to make sure it isn't real dangerous.  I really love and trust my onoc.  I think i will be alittle more anxious tomorrow when I go for treatment to see if I make it past the 15 minute mark with out a reaction.  Has anyone else had to switch from one drug to another in the middle of your treatment?  If so how did it go?  I wish everyone a wonderful rest of the day.  Hugs and prayers to you all.

Mel: I am with you about not wanting to switch.  Those where the same reasons that I didn't want to switch.  When do you have your 4th treatment?  I wish you luck.  Keep us posted when you go back to the ono.  I was very happy with my ono that he would let me try to continue on the T.  If we have to switch then I will delay my last treatment because I am scheduled to go on vacation the day after and I am not going on vacation not knowing what the SE will be.

GG: Loved the dog story. Sounds like my mom.  I haven't talked to her in about 13 years, but she was always such a downer.  Leanna:  I have the same problem with the hot flashes.  Yes they wake me up all night long. I have been moodier than usually too.  Real short with the kids.  I'm hoping that will change some day soon. After reading all your posts about vitamins I need to find out what to take and what I can't take.  I am going to try to go to a nutritionist once I know what medications I will be taking .  Tomorrow is the end of another phase of my treatment.  I can't wait but then again you're back to that \"Ok now I'm not getting any treatment will this come back?\"  Each new phase brings on new fears and anxities. Has anyone start tamoxifen yet?  Just curious about side effects.  Hope everyoe has a great Friday and weekend. Barb",

Friday and Sunday I had steak and baked potatoes for dinner.  In the middle of the night both nights I started with the stomach grumbles.  By the end of the day I was running to the bathroom.  then i was fine.  This happened both days after eating steak and baked potatoes, so I guess there's one food I can't eat anymore.  I ove steak.  Anyone else had one food that made them sick?  Hair update:  I was beginning to think that maybe I would be spared for a little while with out losing my hair, but tonight I started seeing a few strands come out if I tuck on my hair.  My head is also getting itchy.  How long after this starts are you bald?  I need to get a few scarves, turbins or hats.  Can anyone recommend the best things to go with?   I hope I am ready for this.  I have had such an easy go round with my first treatment and want to handle the hair loss with grace.  The emotions are starting to hit me, especially at night when I am by myself.  I thank all you for your posts so that i know what to expect.  I feel blessed to have found such a wonderful sight that I can go to to get answers.  Thanks to all of you!!!!",

Mastectomy.    The doc said all the cancer is gone, but 3 doctors also told me they doubted they would fine anything in the margin.  He also said this is an unusual case.  any advice anyone.  NOw my question for all of you: has this happened to anyone else? How many times do I have to be on top of this darn roller coaster and then be pushed back down the hill.  I know everyone says to stay positive, but this is getting harder and harder.  My youngest (12)saw me go in the back room and close the door while I was talking to the surgeon.  When I put him to bed he started to cry.  He told me he was scared that I was going to die.  I tried to explain to him that I am not going to die yet.  I also told him that I closed the door because him and his brother were fighting.  He seemed better after that.  I hate what this is doing to my family.  I have such wonderful kids and a fantastic husband.  I know this isn't terrible news, but I feel like once I have made my mind up on what i want to do another road block is thrown in front of me.   Thanks for listening to my ranting.   Jean: sorry you things didn't work out for you, but better safe then sorry.",

Kittykat: I didn't have a Benadryl drip in my infusion.  My onoc only using it if you have a reaction during chemo. I would definatly talk to your ono before you go for treatment.  I can tell you that when my son had hives after taking amoxicillian they sent me to an allergist,(this was 10 years ago) they told me they had no real test to see if he was really allergic so they gave me a dose and we sat and watched to see what happened.  Of course nothing did.  He said that it might be a long term reaction so said to just say he is allergic.  Like I said that was 10 years ago.  So who really knows? Dana14: Good luck tomorrow.  I hope you have an easy infusion.  I will be thinking of you and praying. ((((HUG)))",

I am on day 2 and feeling great.  I had my neulasta shot today and so far so good.  I took a clairiton when I got home.  I wasn't sure when to take it so I took it when I got home.  I figure I will take it for a week and see what happens.  My nurse didn't know anything about the clairiton and didn't talk to my doc yet about it.  I have been drinking more water in one day than I use to in a week.  I was never a water drinker, boy how you can pick up good habits when you have to.  I hope everyone has a wonderful weekend with no SE.

Hair update:  Hair I shaved short is still coming out pretty badly, but I can handle the short hairs much better than when they were long.  I haven't lost hair down under yet.  Have most of you lost that hair?  I haven't had to shave my legs as often so it isn't growing as fast.  Eye brows and lashes still in tack. Same with arm hair.  I figure since the hair on my head has fallen out that the chemo is working.  Did anyone else hear the news about the vacine that has been developed to prevent breast cancer.  Apparently it has been working on animals,  All they need is the funding to get started on humans!!!  I heard it on the news the other night. Hopefully it is true!! Have a great Thursday!!!!!",
