Quiggy, my heart goes out to you!  That is really rotten luck.  I empathize with your frustration.  Hopefully your antibiotics will do the trick.  Apparently radiated tissue is more difficult to heal post-op and infection doesn't help. That being said, I wouldn't hesitate to get a second opinion if need be. Maybe postponing it a bit will be all that's needed. My news is mixed. I've got one week of hyperbaric treatments under my belt. Am tolerating them ok with the help of Ativan for my claustrophobia. The stuff really knocks me for a loop though so its back to being tired all the time.  Have enjoyed the weekend without it. I saw the new plastic surgeon on Wednesday and really like him. He is thoughtful and honest without being cruel. He is the first doc that seems to have really looked and felt how big the area of necrosis still in there is.  He is not completely convinced that it will heal without getting that removed too. The hyperbaric treatment increases the blood supply to the area to promote healing and make another surgery (Ughh!) more likely to succeed.  He also said he would have to remove part of the areola too and there is no telling what the boob will look like after that. I may very well end up in Quiggy's shoes. So, after thought and discussion we decided to go ahead with 4 weeks of hyperbaric and re-evaluate then. For some reason the boob is really sore this weekend which scares the hell out of me despite the previous negative cultures. Still doing daily irrigations and repacking. Time will tell, I guess. One day at a time...",

The good news is that in spite of the holes in my boob, it hurts less than it has since the lumpectomy. No signs of infection. I think they just want to drag full recovery out to a year from diagnosis. I can call every Wednesday to see if they have a cancellation. Crazy as it sounds with a 7 hour trip I'll probably do it.

Did you have a dexascan prior to starting the Anastrazole? Are you taking calcium and vitamin D? Maybe your mo just doesn't like chiropractors. Personally I iwould prefer a good physical therapist but not all insurances pay for that. If they didn't check your bones before you started the Anastrozole, you might want to ask about that now if he is really concerned. It's hard to know what to do sometimes.

They did cultures today including a different one at my request. Have had major problems with the wound care, things as basic as handwashing and using clean equipment. Friday it appeared they had \"borrowed\" my packing material and used it on someone else and then put it back in my bag! Appalling! And they can't seem to clear up the infection! In my mind I just want them to open it up, clean it out, take out the necrotic tissue that is still in there and be done with it. I see the NP on Wednesday but not the PS until June 1. Feels like an eternity until then. Quiggy, have they considered hyperbaric treatments for you? I do think if they'd speed up my healing once it is cleaned out. Tolerating the treatments ok with the help of a little Ativan! Hope you ladies continue to well. Quiggy, I feel your pain and frustration. Hang in there!

Went to hyperbaric treatments today and my PS happened to be the supervising doc checking ears and lungs. (A doc always has to check your ears and lungs after every treatment.) Anyway, I took the opportunity to voice my concerns and he was wonderful! He took the time for an unscheduled visit and examined \"the breast \" and agreed with me that more surgery is likely to effect a complete closure.He also wants the best odds of post- radiated tissue to heal. Thus another week of HBO and I see him on June 1st to figure out what's next.I guess the bottom line for me is that he listens and explains rationale for his decisions. Culture results still pending. Can't wait to get out of Dodge for my niece's wedding in Ohio this weekend. My dad is 93 and every chance to spend time with him is a blessing. He is funny and just finished painting his basement floor after \"supervising\" putting 2 sump pumps in! Smart as a tack and very wise. He is a treasure! ! I am rambling. So sorry.

Eventually my mo sent me to a plastic surgeon who immediately said I needed surgery to close the wound so I could start rads. He took out a chunk of necrotic tissue and closed the wound. I still have hardness,tenderness, and shooting pains. Hope it eventually goes away. My PT also has dealt with the fat necrosis problem and has a plan for after rads are done. Good luck and trust yourself. Has anyone out there heard about the LIVESTRONG program through the YMCA?

It could be stress, all the antibiotics you have been taking, or gastritis caused by either. A good probiotic such as Florstor or Culturelle can help a lot. I'm taking Florstor with mine and it seems to have stopped the diarrhea and nausea I always get with antibiotics. I'm not sure if your mo's office could refer you to a psychologist that takes care of women dealing with breast cancer. I was offered that earlier. Talking to a caring person who also has some detatchment can help. I've seen one in the past and she literally saved my life. It is a good way to share the load without feeling like you are burdening loved ones and then still be able to share with them. Wondrwoman had great stress relieving ideas.

The other is to do all of the abovementioned but end up removing the nipple and most of the areola. The kicker is that if the radiated tissue doesn't heal we are looking at a mastectomy with TRAM flap to close the wound. At this point I just want to be done. Am hoping to avoid the mastectomy with TRAM. We are both taking the week to consider. On one hand it makes me angry and sad, on the other it makes me glad to see an end in sight.

They basically have to remove all the radiated tissue and replace it skin and all. Good news (there always is some) is that my PS knows a PS at U of Michigan that this is all he does. He quite candidly told me that he hasn't done one of these since residency so he wouldn't attempt it. The guy he is referring me to has specialized in it. It's a free flap so involves microsurgery to reattach blood vessels. The nurse said she has seen his work on other patients and it's good. So waiting for a call from Ann Arbor with an appointment date. I must admit I was pretty much a basket case the rest of the afternoon. One of the worst parts was the horribly crestfallen look on my DH's face when I told him. He has been such a support through all of this.

This time there is no nipple left and I have a bit of a crater in the center. I am 2 weeks out and so far the incision is holding. That now is my chief concern. My outlook has improved and reading the recent posts I realize that we are all continuing the journey. It's good to see that some are taking advantage of the Livestrong program. Be grateful for the small things. Hold your family close. My brother is NED. For those who remember my nephew with Hodgkins, he had a recurrence, did chemotherapy and stem cell transplant and now has had another recurrence. The doctors told him just to live his life as best he can. He is not a candidate for more treatment for a year. He signed up to play baseball! I am blessed. Marge",

It is thicker and has to be rubbed in so I've not been able to use for a while. If your skin is less sensitive now it might help. The breast cancer coordinator told me that the newest recommendation as far as mamms is one year from diagnosis. Depending on circumstances it might be earlier for some people but research has not shown increased benefit from doing it sooner. 3 boosts left! Quiggy and Beachbum I'm right with you. I think Sjacobs is too. Stomp on! Gentle hugs.",

I still get the shooting pains to my nipple. Believe it or not anti- inflammatory meds might help.I got a muscle relaxer too which helped more because they were fewer and not as hard. You definitely are not crazy. Take care. Quiggy, belated congrats on finishing!",

It truly is what it is. As far as the national healthcare discussion goes, healthcare has been rationed for years! Right now insurance companies are making money hand over fist from people's suffering as are for profit hospitals. Having been a provider fighting to get things covered I have seen people die as a result. So I don't think rationing is the issue. I think it's a matter of will and basic human decency and fairness.

Now 2 weeks out I feel like I'm really done, or well done as the case may be. But, it is getting better every day. For those of you with cording issues PT really does help. The massage makes a big difference. By the end of rads I was having pain all the way to my wrist. Just turning my arm certain ways hurt. 3 PT sessions with massage and stretching and it is practically gone! It's related to the lymphedema which I didn't even realize I had. Got my sleeves too.

I turned pink early but in the end was not too bad, had some breakdown underneath in the crease but otherwise just red and brown.

I do need surgery which will be either this Wednesday or next depending on his schedule in the OR. Basically what he is going to do is open it up and clean out the infection and as much of the necrotic tissue as he can. If he can close it he will, if not, he'll pack it and let it heal from the inside out and close it later. It's a decision that will be made in the OR at the time and luckily I trust him to make it. I'm hoping it will be this week. Meanwhile I have1 more hyperbaric treatment tomorrow and those are done but I'll have to keep irrigating until surgery. They'll call me tomorrow to let me know.Don't you love it! Oh, and I had an allergic reaction to something and my boob got red and itchy. It isn't the antibiotics because it's just on the boob. Perhaps it is the silver in the packing or we've reactivated something from the methylene blue. Changed the kind of packing today so we will see. Seems a little less itchy tonight.

Because I had a lot due to the methylene blue injection I know how unrelenting that feeling of just not normal can be. Methylene blue necrosis is different in that you can end up with necrotic cavities within the fat that coupled with radiation makes healing difficult. Anyway, if it is attached to the surrounding tissue it's like having a golf ball in your breast that pulls on the surrounding tissue every time you move. At least that is what it felt like to me. I cannot offer you advice for your situation. What I know for me is I had pain until all of that hard tissue was removed. Even though the incision line reopened after the previous surgery, I still had little pain. Prior to this last surgery my only concern was that the incision stayed closed. So far so good. To have a \"normal\" appearing breast I will need plastic surgery again. In the meanwhile, I am pretty much pain free. I guess you might ask your PS what is the likelihood that it will resolve on it's own? How likely is it you would have a repeat problem with fat injections? Is there another option for reconstruction so you do not have another problem with fat necrosis? He knows your situation far better than I. God only knows how much we all dislike surgery. Hope this might help a bit. It is just my experience with fat necrosis. Best of luck with this. Take good care. Gentle hugs. Marge",

Skin on skin is more of issue for those who had a lumpectomy especially with larger breasts. If that is the issue, a comfortable bra can help. Most sports bras wick moisture away and the band can be softer. Do what feels good for you. Beachbum, glad to see that you are doing well! We are on the same schedule though you have 28 total and I have 30. The weekend break helped. My one small blister seems to have resolved with aloe. Leslie, welcome! You will get through this hopefully with few side effects. We want to know how you're doing. You have found a soft place to land. Coyote, I understand the chin thing! Just found out my nephew's Hodgkin lymphoma has returned. Young dad with a wife and 2 beautiful little girls. Once again mixed emotions. Cancer sucks. He doesn't deserve this.",

Somehow being done or close to it and not dependent on the doctors for daily care makes it easier to speak up. I am looking forward to setting up an appointment with my surgeon to explain what methylene blue in the wrong place does to a woman's breast. \"I've read about it but never saw it \" he said so cavalierly. Then he said, \"See you in 6 months \". I have lots of pictures to show him! If my mo hadn't taken care of it I would still be waiting for rads because it was never going to heal on its own. Magdaline, I never heard of 10 boosts. I was surprised enough to find out I was having 5. Let us know what your ro says. Good news, bad news, my ro says my blistered area will be out of the field for boosts but between now and then it will get worse. At least he is honest. He recommends hydrocortisone cream (steroid like the Mometosone cream), aloe, and leaving it open to air as much as possible. Only 7 regular and 5 boosts to go. Thanks for the well wishes for my nephew. I like the cancer stomping boots idea! Apparently he is looking at surgery, chemo, and a stem cell transplant.",

I basically said I would tell the people I wanted to know. It is good to have spaces in your life where that's not the first thing people think of when they see you. Sometimes I think it is how husbands cope. My husband did fine until he put something on Facebook that I was half way through rads. Oops! Windgirl, I had bad cording after my surgery. Physical Therapy helped. Had no problems during rads but last weekend (after 5 boosts) I began noticing the tightness again though not nearly as bad as before. Back to those exercises too! The brown skin is peeling off, especially in the clavicle area. The boost area is still getting redder. This too shall pass. A switch has gone off in my brain that finally breast cancer does not need to be the main focus of my life. Feels wonderful!",

My RO explained on Tuesday that the CT was to make sure that the tumor bed hadn't shifted due to the shrinking seroma. My last 4 treatments be boosts with the same amount of radiation but just concentrated toward the tumor bed. The rest of the breast will be shielded. For those of you just starting the time has gone by quickly. For those of you just finishing can't wait to meet you on the other side of this. So far se have been minimal. I am tired but have been through a funeral early on and babysitting 3 grandsons all this week so who knows. I have some swelling but not near what I had with the dye problem so perhaps my perspective is skewed. I normally tan easily so have had some redness but no blisters or peeling. Once again, I think most of my pain is coming from the fat necrosis from the dye, not the radiation. It is more tenderness than pain. I know it can still get much worse but am hoping for the best. Dacre, no shame! I've had similar feelings that I should respond to things and just don't have the mental wherewithal to do it. Sometimes it takes all your energy to keep on keeping on. As far as the poll goes I think what we all want to know the rationale why things are being done a certain way for us. Is there a scientific medical reason or is it the preference of the RO or institution? If so, why? We are all different with different medical histories and tumors in different places. Don't think we all want to be treated exactly alike. But there should be some predictability in se based on all of the above factors. Right now it appears pretty random which is frustrating. And then there's that damn human factor! Justjean, hope you are doing well.",

I am not so worried about physical appearance as physical healing. Reconstruction is the farthest thing from my mind which may be hard for some to understand. Perhaps I am asking for the impossible but what I want is a healed incision, a boob that doesn't hurt whenever I change position at night or it gets bumped the wrong way. And I don't want hard, necrosed tissue left in there leading to multiple repeat biopsies to make sure there isn't cancer in the dense tissue. It may be too much to ask, I don't know. I am tired.

Rest and take care of yourself and allow others to take care of you too. I see the PS on Monday. I broke out in a hive rash down both axilla and down both arms along with increased redness of my boob. It's really itchy so I think it is an allergic reaction to the antibiotics I'm taking. Friday the doc who was checking ears looked at it and said he thought it was worsening cellulitis, put me on another antibiotic and said to keep taking the first one but couldn't explain the rash on the other arm. I didn't restart the first one because I really think I am allergic to it. I did start the other one.The rash is getting better on my arms with the Benadryl, the boob is still red but slightly less so. If he postpones the surgery again I'm going to ask for a referral elsewhere. Just so tired of it all. On a more positive note, I went to our local Relay for Life last night and it was amazing. The survivors ' lap was inspirational and just about brought me to tears. It was a strange but welcome comradarie. The sight when they lit all the luminaries was beautiful. My daughter had actually made one for me. My dh and I made ones for his sister and my nephew, Danny. He still needs prayers and good thoughts as he started running high fevers and is pretty sick.

As usual at such gatherings, I found out that my youngest brother needs a cardiac ablation to fix his abnormal heart rhythms and my middle brother is being worked up for respiratory problems. They have ruled out heart so are looking at respiratory now. He was a heavy smoker though he quit almost 20 years ago. Sounds suspicious to me. He may need those cancer stompin' boots.

There are no stupid questions and often more than one right answer. Bless you all! As far as CT goes I had one for my initial planning and one to plan my boosts. Yesterday I got the sharpie drawings. When they were done they took pictures and measurements and told me not to worry if they came off with washing or creams. They explained everything before they did it. I am really grateful for my techs. The other day they told me that I was getting so good that they were just going to let me tell them when I was in the right position! Just 5 more regular treatments and then 5 boosts and I'm done. My ro recommended the hydrocortisone too. It does seem to help. I still only have the one small blister and a very red breast.

One day we are exhausted and the next day, not so much. Saturday evening I babysit the boys for 4-5 hours and then bring the oldest home with me so I can get him to hockey Sunday morning. His next younger brother has games several hours away. Being able to do these kinds of things is something I looked forward to in retirement. At times it still feels overwhelming. But in many ways. I am stronger now. Quiggy, thanks for the good vibes. Saw my RO today and they cultured the drainage and put me on antibiotics. Hopefully that's all it takes.

Don't try to escape PT. It can help a lot of those aches and pains if it only teaches you how to exercise efficiently and safely. It takes a lot less time than you think. Try it please. It does not mean you are weak. It will be a gift you give yourself. Take it from this 65 year old body.",

Someone else mentioned the Livestrong program at the YMCA and I found it to be a great program. So, for those with one relatively close it's worth checking out. Kept me out of the winter doldrums. Even on the days it was hard to leave the house I had so much more energy and my mood was better after. They even scheduled my rads around it for me so I was already out of the house on those days. Everyone else there was done with treatment. But that was OK. Well, saw my mo yesterday and he's sending me back to the wound clinic for the hole in the incision in my boob. The infection seems better but not gone. Still have a hole. The gift that keeps on giving! At least the NP that I'm seeing was there for the surgery so I can pick her brain. Silver linings!",

My RO says I had a well behaved tumor. My sister in law was just diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer with mets and given a prognosis of weeks. How different! I really feel bad for my husband and his family. I look at all the brave women on this site who have needed chemo and had recurrences but fight on. I was diagnosed in November, had 2 surgeries before Christmas, and got through the holidays. Then it hit me at my sim that I have Cancer! I love the song in your second post.

When they probed in the wound it went the same depth as the PS did to remove the necrotic tissue from the methylene blue. With some necrotic tissue left in there and then rads the cavity under the skin never healed completely and when the skin sloughed off after rads it opened up. So much for not concentrating on the boob! I remember someone else talking about hyperbaric treatments for a seroma a while ago. Will need to go back in the posts. Thanks for listening.

I'm hanging in there and hoping for good news on Monday. My daughter called in tears on Thursday because her dad had been taken to the hospital by ambulance. He has multiple medical problems, most recently fighting an infection in large open wounds on his legs. Apparently they stabilized him in the ED and admitted him to\"tune him up\"so he can get back to Mayo clinic on Sunday. Then yesterday my sister called and said that my 94 year old dad went into the hospital for an outpatient sinus procedure and ended up with a pacemaker! When they got him in the OR his heart rate was in the 20s. The anesthesiologist said he wouldn't put him to sleep with a heart rate in the 20s and my dad told him in his usual form that he wouldn't have surgery without anesthesia! It was scarey but I talked to him last night and he was in good spirits. He challenged me to a race to see who can get off the doctor's list first! He has had a-fib for a long time and had been getting more and more tired lately and he already felt better. So, the race is on! What a life! But the good news is that it is a life for both of us.",

His greatest fear is that the tissue won't heal due to radiation. It does have a better chance after hyperbarics and there are some positive signs with the bleeding there's been and the increase in sensitivity. I told him that I really wanted all the necrotic stuff out so that I wouldn't have to deal with multiple biopsies in the future because it was too dense to see through on a mammogram. He plans to try to lift the skin and still get rid of the necrotic stuff underneath if he can. If he can't do it that way it will be goodbye areola and nipple. We both want so much for it to heal either way. I'm continuing the hyperbaric treatments afterwards too. I'm feeling a sense of anticipation and trepidation at the moment.

Mine is from a methylene blue debacle. I had to have plastic surgery after my lumpectomy just to remove the skin lesion and they removed some of the necrotic tissue too so they could close the skin so I could have radiation. It's that incision that opened up after radiation and drained. That area had never healed on the inside because of radiation and the remaining necrotic tissue. The rest of my saga is on this thread. If you want more information you can pm me. I'll be back in touch as soon as I feel up to it. Marge ",

The fellow/resident that was working with the PS needs to learn how to talk to people. He was full of himself and U of Michigan and was very dismissive of our concerns. He wanted to send me to their breast clinic where they do \"miracles\". The PS was better but he still wanted to do another debriedment with closure. Duh! I was pretty dumfounded and had a hard time responding. I had myself so psyched up for the other. Given past results, I am leary of doing the same thing and expecting a different result. It seemed like just another postponement. Everything we had done seemed to make no difference to him. He sent me for pictures in case I do need the TRAM and mammograms and an ultrasound. GOOD NEWS! NED! And I didn't have time to worry about the Mamms. So, the long and the short of it is I saw my PS here on Monday. He was rather surprised too. He is going to call the guy at U of Michigan and they will make a plan. If the U of M guy wants another debridement I can do that here. My doc isn't convinced that will work but he will defer to the specialist. If he can convince the specialist, I'll have the mastectomy with the TRAM. It's really not that I want major surgery. I just want to be done. Believe it or not, radiation ended 6 months ago! I will have gone through every holiday of the year since diagnosis. The last 4 weeks have been trying. My brother was diagnosed with kidney cancer and had surgery and they're hoping that will be all that is needed. His PET scan was clear. Then a week and a half ago I had to put my dog down. He got sick really fast with some form of leukemia/pleural cancer. He lost a lot of weight quickly and was short of breath. He wasn't eating. After 12 1/2 years it was the hardest thing I ever had to do. He was one of the most gentle souls I will ever know. We did that on Monday and went to Ann Arbor on Thursday. I didn't have any emotional reserve. So, am playing the waiting game until the 14th. Good news is not a lot of pain and no infection. Still striving for courage , grace, and humor.",
