Some keep them in a bag, stuff them in pockets or tie them to a lanyard. I carried mine in a dish towel so they didn't touch me. I was hot and it was summer.  Good luck! ",

Fatigue is probably the biggest issue for all three phases. You just have to nap and slow down. Very hard for most of us, especially this time of year. If people want to help out, let them. They understand about surgery. They are scared of chemo and don't understand rads. Some would rather cook or clean or run errands or play with your kids. Let them. Don't be afraid to set some rules regarding visits (who or how long) plus tell them your food preferences or allergies. You will be amazed how quickly you feel better. But then you will overdo it and pay the price with some discomfort. These boards are great for support and there's always someone around.",

Maybe your DHs company could help. I am relying on myself and the Medicare.org website with calls to the companies. You can start this process three months ahead. I recommend it.

She didn't garden but painted flowers on China and could cook. She did have Violet's in the dining room. She was a homemaker and had proper meals with salad, meat, veg, starch and bread and usually dessert. She and my other Gma were ice creamaholics. I never got that gene. I inherited procrastination and dirty dishes in the sink. My other Gma also had that mad scientist thing in the basement. She had the greenest thumb. Could keep poinsettias going year after year. She cooked from scratch too. Made thanksgiving dinner for 20 people on a regular gas stove. No help, no warming dishes, tiny galley kitchen. Whipped her mashed potatoes with never any lumps. I miss them. It's hard to live up to their examples. Thanks for the memories.",

As far as chemo, your nurse will talk to you about diet. Supplements usually aren't recommended. Bland is what I was told. My philosophy is if it sounds good, it should taste good. You can eat healthy after treatment. Some people don't get sick. I was not one of those. I ate a lot of turkey and chicken. Protein is good. I made a green tea and ginger tea. Towards the end I ate white toast and a lot of dry cereal. It was easy on my tummy. Do some of those finger holds yourself. Especially when you are stressed or scared. I used them during treatment and even have my kids use them. I'm on tamoxifen. It's kept me stable, even has healed a couple of bone mets. There's several ladies on hormonals only.

He was a little shocked after surgery as I told him how the scar looked after it healed. I forgot about the bandages. It took about a week for him to talk about my bandages. He loves to help. He would stand on the coffee table to put my robe on. He actually said last week that he wishes I would go back on chemo so my hair would be short and curly:) Of course he has no idea what that means. One hand, I'm grateful they were too little to understand. But it also means I may not get to see them graduate, get married or have babies. Just take it one day at a time, go for walks, do the finger holds (especially while trying to sleep or on your way to appts). Eat whatever sounds good, no matter the nutritional content.

I have to say the thought was worse than reality. I did cry in the shower when it came out but I just wore a pretty hat or scarf if I remembered. Two small kids rushing out the door and I'd forget.

I added a green tea bag. It helps and is very refreshing. Would those sea bands that work for motion sickness or that patch they put behind your ear after surgery be options? Ebru you look beautiful.

He drew squares in the air to describe my bandages. I knew at that point we were ok. Mine was a big help. He loved having a job like standing on the coffee table to drape a robe over my shoulders. You know him best. And whomever will have him after the visit will have lots of questions to answer. Mine stayed with his aunt and was too busy playing to talk much on the phone. I didn't have him visit but I was only one night. I was late getting to recovery and the pain meds didn't agree with me so I wouldn't have wanted him there. He can give you gentle hugs and kisses on the cheek. Make up a secret handshake. I played footsie with the baby for a long time. She still plays footsie in her high chair.

My RO believed me. My new MO seems to believe me. The old one told me not everything is cancer. While that is true, I have never felt this tired or sore and it's all SEs from the cancer preventing meds. So in my book it is cancer related.",

He asked if they were going to use a knife. We used the word cancer. I didn't prepare him for the drains so it took him a few days to process when I got home. He told everyone I had a booboo, they were going to use a knife and I had a scarf (scar). We got \"summer\" haircuts and he wanted to go bald with me. My husband did. I didn't let him. I was afraid he would burn and he's fair skinned. It was a buzz cut though. My baby girl had just turned one when I was diagnosed. She learned to walk while I recuperated from the BMX. The boy now says \"when you had cancer....\" The baby says \"mommy doesn't have nickels (nipples).\" If asked where they are, she replies \"in the trash\". We are matter of fact. Except for not preparing him for how I looked right after surgery, he's been fine. He loved to help. You have to do whats best for your family.",
