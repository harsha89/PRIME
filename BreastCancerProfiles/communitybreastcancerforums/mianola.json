I'm taking my nausea meds by the clock, drinking tons and tons of water, never letting my stomach get empty by eating very small snacks and walk even when you don't want to - as instructed by my onco and so far, I had have no side effects. I'm almost afraid to put that in writing. I'm so very sorry for all of you that are suffering - I truly thought I'd be there with you, however, I still have a couple of days left before I am in the clear. My thoughts are with everyone starting and going through this journey.",

Djt, you are so right about our thought process and what it does to us. I had a double mastectomy on April 5 and have breezed through the recovery, but the chemo I can't even wrap my head around. I feel so great right now, I can't even believe I have cancer. Best of luck to all of you starting down this chemo road in May. I know we will all get through it together!",

      "Content": "mianola wrote: I had a biopsy on January 16 and on January 18 was told I had DCIS on my left breast, grade 3. I met with my surgeon on January 31. He told me \"nothing to worry about\" - it's 99 per cent curable and you have option to have a mastectomy - both if you'd like - and all will be well. I agreed to both and then saw a plastic surgeon. I told my surgeon I had a hard ridge on my left breast and he examined it. He thought we should do an MRI, which was done two days ago. Yesterday, he called saying I actually have invasive cancer and I'm scheduled for another biopsy tomorrow. WTF.... I have gone every 6 months for the last two years. I have had mammograms, ultrasounds and breast exams. I have dense breast and asked constantly - am I doing everything I can. I've tested negative for the genetic part of all of this even though my mom had DCIS and my grandmother died of breast cancer at 52. Has anyone else had a hard ridge and not been diagnosed? It didn't show up on any mammogram or ultrasound. I'm now facing chemo before surgery to shrink the ridiculously large 3 1/2 inch \"tumor\" in my breast. I am floored and I don't know what' else I could have done. Has anyone else had a hard ridge and it NOT be cancer? How could I go from non invasive DCIS to this?? Praying for better results with the biopsy.
