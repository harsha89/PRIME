I went in for the mammogram because I was having shoulder pain, which thought it was due to over strain. Then I began getting symptoms of soreness in my underarm and down the lat area of my body. It hurt like crazy. I go in on Wednesday for a re-exam of my left breast along with an ultra sound. I am feeling pain in my lower ribs and tension in my neck and shoulders, which could be due to stress. I am very scared that something is wrong and cancer is spreading in my body via Lymph Nodes. I can feel a slight lump under my arm.",
