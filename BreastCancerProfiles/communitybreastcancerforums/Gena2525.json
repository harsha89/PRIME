Upon seeing the clinician she suggested i have a ultrasound which i had on monday, I thought it was nothing she called me this afternoon to inform me that they now want to do mammogram because the don't like the was it looks, it is somtimes painful in that breast. I just don't know how to feel i cried a little i am terrified i just watched my friend go through stage 3 carcinoma i took her to her radiation and chemo appointments i am so scared i don't want to have to go through that. I have not told my mom yet or anyone in my family i am terrified. I don't know what i am asking here but i am freaked out. I am afraid to go to bed because i tommorow i have to go pick up my orders for the next test i am afraid to know, when my friend was first found out all she kept saying is i don't want to know anymore now i understand i don't want to know. 7/21/10 I went for my mamogram today the dr imformed me he could not be sure yet and has order another ultrasound on friday he will then go over the results with me. Thank you all for you kind words and prayers. Log in to post a reply",

I recieved one report from the second ulta sound saying it was b9 and then i recieve a call in regards to the mammogram requesting a biopsy it is all so confusing and frustrating.",
