When guidelines change for something like scans, it is harder to get insurance to pay, in the case a patient feels that one is needed, and harder to get the doctor to order it in the first place. You can also see the cost curbing in the recommendations for mammograms beginning at 50, not 40. I suspect this is just the first act of cost cutting, and more procedures will be eliminated for more people as time goes on.",

People here (except the few who have posted  in this thread), don't seem to realize that we are in the midst of a huge negotiation in cancer care, with Avastin already taken away, (many would say because of costs), and now a question mark on screening mammograms under 50. Introduced into the cost cutting conversation by ASCO in this \"top 5\" are elimination of screening scans in 'early stage', some limitation on chemo, with it being up to the doctor or ASCO to determine what \"close to end of life' means..... Who is comfortable with someone else deciding what \"close to end of life means?\" Then there are some other limits on blood stimulating drugs, as well. People who look at the latest 'top 5' on its face and say they are ok with it, do not realize that this is just a starting point in the conversation to get this community used to being ok with treatment options taken away, and with nebulous terms put in place as conditions for procedures, like \"early stage, when it is unlikely to spread\", and \"close to end of life\".That COULD be a year, or two, depending on whomever is doing the definitions, and certainly may take on an evolving meaning as health care budgets get tighter. Can a doctor actually tell who is a year or two from death? I think not. This kind of \"stuff\" from ASCO cannot be taken lightly, with what went on with Avastin, and what has come down on the screening mammograms. And with the crazy agendas from insurance spokesmen 'pretending' to be oncologists at major cancer centers, as in the article I posted above. The government is apparently willing to accept even more collateral damage from this disease that is currently the case, in playing with cost negotiations and broad based guidelines for procedure giveups and that is a sickening prospect.  Further, all of this translates to more hassles getting these mentioned procedures approved by insurance, in case there is a need for a screening mammogram under age 50, or a scan in early stage, or chemo. Does anyone really need more hassles with insurance companies in paying for necessary treatment? Everytime this sort of thing comes out the insurance misers get emboldened about what they will not approve. I  posted above once again a very very disturbing article about cost curbs, and my sense is that this weeks \"stuff\" from ASCO is just the first step in moving toward the direction this article suggests ,and it is a sickening prospect. Also you will note in that article you have got one \"oncologist\" meeting with insurance companies and trying to devise ways to curb costs. It makes one wonder who is actually paying for that guy's endowed chair at Johns Hopkins, and if I were a betting person, I would put my money on Blue Cross. There is also a well known BC advocate who posted here this week, jumping into the middle of a discussion on Avastin, defending and explaining the FDA (dis)approval process relating to Avastin. I wonder who pays her salary? Look her CV up on the internet and you might be surprised to find it is the FDA. But she says she is working \"with\" the FDA not \"for the FDA.\" These people sound so much more independent when one doesn;t really know who is paying for their spokesmanship. but as a matter of ethics there should be NO confusion when the appear in articles and in this space about WHO is really paying them to speak. And when it is the FDA and insurance industry paying for spokesmen supporting cost curbs and elimination of procedures and drugs, but those spokemen are feigning independence, it is obvious someone takes this community for dupes. Unfortunately, however, this community is asleep at the switch about what is really going on, the need is to wake up and smell the coffee. Also, if I can figure out that something fishy is up with the governent having a\"breast cancer advocate\" on its payroll to watch forums like this and to jump into the middle of an Avastin conversation with a defense of the FDA, as happened right here this week,  a lot of other people ought to be very suspicious also, about what  goverment/insurance  is up to.",

The top 5 only seems to take procedures away from patients, it does not address cutting the per unit cost of procedure reimbursments, (which would affect dr salaries), nor does it cut insurance overhead, (which would affect insurance salaries.) Further, the baby boom generation getting to the most expensive health care years of their lives is not something that could not have been forseen. I mean, it really was pretty obvious even 10 years ago. Taking away procedures seems just neanderthal. Costs of the procedures and the drugs need to be more reasonable, which could allow more access, but the stake holders, insurance, Oncology community, who have a voice in this matter are protecting themselves. Drug developers obviously want as much as they can get. They might need to accept a good return, not necessarily a blockbuster return, for the sake of all. Bottom line, the  consumer needs a voice in this negotiotion, since he/she pays the insurance premium, and co- pays.",

For ASCO to be saying, \"we don't think they really meant to choose chemo, they must have been trying to please their families,\", or whatever, is overstepping by ASCO. And I will stand by my concern that defining \"end of life\" is a time frame which could mean different things as time goes on, it could mean different things to different people, and bottom line, this implicitly prods the doctor to tell the patient when they are going to die, and when they will get no further treatment. Scary. and what if that doctor is wrong? Bottom line, this \"top 5\", along with the (dis)approval of Avastin by the FDA, and with the new recommendation of no mammograms for under 50, is all about less choice for the patient, not more.  So, what we are really talking about here is taking options away from the patient, For instance, in the case of scans, if needed, due to symptoms, I am suspecting that the patient will now face a battle with insurance over the payment, and I suspect that there will now be insurance guidelines to satisfy over the blood factors, to make sure the patient is not in the group who does not qualify, according to the \"top 5.\" Government and Insurance taking the option on these issues away from the patient, even in  cases where the procedure makes sense, and giving insurance a reason to justify denial, even in  cases where the procedure makes sense, are actually what this is all about.",

While it is easy to give up hope, with the seemingly foregone conclusion among some people that there is no hope whatsoever, I think it is important to look at the people who have survived this for years. I also think it is very important to recognize that the statistics which are out there floating around are years old, and are averages, before certain drugs (like herceptin) were introduced which remarkably increased the averages.. I am not sure that there are statistics available  which reflect all of the current  treatments. In the meantime it is important to recognize that cure is something which WILL be solved, with the right amount of scientific research and funding, and that that cure may be an idea in someone's mind this minute. It is inconceivable to think that this disease will not be manageable in the future for a long time, with the drugs which are already in the pipeline. It is also important to let the government funding agencies know that we are interested in a long life, and that we do not think their silly games with taking away drugs which have been helpful to large numbers of people, like Avastin, are cute, nor acceptable. The Komen organizations and some of the government agencies like the FDA have tried to distract and divide the BC lobby with the idea that prevention equals cure, so we also need to be aware that we are up against a very underhanded agenda which uses  \"Breast Cancer Advocates\" as paid government spokesmen, defending the FDA's defenseless agenda in the social media.  Further, there is no excuse whatsoever, in my mind, for the FDA to take any significant amount of time in approving drugs which have already had standout performance in clinicial trials, like Envirolimus and TDM1.  The FDA and ASCO have made such a production of putting people through their paces to travel all over kindgom come to get these trials, and BC patients have willingly done that, so now it is up to the FDA to complete its part of the bargain and to make the new scientific advances available to the public that needs them.

People in that generation started smoking when it was semi-socially acceptable, when smoking advertising was all over the airwaves, and when there was no concensus practically that smoking was a very bad thing. So, because the government decided at some point to get more information out on smoking, and changed the information on smoking 180 degrees, she wants to forget the part that the govt and the medical profession let people down years ago, when they did not get the message on smoking out early enough, Come to think of it, if smoking is so bad, why do they still sell cigarettes?  Seems like the govt is talking out of both sides of its mouth on that one. That jerk doctor needs to recognize that a failure of the medical profession and the govt years ago led to this woman being addicted, the message put out then was NOT the same as it is today. I suppose now with the new information that alcohol causes cancer, hrt causes cancer, birth control pills cause cancer, this horrible doctor will soon be telling BC patients that they caused their own cancer, and they do not deserve any treatment, even though research and the govt have been very slow to point out these issues, and in many states, it is the state profiting from alcohol sales, and the government pushing birth control pills as something health plans must cover. The fallacy of her argument in favor of refusing to treat people who \"cause their own problems\" is that she does not realize that when people started smoking in many cases, it was not seen as dangerous as it is today, and the government for a long long time did not get out a consistent message of how dangerous it is, even to the point of still allowing cigarettes to be sold. Blaming people for starting addictions when research and social norms indicated they were safe, and applying new research and standards, is totally crazy.

All of this is my paraphrase of what the study in the second poster's link says, under \"discussion.' \"Clinical Relevance of Withdrawal therapy...) What these people seem to be saying is that instead of stopping one hormonal and jumping right  into another, there should be wait time of a number of months, during which time they think some people will have no progression.",

That would certainly explain why stopping it in some cases would lead to a \"beneficial withdrawal effect.' Doctors need to give their patients correct information, not misleading information.",

But if you read the study it did sound encouraging, that what might really be going on with progression on all of the hormonals, (they did mention others), is that the BC actually adapts to benefit from the hormonal, rather than be halted by it, so when the hormonal is taken away, then the BC stops for a number of months. I think they could actually have a good idea, and it seems to be a novel idea, because I have not heard of any doctors doing that, they rush to start the next thing. Which shows just how little they really know about all of this, and that is what I find strange. Over 40 years ago the US put a man on the moon, using a lot of resources and scientific know how, and the reaction of BC  to anti hormonals should have been on scientists' mind a long time ago. This is not rocket science at all, it is an area where they have neglected to put resources, time and effort. So, I think they would try it for several months with no hormonal and see how it goes, as the original poster was saying. They simply do not know who this would work for.",

The PET scans, as you know, show metabolic activity, and the liver can regenerate.  Perhaps your local doctor can email your next scan to the expert liver doctor in the future, so they won't be scaring you with improper interpretations(?). It is concerning that these doctors base treatment on scan results, and we do have to worry that they are able to correctly interpret the scans....so, I am all for having the most expert doctor interpret the scans, to avoid an unwarranted change in treatment.",

Your voice and advocacy is very much needed in stage 4, as you will find, with an FDA which is in slow motion on the approval process for needed drugs, (saving money??), which rescinded Avastin, (for safety reasons ?  when it is in use in other diseases?, or for money reasons?), and when we have apologists for FDA behavior paid by the FDA and posting on these boards as \"breast cancer advocates\"  that we need to wait more time for the results of TDM1, at least until the ASCO meeting June 1? (  Why does the FDA  need to wait until the ASCO meeting to get the needed information from Roche? Have they never heard of the telephone?)  It seems that there is a battle going on between the FDA and the drug companies with approvals of new and promising drugs, in which the FDA is threatening to withhold approval, recind approvals, and to drag the approval process out, in order to force the drug companies to consider pricing as an issue, when considering the power that the FDA holds to force the drug companies wait for Survival Data in these trials. The FDA needs to have a better method of approving drugs, separated from the price fight with the drug manufacturer. Their lack of consideration for the public  who needs  the drugs is coming through loud and clear. Also, as I read your story in the Washington Post, about the false negative mammograms, I could not help but think of the similarities with another case I am aware of, where the mammogram facility, which received yearly FDA inspections, had several years of warning letters in the Commonwealth of Virginia files, which are never made public. The warnings were about such issues as late techinical reports to the state, operators who did not meet the minimum number of hours to be certified, and who were actually employed at this facility, and so forth. And the public thinks that sometimes breast cancer just cannot be seen on the mammogram, but the training of the technician has a lot to do with what shows up (improper positioning), and also the adjustment of the equipment can cause suspicious areas not to show up, and problems in this regard with poorly trained operators, or with equipment which is poorly adjusted and late in inspections, is contained in official FDA and state files, and never seen by the unsuspecting public.  I don't know if any of that played a part in your situation, but PM me and I will let you know what I know about it. It is sickening to me to think that the FDA has warning letters to mammography facilities in its files, where it is aware of problems, but it lets this go on without so much as making the public aware of the problem, and then when people get clean mammograms and have stage 3 or 4 BC, the FDA just lets people go on believing that \"sometimes it just doesn;t show up.\" Yeah, right. ",
