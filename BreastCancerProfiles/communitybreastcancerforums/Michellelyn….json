I had the same stabbing feeling, lump, clear mammogram and was sent home being told I had a swollen milk duct and to come back in 12 months to re check. My breast continued to hurt and continued to grow. I was uneducated about breast cancer and continued to think it was just the duct filling up. I wish I had requested an mri or a biopsy. By the time I returned I was stage 3c breast cancer. Doesn't mean this will happen to you. During menopause your body will go through changes. But you know your body. You worrying could be just as unhealthy as ignoring a problem. Get a second opinion or ask for additional tests, put your mind at ease. Best wishes.",

Once you get that plan, you'll know exactly what to expect. Is it possible to sit down with the ex and ask for a truce during this trying time? Keep supportive people in your life, I don't think I could have gotten this far without it. Best wishes, Michelle",

It takes time to fit into schedules, wait on return calls. Oh it's so nerve racking. You want to get this out, now! Right? Well take a few breaths. First I received my diagnoses from my ob, then I scheduled an appointment with a surgeon. I saw him the following week. Then I scheduled an appointment to meet am oncologist. He's the one that was hard to get into. It took two weeks to meet him. Once I did meet him, things moved quickly. A few test were run, MRI, PET scan, we had to wait for the biopsy to come back telling me what the cancer was made of (mine was er pr positive, grade three). Then the port was installed that following week and chemo started two weeks later. It felt like it took an eternity. Although everyone's treatment plan may not be the same. Your treatment will start moving quickly once your team is assembled. Hang in there, you've got this! Michelle",

Now that the joint pains have started to ease up a bit, I'm going to take your advice.  Thank You!",

But I feel confident it's going to help. Can't wait ti start on Wednesday. I'm the mean time I've been doing my wall stretches and trying to do some breathing exercises. But it's not getting better. The heat and humidity we're having is also causing my lymphedema to act up. I can now feel cords in my arm pit. The tightness that runs down my arm makes it unbearable to stretch the arm straight. I have mild lymphedema, does anyone know if this is going to cause my lymphedema to get worse? I'm so worried. I'm really having a hard time. My last chemo was February 29th, since then my eyebrows and eye lashes grew back, only to fall out again recently. I walk around flat chested because my prosthesis are hot and uncomfortable. My hair is shorter hair than my husbands, I have wonderful hot flashes from the tamoxifen.... Joint pains... I could go on. Now let's add this worry. So thank you all for being here. It's good to know I'm not alone and it's nice to know there are people who don't feel I'm overreacting. Michelle",

I didn't have a wig, so I wore my hat always. I was lucky since it was winter while I was on chemo. But with the hot flashes I was having... Wearing a hat would sometimes set me on fire! However, it was harder to hide my hair loss on my face. I noticed people staring. I wondered what they might be thinking... Did they think I had poor taste in make up, that maybe I was heavy handed with the eyebrow pencil? We're they taking pitty on me? Either way, I just wished I fit into the crowd like everyone else. I understand how you gals are feeling. Your not alone. I sometimes wonder if we're being our worse critics. I try to find happiness in the fact that I'm still here walking the earth and I'm trying to remember this is temporary. : ) Michelle",
