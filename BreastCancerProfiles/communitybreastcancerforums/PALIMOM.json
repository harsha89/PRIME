Pain is still there but it's bearable. Just got the final pathology report that there were no other cancers in there so that's a big relief. Now I can focus on healing and getting these drains out. Seems like a long way off still",

Had to go back into surgery to repair hematoma and got two bags of blood transfusions. Feeling better today but really surprised at how much pain there is. Everyone keeps telling me that you can never have zero pain after a mastectomy and that it's not even desirable to (not sure why that would be), but this is way worse than my two c-sections and my wisdom teeth removal combined. BTW they have me on Tylenol and oxycodine",

That looks great. No, I do not have any type of surgical bra yet. I will ask my doctors about it. I was forced to go off the oxycodin because I ran out of it and my bs couldn't call in a prescription for an opiate over the weekend. I am now on tramodol which seems to be working fine. I tried to go off the pain meds completely and woke up with a searing pain in my right breast so I guess it was too early. I meet with both my bs and my ps tomorrow and am hoping to get at least two of my four drains out. They are well under the 30ml/day limit. Mostly I just want to know when I can start driving, doing simple things around the house and maybe even having a glass of wine with dinner. How grand all those mundane things seem right now ",

Annie66 - hope you\u2019re doing okay. We don\u2019t have a recliner so it\u2019s not an option for me, but anything that works is great Yesterday (the 21st) was a turning point for me. I still am taking all the pain meds but feel much stronger and there\u2019s less pain in general. I am starting to imagine feeling normal again. Today I went to the pharmacy and then got a latte at Starbucks. Felt a little self-conscious because I have one TE fully deflated but I wore a big baggy shirt and didn\u2019t notice anyone staring in horror. I have two minor issues - I haven\u2019t pooped since the surgery and a rash has appeared on my leg and torso. My surgeon said to take Benadryl and Dulcolax which means I am now one med away from needing a CPA to help me with my dosage schedule.  ",
