I was not in pain at all after the surgery and just a little sore from disuse of the arm for a few days.  Your doctor/nurses will let you know how much you are to move your arms and if they advise movement, make sure you follow instructions as you can very, very quickly develop a frozen shoulder if you are not using your arm(s) at all.  You will have excercises to start performing soon after surgery.  Other than the lifting restrictions, you should be pretty mobile.  I was working (at home) within a few days of surgery, with no problems.  You won't be able to drive at least while on pain meds if you take them and until a certain amount of healing has taken place.  I was driving two weeks later.  It varies.  But, most docs rec several weeks at home. Good luck!",

Just had my first hairdresser appt. last week.  He didn't cut anything as what I have is really nice around the face but cutting would have given me more of a blunt look.  Even the long curlies at the nape of my neck look a bit \"flirty\" according to him.  Gad, what a sweetheart!  He did teach me to use a styling product (he used Goldwell's Lagoom) to apply just to the roots and either use a vent brush and dryer or just leave to air dry.  This helps \"lift\" the base of the hairs for more fullness on the sides to match the top, which is SO thick and poppy-uppy!!!  Anyway, it works pretty well and I'd be almost entirely happy with my hair for the time-being if it were not for the lack of bangs, which I really need on my high forehead. Another woman on these boards said she had very good luck with a Redken product called Rewind.  Tina",

And, yes, many people report that their initial hair growth is colorless or looks gray but then starts to show color.  Mine was just my old mix of brown and some gray.  Very unattractive at first and not all over at once, sort of moth-eaten LOL.  Not so funny at the time. I also lost brows and lashes about five or six weeks out from my last A/C.  Then, I've lost my lashes four times, that is, every three months since then.  How's THAT for a pip?",

Use a waxy eyeliner pen/pencil to make eyebrows and make small brushstrokes, then blend, blend, blend with either a sponge tip or pointy Q-tip. Use a good eyeliner pencil to make a line (short strokes) on the eyelash line.  Very thin. Then, blend as above.  You would be AMAZED at how convincing these \"brows/lashes\" can look.  You really won't need false eyelashes.  I bought some but never felt I needed to use them. Good luck.  It's challenging but you WILL get through this. Tina",

Don't forget that you will also have to deal with adb. drains, not just the ones from the chest area.  These you may want to pin onto your panties.  Good luck with your upcoming surgery.",

Bottom line is that if I knew then what I know now, I would either have the lumpectomy with no rads or go for the mastectomy in the first place.  As far as I'm concerned, the rads did not work and just caused my further problems down the line. ",

In my own case, I had a uni mx with expander and had no pain at all so not even one pain med.  Maybe because of that, even though I was tired for a while, I was able to do some computer/paperwork within a week of surgery.  I didn't have the complication of extra sleepiness/drowsiness from pain meds.  Meds can be wonderful but do have side effects.  Just go at your own pace and let yourself relax into the rhythms your own body wants to set.  Good luck for your speedy recovery and the best for 2009.",
