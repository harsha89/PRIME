I also am going to start rads in April, Had a lumpectomy in Dec 08 and another one last week to get clear margins and check nodes.  Have clear margins and nodes are clear, This was all for secretory cancer not treatable with rads or chemo. Now i'm told have DCIS, they want to do rads and start me on tamofixin. Doctor told me mastectomy was probably a overkill. I want to keep my breast. I never have had a MRI. They are just know checking for HER. Somethimes I think I read to much on this site and it scares me, Am I making the right decisions.KatieKay",

The doctor I saw was nothing but professional, Its was the people you had to deal with before getting to her. They were not professional at all during registration and during any calls I made. Even my doctors office had problems with the reception.  Maybe they had a bad, still and all they really should act more professional, we are going thru alot. KatieKay",

They wanted to set me up with another appointment on Feb 24th for a follow up mammo (really, I'm not driving 4 some hours for a mammo) Had a mammo done here and sent down to them. Hopefully they will consult with my doctor after their pathologist look at my slides which I left there. I still don't have clear margins, and waiting to see what the next step is. I'm getting a little better about this waiting game. I've lost 11 pounds since this all began, thats the only good thing i can say so far. I really love the support and care thats on this board. Wishing you all the best. Katie Kay",
