My doctor said in studies it showed to be almost the same effectivness but the lesser dosage at a time made it so I might be able to keep my hair.  I am not getting Neulast, just the C/T and anti-naseua beforehand.  It is about 2.5 hours each week.  Before this treatment (before my BMX and DIEP) I was doing Cisplatin and Gemsidomine (sp?) every 3 weeks for 4 sessions.  I didnt lose my hair on that either and had very minimal side effects, just headache and tiredness.  Hoping it stays the same for the next 6 weeks. Best wishes to you!",
