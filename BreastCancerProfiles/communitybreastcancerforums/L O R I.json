I said to him, \"Why are you telling me about this 3 weeks later?\" and then I pointed out that the Pathology Report was dated 2 days after my surgery.  I was in shock.  It made no sense to me.  That was the start of my journey!  Needless to say, I have lost all trust in doctors.  I had to chose to focus on the urgency of my condition and also decide the route that I would take to beat this disease.   Lori",

They seemed so much more organized and understanding. They also seemed leary of going with the information supplied by my first hospital. They redid the mammogram and the ultrasound and had their own people read them. It seemed that everyone worked together to achieve the same goal. You will probably notice a big difference at the Cancer Centre. You say that you don\u2019t want any surprises but you will probably be pleasantly surprised at how well you will be treated and how they include you in everything, making sure you understand what is going on. Best to not dwell too much on the confusion and just look forward to your upcoming appointments. It will be like a new start!",

Kind of like filters that prevent spread of disease. Yes, hopefully nothing got past the lymph nodes. Just because you had positive nodes, it doesn\u2019t mean that the cancer cells got past the nodes. There\u2019s a lot that you can do to improve the immune system like exercise and heathy eating. It will really help emotionally too. You sound more relaxed compared to your earlier messages so congrats for that!! Good luck talking to your Dr. tomorrow! Lori",
