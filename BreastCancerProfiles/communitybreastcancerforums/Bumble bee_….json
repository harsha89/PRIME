With it being the highest cancer in my area I wanted to do something. I can't make a shot to not get it but I thought you guys go through a lot, you fight and then are stuck with this problem of not having comfortable bras or heavy inserts. One of my favorite teachers recently started reconstruction and complains how uncomfortable it is to have your bra rise up or the fear of the insert falling out. I joined hosa and decided to do a medical innovation on them. I was wondering if you had any ideas or things you wish you could change about the bra or insert. What have you difficulty so I can work to change it. Thank you for your time.",

I am happy to tell you me and my friends have been working on our project now for months and have nearly perfected it we will be shooting our video tomorrow to see if we can be accepted with this innovation into state. The farther we go the more impact we will make on people and that's our main goal. Make people understand this is important and not something to be taken lightly with little options of comfort. We also made a men's mastectomy shirt because guys as well can also get breast cancer. For lighter weight we mad them out of Styrofoam with a flat surface and padding.For our realistic one because others are expensive we created a lighter more realistic silicon like material. Also with the problem of it always pulling up. We created a double layer tank that has a sports bra inside with pockets so you don't have to wear the apron for drainage tubes. The shirt can be tucked in so you no longer have to pull down constantly. And that sports bra is open for inserts with a wider strap for comfort. Thank you for your help and wish us luck on getting through so we can share this with the world. Thank you guys so much love that this website is so nice and friendly and open to helping people.",
