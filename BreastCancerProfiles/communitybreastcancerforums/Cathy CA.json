You should speak to your benefits department about that.  Under COBRA you pay the entire amount plus an administrative fee, so it is normally a lot more expensive. If your employer does not allow you to stay on the plan, you should be allowed to enroll in your dh's plan.  A change in employment status is one of the life events that allows for change in coverage even when it isn't open enrollment.  You will probably need to provide proof to your dh's benefits department that you are no longer working and the date your coverage will end.",

However, it's worth taking the time to have the oncologist explain the pros and cons since that person has all of the details of your wife's case.  There may be something that tips the scale one way or the other.  Given that she is Her2/neu+, the tumor grade is probably 2 or 3.  It is very rare for Her2/neu+ to be a 1.  One of its characteristics is to be fast growing.",

I would caution you to make sure any reading you do on Her2/neu is recent information.  Herceptin has dramatically increased the survivorship of Her2/neu positive patients, but it has only been available for early stage patients for a few years.  If you read older literature/websites you will find information that makes it sound like Her2/neu positive breast cancer is the worst possible thing to have.",

What phase clinical trial is this?  I'm assuming it is either Phase 2 or 3.  Normally, Phase 1 (very early trials) is limited to people who have run out of options and you sound like you still have lots left.  If it's Phase 3, what were the Phase 2 results.  Basically, how promising does this drug seem to be? If you aren't on a clinicial trial would taxotere be the chemo of choice from your oncologist?  While I did taxotere without too many problems, there are women here who refer to it as \"taxoterrible\".  If you have a problem with SEs can you withdraw from the trial at any time?  Conversely, if you respond to the treatment and want to stay on it, are there indications that would cause you to be removed from the trial? The pump sounds interesting in that this would appear to be a version of metronomic chemo -- low doses for an extended time.  I realize it might not be the best for your life situation, so you'll have to weigh the info you receive.  Best of luck to you in whatever you decide.",

The blessing and curse of Stage IV cancer is that you know you're probably not going to live as long as you had hoped, but you're also not going to die a sudden death.  So, you have a lot more time to think about mortality and what-if.  I'm trying to get to the point where I just go about my daily life and do what I can for as long as I can.  For me, it's the only way to keep my sanity and not make everyone around me miserable.  May you find whatever brings you peace of mind in this journey.",

I would probably err on the side of saying too little, but leaving the door open if she wants to talk. ",

Since TN's don't benefit from anti-hormals or the Her2 targeted drugs, chemo is the only thing to attack whatever random cancer cells are still floating around in the body.  To quote my onc, \"it would be naive to think these are the only two spots where you have cancer cells\".  You need to trust your onc, but I would at least inquire about Zometa.  It's targeted to bone cancers and is also used for osteoporosis, so helps build the bones back up.  I'm having it along with two other cancer drugs and am hoping it specifically will help heal my bones so I can get back to a more active life style.",

I finished rads today and am starting Gemzar/Cisplatin and Zometa in two weeks.  That combination was chosen because the platinum drugs (Cisplatin and Carboplatin among others) are suppose to be good if you are TN.  Gemzar in combination with either Cisplatin or Carboplatin is suppose to be more effective than a stand alone.  The Zometa is for the bone mets. There had been some discussion between my doctors of doing chemo and rads together if the rads were going to be a low enough dose.  It didn't work out that way for me, but I know it can be done.",

Thirty pounds is a lot of weight to lose since many people gain weight during chemo the meds are so good at controlling side effects.  Has this all been since chemo started in January or since surgery in November?   Is she eating?  Chemo can mess with taste buds to the point that some people really have to force themselves to eat.  If she is eating and still losing a lot of weight, I would insist the doctors take a more serious look. Also, did she have CT and/or PET scans after diagnosis.  While not 100% fool proof, they would help determine if the cancer was anywhere else.  I'm sorry the doctors aren't explaining things to you.  Just as a suggestion, I find that I get better answers if I do research and then ask specific questions.  If you don't know already, get the names of all chemo and other meds she is on and look up their possible side effects.  This may help you have a discussion on whether other drugs would be as effective but with fewer side effects or whether there are things that can be done to better mitigate the problems.  I hope things turn around and your MIL starts having an easier time.  It's great that you are trying to get answers to help her.",

Peg -- I'm glad your son called.  If you haven't already, you might want to check out a site called www.conductdisorders.com and go to the Parent Emeritus section.  The site's motto is \"A soft place to land\" and it's a great on-line support group (like this one) for parents with children of various diagnoses.  The Parent Emeritus portion is for parents with children over 18.  Drop me a private message if you ever need an empathetic ear.  My oldest son has an entire alphabet soup of diagnoses and I've been through it all. Tinalee -- Happy Birthday! Paula -- Keep up the walking.  I am such a believer in exercise for getting through all of this. KathyL -- The memorial sounds beautiful.  I love the idea of releasing butterflies. Jo -- glad you had fun eating out.  I keep waiting for the taste buds to return.  We went to a Chinese buffet for dinner tonight just because it makes it easier to try to find something that tastes okay.  I can keep trying different things until one hits my hot button.  SheShe -- what a wonderful idea for a gift.  I'm sure there are several woman who will be thanking their unknown benefactor. Kimberly -- The walk sounds great.  Sure makes you feel good to be around so many people working towards progress on the bc front. D1 -- Hope your dd makes your Mother's Day wish come true and has a great game. Thinking of all the Jewels up for treatment this week and a congratulations to Sheebas and Deb for finishing!",

KathyL -- I'm guessing the difference between us is age.  Since I'm in my 50s and my natural estrogen production is shutting down maybe she feels my risk of using estrogen cream is a lot less. Carol -- yes, I'm assuming if you're estrogen positive, anything that adds estrogen is a negative.  Although, my onc did say that you only absorb a little and it doesn't get into the blood stream, so maybe it's worth asking. For those who asked , estrogen cream is used like KY except instead of using on an as-needed basis, you put it on daily for a couple weeks to help build up the vaginal walls and then keep using it a couple times a week.  It helps those of us who are getting scraped a little raw during the \"friction\" if you get my drift. Jenn -- I agree with D1 that chemo takes awhile to get out of our bodies.  I think I read somewhere to allow six months to a year.  I'm as impatient as anyone to get past all of this, but it does take time. D1 -- You reminded me I need an eye appointment as well.  I think the onc said to wait three months before having my eyes checked because the decadron can temporarily screw up vision.  I'm not having the blurriness I did during treatment, but I'm not three months out, yet, so that will need to be an August appt.",

My mail brought me a SP gift.  Two cooking magazines which have some delicious recipes in the them.  It's been so hot that I'm not in the mood to cook, but will be trying them out when it gets cooler this week.  Thanks, SP. KathyL -- hope the weather holds for your open house.  Little kids at swim lessons are so much fun to watch.  It sounds like yours are enthusiastic about it.  Joan -- Congratulations on finishing rads!  Under my arm is getting pretty tender and this heat isn't helping.  Only three more whole breast rads for me and then I switch to boosts.  Since my tumor was at 12 o'clock I think my underarm will be completely out of the field.  Carla -- your recipe sounds so good for a summer day.  I think cafepress is like zazzle.com.  People can put their designs up there and the shirts are made up at order.  Several teams are doing this as a fundraiser (my team has designs on zazzle).  That way you don't have to stock t-shirts in different sizes and colors.  I liked several of the designs.  I may have to buy a few for training shirts. D1 -- Sounds like an expensive, but fun day.  The university my youngest is starting in August has a linen package you can buy that includes two sets of sheets, mattress pad, comforter, towels, etc.  Since the beds are all extra long twin and those are sometimes hard to find at the discount linen places, I think I'll do the easy thing and get the package.  Jenn -- I'm so sorry your bff's son is not doing well.  Since my oldest is currently sitting in a drug rehab center, it hits close to home.  I will never understand why these kids that have so much opportunity offered to them continue to destroy their lives. LJ -- I had cording appear during chemo and it has slowly gone away, so I know it's not permanent for everyone.  I think it's really important to work on range of motion.  I was exercising right after surgery and the nurse practitioner was surprised how much range of motion I had at my first post-surgical exam.",

They can't tell you anything about your student unless the student has signed a waiver (FERPA is the education version of HIPPA), but can answer general questions.  They gave the parents this great calendar that shows the upcoming year's events and has little boxes of questions/reminders you can ask your kids.  I called it the \"nag\" calendar.  The pictures are beauitful, so I'll probably use it as a regular calendar on my fridge, but it is handy that it lists things like deadlines for dropping classes, when tuition is due, registration dates, job fairs, deadlines for study aboard programs and so forth. LJ/D1 -- I know I'm supposed to see my surgeon every three months for the first year and then every six months for a long time.  The logic is that the surgeon is the best person to do the breast exam since she should know what is scar tissue vs. what might be a suspicious lump.  My surgeon is a bc survivor herself and I love her.  OTOH, can't wait for rads to be over tomorrow and have a two-week check at the end of the month and then not see those people again. Just heard the garage door opener.  I'll go talk to dh and do shoutouts later this evening.",

Pretty much told him he was lucky he wasn't dead.  Don't know that it will have a long-term impact, but for right now it seems to have made an impression. Tina -- wow, moving to Colorado.  My husband lived in the Denver area for a few years and loved it.  I've lived in the same 30 mile radius my whole life, so have never had to make a long-distance move.  Hope it all goes well. Joan -- cute pictures of your dog.  She looks like a sweetie. CHJ -- congratulations on being almost done with rads.  My last couple sessions I practically skipped into the room I was so glad to be finishing.  I have a bit of peeling, but nothing too bad.  Hope you're doing fine, as well. KImberly -- glad PT seems to be helping.  One of my best friends from college lives in Vacaville.  Boy, has that place changed through the years.  I miss the Nut Tree of old.  I still have their receipe for dill bread, but haven't made it in ages. Carol -- the crab sounds wonderful and how nice that dh will be home on time.  Mine has been in a training class all week, so even when I've been here, our schedule has been a bit strange.  Hope all the Jewels have a good weekend.  We have a lake concert tomorrow night.  It's Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings.  They were in the Guess Who during the 70s, so it'll be mostly that music.  Later Randy Bachman was in Bachman, Turner Overdrive, so I think we'll get some of those tunes as well.",

Kathy -- August is probably my one year anniversary, as well, but I don't have a date to put with it.  I remember talking to a friend over Labor Day about the fact that I was feeling something different in my breast, but since I had a mammo scheduled for October didn't think it was worth going to the doctor about.  The October mammo, of course, is when everything started happening in quick succession. PALady -- with ds's good grades and test scores, he should be a good applicant for lots of colleges.  Since our son only had one place he wanted to go and they do early admission, we had things wrapped up pretty easily. D1 -- I can definitely handle two weeks with a roller bag and tote unless it's a cruise.  Then I start dragging out the dressy clothes and accessories.  Normally, for a weekend I can just do the tote, but it depends on what I will be doing.  Some stuff you have to take whether it's for one night or one month.  I'll let you know about Belize and cave tubing in December.  I'm looking forward to your Croatia report since we're going there next October. Carol -- If the air mattress is a practice run for the 3-day, I'll pass along what I've been told by our training leader.  She said the tents hold one double air mattress comfortably.  If you share a queen it will fill the whole tent.  If you and your tent partner are sharing your queen, maybe she can take some of your stuff in her bag.  The more handy hints we get on our training walks, the more I'm glad I'm camping at the Marriott for this thing.  LOL!",

Kimberly -- I hear you, sister. From what my gyno told me, it's the thinning of the vaginal walls more than dryness, but the discomfort is definitely there. While I'm grateful for how well I came through all the treatment, there are still times that it's easy to think how life used to be.  Hope Kath can just do surgery and Tamox.  Seems like I've encountered a lot of women who have been able to go that route.  One of my friends who helped me a lot when I was dx'd always feels guilty saying she's a cancer survivor because she never had to do chemo or radiation and was only on Tamox for a very short time before the doctor decided the benefits outweighed the side effects she was experiencing.  Paula -- how great that you were able to do some shopping on Coldwater's dime.  I've been to several fashion shows from their store and they have beautiful things.  There are a lot of outlet stores by our place in the mountains, so I tend to do my shopping there.  I swear half my tops are Izod.  When we were there two weeks ago, they were having 40% off the lowest price, so bought three cotton sweaters.  Technically they were summer merchandise, but here in SoCal, cotton sweaters are plenty warm for winter.",

I had to have my lumpectomy re-excised to get better margins, so the port was put in at that time.  I was under, so don't know how long it took for the port portion.  The port itself is by the collarbone, so it's still a little uncomfortable when my bra strap or seat belt shoulder harness hit it.  I see the surgeon again today, so am going to ask if that eventually goes away.  I have these plastic bands that are used to turn a regular bra into more of a halter-style, so am wearing those to try to keep the bra strap directly off the port. I'll try to answer any other questions, but I'm still pretty new at this myself. WVgirl -- for mouth sores, the sheet I received from the oncologist said to gargle with baking soda and salt.  However, it also said to call the doctor, so maybe it's worth putting in a call to just to check.",

Of course, since Dr. Slamon is closely associated with Her2/neu+ research, I don't know that anyone has looked at a broad cross-section of Her2/neu- patients to see if some small subset of those DO overexpress Topo2a.  Until someone does, I think only Her2/neu+ patients would be tested for Topo2a. Because Her2/neu+ was historically associated with poor long-term outcomes, the Topo2a test gives more information about designing a treatment that might improve success and that's what the FDA report references.  However, since the advent of Herceptin and it's approval for early stage cancer, those numbers seem to be changing dramatically.  That's why Dr. Slamon is so anti-Adriamycin.  He's saying that Herceptin is so effective that it makes the small gains from using Adriamycin in Topo2a+ patients almost statistically insignificant.  Dr. Slamon is considered one of the \"fathers\" of Herceptin, so I always take that into account when reading his studies, but it's still fascinating stuff.  As someone who is Her2/neu+, it sort of bothers me that I can't find much research other than Dr. Slamon's just because I'd feel better if I could read study after study saying the same thing.  But, Herceptin has only had approval for about two years for early stage breast cancer, so there just aren't any long-term, large participant studies available. --------------------------------------------------- Dx 10/24/2007, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIa, Grade 3, 0/3 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+",

I sailed through round 3 which made the onc happy.  The treatment center is a large lounge, so you can hear the conversations and it sounds like several patients had problems with their last round.  My blood counts are all high and SEs practically non-existant.  I'll be off to the gym for my four miles on the treadmill and aqua aerobics classes and then Russian History before my neulasta shot.  Have a good day all.",

KathyL -- ricotta cheese brownies sound wonderful.  I can't even stand to look or smell chocolate right after chemo, but normally it is one of my favorite things.  You're right about all the Her2/neu research going on.  A year ago I thought breast cancer was just one kind of cancer.  I think we've all learned a lot over the past few months about our individual types, plus all the wonderful possibilities the future holds. Maz -- I'm glad you heard from your friend.  There is something so special about those long-time childhood friends.  I've been thinking about that as I'm getting ready to meet with some college friends in a few weeks. I think part of it is that these are people we knew when we were still in our formative years when our only real role was being ourselves.  We weren't mothers, wives, career women, or any of the other hats that we now wear. Jenn -- It's been interesting to me that two of the people who have been most concerned about how I'm doing are male friends whose mothers died of cancer.  I think this hits men a lot harder than we realize.  In the case of one, we've been friends for almost 30 years and I knew his mother.  She died in 1984 and I have had to repeatedly tell him that breast cancer treatment is so different than what his mother went through including how improved the outcomes are.  Add me to the list of overly emotional during treatment.  I have tears well up at the drop of a hat.  The college instructor from whom I've taken a number of cooking classes died two weeks ago.  Her funeral was last Saturday and I cried for the entire two hour service.  This was a truly remarkable woman.  First of all, she was in her 80s and still teaching.  She survived the Nazi occupation of her country and moved to this country after WW II and created a wonderful life.  Her oldest daughter had bc a few years ago and once she found out I had it, would ask me every week how I was doing and remind me that she was praying for me.  She fell and broke her hip about four weeks ago and then when she was recovering so well, she had a blood clot and died.  I worry about her husband.  They've been together since they were teenagers -- more than 70 years -- and I don't think he knows what to do without her. To all who had rounds today -- may your SEs be few.",

I had a CVS coupon so went and stocked up on pure aloe while I was doing errands.  For any of you getting ready to start rads, it's a bargain.  The CVS brand is $2.59, but if you buy two the second is only half price, so lots cheaper than some of the name brands. D1-- the recipe looks yummy.  I used to make something similar only with marinara sauce.  Carol -- glad your weekend with DS was fun if painful for him.  My youngest spent last week on Catalina Island for marine biology and came back a bit under the weather.  He was able to go to work last night and tonight, but is saying he's not sure he can golf tomorrow.  He needs to take me to chemo before he goes to golf since my parents (who are my normal rides) are out of town. Vettegal -- glad you were able to have a big celebration.  It's wonderful to have a lot of positive along with the negative your family has been experiencing.  And, I love PF Chang's.  Good news for all who are reporting they see some hair growth.  I never lost all of mine, so I guess I'll know it's growing back when the bald patches fill in. I've been printing out maps of local hiking trials, so I can start doing longer walks to train for the 3-Day.  DH and I did a lot of hiking before and during the first few years of marriage.  Once the kids came along, we would do short hikes, but nothing very long.  It's amazing how many trails in the area we've talked about doing, but never have, so this is a great excuse.  If anyone wants to join our San Diego team, just let me know.  I will warn you it's a group of Springsteen fans.  The team captain is from Philly and I'm meeting her in North Carolina in two weeks for a concert and to make plans for the walk.  Did I mention we are all crazy?",

Carol -- I do treadmill in the mornings by myself and do a group training walk on Sunday mornings.  I think they are adding a Saturday one closer to the event (we're still 22 weeks out), so we can get back-to-back walking experience.  My current thought on the camping is that dh is staying in San Diego in a hotel and shuttling me back and forth each day.  That way I can get to the campground early in the morning and stay until late, but not actually have to sleep on the ground or take showers in the portable showers. Glad your first round of rads was easy.  There have been days that it has taken less than 10 minutes from the time I walk into the office until I walk out.  It's a quick process, it's just I'm tired of it dominating my schedule.",

Paula -- congratulations on finishing rads.  I finished the whole breast rads today and start the boosts tomorrow.  I have started using steroid cream since I was getting red under my arm and breast and am hoping that will prevent any oozing or blistering. Therese -- glad to hear your reconstruction and fills are going well.  What a nice gift from your sis for mother's day. Carla -- glad you're able to get the testing your want quickly.  It's such a pain to have to wait for all this stuff when you just want to get it over and done with. PALady -- hope you're having fun on your road trip and you made it through all your laundry.  Seems like that stuff is always piling up around here, too. Carol -- Make sure you put aloe on under your arm and breast as well as the breast.  I didn't even think about under my arm until it started getting red since it was only getting indirect radiation.  It's actually my worst spot at this point.  And, I have continued to be in water through this whole thing.  The original instructions were I could be in until I got red.  I've decided as long as it's not an open, oozing sore, I'm not giving up aqua aerobics.  I only have the seven boosts left, so I've made it most of the way.  Unfortunately, due to July 4th and my son's college orientation, it will take almost two full weeks to get in seven treatments. D1 -- I envy you babydoc.  The dour docs at the rad clinic are always so damn negative that they irritate me.  The latest from them this week is that things get worse before they get better, so even though I'm almost done, it will probably be worse after I finish treatment.  Did you find that to be the case?  If so, how far out from treatment did you turn the corner and start getting better?  Kimberly -- thank you for the postcard.  I was in Chicago in October and loved the Cloud Gate.  I sent dh photos from my cell phone of me standing in front of it reflecting back.  Not much going on here today.  Dh and son are out fishing tonight, so I'm by myself.  Probably should catch up on bills, so I can get them in the mail tomorrow, but that sounds boring.",

Carol -- San Diego had 4,600 participants last year.  Not sure how many there will be this year, but I know it's one of the more popular ones.  I didn't do a training walk this weekend, because I'm trying not to sweat.  I'm holding my own with the redness under my arm, but sweat definitely irritates it.  Sherry -- the pictures of you and your daughter are wonderful.  Sounds like she had a great shower.  My friend got lots of compliments at her shower for future dil on all the cute finger sandwiches we made, so was very happy when I talked to her this morning.

Had a fundraiser on Monday night for the Breast Cancer 3-day, which was a lot of fun.  Thursday was youngest son's 18th birthday.  Had dr. appts on Tuesday for oldest son and for me on Wednesday.  I was seeing my internist and she looked at my blood work and said \"nothing interesting here\".  It feels good to be back to where I'm a boring case.  I've always been ridiculously healthy, so the past 9 months of seeing doctors and going for treatment has been a big change for me. Julie -- I don't have suggestions on which all-inclusive, but do have a couple general thoughts.  First, don't book one that includes a lot more than you will use.  They are priced based on what they include, so as an example, if you don't scuba dive, don't use one that includes free diving.  Second, keep hurricane season in mind.  I have had several friends spend their vacations in emergency shelters (Cancun and Jamaica), so you may want to look at the West Coast or Hawaii if it is late summer/fall. Sherry -- I think your outfit is beautiful.  I like that it is simple, but elegant and the shoes are a beautiful accessory.  D1 -- I'm so sorry to hear about your friend.  In addition to losing a friend, cancer deaths just hit that much harder. My dh had a colonoscopy earlier this month and they removed one small polyp.  He works with someone who just lost his best friend to colon cancer, so his work colleague has become a crusader for early detection. Carol -- congratulations to ds and I hope dh will be home soon.  Quick correction on your geography --  Long Beach is due south of downtown LA.  If you went west, you'd be in Santa Monica.  I was born and raised in that area and it's always been strange that Long Beach is a city of almost 500,000 people and few have heard of it.  If it was anywhere except in the shadow of LA, it would be the biggest thing around.  Sorry you ended up with a hotspot.  Hope that long soak helps. Have they had you make a kit for your training walks?  We're suppose to carry our packs as part of the training and have moleskin, extra socks and the like in it.  One suggestion is to change socks after 10 miles. PALady -- even in my day I wondered why they were ever called \"sleepovers\" since the whole idea was to not sleep.  LOL!  I think video games have made it even worse.  My youngest will sit with his friends and play video games half the night just as their normal routine.",

D1 -- I got your postcard today, which is what prodded me into checking the boards.  Thank you so much.  You trip sounds like it was wonderful.  I'm looking forward to seeing it next year. LJ -- I think a study came out a month or two ago saying that the infusion could be safely increased.  It seems like two times ago is when I was offered the option of 1/2 hour infusion and I took it.  I've had two without any problem, but the more I talk to people, the more I realize how lucky I am that I don't.  It seems like most people experience at least a little reaction.  I have had echocardiograms, not MUGAs, so I don't know if the numbers are the same.  I know the LVEF that they look at on the echo can be as low as 50 and still be normal, so if the scale is the same, 63 is still pretty good. Carol -- we're up to 11 miles this month on our training walks and I think of you with each one I do.  I'm looking forward to your report in September. Kimberly -- sorry that the HOA is making you take down your fence.  Glad you and Carol had a good visit. KathyL -- sounds like your vacation is wonderful.  Living in SoCal, I am never interested in taking beach vacations, so we tend to travel to more exotic places, even though dh likes lounging on the beach.  I've promised him for our 25th anniversary in two years we are taking a long Caribbean cruise and he can go to as many beaches as he wants.

News vans followed us throughout the day and I did catch one story on TV a bit ago.  The opening ceremony was emotional because it made me think of everything we've gone through this year and how lucky we Jewels are to be survivors.  You look at all the people with their T-shirts, banners, and hats in memory of people who have died from this disease and it's overwhelming.  I've taked with mothers walking with teenage daughters, sorority girls from the local colleges, women many years older than I who are repeat walkers and it's very inspiring.  I'm tired, but looking forward to tomorrow.",

As far as what day, I think that might depend upon which treatment regimen you have.  TC is more likely to cause diarrhea.  I have only had the one round, so don't know if it will always be this way, but that SE kicked in about Day 5.  Seems like the first few days the other meds that cause constipation were winning the battle.  Don't know how easy it would be to sit in class and have to make frequent bathroom visits.  But, the other thing you might want to take into account is your Nadir.  It's Days 7-10 and I would think the onc wouldn't want you working in the hospital those days.  Mine was less than thrilled that I was flying during that time, but I seemed to come through it without picking up any nasty bugs. Bring a calendar with you to your appointment, so you can count out days and see what will work best for you.  Check what hours and days are available with this doc. Tuesday may be your only option if you have to go back the next day for a Neulasta shot.  My onc will only schedule chemo Monday-Thursday for that reason.  Let us know what the doc says and congratulations on your \"B\"!",

Kim -- I take classes at the community college for fun or to improve my knowleddge of areas where I am going to be traveling.  This semester, I have a Russian history class to get ready for a September trip to Poland, Russia and the Baltic countries.  I'm, also,  taking a travel class on Asia and Africa where you learn about things to see in various countries, a little of the culture and history and watch videos about them.  Then, I normally throw in a culinary arts class.  This semester is French cooking.  I've had this teacher three other semesters and she is a dear.  One of her daughters is a bc survivor, so every week she asks how I'm doing and makes sure I'm not doing anything too tiring.  My husband takes that class with me and it's a lot of fun.  At our community rec center, I'm a regular attendee for yoga, Jazzercise and aqua aerobics classes.  I was surprised by how many of the women I know from these classes are bc survivors themselves.  They have been so supportive and kind to me.  I get never-ending offers of food, rides, shoulders to cry on, and very sweet cards and notes.  What's probably the best thing for me is realizing that these women have full, active lives and I would never have known they ever had a battle with bc had they not told me.  It's hard to feel like this is the end of the world when you are discussing bc during an aqua aerobics class with a 85-yo woman who is a 30+ year survivor. I went to Look Good, Feel Better today and if any of you still haven't gone and have the chance, sign up.  I'm not a big make-up person, but you get lots of really nice goodies and it was so fun to sit and talk with others going through treatment.  Even the two instructors were bc survivors and had lots of things to share including a pep talk on how you will wake up one day and start feeling normal again.  Has anyone who has gone tried the T-shirt head wraps that are shown in the book?  It looks like it would be easy to do, but the instructor forgot to bring a styrofoam head to demonstrate on, so just explained it to us.",

Kimberly -- my friend was Stage 1, so had a small tumor.  In her case, the doctor felt the advantage of chemo versus tamoxifen alone was so small it wasn't worth it.   I know I was told somewhat the same thing very early on.  The early imaging showed my tumor right on the 2 cm borderline, so was told if it turned out to be less than 2 cm I might be able to avoid chemo if the full biopsy showed hormone receptor positive.  Of course, neither of those things happened, so here I am. Dana -- I'm so glad you don't seem to be having much in the way of side effects.  And, it's great that you were able to get out for a walk.  My taste buds are so shot the first week after chemo that I have to force myself to eat, but I know the steroids make a lot of people very hungry.  WVgirl -- My husband shows up towards the end of my chemo sessions.  He is a total wimp about medical procedures and I don't mind spending the time alone.  I schedule afternoon appointments and he comes by when he gets off work.  He normally has to hang out for an hour or more just because these things take so long, but he doesn't have to see any blood.  I'm glad yours was able to go.  I hope it gives him a better understanding of what you are experiencing.

Maz -- I have been so lucky with SEs, that the onc every time gives me the lecture on the chemo is still working even though I'm not experiencing any problems.  Be grateful for being one of the fortunate ones! PALady -- I had BCRA testing before surgery because I had several of the factors that would make me high risk.  The tests came back negative which is why I opted for lumpectomy.  I think it's good information to have particularly if you have sisters or daughters so that they can make more informed decisions.  In my case, I'm an only child with sons, so it was only a factor in deciding what type of surgery. Paula -- I love that you felt comfortable going \"topless\" in church.  Easter service with my mother was one of the few times I've actually broken out my wig.  A few years ago I went to church with a friend from aqua aerobics to hear her son sing a solo.  One of the other women from the class was there and when she said hello to me, she made a comment about not recognizing me with clothes on.  Boy did we get some stares from the people around us. KathyL -- thanks for the recipe.  It sounds yummy! Deb -- My onc has me taking Vitamin B6 for the Taxotere neuropathy.  If you aren't doing this, you might ask your onc if it's worth a try.  I started mine in advance of treatment and have had very little problem.  I get a tiny bit when I first get up before I get moving, but that's about it. Vettegal -- I'm so sorry about your sister.  Tell her we're all sending her positive thoughts. Carol -- Congratulations on your golf round! Kris60 -- Thinking of you today.  May your SEs be few. I normally sit and read when I'm getting my infusions, but yesterday there were two other bc patients in the lounge with me, so we were comparing notes.  One of the women finished chemo in December and is just coming in for Herceptin. She said she's already had her first hair cut to even things out and is close to where she will be ditching her wig.  I thought that was encouraging. Also, the onc had these Biotene sample packs that included toothpaste, mouthwash, gum, gel and something else.  Very handy for travel since I have two trips coming up this month.  You might ask yours if they have them.",

According to my oncologist, herceptin can cause neuropathy and the risk increases when it is taken in combination with chemo drugs.  She has me on a daily dose of 50mg of vitamin B6 to try to prevent/mitigate that.  You might ask your oncologist about this. Based on what I have read on the Her2/neu+ board here, some people think herceptin causes your hair to grow back more slowly.  So, be prepared that it may take a few extra months to get to the same place as others here who are not on herceptin.",

This is from the surgeon, not dermatologist, but for any of you having radiation, you should ask about applying Mederma and massaging your lumpectomy scar.  Apparently, radition can make pre-existing scarring worse.  The massaging helps break down the scar tissue underneath and the Mederma (I'm using the CVS generic version -- it's about half the price) helps smooth out the exposed skin. Thanks for the good wishes on today's infusion.  I go in the afternoon, so will hit the gym this morning, go for the infusion and then to class tonight.  My husband and I take classes at the community college for something to do.  Fortunately, they are adult ed no-stress type classes, so if I need to leave early, it won't be a problem.",

To qualify for FMLA you must have worked for the employer the past 12 months, worked at least 1,250 hours during that time, and the employer must have at least 50 employees at that location.  I realize not everyone qualifies for FMLA, but if you do, it's a good thing to do even if you have enough sick leave and/or vacation to cover treatment, just so you get the protections.  I'm glad you are getting unemployment! Kimberly -- It's the Sprinsgeen concert.  One of my guilty pleasures is going to lots of his shows when he's out on tour.  I have a group of friends (or \"stalker/nutcases\" as my dh calls them) that I go with.  Dh is going with me for three of the Southern shows at the end of the month since he's never spent any time in the South.  We're turning it into a week-long vacation. Carol -- I couldn't even begin to guess how many frequent flier miles I have racked up through the years, but probably at least three or four million.  I used to travel more than 100K miles a year on business, so earned lots.  Dh and I would normally do two trips a year to Europe just on miles and hotel points. ",

Carol -- The team capt. has family in the area, so did the San Diego one last year.  San Diego has a reputation of being a beautiful and temperature friendly walk, so I think it draws from around the country.  OTOH, if I do this again, I might pick some place different just to see 60 miles of a different city.  It's a coincidence that we both already had plans for Springsteen shows in N.C., so just decided to meet up there. Dana -- Glad you were able to talk to your classmate.  There are times that you have to do what you have to do.  Sounds like focusing on getting through school and not worrying about these people is your best course of action.

Julie -- It will be interesting to see if your son can be turned into a basketball player.  My husband was 5'10\" by the time he was 12 and had a lot of people try the same with him with no luck.  He topped out at 6'4\" but just isn't athletic. Carol -- ugh on the ugly tummy.  I get the tiniest bit queasy every day after rads, but fortunately it goes away after about 30 minutes. Kathy -- glad the tattooing went well.  Sounds like dd is quite the little dancer.  Kimberly -- I'm with Carol, nobody is taking my cleaning crew.  When I quit working fulltime I did switch from every week to once a month since I have more time to keep up on some of it.  But, it's sure nice to have a crew come in and do a thorough cleaning. D1 -- It's interesting to hear everyone's hair reports.  Once a week I play bridge at a sanctioned bridge center, so there are a lot of games going on.  A woman I didn't know came up to me today and asked me if I was going through chemo.  I told her I finished about a month ago and was blown away when she told me she finished four months ago and today was her first day without a wig.  Her hair looked great and it wasn't Jamie Lee Curtis short, either.  I would never have guessed she was only four months out.  Really gave me hope that I will be able to dump the caps and scarves by the time I go to Russia in September. Hubby and I are going to Indiana Jones in a bit.  I saw it the day it came out, but his company does movie nights where they rent the whole theater and that's the show they are doing this month.  He was going to take our 17yo, but kid ended up working tonight, so I'm the back-up date.  LOL!",

Kimberly -- glad the surgery went well and that the drains will be gone soon. Carol -- we had a lecture at our training walk yesterday about not doing too much too soon.  There are both Saturday and Sunday walks and the two leaders are trying to coordinate to make sure they don't both do longer walks on the same weekend.  Yesterday's was an easy 5-miler, but the San Diego walk is a couple months later than Seattle.  I'm still working on my fundraising.  I've set a goal to send out three messages/cards a day asking for donations. Julie -- hope your hot weather goes away soon.  It's miserable when it's that hot. Paula -- are rads going smoothly for you?  I'm starting week 4 and, so far, no burns or other problems.  Occasionally the shoulder harness of my seatbelt rubs the tip of my nipple just wrong and it hurts a tiny bit, but that's about it.  I'm using lots and lots of aloe. ",

Yes, the mammo was on the radiated breast.  I had it the afternoon I finished rads and didn't have any more discomfort than I normally do for a mammo.  However, I had a week break between boosts because of the 3-day weekend and going for ds's college orientation, so I had started healing pretty well.

Kimberly -- the comment about long-term issues related to chemo is a very broad one.  For example, as you know some regimens can cause heart failure.  If nurses know a patient has had this regimen, they will know to look for this even if the patient is being treated for a gall bladder (to use Sherry as an example).  There's actually a book published by the National Cancer Institute called \"Facing Forward:  Life After Cancer Treatment\" that discusses changes that may have occurred due to treatment and some suggestions for coping.  It's available on on-line here .  This is one of the publications that they are giving out to patients.  There is a companion one called \"When Someone You Love Has Completed Cancer Treatment\".  And, yes, you did donate to my walk fund.  Thank you again.  The support has been amazing.  I'm really looking forward to November when I finally get to experience it.  We have several weekend walks in October, so we can practice 18 and 15 miles back-to-backs in preparation. Carol -- Hope your bone density comes out good.  It's such an easy test compared to some of the other things we've experienced, but I understand what you're saying about being back at the scene.  I kind of feel that way about the breast center at the hospital, although my last mammo was clean. Paula -- so glad you and dh are getting good news.  The two of you have been through so much. Julie -- You have your surgery scheduled for my b'day.  Hope that's a good omen. D1 -- the trip to the Bahamas sounds wonderful for you and your sisters. To be able to do good and enjoy a family reunion sounds perfect.  Make sure you wear your compression sleeve on the plane.  I always forget to put the stupid thing on and end up hunting for it mid-flight.  Fortunately, I haven't had any le symptoms, but I figure I shouldn't take chances.",

The 3-Day is next weekend.  We have our final training walk on Sunday and then are going out for brunch as a group.  We were almost all strangers when we started training together six months ago and have become friends.  Walking miles and miles every weekend gives you lots of chance to talk and discover what you have in common.  I know there's some talk of having a monthly walk just for fun after the big event.  A couple others in the group have suggested that we try a city other than San Diego next year as a mimi-vacation.  I'm game for that, so we'll see what happens. Carol -- the surgeon told me she just does port removal in her office under a local.  I will still need mine until the end of January and the onc may have me keep it for six months after that.  Is there a reason your removal was done in the OR?

I've been reading the port reports since I only have two Herceptin infusions left.  Yeah!  The nurse said the onc will probably let me get it taken out as soon as I'm done, so figure I'll do it at the February appt I have with the surgeon for a normal check-up.  I'll just need to call and let them know.  Carol -- yes, I've signed up for next year.  Our training group is having a potluck brunch in January to share pictures and stories.  The group I trained with became such a special part of the experience that I'm looking forward to those five-mile walks we start in May. I'm schedule for an MRI tomorrow afternoon, so am drinking lots of water.  I have rotten veins, so am trying to plump them up.  The mammo was perfectly clean, but the surgeon still wants an MRI.  I think some of this is overkill, but I'm going along with it for right now.  Went and got a tetnus booster this morning because our upcoming cruise is to Central America and I figure I would rather be safe than sorry --  particularly since we are going cave tubing, zip lining and wandering through jungles to go stare at Mayan ruins.  Seems like those are all activities that could lead to a scrape. Take care everyone.  I'm sure everyone's holidays will be a lot cheerier this year.",

Carol -- Is a 3.0 cumulative required for the good drivers discount?  We made our son have a 3.5 because he was more than capable and we wanted to push him a bit.  However, we made it very clear that there was no way he was having a license without a good student discount. Tina -- I've worked at home for so long, I can't imagine having to get ready to go to the office.  Of course, the last office I worked at was a web development company where unless we had client meetings, you could almost show up in jammies.  I swear our developers never wore anything but shorts, T-shirts and flip flops.  I'm taking this year off from consulting, but figure I'll jump back in after I finish Herceptin next January. Julie -- Glad you're having a better day.  You have sure had a rough time all through this process. I'm sure I have a big black mark on my chart with the radiation oncologists office after my fit today.  When I went in yesterday I asked if I could be scheduled for my rads time and they said they would give it to me late next week (I start May 19).  I called this morning to say that is just unacceptable.  While rads is important it isn't any more important than my follow-up appointment with the surgeon, echocardiogram to check if Herceptin is impacting my heart function, future Herceptin infusions, etc.  I have several of these already on the schedule for the week I start rads and need to get the rads time locked down.  After being rather pushy about it, the scheduler finally agreed to at least give me times for the first week.  I don't know why they are making this so difficult. Yesterday was the last chemo and today the last Neulasta.  I can't begin to describe how good it feels to be done and know that every day is just going to get better.  I asked the onc if there is anything I need to do when I'm just on Herceptin and she said given how well I've tolerated chemo and Herceptin, she doesn't see that I will need any pre-meds.  The way she phrased it, on just Herceptin, I'll feel normal.  She did say it normally takes about two months for the taste buds to completely return, hair to start growing in, nails to grow out, etc.  I was hoping some of this would happen a lot sooner, but it seems like the end of rads and chemo SEs will be about the same time.",

I had the family over for Christmas Eve, so spent the day making dinner and getting everything ready.  Christmas Day we went to see my MIL while she's in the hospital.  I can't remember if I have explained this here or not, but due to her age/condition, she's hospitalized for each round.  They give her the chemo in a very diluted form and it takes about four days of constant drip each round.  She's getting adriamycin in addition to other drugs and it's light pink in her IV instead of the normal bright red. The tests indicate it hasn't spread and she seems to be doing well with the chemo. Like Paula, we spent today getting the tree and decorations down.  The cleaning crew comes on Tuesday and I wanted them to be able to vacuum up all the needles and other stuff. Yesterday, dh and I worked on our city's Rose Parade float.  If you watch the parade, the Mission Viejo float has a swimming pool in the middle of it and an Olympic torch.  I spent part of my day gluing white beans onto the torch.  The float barn we were in had some great floats, so I'm looking forward to seeing the finished products in the parade. Carol -- my aunt made a generous donation to the 2009 3-Day as my Christmas present.  I noticed you've gotten several donations already.  This year, I am taking the printed donation form to every doctor and asking them to donate.  I see the onc and internist in January and the rads onc and surgeon in February.  I'm hoping by asking at the beginning of the year, they'll be more interested. For the ladies looking at hysterectomies and oophas, one of my friends just had everything removed using guided robot technology.  She was back in the gym within a couple weeks and has done great.  It's amazing how little recovery time there is with the newer procedures. D1 -- have you visited Pomona College, yet?  If you are thinking of making a visit, let me know.  We live less than an hour from there.  I'm sorry dd didn't get into her first choice, but she has some excellent second choices. Norma -- what a scare and how lucky you are that you knew enough to keep pushing.  Blood clots can be very tricky, so it's good you are vigilant.",

Kimberly -- your trip sounds wonderful.  Sedona is so beautiful and peaceful and the Grand Canyon is amazing.  I would like to go to Copper Canyon in Mexico sometime which is similar, but haven't made it yet. D1 -- Sorry to hear about your pain, but am curious as to whether the therapists are in the rad onc office (since they call the technicians in the office I go to \"radiation therapists\") or physical therapists.  I may have mentioned I detest the rad oncs and everything about their office, so I know I have bad attitude towards them, but when I mentioned pain last week, it was quickly brushed off by the rads doc as \"that's not us\" even though the pain didn't start until after rads.  I may give the physical therapst I saw for lymphedema prevention a call if you are getting good results with them. California still has a June primary for everything except the presidential race, so I need to go vote this afternoon before rads.  Our polling place is an elementary school, so I'm waiting until they are out and I can find parking.  Tina -- I'm not sure I've ever seen raspberries growing, but boysenberries grow on the new growth portion of existing canes.  We have them against our back wall.  Dh hates them because they have lots of stickers, but he likes the pie.  I'll go out and pick a few to put in cereal or throw in a fruit bowl, but that's about it.  I'm not much of a gardener, but like having fruit trees, flowers and vegetables/fruit in the backyard.  It's so nice to just grab a lemon or whatever when you need one instead of remembering to get them at the store. ----------------------------------- Dx 10/24/2007, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIa, Grade 3, 0/3 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+",

SheShe -- make sure you talk with your onc about your problems with Tamox.  I'm not on it, so don't speak from personal experience, but I know it causes more problems for some than others and you have to weigh if the benefits outweigh the negatives. Dana -- if you are only going to do one zip line adventure, I'd vote for Cabo.  There's not much else to do there, but Puerta Vallarta has a lot of other options including just wandering around a very pretty town. PALady -- I'm going topless more and more.  I still wear caps if I'm running errands or something just so I don't get funny looks, but at places where most people know my story, I figure why not. LJ -- that's great that you are back to exercising.  I think that really helps combat the rads fatigue.  Make sure you lubricate everywhere.  I didn't do under my arm because I didn't think it was really gettting zapped and that's the place that got red first.  Paula -- sorry to hear that you are dealing with insurance issues.  We had the same thing happen to us many years ago.  Dh dislocated his shoulder and went to the ER.  We received several of the \"this is not a bill\" correspondences from the hospital, but never a bill.  We assumed the insurance had covered everything and didn't find out it had gone to collection until we were refinancing our house and it was on the credit report.  We had never even received a bill from the collection people. Kris -- I still have my port because I'm receiving Herceptin until January, but I've read elsewhere on this site that port removal is a very easy, painless procedure.  I know how you feel about just wanting to be left alone, but it sounds like it's done in office with just steri strips for a few days -- no stiches.  D1 -- We were on a Panama Canal cruise when we went to Costa Rica, so it was a shore excursion and I didn't pay a lot of attention to where we were other than I know it was on the Pacific side.  Have you ever tried cave tubing?  The cruise we're doing in December stops in Belize and I've had several people tell me cave tubing there is a blast. I love taking cooking class, but don't make very complicated dishes at home.  Class is four hours, so there's lots of time for prep, cooking, eating and cleanup, but I never feel like taking that much time at home.  You show up and the ingredients are already there, so no shopping involved.

All of that said, I think there is so much progress being made in the treatment of breast cancer that information will continue to come out that makes us wonder whether or not we've made the right treatment decisions.  It's important to not fall into that trap.  The goal is to beat this thing and stay disease free.  If we accomplish that goal, then the specific treatment we did or didn't choose isn't important.  Just like we've benefitted from advances in treatment that weren't available to women 10 years ago, those who come after us will have options we may not currently have.  -------------------------------- Dx 10/24/2007, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIa, Grade 3, 0/3 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+",

I'm playing catch up with the laundry, mail, and all that other stuff that one does after being gone for several weeks.  I had a note from my Secret Pal and some great kitchen stickers.  Thank you very much!  I have cooking classes tonight and tomorrow, so I've been trying to get my reading done.  We're covering salads tonight in garde manger, so I'm hoping for some good recipes.

Also, if your insurance doesn't covered many oncs, you may be able to get them to make an exception.  I know some insurance companies will do that if they don't have sufficient contract providers within a certain geographical distance.  One time my son needed a specialist and the only covered providers were a long ways away, so they gave us the authorization to use anyone we wanted locally.  Call the customer service number for your insurance and keep asking to speak to a supervisor.  Also, you might check and see if they offer case workers for breast cancer.  I had one assigned by the insurance company when I was diagnosed and she's available to help fight those battles for me.

Quick explanation on my MIA.  My father had a heart attack two weeks ago followed by by-pass surgery.  I didn't want to post during the time because things were not good the first few days, but he's doing great now.  I was at the hospital with my mother for the surgery during my nadir, so was disinfecting like crazy.  When the surgeon talked to us before the surgery, he started to shake my hand and \"I told him I don't touch people because I'm having chemo.\"  He looked at me kind of funny and then said \"that's probably a good idea.\" Two days after the by-pass surgery and with much indecision, dh and I left for our planned vacation to the South.  The first day Dad was still not doing well, so I thought we might turn around and fly back, but then he started improving and we were able to enjoy our vacation.  Dh had never been to the South except to change planes in Atlanta, so we went to Georgia, NC, SC and a little bit of Tennessee.  Enjoyed hiking in Great Smoky Mountains National Park and touring Civil Wars sites, Charleston, Savannah, Georgia Aquarium, etc. Loyal Springsteen fan that I am, I had timed this trip to coincide with when his tour was hitting the South, so we caught three shows.  I always do General Admission, which means you stand on the floor for the whole show.  The do a lottery earlier in the day to determine who gets to go in first with the first 300-500 (depending on the size of the venue) in a barricaded \"pit\" in front of the stage.  We made the pit all three times and were in the very front for the Greensboro show.  Carol pointed out to me that I've never posted a picture, see the concert one below.  Dh is the tall guy with the beard in the rust shirt and I'm in a blue scarf to his left.  The band is all too familiar with cancer and Springsteen is very active with fundraising for Sloan-Kettering.  I suspect that's why at the end of the show, the drummer came down and gave me autographed drum sticks.  But, maybe he just liked my smiling face",

D1 -- Tough call on what to do about nationals.  I agree its a lot of money since she has already gone and it seems like the team will be out after the first round.  Probably because I'm from SoCal and we have pretty much all the same stuff, Orlando has never been one of my favorite places to visit.

Here is what I'm doing for fundraising ....  I have signed up for a fundraiser at Rubio's (a fish taco chain in Calif.) that gives you 20% of the purchase of everyone who brings in your flier on the given day/time of your fundraiser.  The fundraiser is July 14, so I've started handing out fliers in the aquacise, jazzercise, and yoga classes plus at bridge, bunko, etc.  Attached to the flier, I've stapled a business card that I had printed up that includes a brief description of the 3-day and how donations are used.  It has both the 3-day website and my website on it.  This makes it easy to say to people, I'd love for you to attend my fundraiser and if you want to donate directly, go to my website.  It seemed easier than directly asking for contributions.  I know Souplantation has a similar program, so you might check around.  As I get closer to the date, I'm going to see if my surgeon and rads onc. will let me put fliers in their offices since they are close to the restaurant.  I, also, put the flier on my website so people can print extra out to hand out to neighbors, members of their clubs and churches, schools, etc.  Also, I have a signature line at the end of my emails that says \"I am participating in the Komen 3-Day Walk this fall.  For more information or to make a contribution, go to website\".  I sometimes forget that it's there, but was just reminded a bit ago when I sent an email to someone who responded that she would support me and had an aunt who walked in it last year.  It's a very easy way to let people know you are looking for contributions without directly asking. I haven't been too good about staying up on all the posts, but I am thinking about everyone.  I had my first Herceptin-only infusion yesterday and it was a piece of cake.  This is week 2 of rads and so far, not much problem.  I'm noticing some eyebrows coming back but not any other hair, yet.  Of course, it's hard to look at the top of my own head and my husband is getting tired of my saying \"do you see anything?\"",

Last night dh and I went to a concert with the Greg Rolie Band at our local lake.  He was one of the founders and lead singer of Santana and wrote a number of their hits.  The show was very good.  He was also one of the founders of Journey and their lead singer before Steve Perry, but didn't do any of their songs.  Outdoor concerts are a big part of the summer around here and I love them.  Nothing beats eating your picnic and enjoying the evening breeze. Carol -- enjoy your training walk today and make sure to stop and stretch your calves along the way.  D1 -- I'm sorry about your toenail and the lack of sympathy in your house.  The good news is, they do grow back and fairly quickly.  I caught one of mine on something last summer and ripped it in half.  It ended up falling out and looked ugly for awhile, but did come back okay. KathyL -- hope you find something wonderful and funky at the jewelry party.  And, kukos on thinking about getting a personal trainer.  Once I finish and fully recover from rads, I want to do the Jazzercise \"personal touch\" program where you work one-on-one with an instructor for six sessions.  I'm sure there are things I could be doing to get more out of class.  I've been doing the same stuff for so long that I think it's time to mix it up or add intensity. Jo -- congratulations to your student.  That's a wonderful achievement and you have every right to be proud of her and your contributions to her getting the award. Carla -- how sweet of your gf to go with you for your testing and then to go out for a girl's day.  I don't think most people realize how stressful all these tests are on us, so it's great that you had her support. LJ -- sorry your rad sim and tattoos were so bad.  Rads is it's own frustrating experience because it's daily and it doesn't let up.  Make sure you take care of yourself. SheShe -- your dd's shower sounds wonderful.  I'm looking forward to seeing the pics. Tina -- I don't know anything about housebreaking dogs, but I'm sure they will learn soon and then you'll be off constant clean up.  Maybe that's why puppies are so cute -- it makes it easier to forgive their \"mistakes\". Tina -- Enjoy your rides.  I've always been a bit afraid of motorcycles, but I know people who love them really love them. Kimberly -- great duck fuzz!  Prior to chemo I was rather salt and pepper, but the new stuff is coming in dark, so it's pretty noticeable (if stubbly) right now.  Glad you had a wonderful trip and it was so sweet of you to remember all of us.",

On the opposite end of the spectrum, I'm getting ready to head off to Salt Lake City tomorrow for youngest son's college orientation.  They do a one-day parent orientation in addition to the student orientation.  They offer various orientation options and he chose the outdoor education one, so will do the normal orientation activities plus spend a couple extra days white water rafting, rock climbing and hiking.  I come back Wednesday night, but he'll be there through Friday. Paula and Julie -- sounds like you both had wonderful trips.  So glad Ed was able to relax, Paula.  I can only imagine the stress both of you have been experiencing. Carol -- so sorry to hear about Ginny's nephew.  It's great that he already has such a wonderful support network. Kathy -- I enjoy those \"nothing\" days.  They give me a chance to recharge.  I'm on Herceptin until January, as well.  In fact, that's why I'm up posting early this morning -- have an infusion first thing this morning. CHJ -- happy you checked in to let us know how you're doing.  I understand how you feel about radiation.  It hasn't been harder physically for me than chemo, but I think it's been harder mentally/emotionally. Sherry -- loved the picture.  You two definitely look alike. Kimberly -- I think your hot weather is headed our way.  Yesterday was great, but looks like it's hot the rest of the week.  I'll be back in workout mode the end of the week when I get back from orientation.",

Your can tell $4 a gallon gas prices are having people drive less.  I can't ever remember being in a major national park and having it so empty. It was nice not having to fight crowds at the scenic overlooks or on the trails.  We did a lot of hiking, so I don't have guilt about missing my normal training schedule. We really enjoyed ourselves and other than all the driving was pretty relaxing. We stopped on the way back to have breakfast with ds and hear how things are going with him.  Sounds like he's settling in nicely and making lots of friends.  They have tons of activities for the first few weeks, so he's staying busy.  His schedule is a little strange in that not all of his classes start this week.  So, for the first three weeks he only has three classes.  Then another one kicks in and another one at the eight week mark. It certainly lets him ease into the whole college thing. Carol -- so sorry to hear about the problems with ds.  Even with everything we have exerienced with oldest ds, we haven't had a tattoo or piercing issue.  My mother told the kids years ago that she would disinherit them if they ever got a tattoo or piercing. A couple times he's asked me if I think she really means it and I've told him don't risk it.  There's enough money on the line that I think it's one of the few impulsive things he hasn't done.

Kathy -- The best weight bearing exercise is walking.  You get just as much benefit doing 5-10 minutes multiple times a day as doing a long stretch, so try to work in small doses if you can't find a slot for a longer workout.  When I was working, we would sometimes just take a break and do a lap or two around the floor of our building. I think I have six more Herceptin infusions to go, but it might be seven.  We never really discussed total number, just that it would be a year. One of the local hospitals is part of a grant from the National Cancer Institute and I'm on their survivor panel.  We had our meeting this morning to discuss nurse education.  They are having a dinner next month (along with CEUs) to present cancer patient issues to nurses from other areas. Due to chemo, there are long-term implications when dealing with cancer survivors.  It's an interesting panel and gets me thinking about different issues.",

I'm definitely ready to do this again next year!  The San Diego walk raised more than $11 million and I think it's the biggest of the walks.  Several were surprised to see me at aqua aerobics this morning because they thought I'd be too tired, but I feel great.  I was already talking with them about fundraising ideas for 2009.  I think given the tight economy, events may be a better way to go, so was discussing bridge tournaments and bunko parties. Thanks for all the support, Jewels.  I'm sure Carol agrees, we never would've even thought of doing something like this if not for all the great support we receive here.

Carol -- my issue with the MRI (which came back clean) is that they are known for false positives.  I can see doing one if there is even a shadow on the mammo, but I don't know that I agree they should be routine.  One of the hospitals in our area is now using Breast Specific Gamma Imaging technology which supposedly lets them see cancer as \"hot spots\", which lets you avoid a biopsy for anything other than cancer cells.  I may talk to my surgeon about switching to that hospital for screening since she's on staff there as well.  It seems like the three main hospitals in our area are all competing with each other on who can have the fanciest technology for breast health.  I still use the hospital that had the first \"women's center\" since my boys were both born there when it was still pretty new.  D1 -- I have only spent time with therapists as part of my son's treatment, but if you think things are improving with dh, you might want to wait and not go back until you have something to discuss.  While I think therapists can provide a great service, it can also be a very expensive sounding board if you're not actively working on something specific. The picture below is from the 3-Day with a couple of my training partners.  I'm the one in the middle. Carol -- I'm wearing the \"check your boobies\" hat you sent me.  I received a lot of comments on it along the walk.  Thanks again!",
