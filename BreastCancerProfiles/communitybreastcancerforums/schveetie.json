Really puts things in perspective real quick. Anyone who has to experience this has been changed forever whether you were diagnosed with cancer or not. I have been clear for 3 years, but like you said, with every little ache or pain, you wonder if your sick again. Can be quite unsettling, but with the support of people like you all we can handle it. Wouldn't wish any of it on my worst enemy, bit it is so nice to chat to people who really understand and have experienced the same thing. Family and friends are very supportive, but most have not been down the same path you have. I started my own little info and chat site called \"Sisterhood of Hope\" - My motto is \"Sisterhood gives us our strength...Hope, our wings! My site Sisterhoodofhope.com can be accessed by typing that in the \"Address\" part of your browser where is http line is, not the google or other search engine part.  Just some of my personal experiences and thoughts. Just wanted to make others aware of how important screenings and early detection is. If I help just one person, then it was all worth it. Hope some of you all will give it a look and start some chats. Good News and Blessings to us all.",
