So I get checked every 6 months wuth akternsting mri, us, mammogram. When adh is found on a core needle biopsy they do an excisional bioosy to make sure there is not dcis or idc hiding in the same group.",

She had an mri and it turned out to be a papiloma in her ducts by her nipple causing the bleeding. It was all benign and she had it removed. The fact that your fluid was sticky could be puss due to an infection. As far as waiting 12 more days will not make a difference if not they would have rushed your appt. Maybe you can explain your anxiety and they might move your appt to a sooner date. My drs already know me and they try to work everything in one day if possible or asap.

I am going to see why but I got a bill for that amt. As far as mri and us I believe with the US you need a good technician that takes there time. When I was being diagnosed after a suspicious mammogram I had an us in my local hospital and the tech only found a .5 m cyst. I went to the breast specialist hospital and had more images and an us. This is where they saw the area that needed a biopsy and they found adh on the core needle biopsy. So yes I think us are great if you have the right tech and radiologist performing it. Mri is a great tool but depending on your breast activity you can get false positives and false neg. I think they are all good . My surveillance is mammogram 6 mo later us 6 mo later mri. So every 18 mo I get an mri. But at this cost I'm not sure I can keep it up. I'm going to find out why I have a large oop if it's not a mistake I'll have to switch ins. A birds1 is awesome I got a birds 2 I had a couple of cysts. They didn't mention calcifications in the report., Which was my problem the first time around ( clustered). Not taking tomaxifen yet. If you can I think all should be done .",

I went in for a mammogram (routine) my last one was in Oct 2014 but I have new insurance and did it 2 month earlier than the year. I was called back for suspicious cluster of calcifications. I had 2nd mammo i got a birads 4, so now im getting really scared. My gyno said its probably nothing. He sent me to a general surgeon. I kept my appt, so the surgeon comes in and said we need to do a core needle bopsy and an ultrasound. He said you have a birads 4 which means more than likely its cancer. I looked at my husband and we both said i wasn't going back there. I searched the internet for a cancer center near me and found one 1 1/2 hours away. I had my ultrasound done before my appt to the cancer hospital. It came back a birads 3 small cyst. I was feeling confident. Got to my appt at the cancer hospital gave them all my images and reports. They redid mammo and ultrasound I was about to be let go with just close monitoring mammo every 6 month for changes. Radiologist came back and redid ultrasound and found a second lession not of cyst looking. He did a needle core biopsy guided by ultrasound. Not bad at all not painfull. He called me the next day and tells me the results are benign but with an * so i'm back to confused. He said of all the samples only 2 tiny tiny pinhead size adh cells were found. Now i'm scheduled for incisional biopsy mon Sept 14, 2015.. I am scared out of my mind, I feel I have been frozen in time. My anxiety and dpression is at 100%. I will add I have silicone breast implants that I got only 3 years ago. Has anyone had a similar expierience or any advise for me. I only have my husband and he doesn't realize how serious this can be. My breast implants are not at all priority, but I also read the breast implants don't have a chance against radiation therapy because of the scar tissue. Has anyone had a similar situation. ",

Sorry you are going through this again but glad they didn't find cancer. linpiz glad to see you found us. I joined this club because I wanted to here from real women who could relate to all the different anxiety and emotions I was (am) feeling. To hear from other women diagnosed with adh and discuss adh with someone that actually knows and understands what I'm talking about.Everyone is different with their own personal risk. The last thing we want is to scare you and yes adh may never become cancer but It can and that's why we are closely watched . If you feel good with waiting and watching then that's what works for you. I also chose that option for right now and I feel good. I still have anxiety but it has gotten better. Am I nervous about my 6 month checkup Yes of course but I can now put it in the back of my mind and go back to my life before adh. I think once you have a plan it gets easier. My mo and gyn agree my benefits do not out weigh my risk at this point so I'm holding of on tomaxifen and praying we are all right. Ddw still praying everything goes good for you. I understand your anxiety you have a little more going on but remember positive thoughts 😊 Grandma glad you made your decision, peace of mind is priceless. (((((((HUGS))))) for all     ",

Hopefully it's small enough that all you'll need is tomoxifen. Check in with us and let us know how you are doing. The diagnosis is always hard but once you get your game plan it tends to ease up some. I believe clean margins does mean they got it all. Good Luck on your future treatments.

I went to my GYN today and confirmed it is a swollen lymph node. I will go to my Onc tomorrow and find out where I go from here. I have been having weird symptoms for a few months now severe back and leg pain and shoulder pain depression not knowing why because I have nothing to be depressed about. But I have had weird dreams and a lot of insomnia which usually I can fall asleep and stay asleep really easy. But I will continue to keep you informed of my symptoms and my prognosis if that is going to help anyone on this thread. I hope I can report back a good outcome of this situation to give people with the same symptoms hope.. I also should let you know that I have entertained and drank a little more wine than I should have, so maybe that will make a big difference. Im still praying for the best but expecting the worst. I have not been diagnosed yet..... Remember I was diagnosed with adh 1 year ago this does not pertain to everyone here. NEEDING HUGS AND PRAYERS",

So hear it goes I went to my onc Tuesday and i showed her my swollen lymph node, thankfully as soon as I found out I had adh I found uf breast cancer closest to me. Its an hour and a half away but its worth the drive. Ok so my onc sent me to radiology for an US instead of one swollen lymph node i had several. Right away i was having a lymph node biopsy. when I asked why, they mentioned lymphoma. I was numb. I have a good relationship with my onc and radiologist. So i spoke with my radiologist early in the am the next day. He promised he would keep an eye out for my results and that he did. At about 3:00 pm he called me and said NO CANCER!!!!!! and that he would not let me spend the holidays worried. My onc called at 6:00 pm way after she left her office to inform me too. I feel so lucky to have such great drs looking over me. I cant imagine days, weeks without any news. I am so Thankful. Thanks to everyone that gave me incouraging answers mellissadallas, lovinggrouches,ddw79,alicki, djabi and everyone else. I hope my results can ease someone elses worries. Lots of love and hugs ",

She said to think about tomaxifen but on the Gail scale I was at a 1.5% higher risk. She said usually she would recommend it more for 1.66% or higher but she did say if it were her she would take it. She put me on a 6 month mri and then diagnostic mammogram. Then I met the genetics doc he said I would probably be neg for brca1 &2 then he said with my family history my % went up to 34% of lifetime 10% for 10 years 2% for 5 years. So I met with his nurse practioner she also recommended tomaxifen or removal of ovaries and no tomaxifen. Now I don't really know what to do. She said ovary removal would reduce my % even lower, but still higher then the average women. So I'm in the med risk. I'm even considering mastectomy. Then I think I'm over reacting. Should I listen to my onc or the genetisics. My Dr. Was very optimistic thought mastectomy was a bit much. But he would do what I wanted. Confused. Can someone please help... Has anyone had a similar situation. For the women that chose mastectomy how do they look and feel? How is the recovery. Wow this is truly shocking...",

The genetics nurse practitioner said it was an option since I probably go through menopause between 50-51 no one I know has gone through menopause so early.

I still have some ptsd from all of this. My oncologist did the Gail score model and I scored lower than 1.6 so tomoxifen was an option but my benefits did not out weigh my risks. I hope I said that right. So I opted not to take it. I struggled with the decision. I am 51 years old and probably going into menopause soon. Then maybe I'll consider taking Evista. I go every 6 months and I won't lie, about a month before my appt My nerves and anxiety start. I go now in Sept and it's like I wonder is this going to be it. You are much younger and every case is different I would ask the oncologist do your benefits out weigh your risk if you take tomoxifen. The decision is hard but you have to come to terms with whatever you decide. I'm OK with not taking it. You have gotten great advice from mystic88 and wonderwoman ask lots of questions and yes ask for anxiety meds if needed they do help. Sending you hugs and prayer.

I know I'm over reacting and I only have my husband to discuss all this with. I don't want to worry anyone with my problems. So to them its benign which it is ( but). My husband was sitting with me waiting for paper work and 2 ladies walked in with scarfs on their head and I saw tears rolling down his cheek. I think I'm going to put this behind me till 3/23/2016, when I go for my first 6 Months. I might start tomaxifen but until my husband agrees which now he thinks I should wait and my onc thinks I'll benefit but not with the job, I'm going to pray for God to guide me in this life changing event. Boy I really wish I could have some wine today. My life stopped since I receive the adh news I have to get myself going again.. on a good note I will be a grandma 10/27/15. So God is still blessing me. To mvspaulding I haven't stopped praying for you hopefully you are coping better than me and everything is going well for you.

Yeah you reduce your chances of breast cancer in return for your quality of life and maybe even getting another type of cancer. The way I see it it's like making a deal with the devil.

I also have not started tomaxifen( I'm 50 ) I deffinatley understand your anxiety, Mine usually starts up a month before my appt, but It's always in the back of my mind . A second opinion is a good idea. Maybe you can get checked every 6 month. My check ups are every 6 months mammogram, next ultrasound next mri. This way if something comes up it will be cought early. As far as taking tomaxifen you can always stop taking it if the side affects are to much for you.",

My test were all done on the same day to by the time i got to the core needle part I broke down and cried. I had been there so many hours, mammograms, ultrasound s and then biopsy. They put a rush on it and I got my results the next day. Maybe they can do the same for you.  ",

The stress and anxiety come and go, but its always in the back of my mind. It gets bad about a month before my appt. This time im double stressed because my ins was cancelled and im having to apeal there decision because they made a mistake. Now im praying harder than ever that everything turns out good. I'm getting an ultrasound this time. I have to pay for it myself so if i need further test i will be in trouble because i dont have that kind of money. so my anxiety today is strong just got letter from the ins yesterday. I couldn't sleep and i stayed up crying. They alternate every 6 months mammo, then ultrasound and then mri. I was prescribed the tomaxifen but my gail score was low so it was up to me. i have the bottle but i just haven't taken any. I will also be praying for you. GOOD LUCK Hi momo You give me hope since you have been clear all these years. My radiologist said a lot of women with adh will not get cancer. I guess its in the genes only God knows. I wasnt stressing so bad this time until I got the letter from my ins. Now im a nervous wreck. God help me.  Good Luck everyone...   .",
