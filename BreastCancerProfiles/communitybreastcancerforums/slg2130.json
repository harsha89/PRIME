Regarding stuffing - go to the fabric store.  I found some forms that are used when sewing swimsuits, lingerie, etc.  I just bought a package of those and pin them inside my bra.  I DO use two-sided tape so they won't shift around (even thought they're pinned).  Seems to work okay for the duration.  I AM, however, making an appointment for an expansion immediately following the last radiation!

As far as everything else, I was told Tom's of Maine for deodorant.  My RO said that there's no problem with supplements of any kind.  His attitude is that for every study that shows something is an issue, there's another study that shows it's not.  Since there's nothing conclusive, he's not too worried.

At any rate, radiation sucks, but it's been very do-able for me and WAY easier than chemo ever was! Sandy",
