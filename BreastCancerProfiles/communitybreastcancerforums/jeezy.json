I hope this helps. ",

Your case is a little differnt to mine...I have IDC.  What drugs are you taking and how often? thisisme I'm so sorry about your hair.  I'm not sure how long it will take for it to fall out.   The first time I had chemo 12 years ago, I shaved my head when mine started coming out in clumps (14 days after treatment 1) .  I started wearing my wig at that point.  It is a personal choice how you handle it, but just know it will be ok and it will grow back when all this is over.  I had my first treatment last week and today is day 9 so I have about 5-7 days before mine starts falling out again.  It's one of the most humbling parts of chemo, but remember it's short term and it will grow back.  Last time I was hoping for red curls, but mine came back exactly the same as before so I figured the good Lord knew I couldn't handle a style change...Good luck with your hair and your treatment.",

I'm continuing to pray for all of you and for those of you that have finished God Bless and I wish you all great health.  For the rest of us...hang on we are getting close.",

Stephanie, Contratulationsand thanks for the words of encouragement. I can't wait for July 30th whch is my last treatment day.  I will celebrate! Jeezy ",

Other than all that and since I've  for two days, I actually feel better this afternoon so maybe I'm over the worst...I sure hope so.  God says to be brave and strong and I'm trying really hard.  Hope all you girls have a great and painless evening.  Jeezy",
