I breast fed for four years! Studies show that even just 6 months of nursing can reduce risk by 4% is what I remember. I had no risk factors. Didn't drink, smoke, no family history. I struggled immensely with this as at my age and risk factors I had less than 1% chance! I couldn't get over it for a long while and why was I dealing with this and having to worry about seeing my 5 and 8 year old grow up?! It was exhausting and I finally had to get over the why. There is no reason. It was nothing I did or didn't do. I still have a pity party sometimes but not as long or as often as I used to. I am hoping every year gets better. And I hope the same for you if indeed the biopsy shows BC. I'm sorry your children are not supportive and I hope that will change. Best wishes.",

You should see a color progression from reddish like cranberry juice, to apple juice, then straw/lemonade color. That's a what they told me to look for and that's exactly what happened. Everyone is different on output but definitely if there's odor you should get checked. Congrats on the low risk. Rest easy with that info",

      "Content": "Oct 19, 2018 03:09AM - edited Oct 19, 2018 03:09AM by Dmoore39 My final pathology also referred to the biopsy for hormone receptors too. I had the oncotype which confirmed the biopsy results. I know that so sometimes the oncotype may vary for some depending on percentage. So the ER may be lower (but still considered positive by IHC) but may Be negative according to oncotype. Not sure if mammaprint gives hormone receptors? Did you get ER percentage on your biopsy? And I'm sorry about the drains. They are really annoying. I had my drain on my prophylactic side for 3 weeks and 2 days. Drove me nuts and I was so sore and red. I just had to keep telling myself it's better than an infection.",

Well, I guess I would be stage 1 based on the new staging this year, so hopefully I'm not intruding too mich",

I have avaeiant if uncertain significance on my ATM gene and therefore had another mastectomy in January. My new oncologist is revommending ovarian removal since the tumor was highly ER+. My last mo didnt think that necessary and I specifically asked. I had a low oncotype but she still feels it will provide a few percentage points reduction. I will do whatever I have to do to see my kids grow up. I've gone through phases. At first I was completely in shock and almost couldn't cry. About a week after diagnosis during the multi-disciplinary meeting a counselor came in to speak with me and the first thing she said to me was \"You're not sick. You have a tumor and it will be removed.\" I don't know why but that sent me over the edge crying. And I've cried every day since. But I've also started feeling more angry too. My life isn't what I thought it was and will I ever forget about this crap. Or every day will I worry about seeing my kids grow up? It's a horrible feeling and from what I read on these boards gets better with time. All that to say all your emotions are valid and you're not alone. Best wishes.",
