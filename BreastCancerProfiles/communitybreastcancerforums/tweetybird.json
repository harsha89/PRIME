I'm so sick of the snow, and Long Island hasn't gotten as much as the DC area. I have family that lives in the Northern Virginia area, right by Dullus Airport, and they got 3 feet of snow on Saturday, and was expeciting another foot yesterday! I was going to head down there this weekend, but I think I'll be taking a snow check, since DC is still shut down. My right arm is a bit on the sore side today. I hope I didn't push myself too much yesterday with the shoveling. It's hard to tell if it's my fractured elbow acting up, or the lymphedema yelling at me to take it easy. Well, pichers and catchers report to spring training over the weekend, so spring is right around the corner!",

My town only has 2 ways in and out, one is going over a small draw bridge, and that was closed for construction, so that only left one way in and out, which was on the way to the hospital that I was being treated. The cops had a speed trap set up, and I was snaged doing 53 in a 40. I had to go to my glove compartment to get my insurance card, and the parking pass for the cancer center of the hospital happened to fall out. Not sure if that is what got me out of the ticket, but I call the parking passes, a get out of speeding free card. They have a new one each year, and my husband wants one for his car for \"just in case\" Nats, I'm a big time Mets fan. I think my Dad would disown me if I was a Yankee fan. He's still bleeding Dodger blue from when they left Brooklyn for Los Angeles. Thanks to your belovided Nats last season the Mets weren't in last place. I had a nice surprise yesterday, my husband did all of the shoveling! And he even cleaned my car off, so the only thing I had to do this morning was hop into the car and go! After the last storm around Christmas, I don't think he wanted to take a chance of me hurting my elbow again.",

Nat, glad I'm still on your good side! I'll have to look into the book for my Dad. Think it's kind of funny, the one World Series that they won, my Dad was just getting discharged from the Navy, and wasn't even in New York! At least he was around for the 2 Mets World Series wins. Hopefully not to many Mets are going to be on the DL this season, so maybe we will give the Nats a run for 4th place!",

I've been taking breaks as I've been going along, but Long Island hasn't gotten as much snow as you guys have. We're suppose to get hit with about a foot of snow tonight. I just hope it starts after I get home. I have a 4:00 appointment with my oncologist, and then a 6:00 physical therapy appointment for my right elbow that I fractured with the foot of snow that we got around Christmas. I guess I was lucky with that, since it was my right elbow, and that's my arm that is at risk. So far no swelling or problems, and it's been almost 7 weeks. If anybody has any other ideas, I would also like to hear about them. Good luck with this snow storm! Janet :)",

I'm totally bumbed out about that, and a nervous wreck about Wednesday. I'm just trying to put both of the situations in the back of my mind and enjoy the long holiday/Valentine's day weekend.",

I was referred to my ob/gyn who specializes in it. I also had alot to consider when I had mine. I was on constant monitoring with my fibroids, I had a mymomectomy in 1995, the one fibroid that they took out grew back with advengeious, in a short period of time. While I went for my 6 month ultrasound in Oct 2006 (I was also in the middle of rads at the time), they found that my right ovary was covered with chocolate cysts, and was tripple the size of the left side. My CA125 count was normal. I was also going back and forth on what to do, since I'm ER+/PR+, close to 40% with both, on tamoxifen, and my mother had a hysterectomy due to pre-cancerious cells. I decided to enjoy the holiday's, and had my hysterectomy in January, 2007. I deceided to leave the one ovary in there, to hopefully make medapause as easy as possible. Even with having one ovary left, my ER count is still a bit on the high side, so who knows when I'm going to be \"offically\" in medapause. I know how you feel Aileen, we've all been thru so much with BC, and then to have the hysterectomy issue thrown in so close to our other treatments, totally sucks! It was a tough decision at the time, but I'm glad that I went thru with it, due to my fibroid, I was doing some major hemoraging, and was extremly anemic, and at high risk for uterine cancer. It's great to go on vacation, and not having half of my suitcase being filled with various shapes and sizes of sanitary napkins and tampons. Good luck with your decision, I'll be thinking about you.",

I thought it looked horrible, but the Doctor, and Nurse said it looked ok to them, and I didn't use any sort of creams, except for \"Jeans Cream\". I just had to wear a gauze bandage, so my bra wouldn't rub up against it. Thought my right breast looks odd with the \"extra padding\", but my husband said he couldn't even notice anything was there. It took about 3 weeks for everything to be \"back to normal\". I just went to my breast surgeon last month, and she was amazed how great my radiated area looked. She said most people don't heal as good as I did. I lucked out with that!",

You might want to ask the surgeon when you see him/her, DCIS is non-invasive, so that would make your long term survival rate at 98%. Those odds sound good to me when my surgeon told me that! I have to agree with Southport that once you have a \"game plan\" it makes everything a little more manageable. My Dad has a very dear and close friend that he grew up with (he just turned 77 in November), who was diagnosed with Breast Cancer, at 36 years old, and they only gave her 6 months to a year, and she showed them, she just celebrated her 40th year with NED (No evedence of detection.).
