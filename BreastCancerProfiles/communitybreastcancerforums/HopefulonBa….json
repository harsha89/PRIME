It is a wonderful place to get reminded that things can and do work out for a lot of people. It helps to hear the encouragement throughout this site. I found myself googling every term or phrase my doctor has spoken over and over. But the truth is until I complete all the tests the answer I really want will not be found. It's frustrating and I'm not particularly patient so this is a stressful time. The ductogram I went for was complicated because when she would get the tube in and inject it from the syringe the dye came back out. After a few attempts she referred me for a MRI which was done this morning. I thought this will be a cakewalk but to tell you the truth, I wanted to push that panic button several times inside there. I don't know what is next. I sent my dr. a message through the VA hospital email system this afternoon that I had completed the test. I hope to get the results soon. I notice that several of you have direct information from reports from you Mammograms and Ultrasounds. I have never had one mailed to me or seen one. Is it common to ask for this information when you see the doctor. My doctor who has been coordinating my care is my General Doctor as they don't really have an OB/GYN per se in the VA system. I go to a separate clinic than the men. It is a Womans Health Clinic inside the VA hospital here in Houston. I have no idea what a Bairds is other than reading on here. I have been healthy mostly other than this issue with my left breast. It started just randomly having discharge 10 monthes ago, a mammogram showed some areas but the doctor said they were not issues and I have pain that they also say is not an issue. Then in October when I went back and told her I was still having discharge and pain she referred me back to get the mammogram. They found 4 \"somethings\" and I was referred to get an ultrasound, that radiologist referred me for the ductogram. When the ductogram failed that doctor requested my doctor order the MRI which is where I am today. Am I taking a chance by using my VA hospital for this problem, should I be looking into getting actual insurance and possibly pay out of pocket or am I just making to much of a deal about all this. I just get the sense that I'm not asking the right questions. I was prepared today after the MRI to ask several but the MRI technician said I need to ask my Dr. I know I'm rambling but this has seemed to go on and on......, last month I was waiting for a ductogram, then I was waiting for an MRI, today I'm waiting for results. I just want to know. Which brings me back to why this site is so awesome, everyone wants to know and everyone has something they can add about how they felt when they were waiting and you keep getting reminded to not worry about something before you have something to worry about and that even if it is gonna be a problem people make it through and are happy. So thanks and wish me luck....I just hate waiting. Love to all :)",

It's not really painful, more just uncomfortable. You'll do fine and I hope everything works out great for you. Today, I was given access to all of my medical records and I spent so much time pouring over them. I can tell you that my mammograms did not show any of the 4 masses that were found in my ultrasound. They were actually done the same day. I am still waiting on the MRI results so I don't anything about the results of that. I hope you know that this can all work out and we could all be worrying for nothing, the best thing to do is spend your time reading about b9 breast conditions because there are so many of those. It helped me settle down and relax. The only good thing about spending time researching \"breast cancer\" was I found this place.    ",

I don't know much about the whole process and was not really thinking this was gonna work out to needing more tests. At first I was pretty casual about it all. Not until I had mammogram with the doctor who was not able to complete the ductogram did I feel like I should be concerned. She was very nice and asked me to please get the MRI. I will talk to my doctor about getting any and all reports from the previous mammograms, the ultra sound and the MRI from today. I'm going through this site now just reading and trying to learn. I'm sure she just did not want to worry me but I have not seen her in person since the mammogram. She has been able to set the appointments up for me through the appointment system. I feel fortunate as my radiologist today works at MD Anderson in Houston and comes to the VA only 2 tues a month for this type MRI. Regarding the MRI, I had to count the \"beats\" of the sound to keep from going crazy. If anyone has had an MRI can you tell me that this test is the last test til you get some real news. I really want to just know where this is going, cuz I feel like I've stepped aboard the crazy train. Is everything they want to see completely visable without more tests? I know they could perform a biopsy but I mean as far as the mammogram, ultrasound, MRI type tests.",

I am finding some relief by only reading about benign breast issues as I still can not stop frantically googling information. There's a lot of hope for me in those articles I'm finding. There are several benign issues with my symptoms that I could live very well with having. I will fill blessed....fingers crossed!",

I was super nice, not pushy and haven't even phones anyone til late this afternoon. Tommorrow morning my dr. has a walk in clinic before 9am. So am planning on going there in the morning.

I also hope it heals up quick for you. :) My report was posted online on my health account last night. I just called my doctor and she called back and is scheduling a biopsy/duct removal. Hopefully I will have the appointment by noon. Today is a new day and at least we are both now waiting for new things to happen. Just really getting tired of  waiting....at least we're not alone and we both have some progress :)  ",

I will call them tomorrow and see if the report and records can all be uploaded for me to see. I just have this intense need to understand what is going on. I do want to be my own best advocate.
