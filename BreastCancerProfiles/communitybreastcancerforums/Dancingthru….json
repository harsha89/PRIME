Start my treatment Thursday and am very nervous about it. :) So glad I found this board... Such great information and support. I am going to go buy some of those items suggested today. I am a dance teacher and have been worried about the side effects. I love my job and students and am going to try my best to keep up with my schedule. Scheduled chemo Thursdays that way I can hopefully be back Mondays. One tip I saw on another board was to chew on ice while receiving the medications... It is supposed to help with mouth sores. Not sure if it works, but figured I'll give it a shot. Hope you all are doing and feeling great!",
