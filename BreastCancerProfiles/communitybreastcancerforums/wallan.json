No one called to see how I was, no one offered support. I was really upset about it for years after my dx because I always thought our family would pull together for each other. On my second BC dx this time, I didn't expect support and it was alot easier. My family and I are somewhat estranged now after the first time and I have made new friends who are there for me now. Sometimes I feel sorry for myself thinking about other people who have family support them, but on the other hand, I am now able to offer support to those who don't have it because I know what it is like and this give me peace. I have been told by oncology counsellors that some people cannot handle it well when a family member or close friend is dx with cancer and its because they fear losing the person. I guess this is supposed to give me some kind of compassion for them. But honestly, I don't feel compassion for them. I moved on. I do feel for you but you are stronger than you know and this too will pass. Hugs wallan",

I was pre-menopausal before this all began and my story is similar to yours. Was I post-menopausal or not 2 years out? Anyways, I had the ooph done on my oncologists recommendation... my gynecologist did not want to do it, but he did to make me happy. I was afraid of all the side effects too... Well, it has been about 18 months now since it was done. I am on aromasin now. I switched after the ooph from tamoxifen. I am great now. At first I had alot of hot flashes and joint pain. Tendinitis developed in my elbow! But it went away and I am doing great. In fact, I am happier. My mood doesn't go up and down.. no more bloating, no more swollen tender boobies, no more bitchiness... (unless something really ticks me offf... LOL). No more over-bleeding worrying about leaking problems. Nothing. My two biggest complaints? --- a very dry ....vagina... astroglide works wonders though AND.... a declining memory. But this is also related to maybe chemo brain and being a very busy person. Once you get over the initial hormone shock and things settle down... its great, in my opinion. I do take calcium and vitamin D and I make sure I exercise. That is another thing... weight gain, but I gained alot of weight during chemo and I haven't since the ooph... I think if I watched my diet and exercised more than 2x/week I would lose it. People say I look 10 years younger than I am too.... so it hasn't \"aged\" me yet... I say go for it if it will lower your risk of recurrance.... why not give yourself the best chance you can? HUGS Wendy A ",

I really thought I was toast and I think my oncologist did too. But 13 years later, I have not recurred. Believe me, it took me years to crawl out of the anxiety and depression and fear of every ache and pain being the end of me. I had all the guns thrown at me - mastectomy, chemo, radiation, hormone therapy, oophorectomy. I think I had PTSD because I walked around in terror that my life was about to end for many years. I was dx with stage 1 multifocal breast cancer on the other side this Jan 2017. It is not a recurrance of the old cancer, but a new cancer on the other side. In hindsight, I wonder if I should have had a prophlyactic mastectomy on the this side years ago. But it is what it is. Do I have a return of the anxiety now? Yes and no. I am in limbo waiting for the full pathology report and if I will need chemo. Before my recent mastectomy, I was told I would not need chemo or radiation. But now, after surgery, this has changed likely. The waiting is torture to know what treatment I will need. This gives me anxiety because I know what I am facing if I need the full gamut of treatment. On the other hand, I have learned how to manage the fear of recurrance so I feel \"experienced\" and I think with some anti anxiety drugs I am good to go. I have learned thru all this you do need to focus on living your life for YOU one day at time. I think of other people I have known who are told they have esophegeal cancer and die three months later, or lung cancer and die 6 weeks later. This past summer, my neighbor literally had a fatal heart attack right in front of me. So I realize now life is fragile and no one knows when their time is up. No one. It can happen anytime. So I feel sort of grateful that I have breast cancer and my prognosis is not as bad as dying in three months. I want to live until I am old and grey. But I don't want grippling anxiety to stop me from enjoying the time I do have. Easier said than done. But this time, if I do get that anxiety, I will get treatment so I can get on with it. Thats my plan anyways.  Hugs to you and know that with stage 1 BC, your prognosis is excellent. wallan",

I see the PS on Tuesday next week, so I will bring it up if not resolved. All in all, I really am healing! Light is seen at the end of the tunnel. wallan",

Apparently there are \"phantom' pains or something. Not to bothersome. xtina78: Welcome to this wonderful site. I am happy for you that you like your team in New Orleans. It helps the whole experience be more tolerable for sure. Good to hear your pathology is not too bad. And chatting with everyone here and their wonderful support is instrumental in recovery that is for sure. Today I slept alot. Its just over two weeks out from surgery. I am healing very nicely. i have some pain in my TE side because they filled it a few days ago, but its tolerable. Fatigue is still over the top so I do most things need doing in the morning when I have most energy. I need to remind myself its only been two weeks. It feels like a life time ago I must say. wallan",

I have the TE on my left side still which every 3 weeks I am getting fills of 30 cc only. I am not quite sure if a TE will be put in on my right side during the procedure. I have already had some fat grafting on the right side from my first surgery. Did any of you have a TE put in and fat grafting done at the same time on the same side? The surgery is supposed to be 2 1/2 hours long and its day surgery. I have not spoken with the surgeon yet as to exactly what she is doing. I speak to her the day before the surgery. She did tell me several weeks ago (my first followup after my initial surgery on March 8th) what the next surgery will entail, but now I can't remember exactly what she said. I just know fat grafting for the right side is involved. I am feeling much better these days in terms of fatigue. And, I have minimal pain now except for the odd stabbing pain on the right side which the PS nurse told me is normal and an excellent sign that the first fat grafting is \"taking\". I am nervous about this surgery because of the ordeal I went thru after the last surgery (ie the shaking/trembling due to anaesthetic). At the same time, I am really happy that my reconstruction is progressing on a faster schedule then originally planned because I don't need radiation. I am trying to think of this surgery as a \"happy surgery\". Raven: you had a TE on one side and a flat side for nearly a year? I am dealing now with this. A bump on left side where TE is being filled and completely flat on other side. What do I wear? PS told me not to wear any kind of bra. Its getting warmer outside so bulky sweaters and coats is not going to be an option. Right now, I wear tshirts or loose fitting tops and scarves to hide the obvious deformity in my chest. Its a bit of a concern considering I am mandated to return to work in June/July and I am in sales. sigh... wallan",

I am doing my stretching exercises and still feel pain. But its less, I must admit. I am not supposed to lift anything over 10 lbs still or do any pushing or pulling, and neither can I sleep on my side or on my stomach. I am a side sleeper, so this has been affecting sleep. I went in last week for my second fill on my TE expander, and nurse said my symptoms and pain are expected. She said the burning pain is \"normal\" and can get worse as you expand more. Ugh. I have seen my oncologist and radiologist now. I do not need any radiation because I had clean margins and a mastectomy. This is a relief because the plastic surgeon was concerned with dealing with capsular contraction around the TE or implant after radiation damage to the skin. So this is not a concern on my left side. As for chemo, I am waiting for the oncotype dx test to return. The oncologist thinks i will not need chemo either but she is checking to make sure. She says my 5 tumors were tiny and I am node negative and I am highly (100%) Er+ positive/ and 98% Pr+, her2- and grade 2 with a 1/3 mitotic index so my tumors were unlikely to have spread at all. So.... this means I just need further recovery from the surgery and then I can return to work. Insurance company will mandate I return to work if do not need chemo. I am a bit concerned about returning to work because I drive around alot and I lift heavy equipment alot. Will I be able to do this in a months time?   ",

It is very difficult to hide the disfiguration of my chest now. I am in sales professionally too, so this will be a challenge to rectify. I am going to need new clothes I think. Oh the joys of all this..... wallan",

It is difficult to \"stay positive\" all the time and it totally is understandable that you are worried. I find that venting about how I am truly feeling; my fears and anger or whatever really helps and these boards are the best place for that because the women and men here have been there and can relate.

She also gave me more fill for my TE on the left side. Next surgery for another fat grafting on right side is in June ish. No set date yet. I am also told fatigue is normal and to expect fatigue for about 8 weeks. Eight weeks... holy crap... Also, reconstruction timeline for me.... one year plus. Its because of my mastectomy from 13 years ago and then radiation. That side is harder to reconstruct she said. Time line is due to the fat grafting attempt as a way to put in a TE later without have the contraction around the implant. The left side has the TE in place already after this mastectomy because I won't need radiation this time on this side and it will be filled slowly so that by the time I have the TE in on the right side, they can fill to match. PS says its a bit of an experiment. I came home and have been sleeping. BS to find out pathology of my tumors is Thursday. Hugs to everyone. We are going thru this together.",

I stopped the oral antibiotics I was on since surgery (preventative) and I feel better two days ago and I feel better. One of the side effects of these is fatigue. I have no more drains now and the home care nurse came by yesterday and told me I can shower this morning. Yeah!! She also discharged me from her care so no nurses coming by now. That is a psychological thing having a nurse come by. To me, it means really sick I guess. When she discharged me, I felt much lighter and on the mend. I am sore a bit on the TE side, but nothing unbearable. I did have a \"fill\", my first one on Tuesday. The fat grafting side is essentially painless. However, they took the fat from my thighs and they still are stiff and sore, especially at the end of the day. Basically, my spirits are up and I feel like I am on the mend. Today, I see the BS for my pathology results. I am a bit nervous about it, but not too much. I have turned a corner emotionally and feel more like my old self. Yeah!!!! So for all you ladies facing surgery, there is light at the end of the tunnel. Welcome sjssparks!! These ladies are truly amazing and you will get lots of wonderful support here.

I figured I was done and whats the chance of it appearing on the other side? So the second time I had another mastectomy and full reconstruction. Last time I did not opt for reconstruction because I didn't want more surgery et al. This time, I am glad I did it.

They gave me grief from the moment I requested short term disability. My boss told me I can delegate any work I can't do to others so no need for me to take time off. However, this is unrealistic. We all work very independently (alone) in different cities. And, I still need to meet the objectives of the job whether someone helps me or not. If I don't meet the objectives, my job is in jeopardy. Its high pressure. So even though my boss says others will help, this is not the reality and he works out of the country alot so is not a \"supervisor\". Anyways, I do not have a description of my job duties. I have an employee-employer contract telling me the goals of the job, but not what is required in day to day duties. I don't think this is available from my employer actually - not formally. Sigh. I will tell the doctor my concerns and ask the surgeon, especially since i have more surgeries.

Of course, this was 13 years ago, and I had only had a screening mammogram and ultrasound which showed a cyst before surgery. No MRI back then or not even diagnostic mammogram.

I am black and blue from knees to neck. However, I do not have too much pain. Only when I walk around and then it seems to work its way out if I keep on my feet for a bit. I think recovery is going to be much easier this time. I do have a bit of shaking from the anaesthesia again, but its not that bad and is helped if I take pain meds. So that is good. I did have one scary moment though in the recovery room. I had chest pain and a racing heart so they tested me for a heart attack! Morphine doses were not relieving the chest pain either. I was not having a heart attack thank God. They released me once the heart slowed down and the chest pain went down a bit. They did tell me to come back to ER if the chest pain returned or anything like that. I went home and took an Ativan and fell asleep. I slept excellently all night. So my chest pain and racing heart is probably part of my out of control anxiety these days. I did feel some racing of the heart this morning when I had the shakes, but the pain meds calmed that down. I think I am just very sensitive to anaesthesia and stress and pain. wallan ",

NED still.. and counting.   Last time I posted I told you all about my unrelenting depression. Well, it is under control somewhat. Drugs really work. LOL.. I am starting an exercise regime too and I know this will really really help. Hopefully I will lose treatment induced weight gain!   As well, off topic, I have been hard-of-hearing since my teenage years. I am 47 now (almost). I wear hearing aids in both ears and have for 25 years. Anyways, last week, I had surgery on one ear to improve my hearing. It was risky and  there is a chance it won't work. Well, it worked!! I was at the surgeons office this morning and they tested my hearing in that ear and it is normal!! It is incredible to be able to hear. I didn't appreciate how deaf I really was. I mean, the sounds I hear now. I almost thought my hearing issue was more of an inconvenience than anything. Most of the time my hearing aids were broken so I didn't wear them much. But now, I notice what I was missing. Music is so sweet! I didn't know cars were so noisy when driving. I have turned the volume on the radio down from 22 to 7!! I can hear my dog bark. I know these sound trivial, but to me it is a miracle.  My 13 year old son says I hear better than he does now! Once I have been stably hearing for a few months, I can have the other ear done.

I have been feeling drained, nauseated and I have this sharp stabbing pain in my right side every now and then.   Anyways, I thought it was the aromasin I am on,  but tests were done to make sure. You know.   Anyways, my blood RBCs, WBCs, thyroid, inflammation, liver enzymes, kidney stuff -- all normal.    I haven't heard about the ultrasound yet, but I had it last week and I would have heard anything by now. So it is probably normal too.   My family doc checked with an oncologist and they both think my symptoms are not from aromasin. However, my results are normal. Is it possible for these tests not to show mets but there is mets? I mean, I have read that sharp, intermittent pains over my liver can be a symptom of mets. My family doc suggested I bring up my symptoms with my oncologist at my followup in October.  So I am wondering if I should go in earlier or should I just assume my tests are fine, so I am.

So, I went into the hospital Monday night and I was discharged today.   I saw a wonderful psychiatrist! He put me on 3 types of antidepressants.. Effexor, Cipralex, and Zyprexa. Can you believe it? I am starting to feel more energy. I do still feel teary and empty but I haven't felt any energy for years now. So I think within a few weeks I should not be depressed. The hospital stay was just what I needed to. It was so peaceful and no stress. None. It was quiet and serene. Just what I needed. I also had a head CT scan; as you all know, anything wrong could be the beasts return. Thank God my CT scan was normal. Thank-you for all your support. I am so glad I went to my doctor.

I remember all too well my oncologist telling me that she didn't think the chemo would work and that I would be stage 4 very soon, within 2 years. I would ask her why would she say that and she said I had all the bad indications and I was in denial. I was quite distraught. My radiation oncologist though told me I had very treatable, garden-variety BC and he felt it would be eradicated. That gave me relief. For this second primary, I did go to another medical oncologist because I did not want the doom and gloom of the first one. My journey this time has been positive and hopeful. I hope that you get solace out of this. wallan",

It turned out to be tendonitis in my elbow and a little bit of swelling in my arm. It was all from surgery and overuse of my arm or something. That was a few years ago. I don't have that pain anymore. It did improve. So its not necessarily recurrance. But it is important to get it checked out... Good luck to you Wendy A",

It has been over 4 years now since dx.  And as you all know, I  worry about recurrance. I know that stats are can be wrong and I know I am an individual and no-one really knows my chances. I just tell myself to take care of myself, enjoy life as much as possible and just to think that I am at a higher risk than the general population for cancer instead of fixating on the stats. It is true that some gals have less than 5% chance of recurrance and it comes back. And there are some gals with 80% chance recurrance and it never comes back. So we just don`t know! But I do understand how hard it is not to fixate on the stupid stats.... HUGS to you Wendy A",

When chemo ended and I was on tamoxifen, my periods came back with a vengence. I had several D &C's actually because they were so heavy. My uterus was like a large soggy bag I was told, so hysterectomy was recommended. And, MO was going to shut down my ovaries chemically anyways to give me aromatase inhibitors instead of tamoxifen, so I had my ovaries out too. Like you, I was terrified of what this would do to me. I am now 54 and have no issues after the hysterectomy/oophorectomy. I was delighted with my periods ending, which surprised me because I thought periods meant \"youth\" and \"health\". But no periods is really freedom, I must say. My PMS disappeared too! I also thought it would age me faster too. But just the other day, a GP who I had never seen before that I went to for something, thought I was 40 years old and premenopausal. So, thats not bad right? I look 14 years younger than I am! The surgery was open abdomen for me, so I have a scar along my bikini line which is barely visible. I was in hospital two nights after the surgery on morphine. After that, I took tylenol. I was very tired though. It took me a good 6 weeks to recover. If you want to PM me, please do. wallan",

I know many women who have not recurred after many many years. I can understand that it was a shock for your mom at her check up mammogram for them to find something. Of course it was.

Its a normal reaction because we hear in the media and from friends and all our life how big a deal cancer is. What helped me is remember the odds are with you. 14 years ago I had a large tumor (7 cm), two positive nodes with extracapsular extension, grade 3 (aggressive) and hormone positive. I really thought I was a goner. I had mastectomy, chemo and rads and hormone therapy. They told me I had a 30% chance of recurrance in 10 years. But that means 70% chance NO recurrance. So the odds were still with me. And they still are. I have heard that with diabetes and BC, it is a good idea to monitor your diet with low carbs, but you probably do that anyways. Good luck to you, my dear. This is a wonderful forum for support from those you get it. Keep coming back to it. wallan.",

I think Irish cream in my coffee would do the trick too.... LOL Yes, my oncologist should have seen me right away. But I do live in another city about an hour away so maybe that is why she suggested my family doctor. But I am cynical, and I think she is just too busy and put me off to another doctor.  The health care system here in Ontario is a litte backed up to say the least. My actual family doctor is on maternity leave and it is her \"substitute\" doctor who saw me. This doctor is only in for the day. In another words, a different doctor substitutes each day or week or whatever. So the results may not be actually looked at for a while. The doctor told me this herself. She told me to make another appointment to come back and see her specifically in a week. We can go over the results together. Nowadays, I have to be very proactive to get health care here. It is frustrating. I had a massage today, and the massage therapist told me my pain may come from a \"trigger point\" in my intercostal muscles. She thinks I may have somehow irritated the muscle and now it is inflamed and sore. Let's hope she is right. HUGS to you all Wendy A ",

After bc I too was unable to imagine working at the pace I did before. I went back too soon too. One year and 1/2 after dx... I went back. I would go to my office and sit and surf the web all day... day after day....  I couldn't cope. I felt exhausted and drained too. I thought going back would get me going again.... help me forget bc... be a \"true\" survivor and all that. What a joke!! But now, it has been over 4 years since dx and I am still back at work... and moving forward. I do not work at the same pace as before even though at times I feel really pressured to. Its just not worth it to me anymore. I can silently giggle now at others around me who think career and work is everything and that they must almost kill themselves to get ahead. What fools I think.... I used to be like them too... But I am glad I went back now... I mean, I am involved in life... I can say bc hasn't completely killed my spirit and it is now easier than it was. I feel back to normal mostly... I mean, I am not as exhausted or drained and I feel pretty healthy. so take it easy and be kind to yourself. You have been thru alot and I am sure your partner will understand. You can be inspiring and a leader to others.... Cheers Wendy A ",

The worst treatment really was the tamoxifen for me. I have no heart issues that I know of now. I was only 41 at time of first dx. I was dx though with a second breast cancer in Feb this year in other breast .Stage 1, no lymph nodes. Had another mastectomy and am on Arimidex. I do believe that the adriamycin really killed the first cancer. wallan",

I had stage 3 BC and had mastectomy, chemo, (AC/T) and 18 nodes removed, two were positive. I had radiation. This was followed by 2 years tamoxifen, hysterectomy, oophorectomy and then 3 years aromasin. Recently, in October I had half my thyroid removed because of huge nodules they were afraid may be malignant. They weren't thank God. Anyways, I am doing well despite it all. I have a great job I started about 8 months ago. This job does require some heavy lifting, and is stressful with long hours. Great pay and benefits though and I enjoy. For the last two weeks, I have worked long hours (14 hr days) and have pushed, pulled and carried heavy carts, equipment. A few nights ago, I noticed achyness in my upper back and under my arm on my mastectomy side (I never had reconstruction). I thought it was overwork. I took advil. It worked. However, last night, I noticed that the upper arm on that side (my right arm) looks larger than my other arm. If I held my arms up and looked, I could see bumps of swelling in the lower arm too. It is not very pronounced, and I could just be paranoid. The achiness has returned a bit, but is completely controlled with Advil or Tylenol. I have looked at the pictures on this Lymphedema topic and the swelling is not as bad as that. There doesn't seem to be any pitting. But, I do have the slight achiness, and it is puffy. Should I be concerned and see if things resolve or should I have it looked at? Sharing any experience with the onset of lymphedema will help.

The link is very informative and I have been quite ignorant of the complications and suffering association with lymphedema. I am going to take it way more serious now. I think some of my complacency has been fed a bit by doctors not seeming concerned. I get blood drawn, blood pressure taken etc and when I tell them I have had breast cancer and axillary dissection, it doesn't register and they seem unconcerned, so I think lymphedema must be low risk or something and even if swelling does happen, it can be controlled or managed. So I will get my arm checked and start to be more rigorous about prevention. Thank you so much again. wallan",
