I started TCH 2 weeks ago, and found this forum today.  I really appreciate all the information, and encouragement.  Unfortunately, I've had pretty bad SE during the last 10 days - predominantly body and bone aches and pain, with occasional nausea and diarrhea.  My WBC dropped to 900, and I became dehydrated.  After all this, I'm pretty anxious regarding my treatment next week.  Have any of you found something to ward off the aches and pain - it's like a super case of the flu.  Thanks in advance",
