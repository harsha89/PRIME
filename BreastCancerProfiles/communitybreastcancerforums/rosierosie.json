He said I would probably need radiation and tamoxifen or another pill I cant remember the name.a inhibitor? I was just wondering when you go to the med onc. do they tell you the grade, What determines the grade? My surgeon gave me the impression that he caught in time. Do you always need radiation? My pathology report from my stoerotatic bisopy said I had DCIS cribform pattern, low grade nuclear containg rare microcalcifictions. and estrogen receptor postive and progestrone postive both 1% I guess what I am trying to figure out is what to expect when I see both of these doctors this week I meant by the cost of the radiation is it one price for all the weeks? or is each visit billed seperate? thank you so much LIsaAlissa I know my grammar not good I dont understand any of these medical things.
