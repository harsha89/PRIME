I was sure that if I ever dared to express my dismay of her advocacy I would be shouted down! Anyone else notice how much the Hopkins Breast Center website is about Lillie - almost all of it - try finding anything useful on it - like support group information - doesn't exist. But there's loads of stuff about Lillie. All the \"Upcoming Events\" are about her. I know for a fact that my plastic surgeon has published loads of articles - is there one single link to any of them? NO! I stopped referring anyone to her \"Ask an Expert\" forum because it seems to mostly exist as a way to recruit patients to Hopkins. \"Come to Hopkins - here's the # ask for so-and-so.\" ICK! Also - anyone tempted to buy her books - DON'T BOTHER - THEY ARE A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME! There are many better guides to breast cancer out there. Even if you get free copies - don't waste your time reading them.",

If she spent half as much time advocating for patients as she does for herself personally, we might have some progress. Every conversation I've ever had with her is \"I did\u2026\" \"I am\u2026\" \"I\" \"I\" \"I.\" Nancy Davidson has left Hopkins and gone to Pittsburgh. The \"head\" of the Breast Center itself is Lillie herself (administrative director). The medical director is Tsangaris. He's a surgeon, and a tool. You won't get anywhere with him. He's in league with Lillie. Also very good at advertising himself, but little time for patients, or experiences that contradict his own well-entrenched bias. He claims to never had a patient come down with LE - like he even keeps track! The Kimmel Cancer Center has its own set of administrators. Not sure whose taken over from Nancy Davidson on the Oncology side. Might be Antonio Wolff.  Even this exchange among ourselves will not be taken seriously - just the ravings of \"hysterical\" women. You're quite right to question Hopkins' care. My own experience as a patient there was not great. No one did anything \"wrong.\" But, there is a machine mentality there - patients are widgets - get them through the assembly line as efficiently as possible. For all the talk of \"patient-centered care,\" it really isn't. It's about what's convenient. It's about what they think you need, not what you actually need. It's about a logarithm, a checklist.",
