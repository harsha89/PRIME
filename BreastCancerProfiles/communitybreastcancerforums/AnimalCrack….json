It is merely a genereal idea of how many women were both members of breastcancer.org AND stage iv at the time I originally posted this question. Please do not be upset if you don't fall into those parameters. After all, this isn't a list anyone really wants to be on. I'll continue to add names of any women who were members of breastcancer.org and who've received a stage iv diagnosis up to and including April of 2013. Just let me know if you'd like to be included.\" At any rate I think it would be a good list to update and maintain. What do others think?",

I have also had techs come back to take additional pics of other areas as well. they may need a different angle or depending on what facility I'm at for the scan they just follow different protocols. I always fret when I notice any variation in a procedure and then I ask questions. they are usually very nice and answer the best they can.

So sorry there was progression.  One thing I can say from my experience in changing treatments after progression - is that the next treatment can very well be more tolerable than Ibrance/Letrozole.  I know it may only be kicking the can down the road but if that road lasts another year or 2 before the next progression and you FEEL BETTER then that's nothing to sneeze at!  Even if you don't feel better but you get another year or 2 - that's nothing to sneeze at either.  But I prefer to hope for the former.  As you know I went on a clinical trial after Ibrance\\Letrozole failed (progression to my liver).  I am very pleased with the clinical trial protocol.  I feel so much better on it.  My hair stopped falling out and I'm no where near as tired as I was.  There are still side affects but for me they have been extremely tolerable.  Whatever your next treatment ends up being - it may give you a new lease on life, so to speak.  It's always a punch in the gut when we face progression but there are lots of options out there and the next treatment isn't necessarily harsher.  It won't be a cure at this point but it will keep us around until there is one (we all hope). For those of you who don't know - I am on a clinical trial for a new oral SERD that doesn't have a name yet.  It's just called LSZ102 and I take it with Kisqali (ribociclib).  LSZ102 is similar to Faslodex but it is oral - NO SHOTS.  I have a topic on it so check it out if you are interested. Back to Z - we're here for you!  Excited to hear what happens in Japan! ",

My first question to this thread is - have you all had liver biopsies and if so what kind?  I believe I will be having a percutaneous biopsy.  I will be sedated and then will have to lay quietly for 2 to 4 hours afterward.  I will try to get some answers today about what is planned but I thought I'd reach out to you guys to hear about your experiences.  I've been reading through this thread and see many familiar faces from other threads.  I'm not very good at addressing everyone individually and I'm always fearful of leaving someone out or worse mixing up people and their situations.  These threads are so fast moving.  But I do read daily and have you all in my thoughts.  Thanks for reading.

Do you live in Maine?  I'm in Massachusetts being treated at MGH in Boston. Here's the link to the trial   Clinical Trial Identifier: NCT01971515 And here is the link to the thread I started here on BCO for this trial. Clinical Trial - AKT Inhibitor (MSC2363318A) and Tamoxifen - I haven't updated this thread yet.  I just had a liver biopsy on Friday and an echocardiogram and eye exams on Wednesday.  Tomorrow I take my first dose and spend 10 hrs at the hospital having my blood tested at varying intervals.  Fun fun fun.

I am not TN but my experience with liver mets is that one appeared while I was on ibrance/letrozole but it was only 7mm which was deemed indeterminant and too small for biopsy. So yours is 7 times smaller than mine was initially. It is VERY tiny and may not even be a met. So don\u2019t be jumping off any cliffs. We watched mine for a few months and it eventually grew to 1.3 cm (which is still small) that was more conclusive and the biopsy confirmed metastasis. I changed treatment at that point (clinical trials) and have been stable since. I have a few small nodules in my lungs but they are stable and I\u2019ve had them before cancer. I was scared too when I went from bone only to liver mets. But it turned out not so bad. I\u2019m not in pain from it and treatment so far is keeping me stable. I\u2019m not sure how much being TN affects treatment for you but a 1 mm spot on your liver may turn out to be a nothing burger. Try not to think the worst. ((Hugs",

My understanding is that you can take Abemaciclib continuously without the week (or more) break like Palbo and Ribo as it does not cause neutropenia.  However there is higher incidence of diarrhea but that can be controlled with anti-diarrhea medications. Wishing you great success on this new drug and thank you for participating in the study. Cathy",
