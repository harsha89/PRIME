Since my drain has come out I am experiencing a lot of swelling in my chest, armpit, shoulder and arm. I am not sure if this is lymphedema or seroma. In some places it is hard and in other places it is soft. Where it is hard It is very painful. I have rung my breast care nurse and I am waiting for her to ring me back. This all started on 24/04/2015. By the end of the day I am in a lot of pain, which my current pain relief is not reducing. The areas where the swelling is, is also warm to the touch, but there is no redness or other signs of infection. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
