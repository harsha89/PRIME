I started chemotherapy in February and have my last treatment next week!!! I was on the AC chemo for four cycles every two weeks, and then 12 weekly Taxol treatments. I did pretty much OK the whole time. My life went on as normal. The biggest thing I noticed is I was tired, but that's to be expected. Just taking a nap, even a half hour when I felt that way solved that problem. And if I couldn't get a nap, I just went to bed earlier. I never got any mouth sores, rinsed with Biotene mouthwash constantly, and also used to their toothpaste. Also, I know this is TMI, but just eat a high fiber diet for constipation esp if you have to go through the AC portion. I ate the fiber one bars, the fiber cereal, and drank lots of water. I also drink hot water with apple cider vinegar and lemon every morning when I wake up to help filter my kidneys. I know everyone is individual, but my best advice is to take the meds they give you like clockwork, and come home from chemo and go straight to bed for that day if you can. I was diagnosed at 34 years old, just had a birthday last week so I'm now 35, plus I have a six-year-old and a three-year-old. I was terrified for them to see me hair free, as I've always had longer curly hair, but I'm here to tell you, everything involving this whole process was not as bad as I thought. Of course, I've had better days, but just keeping a positive mental attitude and doing what the doctor says will get you through and you will soon look back on this experience. Believe it or not, I didn't even have to wear a wig to chemo today, as I've gotten a pretty decent amount of hair back, and I have not even finished chemo yet! Of course, you will not be the same person you were when you started. I am so much better now at just living every day life. I am praying for each and every one of you, and just know we all understand what you're going through. You are not alone, and you are a true, true warrior! Just wanted to motivate you ladies and tell you, you will get through all of this! i'm not saying some moments won't be tough, but you will get through and at timesyou'll surprise yourself at how strong you are. I know I have! Bless each and everyone of you.",

As far as hair loss during Taxol, my doctor told me she could almost guarantee I would lose all of my hair on the AC chemo, but that I might see hair return during Taxol and that is exactly what happened. I started noticing peach fuzz on my head a little over a month in, and now as I'm finishing, my head is fully covered with hair. Of course, it is thinner and very short, but it's hair and I'll take it!",
