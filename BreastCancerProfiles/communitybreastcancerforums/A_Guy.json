      "Content": "A_Guy wrote: Almost two years ago my girlfriend's breast cancer spread to a lymph node in her neck (large tumor), a small one in her chest, and a small one in her abdomen. None of the drugs did much for long, but a PET scan a month ago showed the abdominal tumors to have shrunk by 50%. She was on Ibrance until a few weeks ago, but she developed a distended stomach, nausea, and couldn't eat much. They dropped all chemo, and wound up removing the fluid twice. She feels better but can still barely eat. Very bad. Both cancer markers are down by 25%. Now they started with eribulin. She also has just completed 2 months of Avemar, and we're staying with it. They ran labs on the periotoneal fluid, and today we learned that they found cancer cells there. Devastating news. Her doctor is out today, which is frustrating. I am waiting to hear what the nurse says, as well asd her naturopath. We don't know what this means. Could it be normal? Could they be dead cancer cells? Could it mean that the last chemo didn't work but that the current one (only one treatment so far) could help? We don't know anything. It doesn't make sense that there would be new cancer with the markers being down. On top of all this, my father's wife died today of a rare form of ovarian cancer. This sucks. Any thoughts? Thanks.
