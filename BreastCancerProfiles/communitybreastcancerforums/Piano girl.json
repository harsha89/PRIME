Fastforward to Thanksgiving of this year: I felt a lump (same area), was told it was a cyst - but I insisted it be checked out. They sent me in for a 3D mammogram, then did ultrasound where they saw a suspicious area BEHIND the cyst.  Another biopsy: this time they found the cyst contained ADH cells, and the suspicious area was IDC .7cm.  I chose to do BMX 12/3 and before the surgery, I had an MRI with contrast on both sides.  NOTHING MORE WAS FOUND... After BMX, my final path report reported not one tumor of IDC (.7), but three!  All were clustered near first tumor but separate (the others were .8 and .7cm).  They also found .5cm of DCIS in other breast. I am thankful I chose to be aggressive.  Last week, I was at my local hospital and found a flyer talking about a new law passed in my state (Oregon) effective 1/1/14 -SB420. It states women must be told after a mammogram if they have \"extremely dense breast tissue\" as these women have DOUBLE the risk of breast cancer (similar to the risk of having a family history (mother, sister or daughter with cancer in one breast, after menopause). Extremely dense tissue is more than 75% dense tissue (not fat). Heterogeneously dense breasts are 51-75% dense tissue and can make it harder to see small tumors which means a \"very slight added risk of breast cancer.\"  I don't want to scare people, but hopefully this information will help others in the process of making healthcare choices and in discussions with their surgeons etc...",
