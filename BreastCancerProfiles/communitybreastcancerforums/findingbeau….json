I have moderate arm lymphoedema that appeared after axilla surgery late last year, and I am very concerned about it because the pressure readings keep going up, every visit to the lymphoedema physio. So far, the only treatment I have been recommended is exercise (general and lymphoedema movements), compression sleeve during the day and self massage. To go to a professional for lymphoedema massage is too expensive. I have been doing all this, but was told to take off the compression sleeve at night. Am I missing some info here? And frankly, the amount of exercise needed to stay on top of this in any way at all is killing anything else I try to achieve in my life and my back has seized up from trying to do the self-massage every night... Is there a better way to manage the condition than what I have been doing? Some days amputation seems easier",
