Try to do some things to take your mind off the tests while you are waiting either to have them done or for the results. Worse case scenario--even if it does turn out to be BC (and keep in mind there's a better than 80% chance that it's not) most breast cancers take years to grow to the point where they are palpable. A few weeks won't make much of a difference. I had to wait 5 weeks for my surgery once I had a diagnosis, and I remember well the feeling. You just want this thing that doesn't belong in you and that you think might kill you---OUT OF YOUR BODY. Unfortunately, the whole diagnostic process takes some time. If you need to keep talking about it to keep your sanity--then do that, but try not to spend all your time dwelling on the negative possibilities. Instead do things like listen to your favorite music, exercise, take a relaxing bath, watch a favorite movie etc. Whatever relieves some of the tension and takes your mind off this for even a short time will help. Most of all, be optimistic! Remember that the odds are very much in your favor that this will turn out to be nothing serious.",
