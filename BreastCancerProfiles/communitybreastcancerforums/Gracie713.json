I actually started cleaning our bedroom yesterday--threw out all the pamphlets and books I have accumulated on cancer since April.  Here's the part I really want to share....in all this stuff, I came across the plastic bag that I had all the cards and letters that I had received when my Dad passed away.  (I know that I had put this bag in his blue suitcase-that is where I have all his papers & \"stuff\".)  But...also in this bag was the laminated copy of my Mom's obituary, from 27 years ago.  (I know that I had put it in the little metal box.)  I just kind of froze for a moment, then I heard the last words that she said to me in my head---\"Baby, you are going to be okay!\"  It was almost like she was right there with me, saying those words again and I felt like a huge cloud had been lifted.  I showed DH the bag and we both had a little cry, but it was happy tears, not tears of sadness.  So, my wonderful friends--I truly believe that we are all, GOING TO BE OKAY. I won't get started on the insurance thing--I could probably write a book.  I have had several people ask me why I chose to COBRA my insurance instead of applying for state medicaid--I would tell them, because I wanted to have some control over my care and I know how patients with medicaid are treated, especially by doctors.  They know that they aren't going to be paid the higher fees that they like.  This has been one of my pet peeves for 23 years--I am a firm believer that everyone should be treated with the same compassion and care, no matter how it is paid for.  (Okay, I got started, and now I will stop.) I have to go google \"chooks\". Hugs to all!",

Started the Tamoxifen today--we'll see how it goes.  When I picked up the prescription yesterday, I told my DH that now I am paying to have hot flashes!   Saw med onc yesterday to go over mammo & US.  She made me an appt to see the surgeon next week for biopsy of \"cyst\".  She didn't tell me how many cysts I have, just that they were \"multiple\".  She also said that with my family history of cancer, she will monitor everything VERY closely.   I'll get a lot more info from surgeon--always have.  So, I guess we will go from there.  Told DH that I might as well go ahead and have both breasts removed, because I really don't want to have to go back & forth having every lump & bump biopsied.  I know, drastic.....but I know that `with all the cysts, it will be more difficult to detect any cancer in the left breast and I am ready to move forward and get on with my life!  Just thinking, venting--no decisions.

My beautiful granddaughter-I can't stand the thought of her having to deal with this, in any way, shape or form.   I know that we have to keep Karli's life as normal as possible.  And that it is our job to stay calm and make sure she knows that she is safe now and she did nothing wrong. (I fear that the examinations that she will go through will be just as traumatic.)  I just want to hold my baby girls and protect them.  It was bad enough she spent most of the last year worrying about me--every phone conversation started with \"Nana, do you still have cancer?\"  All combined,is more than an 8 year old should have to deal with.  I know that I am rambling, but this is my safe place.  Please pray for Karli, she needs all the comfort and love we can give her.  Having a hard time tying through the tears right now.

My career story.....started out in retail--went to a junior college right out of high school and got my degree in merchandising.  Worked for a short time managing a clothing store, then found out was pregnant with first dd.  Took time off from work to take care of my mother and then after having dd, went back to work in a small retail store.  When dd was 6 months old, met dh and have been happily married for 27 years.  Was a stay at home Mom for awhile, and continued taking care of my Mom until her death in '82.   Moved out of state, had second dd.  DH was layed off from his job, so we moved to Southeast KY, where he grew up.  Started working in a nursing home as an aide, then went back to school and got my nursing degree.  Worked in nursing home for another year, then went to a doctor's office.  After a couple of years, decided I needed something more challenging, so I worked for a temporary staffing agency, going to various hospitals and gained a lot of experience, including management.  I then worked at a small hospital for 6 years, working ER and medical, did ambulance runs on occasion. I have also worked in ICU and post partum.  After that I returned to long term care and that is what I have been doing for the last 5 years--and I am back at the long term care facility where my nursing career began.  I an scheduled to go back to work on Aug. 7, but won't be doing direct resident care-I will be working in administration, learning the MDS and QI process, in other words, paperwork--which is okay because I always enjoy learning a new area of nursing.  This change is to keep my exposure to germs/bacteria at a minimum.  Rock--I still have my nursing cap and wore it during the early days--very proud of it because it took a lot of hard work to get it, but really glad that we no longer have to wear them! On the personal side, We have 3 children--yours, mine and ours and a total of 11 grandchildren (7-I'm counting the one due in 2 weeks, plus 4 step grands, who I love dearly)  We live a quiet, country life but will probably be moving closer to the \"city\" soon.  Thinking of all of you who have treatments this week.   ",

Recon--right now, I have no desire to even think about it.  Being flat chested doesn't bother me at all.  (I was flat for the majority of my life.) DH is not thrilled about me having any more surgery.  Every now & then I will wear my foobs, still using the camisole as it is comfortable, going to wait another month or so before I get fitted with mast. bras & prosthesis.  Has anyone else had 'phantom' b@@b pain/discomfort?  I swear I can still feel them every now and then.  Difficult to describe. Don't get to go back to work tomorrow after all--the district manager has to \"approve\" it and he has been on vacation.  So it is up to him if I get my job back or not.  Guess they haven't heard about the disability act.   If he decides not to let me go back to work, I will be contacting a lawyer and look for another job.  Hard part is that I was looking forward to going back and I really loved my job.   Trying to stay sane here at home.  I miss my peace and quiet.  Two more weeks and Karli will be here too.  She isn't as hyper as Kelli.  And it will give Kelli someone to play with.  We have had to eliminate sugar from her diet--if I could bottle up her energy and sell it, I'd be a rich woman!  DD is actually helping around the house--keeps the dishes and laundry done.  Ended up picking 24 gallons of strawberries.  Didn't bring that many home-I was just picking to be picking.  DH has been making strawberry jam.  It is so good.  I have cut up about 4 gallons so far.  Legs have been very sore the last 2 days, but it is a good sore.  Noelle--been using the muscle mist and it has helped.   Hope that everyone is having a great weekend!

And yes, this is the DD that likes to live on DH's computer-he has it password protected now!   Youngest DD isn't happy with oldest DD, just for the simple fact that they are all staying here and she thinks that it is too much on DH & I. She told me yesterday that she wished her sister would \"get over it and grow up\".  It is amazing, the difference in maturity, of my girls.  I also think that there is a little jealousy playing into it--youngest DD is used to having us to herself.  But she was the one here with me all through my treatments and is very protective of her Dad & me.  Doesn't like me being stressed out.  Robin-I am working days (instead of nights as they told me, but this makes me happy).  I work in a long term care facility and we have a 2 week schedule rotation.  One week we work 2 12 hr shifts, then the next 5 12 hr shifts, which ends up giving us 8 hr overtime each pay period.  There are 52 residents on my floor and I am the charge nurse.  Trying to get used to getting up at 4:30am again.  I am tired, but it is a good kind of tired. Brought home more strawberries yesterday--this is the end of them for the year.  We have made a lot of strawberry jam, and eaten a lot of strawberry shortcake!  Plus, we gave youngest DD several gallons for her crew--them eat them too fast to get any in the freezer.  The 4 year old wants to eat strawberries with strawberry jam on them!  I have made a couple of pies and need to make another one for my mother in law.   Roxi, Kerry & Jean---Glad to know that you are doing well.  Rest and take it easy! Karin-Hope that you had a great birthday.  (Yours is the same day as oldest DD) Rock-Happy Birthday to you!  Have a super day!!! Randie--I love you sista!!!!  And I love reading your posts--you are amazing! Eddie--I enjoyed the article and the global bra!!!  And Adam is awesome!  What a wonderful young man! We now have space invader #3, but I was so happy to see her!!!  Karli is here for the summer!   I just want to hold her and never let her go.   Better get dressed and ready for a day of fishing!!  Love you all--Big hugs all around!",

Taxotere is easier than the FEC, nausea wise.  But my mouth did get very sore and irritated, Magic Mouthwash has taken care of that.  The bone pain was horrible, between the Taxotere and Neualsta. Last week I had a difficult time getting my Onc to give me some stronger pain meds.  She told the nurse (it was lab day so I didn't see the Doc.) to tell me to take the Ibuprofen and Benadryl.  When the nurse came back and told me that, I just broke down and cried and told her (for the second time) that was what I had been takiing, it wasn't working and I would get something, if not from her, from my PCP, but I really didn't want to have to go that route.  I got my script for Vicodin.  (Hey it wasn't like I was asking for morphine!)  Anyway, when I went this week for my visit with my Onc, she gave me a big hug and told me that she was sorry I was having a time with the pain and if I needed more medicine to let her know.   (I had the \"rare\" but serious side effect of bone pain/muscle weakness when they tried me on Lipitor and Zetia-we tried 5 cholesterol meds before finding one I could take.) Feet are sensitive and fingertips are numb.  Fingernails are discolored. Went out last night with a few friends for dinner (first time since May), and it felt so good!  They gave me a small gift and I just about cried.  4 different really good smelling lotions!   You know the sad part is that it is more than what any of my siblings have done for me. (One sister does call and email, the other sister and my brother...who knows, I haven't heard from them since just after I was first diagnosed.)  That's okay, I have all of you. Enough for now.  Hope that you all have a great Friday!  ",

This makes the 3rd time I have tried to post-sometimes, I really don't like this laptop-hit the backspace button and I went back to my homepage--what's up with that? Not much happening here in my neck of the woods-my main rant is my oldest DD.  She filed for a divorce back in Oct, from her abusive husband (mostly verbal, but vicious).  Now, this girl is no angel and there are still times she can make you mad enough to want to slap her, but I am so tired of my granddaughter being bounced around here & there and from school to school.  I hadn't talked to her since Christmas and when she finally called me this weekend, I just told her...if you think that this is the right thing to do, then why did you feel that you had to hide it?  They have seperated several times in the past and she keeps going back to put up with the same crap.  When will they learn?????? Finally have my appetite back and I'm not sure that is a good thing, although I can taste most foods now.  Still can't taste salt though.   I have noticed more swelling in my hands & feet, maybe because I am doing more.  Went Friday to have my port flushed and my chemo nurse thought that my face looked a little \"puffy\".  Med. onc said to just keep an eye on it and let my rad onc know if it gets worse.   Better get this posted before it disappears too, time to jump into the shower and get ready for the daily rads trip!  A little kitten has found it's way to my front porch and now our little psycho dog won't go outside-talk about a wuss!

My story-went for my annual exam (at DD & DH's insistence-in fact, DD used her first pre-natal visit as a levering tool--I could go with her and see the ultrasound of the baby, IF I made an appt for my check up).  As soon as we walked in the office-she made sure I made the appt--what I didn't know at the time was that DH had felt a small lump, told  DD and they ganged up on me.  I had not felt anything and when I went on Jan. 30th for my exam, the doc didn't feel it either.  Anyway, he gave me the order for my mammogram and it was up to me to make the appt.  I kept putting it off and forgetting--work was super stressful at that time, big State investigation over a resident falling and corporate swarming all over the place.........But I finally got the mammo done on Mar.7.  I was scheduled to have thermal ablation on my uterus Mar. 25 (wedding anniversary), to stop my heavy, painful periods.  Then, on Mar. 11, I got the \"call\" from the nurse, telling me that I have a mass in my right breast and they were scheduling an ultrasound for the left one because of \"suspicious\"  areas.  All I could think of was \"why the left if it's the right that has the mass?\"  And-\"Am I still going to have the ablation surgery?\"  The nurse ended up having the doc call me back and explain further-no ablation surgery, this has to be taken care of first...the ultrasound was to check for some \"shadow\" areas, that he felt would be nothing.  (Turned out to be cysts)  What surgeon did I want to see???   DH came in the living room and asked me what the phone call was all about and I just broke down, told him that they had found a mass and I needed to see a surgeon.  Then, we broke down together.  I think we knew from that moment what we were facing.  DH only knew my Mother during the last year of her life-I think that he was more afraid at first than I was.  Had the biopsy on Apr. 1 and got the results on the 11th.  (Did I say that I really wanted to knock DH out when he finally told  me that he had felt the lump and that was why he & DD stayed on me so hard to get my mammo????  He didn't want to scare me-I still get livid when I think about it, sometimes.

I agree--WE are an amazing group of ladies and I am glad to have all of you in my life.  BIG GROUP HUG!!!!!!!

But the taste buds are back! Definately have a touch of chemo brain.  Taking Zantac for the acid reflux, which still bothers me, but thankfully the nausea is gone.  Next treatment is June 18.  Reading how everyone else is dealing with this really helps. Happy Birthday Rock---I'd like to go to NYC one day--I have a cousin who works at Macy's there! ",

The company that my cancer policy is through sent me a book--\"Chicken Soup for the Cancer Survivors Soul\"--haven't read any of it yet--Have enough emotions right now.   Hope that everyone has a great week--those of us up for treatment this week--hoping for very few SE's. ",

No problems with the Neulasta shot so far.  The Zofran and Phenergan doing a pretty good job at keeping the nausea under control.  Taking Zantac for the indigestion.  Don't have a great appetite, hoping that will pass.  Have any of you had any \"cravings\"?  For some strange reason, I want baked spaghetti--I have never made it, and it probably wouldn't be the best choice of food right now, but I want some.  Ordered my wig and waiting for it's arrival.   Figure my hair will start falling out around the 12th or so.  Had my head shaved last week, (not completely, but close), so I'm getting used to the scarf/hat look.   Hope that everyone is having a good weekend! ",

Yesterday, early evening, I had to start taking phenergan for the nausea, which is something that I haven't had to do before-it is usually on Fri. evening.  Felt really horrible.  But after a good night's sleep, I actually feel pretty good this morning.  I've took the emend this AM,  I really despise the \"yucky\" feeling,  Drinking water, water....wonder if it would go down better in a wine glass? Otter & Noelle- I am glad that you are here with us.  I won't be done with chemo until Dec., so I'll be for awhile.   Noelle, what all bath & body products to you make & sale?  We make handcrafted soap and a few other products,  Haven't done much lately.  Have to make a batch of eye cream since we just got an oder for 12 jars.  My house, especially the upstairs looks like a warehouse! To everyone at the bar today--sending you good vibes for NO SE's.",

I have been reading everyone's posts and I think to myself, \"Yes, I know that feeling\" or \"Couldn't have said it better myself\".  I sit here and cry with you all and laugh with you all and then am thankful that I have you all.  There are times that I don't even want to answer the phone because I don't want to have to answer the question \"How are you feeling?\"  Truthfully, the people in my life, don't want to really know, at least not the true gory feelings.  I know that they mean well, but I would like for them to understand that there are a lot of days that I just don't want to talk about it.  Right now, I prefer to be a hermit.  WBC's are low, in spite of the Neulasta.  (Would hate to see what it would be like without it).  On antibiotics for what they think is cellulitis in my right elbow.  Waiting on BRCA results.  Wondering if food will ever taste the same--this is a biggie for me--I love food and now I don't enjoy it.   Chemo brain--it's almost hilarious.  I fixed DH some sandwiches to take to work the other day, then walked in the living room and told him that his sandwiches were on the kitchen table--he just started laughing, then I realized what I had said--we haven't had a kitchen table for 12 years!  (I actually left them on the stove).  We both had a good laugh. Enough self pity--but it does feel good to get it out.  On the bright side, new grandson will be born in a couple of weeks, looking forward to holding that special baby boy!  Love the poems!  You are all the greatest.  I will post a bald picture, hopefully soon.  I would have never thought that  I would let people see me without hair, but you know, I just don't care--I go to the store now bald bald-I draw a lot of strength from you all. Done rambling--hope that everyone has a great weekend! ",

I live in a small rural community in southeastern KY.  Good 'ol Nancy, KY--blink as you drive thru the  \"town\" and you will miss it.  I'm 5 miles from \"town\", surrounded by large fields and lots of cows!  This is a tourist area as we are on Lake Cumberland.  (I was transplanted here-born and raised in central Indiana) Sore throats must be nationwide.  DD had strep throat earlier in the week.  Scared that the baby would get it, instead he has thrush and they checked him for UTI.  Luckliy he didn't have one, but they gave him a shot of antibiotics anyway.  Both are doing well.   Hope that everyone has a great weekend!",

Noelle-so sorry to hear about your friend's son.  That's a tough one, and it breaks my heart that anyone has to go through it. Roxi--whoo hooo you are done!  Congratulations!  Anxiously awaiting pole dancing pics! FEC #5 completed (finally), so I am now to the half way point!  Got there at 9:10am, nurse flushed my port-good-couldn't get any blood return-not good.  Drew labs from hand. Counts good.  Start pre meds-good-still can;t get a blood return-not good-can't give the epirubicin without a blood return.  So, after numerous flushes (and a total of 2 hours later), decide I need to go to the hospital for floroscopy on port, can't so it for an hour & a half --nurse says, go eat-so I left, went and got something to eat and went shopping (looking for shows forclass reunion).  Go to hosp., there stands my DH (Did I tell you that he had to go to Atlanta last night? Sorry-chemo brain)  Wasn;'t expecting to see him.  He was freaked because I wasn;t at the onc office, he wanted me to know that he had gotten in early.   Test done-everything is in place-but there is a fibrin clot at the tip. Port usable, still no blood return.  Sent me back to onc, borrowed a med from the hosp and dessolved the clot, finally got treatment, left office at 4:45pm.  At one point they ahd been talking about-port may need to be removed & replaced--I don't think so----then onc said that may consider putting in a PICC line for last 2 FEC treatment  (this was before clot dissolved), I don;t think so--Was very thankful that they finally got blood return.   So, that has been my day------long.   Went with DD yesterday to take new baby to pediatric urologist yesterday.  Little fellow had to have another ultrasound of his kidneys (no one can seem to get a good shot).  He has a perfectly developed left kidney, but no right kidney.  Looks like it had tried at one time, but just couldn;t do it.  Left kidney is great and fully functional.  (We knew that this was a possibility when DD was 5 months pregnant, but at that time there were several possibilities)   A person can live a very long, healthy life with one kidney--I know this, but it breaks my heart because we can't fix it.  This little guy is my little angel, Nana is supposed to be able to fix it.  DD is trying to be strong, but I can tell it is bothering her, but at the same time, we now know.  She is one tough Mama and all will be fine soon.   Can you tell I got steroids today???????? Hope that all is well with all of you--my friends!",

Transfusion went well today-didn't think it was ever going to get through--got at the hospital at 12:30pm and left at 8pm.  I've administered blood a lot and knew how long it would take, but it really is different when you are on the patient side.  I don't like being the patient!

Had an interesting experience at treatment today--was very crowded, so they put me in one of the large exam rooms.  Then they brought back a lady and a man with long hair, pulled back in a pony tail.  They  took the lady to the treatment room as soon as a chair opened.  The man & I started talking, and low & behold, to make a long story short, I actually knew this man when I was growing up in Indiana, he lived a couple of houses behind us and his daughter was my best friend all through grade school & Jr. High.  (She moved to FL)  She moved back a few years later and we worked together in a retail store.  She is coming down to visit him this weekend, so I gave him my number so she could call me.  We had a good conversation, talking about the old neighborhood, brought back a lot of memories.   Rock--glad you get to go back to your DD!

Basketball game was great!  GS really got into it.  We had to climb way up to our seats, but hey, we were there.  Best part is that we WON and now I have the \"bragging rights\" over my big brother!  Got to meet eith UK's baseball team and talk to the coach, even mentioned you all and AlaskaDeb-He asked me if I'd come to their opening game with my head painted like a baseball since I had my head painted like a basketball!  (Unfortunately, he didn't offer free tickets)  GS got all the baseball players autographs!  Will post pics on FB as soon as I download them from the camera.  You were all there with me!  Randie-thinking of you and praying hard!  You are always with me!

Eddie-I am so glad that the liver is okay.   Rock--I didn't see the post that was deleted, but the post before really got to me.  There were 8 children in my Mom's family and all but one had some form of cancer.  The one Aunt who (as far as I know), has not had cancer is the only one still alive.  I have tried to contact her, but no response, but she does stay in touch with my sister.  Anyway, my first thought was that we have the same family!  Oh, and I hate tamoxifen too!  There are a lot of things that I would like to do, I just don't have the get up and go to do them.  I am irritable and moody at times, and that would probably be even worse if it weren't for the Xanax.  Mammograms-I had my baseline done at age 30, due to family history and my Mom being diagnosed at age 42.  They didn't give me much of a choice.  I didn't get one every year after that, but after 40, they were more frequent.  The routine mammo that detected my cancer was just that, routine--no lumps or anything.  Even after getting the results, the docs had a difficult time feeling it, but it was there.  I think that the decision of when to have a baseline should be a decision made between a woman and her doc, everyone is different.  Guidelines are ok, but they are just that, guidelines. Otter--I am thankful for your wisdom!  And your kind, caring compassion. For everyone who is having tests--I am thankful that all is turning out ok.  I go back to my onc in Jan.  Don't know what tests she will do as this is my new onc.   Thankfulness--I am thankful for each one of you.  You have been my strength and I couldn't have made it through everything without you.  I love you all so much and think of you everyday. I am thankful for my family, my husband, who is the greatest and my wonderful children. Most of all, I am thankful to be alive.  There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about how close I was to dying last April.  About how blessed I am because honestly, I should not have survived that blood clot.  I thank God above for watching over me. Now for a little vent--I have had probably the biggest challenge I have ever had in my nursing career.  I now have a patient who is dying of bc.  She is 47 years old, was diagnosed 3 years ago and has really had a rough time, especially with family.  She is so beautiful and so tiny, they are saying she only has a few weeks left.  This has opened a flood gate of emothions within me.  First, her age--my Mom died at 47 of bc, I was diagnosed at 47.  (I am beginning to despise that number).  The first day taking care of her was the hardest--thoughts like--that could be me--in a few years--but then it may not.  Then, thoughts like, why is she dying and I am surviving.  (Survivor's guilt is what the Hospice pastor calls it--I had a long talk with him on Friday)  And I think about Randie, every time I walk into the room.  My co-workers have been great--even offering to do her assessments for me so I don't have to deal with it all.  I told them thank you, but I have to handle it.  So, I decided to put my big girl panties on and deal with it all.  I will take care of her the best way I can and keep her as comfortable as possible and I will hold her hand when the end is near.  I refuse to shy away from her just because I might get a little uncomfortable.  (I did cry a lot when I got home from work on Fri)  I have chosen to make this a part of my healing process, accept that I am one of the lucky ones and be the best nurse I can possibly be.  But it still breaks my heart everytime I walk in that room.  I deal with death and the end of life process everyday, but this has to be the hardest I have ever dealt with.   Now, I am off to watch the baby while DD and her DH close on their first house!  Very exciting time for her!  We will be having Thanksgiving at her house, but it will be on Friday instead of Thurs, because I have to work. Love to all!",

Hoping that everyone is on the mend and feeling better today!  Robin-hope that you get to go home today.  Now a word about the fevers--this may be a sign of an infection setting up somewhere, so if the fever persists, get in touch with your doc.  Also, drinks a lot of fluids-staying hydrated if very important.  Okay,enough nursing. I had my 6 month follow up with my radiation oncologist yesterday.  Good to go for another 6 months with her, which, good, but I really don't see the need to see her that often.  No tests, just questions--I loved it when the nurse asked me when I had my last mammogram--but  then she was embarrased when I reminded her that I don't get mammograms anymore.  No boobs.  Anyway, rad onc is going to let med onc order any tests that need to be done and send her the results.  I go to her the 27th. Now, my issue (or question)--most of us are having check ups this time of year--afterward do any of you have like this \"wave\" of emotions?  It's like trying to come to grips with all of it all over again.  DH took me out to eat last night and all of a sudden I had a horrible hot flash (which I don't have often--I have them, just not really bad), then just started crying and couldn't finish my meal.  I am thankful that I have such a wonderful DH.  My brain just won't shut off.  I am sure this will all pass, I figure it could be a part of post traumatic stress syndrome and going back into the radiation center triggered it.  Hoping that going to med onc will be easier, because I didn't get my chemo there.  Thanks for listening. Waiting for DS to come home from China sometime this month.  He didn't get to come home at Christmas.  I am really hoping that he is moving back to the states.  Haven't heard from him in a while.   Hope that everyone has a great day!",

That's my story.  Now I am just waiting for the first treatment. ",

Reading about the \"one boob\" situations has been interesting.  I had bilateral, so I don't have to worry about being lopsided, but I do get bombarded, by friends, co-workers and even my onc. nurses, with questions about doing reconstruction.  I couldn't tell you how many times I have heard--\"You may change your mind someday\",  Sorry folks, not going to....I am perfectly content with me just as I am.  At work, they are used to it-one day I may have my foobs, one day I won't.  Before surgery, I was a D, but my foobs are a large C, not as heavy.  Mast. bra isn't too uncomfortable, but then, I could never find a comfortable bra before bc.  The thought of going through more surgery sends shivers down my spine, especially after the blood clot scare in April when I almost left this world.   Hope that everyone is having a wonderful Sunday!  Love you all.",

Space invaders are here part of the time.  DD doesn't like being here because we are pushing her to get a job, apartment, etc.  She would rather be with her trashy friends and not have to be responsible.  Took the girls from her last weekend and they stayed with our youngest DD--they had a blast and didn't want to come home.  Took several hours to get ahold of their mother and when she did finally come home, she wouldn't stay in the same room with us.  She may get surprised when she comes in next time and we have a drug test waiting for her.  Don't know what it is going to take to get her to get her life back together.  She had been doing so good, working, was a good Mom, and now that she is back here, she is hanging with all the \"old\" friends she ran with before she moved away, no desire to do anything.  I just keep praying.  The girls like helping me scrapbook--I show them the pictures of when they were babies and pics of when Papaw and me were little and share memories.  They pick put the paper for their pictures and what they want on them.  We have a lot of fun.   DD is still on time restrictions for the computer--her youngest told her, \"That's because you stay on the computer all day, so Papaw had to ground you\".   Okay, enough on the space invaders, just needed to rant a little. Randie-Thinking of you, hoping that you are feeling good today. Mary--Hope that the drains are slowing down.  I despised those things.   To everyone else--Love you lots and thinking of all of you today!",

I will start on Tamoxifen after rads.  Not looking forward to it, but am looking forward to living! Will end on a funny note.  3 year old GS--told a friend of DD's  \"Brother can't talk yet--he just has a little brain!\"   Oh, and he has started calling me \"New Nana\".  We are figuring it is because my hair has started to grow (a little) and now he can rub my head and feel the baby duck fuzz!
