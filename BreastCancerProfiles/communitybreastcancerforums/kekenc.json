So i went back after it didn't clear but had my Dr, he told me i had more chance winning the lottery than having breast cancer at my age of 23 but decided to check as i was there, he felt the lump and stated that it was a considerably large lump and was a cyst because of its size but said he had to send me for an ultrasound at a breast clinic and they would just drain it. I had my scan a couple of days ago and nothing showed on the ultrasound and i was told not to worry that believe it is likely to be my milk ducts swollen and hardened, i am not breast feeding and have looked it up and all say its sore. My lump isn't sore, as far as i know i haven't been referred for any more test. IM just worried as they haven't said the same thing my Dr didn't even seem to think that it was a possibility of being milk duct. And the ultrasound technician seems to be basing this on a hunch, should i push for more tests you? You hear all these stories of it not being taken seriously in younger women. ps sorry it was so long xx",
