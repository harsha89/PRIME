I love my red wine and with this latest study considered giving up alcohol completely...well that lasted about a day...then I realized I don't want to feel deprived of something I enjoy so I'm going to work on portion control.  No more than 1 glass a day (BTW 1 glass of wine is only 5oz!).  Just have to sip it slowly while I'm cooking dinner...or cook faster... :)",

      "Content": "Nov 4, 2011 09:34AM - edited Nov 4, 2011 09:35AM by SoulSista So I have a question on this topic and would love to hear from anyone who knows the answer... We hear about alcohol increasing breast cancer risk...does this risk apply to those of us who have had a BI-LAT MX and taking Tamoxifen?  Isn't our risk lower than someone who never had cancer since we have no more breast tissue and we are starving any lingering cancer cells of estrogen by taking Tamoxifen.  I'm confused about breast cancer risk VS recurrence risk. I enjoy a glass or 2 of red wine once or twice a week when I'm out with friends or cooking up a storm in the kitchen with the music on and I don't want to worry about recurrence.",

All - Here's where I'm still confused.  When we hear about these case studies that talk about breast cancer risk they are talking about women who are at risk for getting it the first time.  Do these studies apply to us since we are concerned about recurrence.  What's the difference between the first cancer and the second or third or new cancer vs old cancer that came back etc.  They are all created by cancer cell growth so isn't it all the same really?  Reducing the estrogen in your body is the goal if your hormone receptor + right?",
