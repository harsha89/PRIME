      "Content": "May 14, 2016 12:14AM - edited May 14, 2016 12:49AM by soareagle1962 Hello. This is my first post. My name is Sandra and I start my first chemo (AC) on Monday. I have IDC multi-centric tumors (5) with one tumor that is skin invasive and two against my chest wall, so chemo first to try to shrink the tumors then surgery, radiation, and then reconstruction. This is all in my left breast; my right breast shows no cancer. That is good news, right? I have been reading through the posts and want to thank all of you for sharing. It is helpful to those of us who receive support just by reading the threads on the discussion boards. I have hesitated to join in until now thinking reading on my own was enough. I try to keep my emotions in check and put on a brave face. It is difficult right now knowing I am starting chemo in only a couple of days and feeling alone even with so many people around me who care. My husband is amazing and very supportive. I have two daughters living in CA (32, 33) and 3 grandchildren (13, 5, & 2 months). I live in WA. How is everyone dealing with work? My boss is very supportive and wants me to work from home as much as I can but wants me to focus on my health. It is difficult because I feel checked out at work. My availability is up in the air since I do not know how my body will respond to chemo. I look forward to hearing from you. Sandra",
