The next day we stopped for Chinese at my favorite place and  a short trip to Lowes also. Got home and took a nap them made myself some scrambled eggs for dinner. Stayed up and watched a little TV then went to bed with an Ambien.   I have needed no pain pills so far. I am wearing a ON-Q pain ball til friday and i thimk that is why I am feeling so good. It hangs from my waist with a belt. It is about half the size of a bowling ball. It has 2 tiny tubes threaded up thru the incisions. I will pull them when I remove my dressings on Friday.She wrote a scip for Vicodin but I haven't needed 1 yet. The drains are annoying but I have a wardrobe of short sleeved hoodies-we cut a hole in the back of the pocket and fish the drains in from the back. That way they aren't swaying all over the place. I bought the wedge pillow from Bed Bath  and Beyond but I think I will return it. It was $29 plus an aditional $10 for an extra cover. I slept fine in my own bed with lots of extra pillows to prop me and my arms up.Not having re-con probably made my case lots easier. I will remove the dressing and bra on friday and I can shower on Saturday. YAY. The whole thing was so much easier than I had thought. The last thing I can remember is the surgeon putting the sign of the cross on my foehead and then kissing the same spot and then I was out!! BS called last night to say all margins were clear. She found extensive scar tissue on my my chest wall but it was just that-scar tissue. My tumor was attached there to start with. I will not see her until the drains are ready to come out.   The one thing I wish is that the rest of you up for this week have a good experience also. I plan on being up and active as possible today-probably with some power naps worked in.",

I am 3 weeks past when I was supposed to start the Rads.   I talked to the RO yesterday. I am worried about getting outside the optimum window for getting them. He said i am fine for now (sx was Aug 8) and hopefully we will get started soon. He said he can;t do a setup with my skin floating around (because of the fluid). BS also says the skin could even slough off if I tried Rads while still draining. She wants me to be at less than 10cc on each side. It is making me nuts!!

It has never been uncomfortable even when there was as much as 100cc. With no recon it is very easy to see when the fluid starts gathering.   Now the draining part is not much fun.

The thing I am the most upset about is the BS told me she was off by 1/4 inch on the 2 incisions. When I looked yesterday the cancer breast (which had become lopsided) has a nice straight incision almost 10 inches long. The good breast is straight for about 4 inches then has a big hook all the way to the top of my armpit. The purple line she drew before surgery is still there and she is 5 inches away from it. Did she think I wouln't notice? I know there isn't anything that can be done about it now but I am pissed. A whole different set of nerves than if she had cut it straight. It is also chafing like crazy. It is all the way at the top crease of the armpit. I had no nodes taken but may as well have for how messed up it is.

Half that on the left. I have been poked in the same little area 12times in a week and it is so sore and swollen. She keeps telling me-this whole arae should be numb.

My tracheal nodes lit up huge but they never had any intention of removing those... so I said no armpit thing.   My intial breast tumor was 9cm and attached and grown into the chest wall. she had mentioned she hoped not to remove any of the chest muscle-I told her don;t worry about it-I am telling you no right now. Breast tumor iwas gone at mid=term scan and Rads will kill any of the little buggers still there.   Great tip about the consent form. I willl have to remember to take reading glasses. My BS is off on medical leave because she had a hysterectomy 2 weeks ago. She is coming in to do my surgery even though she is off for 2 more weeks.

As many pictures as i looked at beforehand it in no way measured up to my own look in the mirror. And you probably are getting that much in your cancer side because of only 1 drain. I thought if they took nodes that had 1 for nodes and 1 for the breast. I am thinking  may have fudged a little too much and had mine pulled too early-hence the fluid build-up. I am glad those camisoles are working out for you. I did a little sewing beforehand and made some of my own-probably not as nice as the store bought ones.

She ordered a MRI and they found some things in the other breast that she was sure was B9 but they wanted to ultrasound and biopsy. And she said they would want to do this every time they found something for the rest of my life. That was all I had to hear-I am taking off both. It was MY decision. I am not doing recon. I still have lots of other stuff to come and just didn;t want all the extr dr visits and surgeries. Having breasts just wasn;t that important to me Jessie-I am having a BMX on Monday also with no recon. Glad to have someone on the same path as me. I see this is your first post. Welcome. This seems like it will be a great group. The ladies that have had their surgeries so far have posted some pretty positive comments.",

I will have a pinball that lasts the same 4 days. She said when it comes off so can the dressings.   Disappointed in my scan results-or at least the interpretation the guy who read it put on it. It is hardly coherent. Am thinking English is not his original language. My other 3 scans were all read by the same guy. Way easier to decipher. Hoping my onc sends it back for a re-read. I am not sure if I am better or not. he didn;t take any measurements. it was a lot of \"seems somewhat smaller\" or \"possibly smaller\". He also jumped all around to the different organs instead of making each organ a category.   I will post Tuesday when i get home. Not taking the laptop wiith me.",

I am going to ask again about the vaccine-even if it's only 50%-hey that's pretty good odds.",

The radiologist sees way more of these scans than the onc does so she is the expert. I guess it will depend also on what kind of relationship you have with your onc. You are entitled to a better explanation on why he is making the recommendations for changing your tx. The MRI might help clear things up. You have a difficult decision to make but I definitely think you should press for answers before changing things up.  My liver stuff has always been in a mass and always comes back in the same place-and lights up like crazy when it is there.

I put on make-up and earrings and pencil in some brows wehn I am going someplace nice but rarely bother the rest of the time. I guess I am not much of a girlie-girl anymore...",

I think it would look better if it was all the same. If I put the color on will it dye the scalp in the places where the hair is thin? You know how you have to wipe the dye off around the hairline to keep it from staining??/ I am just wondering if it will look funky if my scalp stains a different color than the hair?   Or should I just wait a while longer til it fills in more?",

Isn't that why you go carb and sugar free the day before a scan?). Got a vein on the first try, laid absolutely still for 20 minutes and gave vacation advice to the tech-glad I was outstanding for at least part of the day. It sure went downhill from there.   I was surprised to get a call from my onc in the early afternoon with my results. Never a good sign when they call you that quick is it?  All mets icreased in size and activity and a met found in the liver-which had been cancer free since last August. Stopping Xeloda/Tykerb and moving on to the new Her2 drug Perjeta. I searched and didn;t see anyone else posting about taking it. Bad part is it pairs with Taxotere so my darling short hair-do which took 16 months to bcome darling is going to fall out again. Also back on herceptin which failed me last January.  He wants me to stop working immediately but I am going to try it and see. Last year I took Taxol 5 times before it made me sick-but I wasn't working in a factory where it is 110 degrees almost daily now. If insurance approves I will get my first dose next Tuesday-I have not missed the chemo room-that's for sure. Not sure if it is 6 tx or how exactly it is done but I will find out soon.  So I am off to start a weekend binge of every kind of food I can think of before my tastebuds go. Starting with fresh corn on the cob, tomatoes, cucumbers and yellow cupcakes with chocolate frosting. I am not telling anyone else this weekend. Next week will be soon enough.

I could have said no to it-I did say no to any axillary nodes-but my doc and I are on the same page as far as being aggressive.  It did creep me out because all I could envision was a little stream of Pac-Man like things steadily marching forth and further invading my body. Like SuperFoob said any way to get rid of any of the cancer is always going to be my first choice.  And BCO has been the best thing I have ever participated in.

When I got my first dose 3 weeks ago I also found out I had brain mets the same day and I wasn't sure wether I laid on the couch for days because of the chemo or the shock of the brain tumors. I had Gamma Knife to treat 8 tumors last week.  I got terrible acid reflux especially when I laid down-over the counter stuff worked but at 3 times the normal dose. He has ordered me some Protonix (sp?) and it seems to be working. And taste buds were blown for about 10 days. So not too bad overall. I always say I want 3 treatments under my belt before I say what happens consistently.   I have been on weekly chemo for almost  2 years so just going every 3 weeks is so nice. I thought I was going to be one of the lucky 3 % that doesn't lose their hair but at Day 20 it fell out by the handfuls. This is the 4th time I have went bald and always before about day 15/16 it would start to hurt and then it would fall out the next day. I didn't have much but I had hoped to keep what I had for the winter.  So you and I can hang together and compare notes. I hope it treats you well. It was either that or Halaven and I decided to save it for spring. I just came off Navelbine and it not only didn't work at all it made me miserable all summer with body cramping for days on end.",

From looking at most of what you guys have listed I guess I am destined to be bald for the rest of my life!   He did bring up a trial that has a local site that does a molecular engineering study of your tumor and picks a drug based on the pathways. He says it isn't cancer specific. Like other cancers besides breast are in the study and the prescribed drug might not be in the usual breast cancer line-up. He is going to submit a sample and send me some more info. He did say that very few of what he submitted so far qualified for the pathways they are studying. I will pass this info on when I get it.   Glad to see that so many are living so long to go thru so many drugs. We are lucky to have so many choices-so many cancers have just a few.",

My last 2 scans have showed serious problems with the sigmoid colon that they say needed immediate follow up but my onc says they are just being alarmist.

I have had Big D for almost 2 years and the colon is so narrowed and thickened the gastro guy said he wouldn;t do it. he said the opportunity for it tearing was too great. He suspects like the others have said that diverticuli have become a problem.

I am sorry to say that it is pretty much true. I hope to wrap up by the end of the year and I started in late Feb.   As far as your oncology visit tomorrow-there are a couple of threads on here on what questions to ask. Don;t worry if you don't understand it all but take good notes-or have your friend take the notes-and ask for spellings-it makes the research easier.   I did my chemo first-and it made me nuts that they were leaving cancer in me-I wanted that sucker out right away-but I am so glad that's how it worked out. Most of the chemo regimes are pretty definite for whatever type of cancer you have. When I was dxed I didn;t even know there were different kinds of breast cancer! Anyway, since most chemo is specific for your cancer there aren't a lot of decisions to be made on that front. the surgery however involves making lots of decisions. There are so many kinds of reconstructions and you will want to learn about all of those before you decide. When you do the chemo first you have the time to do research and talk to people about all your options. They call chemo before surgery neo-adjuvant. It was advocated for me because my tumor was large and attached to the chest wall.   I have come a long way since February in both knowledge and prognosis. The fact that you have found this web sitemakes you way ahead of the game. Anyone on here will tell you they have learned more on here than they ever dlo at their docs office!    You will be fine-take deep breaths and realize this is a process-and there is always someone out here that will listen or help.",

Have not used any pain pills. I am wearing an ON=Qpain ball til Friday so it is taking care of it for me I guess. Had a power nap when I got hime and fixed eggs for my supper, watche TV th en slept in my own bed with an army of pillows. Was over before I knew it.Pretty much can move my arms anywhere-some spots hurt so I am being careful there. No-recon makes it much simpler I think. I won't see the BS again til the drains are ready to come out. I get to remove my dressing on Friday and the pain ball catheters nd I can shower on Saturday.   Was very disappointed with the Breast Center though. I have had no contact with any cancer society, group therapy thing ect. She came in with a list of  all these programs they have available-many of which would have been handy thru the past 6 months. She also brought a very expensive post-op bra. My band size is a 40 so when she pulled this thing out of the box it looked like they had stuffed it to a DD. I told her I was not having re-con and no way would I ever try to wear a bra stuffed with quilt batting that stuck out that far. When she removed the batting the bra cups were huge. No way to wear it without stuffing it hat full-otherwise it would just have a bunch of fabric hangin down. She said the cup size was appropriate for the band size. I was a solid B before with a 40\" band and it was always a struggle to find well fitting bras but this just felt like a slap. I made my decision not to reconstruct and it felt like they thought no one would consider going anywhere without a bra stuffed with something fake. turned me off the whole thing altogether. Couldn'twait for her to leave after that. That is the only paart tha has made me tear up. I will be looking for someone who can use a huge bra-I WILL NEVER waer the thing and it retails for $85. I guess the supposrt from the breast center focuses on the re-con girls. I guess I will go to WalMart and buy the 2 pack of Hanes button up the front. I am going to hit the breast free sitel later today for some suggestions. Meanwhile I have a 40DD beautiful bra if someone needs one.",

She is saying to put radiation on something that isn;t heeled underneath will only make it worse.    I worry because i have seen no one else post that they are being drained this long after surgery.

I have been told they will instruct me in how to empty and clean the drains before I leave the hospital. It's nice you had a visiting nurse to take you thru it. Have you started any range of movement or exercise things yet? Hate to be so nosy..   I am on the July mx thread also but this thread seems more useful. A lot of what they talk about on there has to do with the expanders and all of that stuff. The descriptions of what I will feel like from you guys is a way better reflection=I don;t have to sort out the surgery stuff vs the recon stuff.. Still seems hard to believe it doesn;t hurt more than what is said. I will have a pain ball that will last for 100hrs after surgery. It is more of a local anesthetic-or that's what I have been told.   My surg is still 2 weeks away but I have 7 appts over that time period. I finally feel like the last chemo is releasing itshold on my stomach. Actually ate toast-and kept it down this morning",

What to ask on your dr visit, how to read your test results, explanations of the different types of breast cancer, ect. You can pick up tons of info from them, just look thru the forum index and pick a topic and then it lists all the threads within it. Great idea to get all your reports and ask for CDs of any scans or tests. Never too early to start a binder.  Most people start with a surgeon. You might be able to Google the ones they suggested to see if you like what you read. What hospitals they work out of, patient reviews, what kind of practice they do-like cancerous breast only or other types of breast things. Don't be surprised if it takes a couple of weeks to get an appointment-belive me I was shocked when I found out the world didn't stop when I got BC. I was told by one receptionist-\"It's not like it's going to get way worse in 2 weeks!\" It wasn't as if she wasn't right but it WAS pretty insensitive. I also don't think your gyno sending you for an ultrasound qualifies them as the first opinion. The BS (breast surgeon) does their thing but you will also see an oncologist. I have seen 2 surgeons and 2 oncologists. I went to the first surgeon who would get me in to get a biopsy but I didn't like her from the get-go. I took my biospy reports and then went somewhere else. Seeing the surgeon is the way to start though. Mine then scheduled me for other tests before I saw the oncologist. In my case I am getting chemo frst and surgery later. My PCP gets copied on reports from both the surgeon and the Onc so I don't call her about anything. You will have enough visits to keep you busy without adding that. Or maybe you have a good relationship with yours and want them to hear it from you. I am never sick so she is really a stranger to me. A great book for overall knowledge of breast cancer is Susan Loves Breast Book. All the big bookstores sell it. BC has a whole language and she covers everything from anatomy to survival. When you get past the first rush of testing and office visits there are more great book referrals on here too. I was diagnosed on Feb 18 and here is the biggest piece of advice I can give you-TRY NOT TO PANIC. It seems so overwhelming in the beginning but every part of this crap is do-able if you break it down into little pieces. Crying is part of it-everyone has done it. And that is the beauty of this entire web site.There isn't one thing in your cancer experience that you will have to do by yourself-there is always someone on this site that can empathize or sympathize because they have already been there. I hoped this helped a little. Maybe a more experienced member will come along and steer you better. I wish you luck and will add you to my prayers tonight.",

She is adamant about not starting Rads until my skin has grown to the chest-at the rate I am going that could be next year!! I am going ahead with my CTsim next tuesday. She said if the skin is free floating I will be way more likely to damage it during the Rads. RO sayd he thinks it will be fine. I have been deferring to her but i am anxious to get started and moving towards being done. I also cannot get properly fitted with foobs til I get this done either. I have a class reunion the end of October. I would like to look somewhat normal. I don;t mind the flat chest in my everyday stuff but my drees clothes need a little something.    I really wonder if I was doing too much physical activity. She probably has no idea I was cutting grass byt Day 5, driving, walking the dog, ect. My drain amopunts were right around 30 when I had her pull them. I could not take 1 more day of it. The fluid was also pale tan. The stuff she is pulling out with the syringe looks more bloody to me. I am starting to get a little freaked but I DO trust her. I see my onc tomorrow and will quiz him about it.",

I had told the surgeon last week at our first meeting I knew for sure I didn't want reconstruction so do not leave any extra skin. As far as the \"good\" breast I was pretty sure I wanted it off but had to check with the insurance co to see if they will pay. They called this morning to Ok it. My surgery is at the end of July after I finish chemo.    I couldn't see any sense in having 1 saggy boob. If I am flat I can choose to be flat or I can wear prosthetics for special occasions. Kind of like how I do my wig.   Did some shopping over the weekend and found some darling Liz Claiborne stuff with shirring and the whole peasant look I think will work good also. Also found a perfect jersey little black dress. It was actually displayed on a flat chested mannequin. They has several of those displayed thruout the womens clothes. I do not have large breasts now so I wore a too small sports bra that flattened me totally so I could better gauge the look. Figure by the time i need some new clothes they will have the winter coats out.   Thanks for sharing your stories. Kind of confirms my own thinking process.",
