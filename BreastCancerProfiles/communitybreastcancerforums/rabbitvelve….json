As for the hair issue; I clipped my long hair and sent  it to hats with hair.  Then when my pixie cut started to come out in the shower, I had my head clipped.  The wig is neat but I've been too sick to care to bother with it.  Instead I have a lot of turbans, ski caps and scarves for going to the store.  So far I haven't felt too weird.  What I do think about is how survival rates have changed over the last 35 years.  As a young nurse I had a hospice patient in the1980's who didn't even make it to 5 years survival. We are so fortunate to have this terrible disease now when there is hope and a far better survival rate.    ",

I had my 2nd chemo today, the 5th and fervently hope I stay out of neutropenia hospital-land this time around. Thanks otceb and Tekwriter for your good suggestions and support Mor  I still have 'taste bud trauma' and expect it'll last as long as chemo does and then some.  However nothing was as bad as the burned mouth and inability to swallow that the screwed up immunity caused.  One thing that has helped me is room temp fluids and plain food.  Once I could swallow again, Jello tasted fantastic and canned peaches with cottage cheese was sublime.  I got so hungry that I said to h*** with my lactose intolerance and indulged (gently) and so far so good. Asb   I have been bald about a week and I also like how easy it is to get ready.  I had a halo wig made but so far I'm only interested in wearing turbans and scarves.  When I was really weak I wore my turban and mask to the grocery store and could've have cared less what any one thought....That's a liberating feeling. RHGSR   It's funny - every time I see my bald head in a mirror, I see my Dad's forehead and after I got over the weirdness of that, I think it's both sweet....and bittersweet.. I still miss him. Desimone  My Doc said that I would not necessarily get a repeat of my neutropenia ....he said the Neulasta shot should get my immunity to stop it's downward slide this time. belleB   In the hospital they gave me liquid lidocaine so that I could at least swallow water and broth.  I suppose spraying Chloroseptic in your throat would have a similar effect. Lastly I was given a get out of jail card.  I have been carrying a load of guilt for 'causing' my Neutropenia. because I didn't drink enough water.  I was not at fault according to my mo - my immunity went down the drain or off the cliff.     ",
