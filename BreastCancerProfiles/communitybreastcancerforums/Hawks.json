I just had my first treatment of TC followed by Neulasta shot on day 2. Felt the worst on day 5 but well enough to sit outside for an hour on day 6 and planned to go to work the next day. Rash broke out on chest, neck and face eve of day 6. Long story short, saw my Onc yesterday and she figured out it was sun poisoning as a side effect of the taxotere is hypersensitivity to sunlight. My rash was only where I had sun exposure. I have a message in to my dermatologist to see if sunscreen may help or what I need to do. I know this won't solve everyone's problem but it may relate to some of you. Hopefully protecting my skin from the sun will solve the rash issue. It has mostly gone away now after hydrocortisone cream and benedryl, Zyrtec and Pepcid AC. Will post more if anything changes!",
