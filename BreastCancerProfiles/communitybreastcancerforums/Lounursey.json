My Doc wants me to have another Mammo and Ultrasound, this time diagnostic, with the possiblity of having an MRI guided biopsy......My thoughts are what is the difference between a diagnostic Mammo and a regular one? How will it differentiate cyst/tumour/calcification when i have 76-100% dense breast tissue? I have a strong history of Ca breast....grandmother, mother, sister....I've always figured that getting this disease is more of a case of 'When' rather than 'if' with me. Am trying not to freak out. louise Log in to post a reply",
