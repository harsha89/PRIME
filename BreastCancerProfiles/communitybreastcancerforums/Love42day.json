I would really appreciate advice from anyone who has had breast hamartomas before. Brief history: I may have had a tumor in my labia that started growing when I was 8. I had exploritory surgery with indefinite results. It grew back bigger and faster, which led to a gyno-oncologist removing more tissue at age 11. Cancer not suspected.Â My thoughts...could this have been hormone/puburty induced? Current issue: 28 years of age. Family history of breast cancer. Started oral birth control January 2011, which made me nauseous. Stopped. Started different oral birth control November 2011 because getting married May 2012. Breast swelled by February. Painless lump formed by May in L.Breast. Breast nearly tripled in size by June with severe pain and new lump formed in R.Breast. Went to Gyno this week who suspected fluid cysts consistent with oral side effects. Hamartoma diagnosed instead. IUD recommended due to likely hormone sensitivity and possible correlation to problem. My questions: *Due to breast hamartoma being rare and unexpected by drs, should I insist on blood work and/or biopsy before 3 month follow up to be sure it is not cancer? I am concerned because I have had an atypical history of growths. *If I have it removed, do they usually grow back anyway? In addition, because mine is measured to be over 2 inches (very large by their standards), is reconstruction usually needed after removal? *Has anyone this sensitive to hormonal changes gone through pregnancy and how did that affect breast health and/or breast feeding? Does reconstruction alter ability to breast feed? Too many questions going through my mind... Log in to post a reply",

I have found in my case that these tumors definitely reactivate during hormonal changes (i.e. during puberty, start of birth control and now I'm 8 months pregnant!) My left breast is significantfly larger (grew a lot during 1st trimester) and I'm waiting and hoping I can breastfeed despite the tumors. Sounds like you were still able to nurse. My doc wanted me to do another US and possible biopsy, but I chose not to until after giving birth. At this time it's just not on my priority list and currently is not intolerably painful. During puberty I did have one removed, but it grew back over 3 years because I was still going through puberty. Therefore, I don't want to waste time, energy, surgery until I am nearing the end of hormonal changes. Interesting to hear it flares up again at menopause...makes sense though. Thanks for sharing. At least I won't be surprised down the road that it will likely grow again. Perhaps I can hold off a couple decades before having them removed hopefully once and for all. Best wishes to you for a successful surgery...may it be the one and only one you have to have! Keep me posted on your recovery :)",
