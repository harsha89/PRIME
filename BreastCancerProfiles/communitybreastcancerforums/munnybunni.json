      "Content": "Mar 24, 2012 02:23AM - edited Mar 24, 2012 02:25AM by munnybunni I went to chemo yestery 3/22 appt was at 12:30 suppose to be three hours.  NOT..... Between the little bit of paperwork and the nurses not being able to find my muga scan I had back in february it was a hoot. Nurse Karen put my IV in while Nurse Tracey was at lunch...they recommended to MO that I get a port...as my veins are for crap. Sooooo...when I go in 10 days to see MO she will give me a date to get the port put in.  After they put IV in they suck 2 vials of blood...one vial takes about 15 minutes to get results...the other vial takes over an hour...so you sit and wait and lay and wait (i had a private room to begin with) After the results come back they mix your potion and the red stuff (adriamyacin) and is in like two needle looking things and they put it in the IV...SLOWLY....takes 10 minutes for a total 61 CC's  to go in.  Then they give me Cytoxin as a drip for a half hour.  Unfortunately, I was there from 12:30 to 5:30 for the whole ordeal. Should be shorter next time. Everyone was nice and my friend Debbie told me about taking popsicles...so i did and left them there after I ate a couple during the infusion. Frankly, right now...I am kinda sorta tired...feel like I can hardly keep my eyes open...I am pretty sure it is from the Benadryl...as I takes chldrens benadryl..or used to.   I guess I will have to ask about that as I have glaucoma and benadryl is a no-no for my eyeballs...forgot to mention that when we all were talking.  got the sweats and pulled a nudie in bed....my eyewinkers were so heavy i hit the hay early  thanks for listening to me.",

I really do appreciate you telling me how it is doable....since I am pretty much a 67 year old wimp...I just need to buck up at this point..appreciate your prayers. I have read where others have A/C plus other rounds of chemo cocktails and am hoping the A/C is all I get if it does the deal.  I am a little leary of the Tamoxifen...after reading all the SE of it...seems like it all has SE's does your grandkids still live here in the area???",
