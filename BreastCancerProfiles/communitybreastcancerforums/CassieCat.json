When my arm pit was getting very dark red and angry looking, he switched to boosts (which I was also scheduled to receive). I had 23 of 28 regular treatments, ending on a Monday. That Tuesday through Friday, and the following Monday, I had boosts. After that, we went back to my last regular rads, which finished yesterday. Today and tomorrow I'll get my final two boosts. The week break of boosts-only gave the other skin a chance to settle down and heal, and I feel fine now. But I don't think that would have been the case had they kept going, and particularly if they'd kept going and done boluses on alternating days like they had been doing. Do I worry that there was a week off between rads? A little bit, yes. But I'm trusting my RO and truly believe he wants the very best for me.",

I can't remember if it positioned my head, but I don't think it did. I got three tattoos that day: one on my sternum and one on each of my sides, below my arm pits, next to/just outside of my breasts (or what's left of my left one). They scanned with and without deep breaths and placed some kind of opaque block on my sternum/upper stomach. I was definitely left exposed at times, but it's all a bit jumbled in my head. The scan was done next door to where I'll get my treatments, so I don't know much more about what will actually be happening, etc. Thanks for being here.",

I am doing what I can to prevent it as best I can through current treatments, diet, exercise and changes in my life to help with stress management.

And I know that I am, for now, but I have no denial that it's guaranteed forever, nor do I feel \"all better\" inside.

There was one tech, a female, who was both very professional and very nice. I had some questions that she answered, and I made one request that she honored. Whenever I didn't need to be exposed, she covered me back up. I have purple marker on me, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it might be, and she always talked to me before writing. There was music to listen to a some autumnal image on the ceiling to look at. It took about 50 minutes from the time I walked in to change clothes until I was back in my car. The dressing room has labeled cubbies so my gown always goes back there, and there are lockers with keys for purses. I think if I'd been wearing a wig I could have kept it on (but I don't wear a wig and just go with my uber short hair). I could have left my glasses on but realized if they slipped or got uncomfortable I wouldn't be able to move them, so I took them off. Kept my wedding ring on, which felt good. I was told I don't need to start treating the skin with anything, that as the techs see me day by day they and the RO will start getting my creams and ointments as needed. I'm still glad I have my calendula gel on hand already, just in case. I took an Ativan ahead of this appointment, and that helped. I've also been stretching on my MX side, trying to increase that range of motion as much as possible. Today felt a little more comfortable in that respect, at least. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step...let's keep taking those steps. xo  Cavalier - Congrats!!! I'm happy for you. :)",

I've had a few little kids that i know want to rub my head and have giggled at how soft my hair is right now. I teach high school and figure this is a chance to share a lesson to all of those impressionable young men and women. I have nothing to be ashamed of because my hair fell out. I'm still me, even when my hair's 1/4\" long. They seem to be taking it right in stride, and some are already coming up with hair styles for me to try as it gets to various lengths. Love those kids. :)",

I've been doing some reading on it and have a few things bookmarked. Had my genetic testing been positive, it would have been a BMX and likely ovary removal as well. At this point I'm leaning toward reconstruction as well, though if I need radiation (likely) then apparently reconstruction may have to wait.  Bummer. It's a personal decision, for sure.
