I spent one whole day in bed resting and was fine the day after that. Weakened immunity from the surgery I guess. Glad to hear you're doing better.",

I found wearing a maxi pad stuck inside my sports bra 24/7 has done the trick. I plan to continue to wear one until the drainage completely stops...hopefully soon!",

Since you're a week in...you still might. It's been 8 days steady so far and I'm getting a bit tired of it, but oh well. No sign of infection or anything else nasty. I will say the swelling and bruising went down a lot after the leak started. My breast actually looks pretty good 3 weeks in.  Were your lymph nodes clear?  I hope you continue to heal well!",

I was feeling pretty well in general...using my arm etc. My breast was very swollen and bruised but not horridly painful. Exactly 2 weeks after coming home, the edge of my breast incision \"sprung a leak\" and has been leaking since (a sort of dark scarlett liquid). I rushed to the surgeon's office...he proceeded to use a huge syringe to drain some of it from my poor breast! He assured me this is ok...that there is a sack that forms and fills after the tumor removal. Today is Friday and I am still leaking and using maxi pads stuck to the inside of my bra for absorption! I'm just curious...has anyone else had this happen? I'm also wondering why on earth I wasn't warned about it by my medical team?? Oh well... I will say that because of the draining, the swelling and bruising have gone down a lot! Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "bekkij1016 wrote: I completed 33 radiation treatments today. I purposely waited until I was done to post about my experience. I fully realize every person's situation is unique and different...but I wanted to share mine so people wouldn't look on this message board for guidance and be afraid, but instead be hopeful.  My official diagnosis is: IDC, right breast, 1.5 cm, no lymphovascular invasion, Er+ Pr+ HER2-, 50 years of age, still menstruating, lumpectomy, 33 radiation treatments (25+8 boosts), I refused the oncotype test. I didn't want a number hanging over my head for the rest of my life. Both my medical and radiation oncologists looked at my diagnosis and \"guessed\" the number would be a 10 or 11...that's good enough for me. I still haven't decided if I will take Tamoxifen or not. It is my personal belief not to use prescription drugs. I am praying about it and I know I will be led to make the right decision.  I can honestly say the radiation treatments were uneventful. I was there, start to finish, for @ 30 minutes each day. Immediately after each treatment I would apply 100% PURE aloe vera gel to the entire breast...then 2 more times daily. I didn't burn at all. In fact, if anything, my breast got tanned. The only thing I can say I've noticed is a mild itching or tingling once in a while due to the tissues healing. As for the fatigue I was warned about...I didn't experience that either. I kept waiting but it never happened. I have made sure I get a good night's sleep, eat well, drink adequate water and walk daily.  So that's my story. I just felt it was important to let people know how it was for me. Blessings to you all in your journey........Rebecca Log in to post a reply",
