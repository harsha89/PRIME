Just had an appointment with the plastic surgeon . I am still having problems after surgery. Some type of a problem that the doctor is not sure what it is. I was put on Benadryl 3x a day and one of claritin. to see if it will take care of the problem. The redness, itching and pressure is very uncomfortable. Has anyone every been through something similar?
