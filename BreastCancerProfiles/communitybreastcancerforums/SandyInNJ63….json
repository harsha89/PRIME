Being neither of them seemed concerned about it, I decided it must be ok to wait. It's already been 3 months, so I really only have to wait 3 more months. In the meantime, I did alot of research on complex cysts and it seems there's a very very slight chance that the solid areas of the cyst would be malignant. I'm not too worried, but I also haven't forgotten about it either. \"Probably\" isn't good enough for someone that has had cancer already. Thanks for the good thoughts.",
