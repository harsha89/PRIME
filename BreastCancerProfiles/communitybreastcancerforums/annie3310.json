I have my first chemo session scheduled for the day after tomorrow and I'm working on a case of nerves. I was diagnosed a month ago with triple negative breast cancer, and because of the TN status, they want to do chemo before surgery. I'll have dd A/C every two weeks x 4, then Taxol every two weeks x 4. I'm trying to keep an open mind about what my experience will be. It's clear from reading through the posts that every woman has her own unique constellation of side effects. It's also clear that everyone has some and that the process is a trial. I'm trying to think of it in terms of going to war (not that I know what that feels like!). I'm not going to be particularly comfortable for the next four months, but it's a battle that has to be fought. And won. I have a wonderful partner who's fully in this with me. I just hope I don't wear her down. I'll be sure to check in after my first treatment - with a report on how it went and some questions, I'm sure.",

Every source seems to say it's day 14 when it starts coming out in earnest. The wig place I'm going to is going to shave it and then fit the wig. I'm completely dreading this also, but this whole cancer process is a series of submitting to things we just don't have any choice in. It's humbling, but living is a pretty strong motivator.  I just forced myself out the door for a walk. It felt good, but I'm glad to be resting again. I don't feel too bad on day 3, just tired and \"off.\" Hard to explain to people. I feel lazy and that makes me feel guilty! Annie ",

I asked my surgeon if I could postpone my surgery from four weeks to six weeks post chemo. In early June I have a number of book related events scheduled that I'd really like to make. Having chemo when your book is published takes some if the fun out of the event, so I want to do what I can.

But I've checked in with my sponsor (who, luckily for me, is a psychologist specializing in patients with serious illnesses - a crazy coincidence in our relationship) and her view is that chemo is a hard road, that anxiety is to be expected, and that we need to be at our best to make it through the treatment and have it be as effective as possible. In other words, she said I should take it. I'm curious how others have benefited, if at all, from Ativan. Naturally, what I'm now doing is making Ativan another source of worry instead of a tool to help me cope with all of these worries! Annie",

She found that the tumor is roughly the same size as when she examined it two weeks ago. She said 'we're good,' while all I could hear in my head was \"It's not working, it's not working!!\" Because there is clinical evidence that it has gotten at least a bit smaller since before treatment began,the MO is not particularly concerned. But because my breast was quite swollen from procedures when initially measured, its hard to know really if it has gotten smaller. I'm kind of terrified. I just wanted to write that out here to try to give it some perspective. I still have four taxol treatments to go. I think as a triple negative patient I'm fixated on every sign that I'm responsive to chemo, and devastated when those signs don't seem to be there. As my MO said today, 'if there's no change in the size of the tumor, it's not good.' I also have to keep in mind that the facts won't all be in until an ultrasound is done after chemo ends and the surgery reveals what's really going on in there. Deep breaths now and trying to stay positive and unafraid. Annie",

But I've felt much more unwell than I expected to. I have no appetite and am losing weight, I feel short of breath when I climb the stairs, and the fatigue, while not as overwhelming as it was on days 3 and 4, is still making me want to lie down most of the time. I also feel more quesy than i ever did on AC, which I didnt think would be the case with Taxol. And,most annoyingly, my hands are itching like crazy, particularly the palms. My partner is off to get some calamine or cortisone cream or whatever our pharmacist recommends. Does anyone out there have recommendations? I'm really hoping that all this will clear up in the next day or so (now would be even better), so that I can have more good days between treatments than I experienced with AC.

Up to now the progress had been slow and not that encouraging, so we're doing the happy dance over this news. Then I went into treatment. Everything's motoring along fine, the acupuncturist is about to stick her first needle, when I suddenly felt like I'd been shot in the back. Then my whole back start spasming/cramping and it was outrageously painful. The acupuncturist ran to get the nurse, who quickly came in, disconnected the Taxol, and gave me some miracle drug that would stop the cramping \"in about five minutes,\" she said. It might as well have been five hours. I don't think I've ever had such pain. I lay there writhing on the bed while the nurse and the acupuncturist watched me with deep furrows in their brows. Finally it subsided and then went away completely. She said that if people are going to have reactions, it's either the spasming or the respiratory thing. I got the spasming. She also said it was a one off and wouldn't happen again. I had to take her word for it as she hooked me back up to that evil Taxol. Now I'm home, trying to think what food I want Linda to bring me for dinner. The spasms are forgotten. But I'm still very happy about the tumor shrinkage. Annie",

I'm also going to be in a clinical trial where I'll wear cold gloves and socks on one side to see if it helps with neuropathy.  As I read about our group moving into Taxol treatments, I'm really surprised by the number and severity of the side effects (hence the nervousness). I kept hearing from some of these boards as well as my oncologists office that it is so much easier than AC. I think the fact is that no one knows how anyone's going to react to any of these chemical cocktails. Taxol is a powerful one. After reading more about it I'm not surprised that some people's side effects are pretty severe.  So, I'll find out this week whether I get the bone and muscle pain, which is my immediate concern. I'm scheduled to do a reading in front of a bunch of people on Thursday night, the day after my treatment, and all sorts of disastourous scenarios are racing through my mind.  Being halfway through treatment is great, but the next two months look pretty long to me right now. I can only imagine how it seems to those who have had the severe SEs. Annie ",

What I'm left with is a decision, solely in my hands, between lumpectomy/radiation or masectomy. The BS says (and I have read elsewhere) that they are the same in term of survival rate. Masectomy is slightly better in terms of recurrence rate. I am completely torn about which way to go. The part of me that wants to do everything I can to prevent having to go through again what we've all been through over the last five months says to have the masectomy. The radiologist I talked to today (female) surprised me by saying that from what she can tell, the women who chose masectomy are \"happier,\" whatever that means. But when I think about losing my left breast, I burst into tears. That makes me lean toward lumpectomy. Ack. I think it really boils down to the phychology of the thing. Will I be more bothered by the loss of a breast or by the extra sliver of doubt that having the lumpectomy leaves me? Frankly, as a triple negative, I am going to have to fight hard not to be worried all the time about recurrence. If I can shave any of that off, it would be a good thing. Sorry for the long message.

Everything went smoothly, and the only thing I feel is the Benadryl. I had signed up for a clinical trial to wear the ice glove and slipper on one side during the infusion. I didn't last an hour. It was too damn uncomfortable. I am concerned about neuropathy, but apparently not concerned enough to put up with more discomfort. We have plenty of that already. Even before taxol a couple of my fingernails have started to lift a bit on one side. I imagine this means taxol will do a number on them. My NP suggested the clear, hardening nail polish Annie",

I keep trying to compare myself to everyone else on the board, asking myself whether i shouldn't have more energy at this point. Am I just being a slug? I do stuff around the house or run an errand, and I can't wait to lie down again. Intense fatigue is what plagued me during AC (I didn't have many other side effects), so maybe my body is just constituted such that this is what chemo does to me. I find it really hard to accept. Of course, I could wake up tomorrow with a blaze of energy. The unpredictability of all this is what drives me crazy. Annie",

I seemed to be hit with feeling ill. I get up and do as much as I can around the house, I run errands, go out for walks, and for the entire time I'm upright I'm miserable. I've set up my Couch Command Center where I get real estate computer work done, take care of writing business, and generally amuse myself between bouts of uprightness. I actually haven't read anyone else having this kind of Taxol reaction. My next treatment is Wednesday, and I'm hoping I at least get the next two days of feeling like my old self before it starts again. Like you, I get a fast heart rate and shortness of breath upon exertion - and it doesn't take much exertion. My appetite is terrible and I'm losing weight. It will be interesting to see what my MO says. Annie",

I have my second Taxol treatment tomorrow, and I'm resigned but horrified at the thought of more of this shit being poured into my poor body! Like Jenn, I can't imagine getting through another three DD treatments. But we will, because what choice do we have? Yesterday I felt great, which is in keeping with my getting two days of normalcy before treatment day. But today, which should have been one of those, I crashed about 2 pm and have that same lousy chemo sick fatigue that has been my worst side effect. I know I have it better than many who suffer more, but I know also we shouldn't censor ourselves here. We're tired, on our last nerve, and in my case, I know, scared the whole thing may not be working. This whole thing requires me to operate on faith, and some days that's way harder than other days. Time for my last supper. Pizza or spaghetti? Annie",

The funny thing was that when they were announcing it, in front of a huge room of people, the head of the company said 'Anne was diagnosed with a rather advanced stage of breast cancer and is undergoing experimental treatment.' What? I'm Stage II and have had AC and Taxol, about as standard as you can get. I have no idea where they got their info; it was like a game of telephone, when the bit of info being passed on completely changes by the end of the line. I went up and accepted the award, probably looking a lot healthier than a person should in my condition. They meant well, though.",

Yesterday was my first boost. I'm finding that I'm having some sharp pain right in the target zone - enough to make me uncomfortable. Ive taken a couple Tylenol, but nothing yet. Has anyone else had this experience? Also, my fatigue seems bad, but I'm always worried that's all in my head. I did have chemo, though, so maybe it's to be expected? Would love your insights.
