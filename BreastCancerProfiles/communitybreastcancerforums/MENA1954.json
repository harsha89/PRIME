Funny how the day that I met my oncologist , after she told me that I Would not be needing Chemo, nothing else seemed important to me! I did not think of anything else that needed to be addressed and discussed! No Chemo! I had won the jackpot, all my prayers had been answered. Arimidex seemed like a small price to pay and bone loss would be taken care of with Reclast! As far as my blood work is concerned, I have the copy of the one done at Pre op and everything was ok! I wanted a copy of the one the oncologist did , just to keep it in my file and not because I thought something might be wrong! I was more concerned about her not calling me to discuss the Results from the DEXA scan ! Lets see what happens in the next couple if days !",

I told her that after taking Nexium for most of my life, I knew from a Scan done 6 yrs. ago, that I already have osteopenia and Osteoperosis! We discussed the option of using Reclast if needed in the future. She never mentioned getting an up to date Bone Scan done now,  so that we could see going forward how my bones were reacting to the arimidex. Of course me being very proactive, I called my PCP and had him give me a script for a new Bone Scan. WOW! The results are scary!  Everything is above -3 ! I had the Radiologist sent a copy to my Oncologist so that she was aware of what was going on with my bones! I called her office today to ask for a copy of my blood work done in sept. and to mention the Bone Scan Report! The person I spoke to said \" Didn't the DR. call you to discuss them with you?\"  \" I said no, she has not called me!\"   She said \" No problem, but I need to make sure the DR. has seen the report from the blood work and the Bone Scan\" Heck, it has been 5 weeks since I saw her!  Do I assume NO NEWS IS GOOD NEWS, or do I assume she's NOT AS GREAT as I THOUGHT!!!!

I was also worried that time was of the essence, but the surgeon assured me the day we had our consultation that the surgery had to be done the latest within 4 weeks!

By the way Surgery was a breeze, did not even use any pain meds , I relied so much on God to help get through this and he was there for me every step of the way!

I was not able to fly, not because I was afraid of crashing, but because when the door closed, I felt as if I could not breathe! I don't have to tell you what my symptoms were, because you know them too well.  This may sound strange, but after I got off all my meds such as antidepressants or benzos I actually started to improve.  Now about 3 yrs. later I am much better. I am not saying that it has not happened again but somehow I am able to handle it better.  There were times when if I could not remember the name of someone, I would litterally feel like something in my head was going to explode. My heart would race so fast, dizziness, shortness of breath, it was just awful. Now if it happens, I can usually talk myself out of it.  I have always been the type to have health anxiety, to always be afraid to go and see a doctor because I knew I would get bad news.  My anxiety level was always in overdrive and I lived everyday worrying that something bad was going to happen.  Well it did.... MY FIRST MAMMO and what did it show... BREAST CANCER!!!!  Instead of freaking out I realized how blessed I was,  it could have been worse I said to myself, over and over.  I had a bottle of ativans ready, just in case... but I took only a few for my MRI, other than that nothing. I don't know why you suffer from anxiety or panic attacks, or why  I am  even writing all this, I guess I just wanted you to know that I understand exactly how you feel...because I have been there....! Where in Westchester do you live?  I actually got married in Scarsdale. Mena",
