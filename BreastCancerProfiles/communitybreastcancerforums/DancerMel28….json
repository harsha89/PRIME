I didn't work during chemo but some people do.  I found overall that there were lots of 'little' things - dry eyes, taste issues yes (lemon juice helps a bit), a bit of eye twitching, I had headaches during first cycle but I think my scalp was sore from my hair falling out (which really started by day 15 cycle 1, I shaved by day 18). My biggest issue was that I had a reaction to the taxotere during the infusion - don't be afraid if this happens to you, the nurses were quick to stop it and gave me extra meds and I was fine when it re-started.  If you feel strange at all during the infusion tell the nurses straight away and you'll be fine I promise!  I wish I had known earlier - but the best thing that a nurse did during my 4th was to start it off slowly and gradually increase it and I had no reactions on the 4th one so that seems to be the key! Good luck, feel free to PM if you have questions.",

We have enough to deal with without putting up with SEs that can be fixed easily. If you need any further advice - check out the april and may threads also - both packed with info!

So instead I've got an antibiotic cream to apply twice a day with the view to prevent inflamation and further break outs. Basically it's all the toxins in the body casuing it so by keeping the skin clean with this cream it should help. He also said that he sees it a lot as a result of Chemo so there you go. LauraM - good luck tomorrow. The anticipation really is worse than the actual thing so hopefully you'll be fine! Saralmum - I have a friend who went through chemo and for ages afterwards couldn't even drive past the place where she had her infusions without feeling nauseous because of the association with it.  I don't think it's as strange as you think.

New SE this round has been blood noses but that seems to have settled a bit now - they said I can't blow my nose so I end up with a bit of dry blood up my nose still but not having the bleeding as such anymore. I've found overall that I've just had a heap of 'little' things but have managed to get thorugh it all and have 2 good weeks out of the 3 so it's been a better experience than what I was expecting (dreading!!) before I began. Kad22 - I'm on Taxotere which I hear is in the same family as Taxol but is different from my understanding.  I react within a couple of minutes of it starting through the drip - get an awful feeling in my chest, heart beats fast and I go bright red!!  Once they stop and give me extra steroid and phenergen wait a bit to calm down, it restarts and I'm fine! So weird - almost as if my body goes - hell no you aint putting that poison in me but then realises it doesn't have a choice so shrugs it shoulders and soldiers on haha. Merideth - I'm having Zoladex shots monthly which I hear is the same sort of thing as lupron.  I too am hoping that ovaries survive all this as I haven't had kids yet and was actually trying to start a family when I got dignosed putting an end to that for now.  I was totally freaked out when I saw the onc and she said 5 years of hormone therapy so can't have kids til after that - but saw the fertility specialist 2 days later and she said generally it's okay to stop after 2 years (PHEW!!!) to try for a baby so fingers crossed it's all okay!",

Had another reaction to the Taxotere - even though they gave me an extra shot of steroid before they started.  This time they stopped it and gave me phenergen then once again I was fine once it restarted.Now they're saying that if it happens a 3rd time they might change the dose (when they said it very rarely happens on 3rd and 4th!). So am hoping that it doesn't happen again. My hairdresser buzzed my hair on Wednesday - so weird!!  I didn't cry just felt weird - looks funny as I have some bald spots but still got hair in other places.  While I was in Melbourne I went wig shopping (got nothing locally). THey were so lovely - they look after a lot of chemo patients they said.  THey made me where my wig out of hte shop and I must say the push was good - I dont' think I would've had the confidence otherwise. Felt nice not to have people staring at my scarves like I've had since I began wearign them on Monday . Hope eveyone's going well. Check in again soon!",

After reading everyone's posts and the fact that I'm actually finally starting to feel 'normal' again I am feeling so much more positive about everything - I figure that's a much better frame of mind to go into next week with Anyway, am seeing my oncologist tomorrow so have a long list of questions to ask after reading your posts.

I started Rads yesterday but don't have an appointment with him until then so we'll see what he says.  I asked my Onc what happens now that I'm getting to the 'end' of treatment and she basically said for the next year I would have 3 month check ups (didn't say exactly what the chekc ups were), and that it would either be with her or my surgeon. I see her again at end of November to check how tamoxifen is going, then she said we'd work out next plan of check ups then. Hope everyone's going ok, have to go and get ready to drive to rads #2 (only 28 to go after that!). Mel xx",

I've been frantically running around getting as much done as I can before then so that I don't have to worry when the side effects hit. :-)  One thing my oncologist said to me at my last appointment was that I was to make sure to ring them if nausea was a problem as in her opinion 'noone in this day and age should have to put up with it'.  I'm hoping that means that there's some way of controlling at least the worst of it (well here's hoping anyway!).  Had my hair cut into a shorter style today - just couldn't face having to look at my longish hair in my hands when it starts to fall out, so hopefully it won't be so bad.  Must say it's different - was a nice excuse to experiment as I said to my hairdresser it's going to fall out anyway so if I don't like the style it's not goign to matter too much at this stage.  She was really good though and I'm lucky that her salon is at her home so when I need to shave it, it can be done privately.  Hope everyone's feeling ok or at least got some support through the bad days, your posts and updates have really helped me get ready for Friday so thank you.",

I've been getting a little worn down with the driving too and from rads but the Eisteddfod was in same town as my treatment so one of my parents drove me down and took me to my appointments in between the girls dancing so that was really helpful. Will be interesting to see how I go back at school anyway - the best part is my principal is really supportive and he told me we'll take it week by week and see how I go so no pressure which is good. Have read through all the posts but can't remember everything!  Something about blood noses - yes had them during chemo my onc said bridge of nose gets very sensitive during chemo which causes them.  I've been going 'topless' more and more lately - got a nice coverage of hair but it's still only about 1cm long (sorry have no idea with inches as we use centimetres in Oz but I know an inch is longer!) so it's not really a style yet but am just so sick of scarves and beanies and I really haven't taken to wearing my wig. Most people say I look better with nothing on then the scarves so there you go.  I too went to a concert and it got soo hot I just whipped the scarf off and kept dancing - people next to me were a bit shocked I think!

Has anyone discovered anything that helps?  I've currently got a bad rash over my face, neck and upper back. Not sure if there's anything that can be done but it's getting annoying.  None of the literature I recieved about side effects says anything to help - only mention is that you may get a rash and that it will clear up after treatment.

Just have to survive the SE's of the next week or so (fingers crossed its the same as last round which was ok overall) then I can cross that part off as done!!! When I met with Onc before my chemo she arranged my referral for rads which I'm going to be having closer to home (30 mins each way instead of the current 2 1/2-3 hours each way). I'm also going to be referred for genetic testing (which normally would've been done earlier but due to earlier complications I had from other things got overlooked), since I'm so young I'd just like to know one way or another for future and I have 2 sisters who could be affected also so want to have all the info.  AND I've noticed some swelling in my arm on the side of my SNB so also have a referral to a physio as I oculd have a slight case of Lymphodema grrrrrr!  Always thought it strange that I wasn't seen by a physio after my surgery (as most seem to?) so am worried that because I haven't been doing any exercises that it's caused it. Will see what physio says I guess.....  All in all - have had a really good week - caught up with 2 dear friends that live far away so haven't seen in a while, my husband won a competition (that I actually entered him in!) his prize was $1000 which is about to come in real handy! and my chemo has gone well.........can't complain!",

Main issues have been with my mouth - really dry, awful taste (had 3-4 days this round that the only thing I could stand to drink was pepsi aaargh!!). Got dry eyes, have to keep on top of the constipation.... but everything has been 'manageable'. My only issue with the Taxotere - is that I react to it within a couple of minutes of it beginning to go through the drip. But once they stop it give me extra meds and restart after 1/2 hour I'm fine with it. I know what to expect now so the reaction doesn't get as far thorugh as the first time but I know the nurses were worried after my last round as they gave me extra stuff before hand to try and stop the reaction and I still reacted!  My onc was happy to restart it again and I was fine as per the first two rounds. There was talk of changign me to A but I dont' want to change (for a lot of reasons) so when I see my onc tomorrow before my chemo I have to convince her to not change it! ",

I hope you feel better soon - like you said in your post your half way there.  I guess we just have to continue to take it one day at a time and we are so lucky to have this wonderful group to help us through",

I've actually started to worry a bit - I've had a reaction to the taxotere both times so far and I'm really hoping that I dont' have a 3rd reaction (it's just not fun!!).  My Oncologist has actaully lowered my dose of steroids too - instead of starting the mornign of the day before, I now only start the night before. SO will only have 2 doses before my chemo.  I had a reaction the second time even though they put extra steroids through the IV before starting.  So I really don't know if I should contact my Onc to question the lesser dose (I only found out she'd changed it when the pharmacist brang my meds up to me during my chemo), I think she changed it as I've broken out in a rash in the week after my first treatment which she thinks was caused by the steroids.  Who knows!!!  Anyway - I guess we'll see what happens.  Hope everyone's doing ok today. ",

Then they gave me some phenergen and aagain when it restarted I was fine.  THey told me initially that you can have a reaction the 2nd time but very rarely the 3rd. But after I reacted the 2nd time they said if it happens again they may change my dose (which I sorta don't see the point of as I'm only having 4 cycles - I figure they may as well just leave it).  I just hope that the reaction doesn't get worse each time. My Oncologist has been really good (apart from the not telling me she changed the dose of steroid), I always have an appointment on the day of my chemo for review before I start my chemo that day so can bring up any issues then.  I have numbers I can ring 24/7 if any side effects which I've only had to use once and they were really helpful. (I'm in Australia not sure if you're in states like a lot of people??).  My hospital where I'm being treated is a specialist hospital for cancer patients so they seem to have a few extra things in place to help which is good.",

Started off with my 9:00 appointment with my Onc being 20 mins late getting in (what the hell - first appointment of the day???). By the time we discussed what needed to be discussed and I got out of there and up to the 5th floor Chemo Day unit I was 30 mins late for my appoinment up there.  So I sat there waiting....waiting.....waiting.... it got to 11:15 and I asked how much longer as my appoinment was supposed to 9:30 and heaps of others that got there after me were going in before me.  Finally at 11:30 got in there. Started off with extra pre meds to avoid a reaction to the taxotere (phenergen AND extra steroid) waited 1/2 hour for them to kick in. Then they started the T and guess what? Yep had a reaction for the 3rd time - I've officially been labelled a trouble maker by the nurses haha.  So they stopped it gave me MORE phenregen and steroid and then while i settled down I heard them discussing me behind me - saying that they didn't want to proceed with it! Even though I'd told them that both times before once it restarted I was absolutely fine. SO they ring my Onc who came up to talk to me. Basically they don't know why I keep reacting as today they did absolutely everything to Prevent the reaction and it still didn't work. However, she was happy to restart it (which I was fine for the remainder of thankfully) but now she wants me to change regime to AC instead of TC (so only changing the T to A but keeping the C).  As funny as it sounds I dont' really want to change as I only have 1 more round so figure I know what to expect and what side effects I geneally have and don't really want to stuff the system up by chanigng now.  If I still had 3 left or somehting I'd go with it but I'm really in two minds!  She said to think about it and gave me thie information so that I can read about and we'll make a decision when I see her next. So all in all a frustrating day - didn't leave hospital until 4:15 then had to face peak hour traffic and long weekend traffic so the trip home took a lot longer.  Such a long day and now I don't know what to do about my last treatment",

ArubaJan - good to hear from you.  I have a close friend at work who has been on tamoxifen for 2 1/2 years so I was quizzing her about the SEs she'd had.  She said that there was a pattern to her moods - and had worked out in particular that there were 3-4 'really bad days' that she warned her husband and duaghter when she felt it coming on and they knew to steer clear, as she said that tiny things would send her off and she just generally feels low on these days.  Overall though she said that she was generally ok most of the time.  My guess would be that we will all need some time for our bodies to adjust to the tamoxifen - hopefully things settle down and you feel yourself again soon! I see my onc on Aug 13th about hormone therapy so I guess will find out for myself once I begin..... Overall am starting to feel a little more like myself again - been 4 weeks tomorrow since my last chemo.  Last week was quite a struggle emotionally - just didn't feel myself at all. I think the not sleeping part wasn't helping either - finally took a sleeping pill and boy what a differnece a good night's sleep makes.  Had my second surgery this morning to fix my scar - 20 min surgery and was only under a local not general anaesthetic so feel pretty ok right now.  Just fingers crossed that I don't get an infection this time!",

My husband is going to be turning 30 in early November so I've decided that I want to throw a little get together - just mainly family and close friends.  He's not really a 'party boy' as such so thought a sunday lunch would be nice - good food and some drinks.  I had decided to hold it at home to save hiring a venue but get someone in to cater so I didn't have to worry about cooking and cleaning up (basically take the stress out of it all). Got some prices - nothing extravagant but will cost a little bit of money but defintiely not too much more than if I'd got all the food and cooked it all myself.  So I'm happily making plans (giving me something to do in between rads appointments) and today my Mother in Law found out what I was planning. She basically turned up her nose and said it'd be cheaper to buy the meat and spit roast it yourself rather than pay someone to cater.  She made me feel stupid for spending money when i'm not in work (though up until 2 weeks I ago I was on full sick pay and now am on half pay long service leave which is covering the mortgage just fine!) and that I should be saving every penny as we were destitute.  I just want to do something nice for my husband - we've had a horrible year overall and as things will be 'getting back on track' soon once I finish Rads I just thought it would be a nice thing.  It's not like I'm spending our life savings on a silly party. Grrrrrr! I'm just so angry that I let her upset me.  My DH had a party in his garage for his 18th (can't have too many people traipsing through the house and messing it up), he just went out for dinner for his 21st, so this was my way of putting on something special for him, Sorry - its trivial I know but she just makes me so angry - not everyone wants to miss out on life for the sake of saving a dollar or two. It' s not like you can spend your money when your dead. We haven't had to rely on them for money or anytihng these past months so I don't see what her problem is. Ok rant over - again sorry - just had to get it out somewhere!!! Hope everyone's having a great weekend :-)",

It's scary the first time but the nurses know exactly what to do to fix it.  My body handled it a lt better today with no pre-meds but a slower drip so go figure!  TIme wise - the first 3 took prob 1 1/2 hours or so as mine was stopped in the middle each time due to my reaction and they had to wait before restarting, today it only took about an hour. apparently T is one of the longer ones I think? xraygirl - I've had 4x TC and have had the steady weight gain each round grr!!!  Unfortunately because of taste issues I find I'm attracted to ANY food which has a strong sugar/salt taste which is all the food we probably shouldn't be eating.  I'm resigned to that fact that due to some fatigue and the fact that I'm not working at the moment means I'm definetly not as active as I usually am - I'm hoping now that i've finished my last one I can slowly build myself back up with my fitness and hopefully (fingers crossed) I can lose the weight again.  I find taking the colxyl and keeping on top of constipation helps with the bloating a bit - but it's mostly from the water loading unfortunatley.  Sorry not much help!",

I had my 3rd yesterday and again reacted - even after they gave me all the extra premeds they could (steroid and phenergen).  I have one more cycle to go and now my Onc wants me to change to A.  I'm a bit reluctant as I know what to expect with T - the reactions have all been the same except I get it stopped quicker as I recognise the symptoms straight away and after more med boost the restart is fine, I know what to expect afterwards in regard to side effects etc so I don't know what to do!  I can understand that they say that my body is put under more stress with the reactions but with one more to go what's the point of changing and not knowing if I'll have a whole new round of SEs that are harder to handle?? So confusing! Hope you work something out to help you. Just thought I'd share that I have to make the same decision. Mel",

Shows that the key with taxotere seems to be to begin SLOWLY!  Wish I had of known it earlier may have avoided a reaction or two! Keep strong! Mel",

I said I didnt' want to change as: I've only got one left, I know what happens with the reaction and get it stopped pretty quickly, there's no guarantees that I won't react to the A, and I know what SEs I get and how to deal with them - don't want to have to worry about new SEs at this late stage!!  So she said we'll see - gave me the info on A and said we would make a decision when I see her next. So I'm gearing up for a fight.  I just don't want to have to make more decisions at this time grr!  It's amazing what our bodies have to deal with during this chemocrap hey? Mel",

I too am having same issues with hair - I didn't think it would really affect me so much but am on a bit of a downer today as last night it was just falling everywhere!!  I reckon I only have about a third of my hair left - bald spots are appearing but I can still sort of cover it but I know myself that they are there. So when people say to me - \"Oh but you can't notice it\" - I get so defensive as I know they are there and that my hair is not MY hair anymore.  *sigh* must try and snap out of this funk - I keep thinking now I get to wear my beautiful scarves. Oh and from what I've read about the taxotere - there is a rare(ish) side effect that hair either takes a long time or doesn't regrow after it. My Onc didn't say anything about that to me - only found out through reading these threads so am hoping that it is on the rarer side fo the possible SEs.  I think it comes back to the 'it affects everyone differently' and it's too hard to predict exactly what may happen as our bodies are so different.  Here's hoping it all goes to plan hey? Bye for now, Mel",
