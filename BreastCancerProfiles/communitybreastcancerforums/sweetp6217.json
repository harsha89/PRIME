When I went for my follow up appointment with my surgeon, she mentioned MBI. The hospital I go to is going to have it in a few months and I went to a seminar about it about a week ago. I managed to get a number out of them as for my density; I'm a 3 out of 4. I'm hoping that I'll be able to get this test done since I'm likely to have recurrence. According to my BS and my diagnostic radiologist, it doesn't take the place of the mammo, but it can be helpful if the images are poor due to breast density. They inject you with a tracer and you sit in a chair and get lined up into something similar to mammo plates. Big difference: it shouldn't hurt much since they're not supposed to press as hard as a mammo. The images produced using MBI appear so clear as compared to the mammogram (with patients with high density). I await a letter come January that should state my density rating and whether or not I may be one of the first to try it in the next wave, if there is one.",

I noticed when I searched for this testing that BC.org has a little information about it dating back to 2016. I wish that this type of thing would take off quicker, but the main focus still seems to be on mammograms, usually sufficient for most. The success rate quoted for the the test doesn't seem to be as great as one would hope, but perhaps with experience may come improvements. I've mentioned MBI to several HCPs, most of which have not heard of it (or perhaps they read about it and forgot about it). At least I have 2 doctors that will recommend it and work out the P/A (prior authorization) should my insurance deny it...something that they are very good at.",

I had a hysterectomy in January and felt pretty good for about almost two months since I was off work. But now thinking back, starting in about Mid-March of this year and going forward, I know that I felt very fatigued. I would be catching up on a show/series, then almost suddenly I would get so tired that I could just lay down in bed and just fall asleep. Not hear any reminder alarms to take my night meds and then wake up around 1:30 in the morning. Low and behold, June 2nd, I found a lump. Fast forward to today, I just had my PORT put in and begin chemo in two days.",

I just got a second opinion that recommends supraclavicular and internal mammory lymph node radiation treatment in addition to just the axillary and the breast. P.S. Treatments haven't begun yet. Amy, did your MO (medical oncologist) prescribe anti nausea pills? When I got chemo, they started me off with antinausea meds, and told me to take those pills (as prescribed) prior to times when I felt I might experience nausea. Also, for the pain, I tried (and my MO recommended it) taking claritin before treatments. Ask your MO though.",

In the meantime, I'm also going to call to other facilities to see if they perform this differently. Thank you all.

I was a bit put back by that and mentioned what I was told about an office visit. They want to give me strong pain killers and not let me drive home after. I have a tolerance for pain and don't believe that it would take 6 or more hours to accomplish. I made the appointment, but now I'm having big second thoughts. I really don't want to have surgery.

I work in a retail setting and my boss says I can wear a surgical mask. Just yesterday, a customer came up to the counter with her virus, hacking away. Afterwards, I sprayed down everything with alcohol spray and wiped it down. I didn't like it when they did that before BC and I don't like it now. If you're hacking away, wear a mask pretty please. And yes, I'm one to talk but I haven't been that sick for a very long time... Speaking of which, one of my doctors is in the medical profession and says she couldn't work during some of her BC treatment. I think shes kind of hinting that I shouldn't either.",

The educational meeting went pretty well until the nurse realized that my doctor is out of town this week. \"The nurse will take some blood to test, then you'll meet with your doctor for sure for about 15 minutes, then you chemo will begin.\" She went on and on about how important it was to have the doctor there when I begin for the first time. The appointment/order says that I am to see \"NURSE\", not my doctor. Hmmmmm. She looked a bit flustered. On the other hand, I happy to learn that I can take some OTCs, that are mentioned in the \"list\" that is posted on this website. Claritin, queazy pops, etc. Tomorrow AM I start taking dexamethsone (twice daily for 3 days). Also some zofran and some compazine. I have to see if my insurance has seen the light and will cover Perjeta. Darn them and their prior authorizations! Now, to make my recliner a bit more comfortable; I'm afraid to rip the stitches out! (Bard Power Port). Oops! P.S. The nurse managed to pull a rabbit out of her hat and handed me a phone number to call. Apparently there is a small chapter that also has wigs. They let you try them on and pick one out. ",

Went to Culver's after chemo and had the Mushroom Swiss burger and snagged one of my hubby's chicken tenders. At 1 AM the next \"morning\", I had the most heartburn/reflux I'd ever had in years so popped the pepcid. Day 2 of food switched to braty diet (homemade chicken noodle soup, banana, toast, crackers, etc. an liquids). Day 3 was pretty bad. Could only get 16 ounces of water down (my #2s were normal although x 3, followed by not so good x 1, only on that day); ate a baked potato and had some chicken and rice soup with extra rice. I worked this day for 4 hours. Day 4 (Sunday) was even worse, if that's possible. The claritin I had been taking for neulasta wasn't working and I had pain in my legs and feet joints all day. Another problem was that nothing tasted right. I would try something, a bite or two and have to put it down. Water consumption had to go to a trickle, only sipping. I worked this day too for 4 hours and was only able to get 12 ounces of water down. Had toast and canned peaches before work. After I got home, I knew I knew that I needed to eat, and my hubby was making dinner. I ran up to the bathroom and emptied my stomach after taking some imodium (not much there). Took zofran and later, got up the courage to make and eat a little maccies. Day 5, got in some rice and cooked plain chicken and some apple juice, then waiting until 8 AM when the chemo clinic would open. Called them up to hopefully get a saline infusion. The called back in 20 minutes, a new record but got me in at 12:30 (1 liter for an hour). Drank some apple juice and got in 24 ounces of water that day. Also called off work and was asked to take the next day off) Had a grilled cheese and a couple of cookies. The infusion nurse informed me that I had lost 8 pounds and could come in tomorrow again if I wanted to.Told to try to eat more frequently, smaller meals, more protein. Day 6 (my birthday) and I was already off anyway. Woke up and emptied stomach. Got in 32 ounces of water this day. Ate dry rice crispies, Chicken and rice soup/crackers, hubby brought home a mini burger for me so I ate it, Had a piece of teriyaki chicken for late meal and had a bit of ice cream (hey! It's my birthday and no cake). Day 7 had a plain bagel, Went to work, sipped water throughout the shift, didn't feel like eating, came home with a Boston Market Prime rib dinner with plain mashed potato for both sides. I only at 1/3 of the meat and the potato. Ice cream for desert. Day 8 weighed myself and discovered that I had now lost 14 pounds since infusion. Got in 48 ounces of water today. Ate two ego waffles with maple syrup, 1/3 prime rib and potato, starbuck's apple and cinnamon cake at work, and 1/2 cold cut sandwich and a few pringles after work. Sent the doctor an email about my progress and asked what more I can do to combat the bad taste in my mouth. Many of my food choices were off limits due to taste. Day 9 got a call from the nurse. Told to see a nutritionist (already had), and they repeated all the same things to try followed by \"just force yourself to eat\". She also said that my taste buds should be much better by now. I don't know about you, but I'm getting sick of getting such sage advice from those who haven't experienced this for themselves. Got in 32 ounces of water, tried to drink applejuice and almost gagged. Drank mountain dew at work, along with water, dry rice crispies, goldfish crackers (amazingly delicious to me right now). Had the last of the prime rib and potato after work. May as well mention that my #2s were not so good day 4 to 8.5, but are now better). I am taking zofran from time to time along with imodium D and lomotil, and pepcid. Here's the thing and I really know that there are those much worse off than I am (hugs), I have to work and during this past week, I really felt like I shouldn't be working, but did anyway. Today is day 10 and I'm off. So I have a question, what foods have you all tried to snack on while going through the metallic taste phase? How did you drink water when you didn't want to? Any tips you have would be wonderful. I hope that you all are doing well with your infusions and side effects. BIG hugs!",

      "Content": "Jul 25, 2017 06:02AM - edited Jul 25, 2017 06:02AM by sweetp6217 Hello All: I'm trying to distract myself since the port is going in later this morning. Last night I had to stop myself from buying a couple of lace front wigs online. Not that I don't plan on buying at least one eventually, but cautious me is thinking how to get reimbursed by insurance. I spoke with the powers that be and they said that they cover wigs for up to 1k/year, but needed a doctor's RX, etc. I ran by a couple of codes and of course they said that they didn't cover \"that\". In my mind I was thinking (Make up your mind!!! BCBS). It turned out that the reps I have spoken to so far A) bless them, haven't gone through chemo and B) haven't been given a clue how to talk with compassion when giving them the (wrong?) bad news that it's not covered since they don't have the information in the first place. At least I can wear a mask at work when it comes time. The last fellow co-worker who wore one a couple of years ago (because she had the flu and didn't want to get everyone sick...and couldn't get someone to cover her shift, mind you), almost got tip-lined to the powers that shall not be named. How a surgical mask can be construed as something else while you're wearing a white uniform jacket, I'll never know. But, I'm sorry, I feel like I need a wig or two. I don't wear makeup and haven't since 2007, just a dab if need be on the odd blemish (blemishes after 45?). So, I don't know if it's a good idea to buy the wig before getting a prescription. The wig place that I have in mind does take exchanges and returns if not used (just tried on real quick to see if it fits is OK). The local places are scams and possibly worse, if that's possible. The one that a doctor recommended to me is an example of you buy it, you keep it. They make sure to alter the wig for you (doing you a favor of cutting it to your liking, etc.) so that the wig can't be returned, ever. I wasn't born yesterday. So I'm not going to be able to just try one on. I even looked up my local chapter(s) for Look Good Feel Better and they have meetings once a month, most of which have been cancelled. Other local meetings where you might swap stories all happen to take place during my work hours. I'll have to see if I can switch shifts with someone once I get started.. You all, this website, is pretty much all I have for right now for this kind of thing. My sweet husband is already getting a bit exhausted. I told him what the plan was weeks ago and put my schedule up for him to see (what and when) and bless him, he thought my surgery today was for a lumpectomy, not the port. FYI, 6 rounds of chemo first, then LX (lumpectomy?), hopefully. Anyway, today it's going to be the PORT, sit around until my appointment with a dietician, followed immediately by the chemo education 1 on 2 at the Cancer wing/building. My hubby is going to race home from work, let the pooch out, then drive on up to the hospital for that 1 hour edu with me. Love him! .... and you! ",

I got my 3rd infusions one week ago and the side effects seem to be worse, perhaps because they doubled my Carboplatin. My kidney functions were in the green so they upped the dose for the first time. As for Perjeta, I might be done with that. With my doctor's permission we decided to stop it and see what happens in the SE department. I'm having sporadic D, the feeling of nausea also sporadically, post nasal drip, congestion, coughing, dry everything, waves of discomfort before some #2, can't taste much, and worst of all, I really don't feel like going to work anymore. When I arrive at work, I sometimes have to make a run to the bathroom; great way to start your shift! Next, I have to bring supplies just in case I need to change my undies. Actually had to use it once, full kilt. Was told that when we have a visit from the powers that be, I can't leave my bag where I need it, but rather in the locker. Luckily, I didn't need it those two times. To prevent extra trips to the bathroom, I have had to subtract more than 1/2 of my regular choices to eat. Speaking of which, there is plenty of food in the house, but I can never quickly decide what to have; can't even finish a small meal. Anyway, I really hope that you have no side effects everyone. I wish that I could hug you all! ",

Before my BC discovery, we bit the bullet and replaced the central AC and furnace with a 2-stage furnace and a more ventilated system. The old system was pretty low to standard and 25 years old, so it was worth it. Update (Neulasta) I got my shot this morning and was going to get it in the arm, but the nurse wanted it to go into my tummy (more fat in that area). Then I remembered that when I got my hysterectomy last January, they cut some nerves so it's numb anyway. Problem solved, no sting whatsoever. I almost forgot to take my Claritin and had to turn back home to do so (Chemo brain already?). Still made it on time with 5 minutes to spare.",
