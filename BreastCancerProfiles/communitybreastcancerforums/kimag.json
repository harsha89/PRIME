Of course not everybody has SE from Tamoxifen or not all SE are equally as bad. But I cannot forget the fact that I have BC as a late side effect of my previous treatment - radiation, that my echo of the heart showed recently borderline low ejection fraction which is linked to one of the ingredients of my chemo in the past. So when the oncologist is not convinced I should take the drug it makes me wonder do I really need it would it not cause more issues. That is why I wanted to support my decision either way with Oncotype test and hear back from other Ladies if someone has it done with small IDC",

I agree 19 years ago I went through chemo just living my life (middle of high school grad exams and university exams) I thought I am unsinkable... this time with issues with thyroid, BC and now heart (not mentioning lungs scaring) I am scared so much and my anxiety has grown out of control at some point.. However I noticed 2 things first I may have had anxiety induced by actual and real issues with heart rate that I was not aware of than, suddenly HR 160 freaked me out and the docs at ER thought I had AF.... dizzines, feeling like faint etc. I stopped driving the car with my kids as i was scared i will pass out behind the wheel. Once I was diagnosed and given meds for heart rate etc. I have not experience major panic attack or anxiety... I am still scared often and worry about future but this is not that strong. Second thing if I feel out of source, weak or like fainting and feel my HR race i take half of tabled of 5mg Ativan just a little bit more psychologically and try to occupy myself for 10 min to see if it would not get better... I noticed as you did that when I was racing to doctors or er because of the way I felt, i was often getting better the minute i was admitted to waiting room... so that is why instead spending hours in er waiting rooms (and believe me my anxiety was at the point that I could practically live there) i try my friend ativan, if after that still in doubt i would go I am so sorry to hear your recent ordeal, please get help for the anxiety at least for the beginning when everything is still new.

I read about your own experience, and the reasons why you did not take it longer, I read other posts and noticed that often even with Tamoxifen or other hormonal therapy the mets or recurrence can show up. I wonder what then is the benefit of that hormone therapy if people still get mets! How to know am I the one that it will work for or the one to only suffer SE and still be not protected. Some say try it you can always stop it but I am scared of late SE that show up much later I cannot sleep as I think and think and worry what should I do to be as long as possible for my 3 boys and hubby...  I had cancer before 18 years ago and this BC adventure is a late SE of radiation therapy... as much as I want to get another 18 cancer free years or more I am concern about SE of the treatment to not end up with another serious issues... your posts on this site reminded me that we are all mortal and have to somehow find peace with that fact and it is true but it is hard for me now... somehow when battling lymphoma  18 years ago I did not fear as much... I know I was lucky to catch BC early and by pure miracle as I was not scheduled for regular mammograms due to age (37) had no lump just happen to meet great doctor doing tests who recommended mammogram hearing my past medical history.. now of course I worry a lot, I have pain in my back - chest level, had issues with vision - it is like migraine aura. You wrote somewhere that if it goes should not be mets related, the pain can be muscles and the vision my migraine which I had in the past... but know with fresh BC dx in the background everything I hear in my body looks scary, like shadows on the wall for my kids... I agree too much tests can be harmful, after radiation I already had a lot but when to know should I push  for more test? Have bone scan? Head MRI ? After all if not incidental mammogram I may have been dx quite late...  I apologize for such a long post but this mets scare is eating me alive, and the fact that I need to decided about treatment as MO is neutral occupy most of my mind and prevent me from enjoying everyday life..",

I was wondering how it is that some of us have chemo and some not... my IDC is grade 2, I cannot have any radiation due to past medical history and was offered Tamoxifen as an option not a must... I asked for oncotype test and was told my IDC was to small to do it... how would I know I should have chemo? Not all of us grade 2 have chemo, but for some oncotype comes high indicating chemo, if i cannot have oncotype results how to know?",

I have started discussion at the time to see what others say about their experience with size and testing.  I wish I had it done but then I will most like have had larger tumor so  it could be possible to test so as always there is another side of once's wish.. and you are very right we hang on to those numbers.... to add myself points though I still need to work on exercises part I eat more veggies and fruits almost no crap food but... I wonder when would I stop thinking about it all day wondering have I done well today, have I eaten well, move more, feel guilty when having nap instead of walk or exercises and terribly scared whenever I feel some ''new\" pain... second guess myself if maybe I should try Tamo but then every cell in my body cries no - oh I will end up in the madhouse one day...  Annette thanks a lot, your response helps a lot, yes it was small: 2.5mm one and second 0.5 mm so MO rounded it to 3 mm, I did have extensive DCIS both grade 2 and 3 and I was 'lucky' that the invasion came from grade 2 not 3,  I had very small margin only 0.4 mm and I was very concern about it but my surgeon said that since it is anterior margin it does not matter and all is fine. I had no other choice then mastectomy as I could not have any more radiation - got my lifetime in the past.",

I did call today the company doing Oncotype test and was told they need at least 2mm of invasive tumor, however with such a small tumors when local pathologist is done with his test usually there is not enough material anymore.  I guess we will always wonder if treatment is adequate but it would be so nice to have a support of low Oncotype score still nothing is for sure. It is almost 6 weeks post surgery for me and I can't yet get over it and some how find myself again. It is a process and probably takes time, so far I cannot sleep at night, I would seat and wonder till 3-4 am , I just can't get my self a sleep earlier, I think to much and stress to much and it is not healthy as we all know stress feeds cancer too. I do not want to take more meds, I still struggle with Tamoxifen decision maybe I will finally flip a coin as my MO says he is fine with me doing whatever I decide..",
