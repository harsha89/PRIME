I had a mammogram and ultrasound that showed nothing a Ductogram that they could not complete Because I fainted 3 Times and had a seizure. I had an MRI and just got the results and they found three \u201clesions\u201c in my left breast and two \u201clesions and \u201cin my right breast. Report says MRI abnormal BIRADS3 follow up 3 months if no surgery for duct issue. None of the lesions show cause for bleeding.Has anyone had any experience with something like this? I have an appointment with breast surgeon Friday and she wants me to re attempt ductogram. I told her I want 5 biopsies not a follow up mri in 3 months. Any advice would be appreciated.
