I had my first chemo treatment last 9 July, the oncologist recommended dividing the dose of taxotere and epirubicin for week 1 and week 2 (considered as 1st cycle) and repeat the treatment again in week 4 and week 5 (considered as 2nd cycle) and so on.  I'm very afraid of the future effects of taxotere on me.  Is there anyone of you there who changed her regimen after the first treatment ?  I dont know what effect if will have in killing the cancer cells if I change regimen.
