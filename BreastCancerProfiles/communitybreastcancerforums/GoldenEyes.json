I have had pain on the upper right side, near my rib cage under my right breast...I was able to tolerate it for while.. but in the last few days it was so un bearable.. I finally called the Dr.. I couldnt even sleep at night..It feels as though I was beaten up, I feel badly bruised.. sore.. just touching my skin hurt on that one side.. and it feels as though someone is punching me. I am in constant pain..Dr Did an Ultrasound he was so sure it was my gall bladder.. It showed nothing.. according to the US.. and Cat Scan of my belly area.. and blood work.. Everything looks alright..But I continue to have this pain.. I was on Medication for few days. .just so I could sleep.. But the side affects were awful.. I was so nausea...(Dilaudid?)  I went back to the Dr Today.. he said. .he has no idea why I am having so much pain.. Now he thinks it could be.. or was.. SHingles? I am now on a pain patch.. that really seems to be working.. I hardly feel any pain at th emoment...So here is my question.. Sorry this is long lol... Has anyone ever had this before? This type of pain? Its so confusing.. First they thought gall bladder. now shingles? So frustrating!.. I am going for my mammo next week..on the same side.. Maybe that will show something.. I also asked if this could be a bruise...wouldnt I be black and blue?....With the pain patch (:Lidocaine? sp? ) this is first time I have felt like myself in over week Thank you Ladies Dx 9/20/2007, IDC, 1cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, 1/1 nodes, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

Do you know which chemo you are getting?  Not all chemo drugs will make you lose your hair.  The last one I was on was Tykerb and Xeloda.. Nerve damage, but I kept my hair.. Even if you do lose your hair,, it grows back fast once you are done with treatment.. Think of it this way..You can be blonde one day, a brunette, you can be a fiery red head too  !  My husband had a different woman in bed with him every night !  Hahahhaha... Thinking of you, keeping you in my thoughts and prayers.. Great ladies here to support you and get you through all of this.. Donna",

I had a blonde wig and an auburn wig..I would switch back and forth. My husband never knew which woman would be in bed with him,  Bald lady, the redhead or the blonde !  Hahaha..I used to order from the  TLC  Catalog.  I never bought expensive wigs  the most I paid was $50 and they looked better than the most expensive ones.  On hot days I would wear a cap on my head and velcro bangs to the cap and throw a scarf over it.  You can order just bangs through TLC.  I think of you ladies often even though I am not here as often.  This September 29th, it will be my 5 year mark..BC Mets to my lung..Keep fighting ladies,  dont EVER  give up...Kick this cancer in the butt !!
