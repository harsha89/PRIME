Join a group of women here having surgery the same month as you, the support is tremendous.  It gets better once you get a treatment plan in place.  I'm 17 months post BMX (bi-lateral mastectomy) and doing great.  BTW I opted out of reconstruction.  Welcome to BCO, sorry you're here but glad you found us.  Good luck and {{hugs}}",

Surgeon took two nodes from each side and pathology found micromets in one node. Oncologist recommended chemo and I agreed so we didn't do the oncotype test. Onc said no radiation so I didn't have to decide about that. Did six rounds of TC chemo (taxotere and Cytoxan), five years of tamoxifen (was in peri-menopause when dx), then switched to anastrozole (now in full menopause) and will do five years of that. Three down, two to go, and so far so good (knock on wood). Best wishes and gentle ((hugs)).",

Reichert (R-WA), and co-leads Rep. Lance (R-NJ), Rep. Blumenauer (D-OR), and Rep. Braley (D-IA). You can read a very moving press release http://reichert.house.gov/press-release/reichert-introduces-critical-legislation-improve-healthcare-lymphedema-patients that includes quotes from each of these members of Congress. This introduction brings us to a new starting line. Now we need your help asking all members of Congress to support this bill!  Please take 5 minutes to send a letter to your Representative, asking him/her to cosponsor this bill, by using the submission form http://www.capwiz.com/lymphedematreatmentact/home/ on our website. A brief template letter is provided, but please make your letter even more effective by adding one personalized paragraph reflecting your own perspective and experiences. Now it\u2019s your turn to make a difference! Even if your Representative cosponsored the LTA in the 112th Congress, he or she must do so again because bills and cosponsors do not carry over from one Congress to the next. I contacted my fed rep last year, it was easy and I did receive a reply.  Going to do it again this year.  Hope you will too.  Thanks in advance!  ♥",

I asked my onc about the remaining tissue and he said the risk is minimal in my case.  So I decided to leave well enough alone.  I don't want more surgery, and I don't want to aggravate a mild case of truncal lymphedema.  My scars are fading and may one day be just white lines.  Obviously, I'm not happy about losing my breasts but am at peace.  Best wishes!  ♥",

I drank a lot of weak tea with milk & honey (could do honey & lemon) and always kept saltines on-hand.

My dx is similar to yours - digital mammo at age 50 picked up an area of concern that turned out to be IDC. Had bilateral mastectomy due to family history. Sentinel node biopsy found micromets in one of four nodes so opted for chemo. Didn't need rads and opted out of reconstruction. Did five years of tamoxifen and now on anastrozole. So far so good. You've gotten some great advice so I'll add one thing, exercise. I started a walking program after surgery with a slow shuffle to the mailbox and back. Kept track of my steps/distance and have now logged more than 6,000 miles walked (see signature line). Start slowly and build your strength. Listen to your body and your doc. You've had nodes removed so please check out this excellent thread about safe exercise for those with or at-risk for lymphedema. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/58/topics/801453?page=1 My 'home thread' is the Let's Post Our Daily Exercise in the Fitness forum.

While many women choose reconstruction, I did not.  I was advised as such by my mom, who is a long-term BC survivor, and her opinion coincided with my inclinations.  Also this website really helped me http://www.breastfree.org/  You're kind of stuck fashion-wise until you get the drains out. I used one of those post-mx camis with the drain pockets but also wore oversized flannel shirts (it was winter) and hung the drains around my neck with a loop of white ribbon. Healing comes first then assess your options. I'm sorry about the scars.  Mine are considerable but fading somewhat.  Maybe I'm accustomed to them after almost two years.  My husband's been great.  He's cried with me but says what's important is that I'm OK.  I'm not sure if he's used to it yet but we're still happily married if you know what I mean. Once you heal, there are lots of pretty camis and silk feels nice against your skin. Best wishes!!",

BTW, if you can afford a small indulgence, get a satin pillowcase.  It'll feel good and won't pull or tug on yr tiny hairs.  Best wishes!  ♥",

I had 6 infusions of TC every three weeks on a Tuesday.  Got zofran anti-nausea as a pre-med.  Had compazine pills that I took every six hours (4 pm, 10 pm, 4 am, and 10 am) for four days: Tues when I got home thru Fri night.  Figured if I stopped Sat. morning, I'd have the weekend to veg out and recover.  If memory serves, by Sun. I had turned the corner to feeling better.  Felt OK the next week and felt good the week after that.  By week 3, it was time for another infusion.  Hang in there!  ♥",

The chest sensitivity is what I notice the most these days.  I am going flat, no recon no foobies.  Bought some silk camis 3 for $20 from an outlet store to wear under my work clothes.  The silk feels great against my skin and also glides over incisions/drain holes that are still healing.  Found some without darts or seams to rub.  Only PITA (pain in the *ss) with silk is the hand-wash, dry flat instruction so I'm going to shop for some machine-washable camis this weekend. I don't know about you but I pretty much babied myself the first 2 weeks then went back to work - I felt pretty good too - so am pushing myself more and feeling the consequences.  Maybe same for you?  Hope you get some relief soon!  {{hugs}}",

      "Content": "Jan 11, 2014 06:17AM badger wrote: MinusTwo, and here I thought vet meds were cheaper than people pills.  Guess not always the case. Warrior_Woman, I did six rounds of TC chemo (taxotere & cytoxan).  I didn't use most of what I'd packed in my chemo bag.  I did use facial tissues (they supplied them but I wanted the kind with lotion), an extra large plastic cup for ice water (which they supplied), a paperback book, and snacks (trail mix, to which I now have an aversion).  I got advice from another ca pt to not bring any food that I loved with me to tx because I'd associate it with chemo and not love it anymore.  I hardly ever eat at McDonalds but I'd hit the drive-through on my way back home (yes I drove myself) for a QP with cheese and wolf it down in the car.  So I've had six in my life and have no desire for another. The clinic where I had chemo used a warmed towel to bring up the veins for better access.  They also had warmed blankets which was so nice since I was chilly from guzzling cold water and sucking on ice cubes to protect my mouth.  You will be there for several hours and get a lot of fluids so if you're like me, you'll need to pee several times while you're there.  They unplug the infusion machine (it has battery power) and you take the pole to the bathroom.  Wear pants that you can pull down & back up with one hand in case the cannula is in your hand, sweats or PJ bottoms with an elastic waistband are good.  The night before an infusion, I took a stool softener.  Took one when I got home from tx too.  Chemo can turn your poo into concrete so I wanted a pre-emptive strike.   The first time is the scariest because you don't know what to expect.  Wishing you good luck, smooth sailing, and few SE's!  ♥ ",

I opted out of reconstruction and don't wear prosthetics. Going flat isn't for everyone but it works for me. After all this time, I'm no longer self-conscious. I wear pretty much what I want (I do avoid clothes with bust darts) and no one really notices. Tip: bring a small pillow to use in the car to cushion your chest from the seat belt.

There were two nurses and a doc (a radiologist).  One nurse helped the doc and the other helped me.  If I said ouch, she told the doc and he gave me more lidocaine.  The procedure was kind of noisy but didn't hurt because of the numbing shots.  I had three locations sampled so was there a while.  They gave me cooling gel packs to wear in my bra on the way home.  I did ice down once home.  Good luck and best wishes for B9 results!  ((hugs))",

Ask whomever drives you home from the hospital to bring a small pillow to put between you and the seatbelt. I had BMX no recon on a Tues and was discharged Thurs with two drains. Got them out the next Monday. TIP: make sure the doc opens the caps on the suction bulbs before s/he pulls out the tubing. I took two weeks off work but my hubby didn't (couldn't). Was fine at home alone. Rested most of the time in a recliner we splurged on that worked via power button instead of pull-lever arm. We still have it, so it turned out to be a good investment. Needed a ride to work for another two months as couldn't drive comfortably yet. It's amazing how many motions require chest muscles. Sometimes you just have to ask for help. I remember not being able to reach something on the top shelf at the grocery store and having to ask some kid to get it for me. TIP: have a list of chores ready and when people ask what they can do, pull out your list and ask if they can do one or two things. That way you get some help and they don't feel overwhelmed. Best wishes and gentle ((hugs)).",

They gave me cooling gel packs to wear inside my bra on the way home.  Once home, I wrapped frozen peas in a washcloth and placed that on my chest.  I was sore for a couple of days and had some bruising but that was almost 2 years ago so I'm fuzzy on any more details.  They did leave a tiny metal 'clip' as a marker inside my breasts at the places where tissue samples were taken.  I remember calling it my internal bling. I would let them know right up-front about your IBS. What day is your procedure?  {{hugs}}",

Just want to say remember you are healing on the inside so take it very easy on yourself. IDK if this is accurate, but the way I thought of it was that the inside (the stuff I couldn't see) was healing apace with the outside (the stuff I could see).  If you're like me, your chest may be hyper-sensitive for a while.  What helped me was to gently place my hands on my chest.  The touch and the very light pressure relieved a lot of that prickly feeling.  That subsided after a few weeks. Could not wear anything but natural fabrics against my skin for a few months so bought some silk camis at Winter Silks outlet for not a lot, and wore them under everything.  All-cotton was good too but no polyester or synthethics at all. Glad you're OK - gentle {{hugs}}",

Had an initial goal of 100 miles. Counted down from 100 instead of up from zero as it helped more to see 99.9 than .1 LOL. Started counting up once I hit my goal. Have now logged thousands of miles walked. See signature line, which is where I keep track. I did well with that program but recently joined a gym to add more weight-bearing exercise as an alternative to bone-building drugs. Wishing you well and sending gentle ((hugs)).",

My DH saw my mastectomy scars right from the start so that's a non-issue for him.  He said my breasts were beautiful and he enjoyed them while I had them, but it's OK that they're gone and I'm flat because what he wants is me. Truth be told, I enjoy our sex life better now.  Before BMX, he couldn't keep his hands off my breasts.  Frankly, it got to be annoying at times.  Now the only 'cleavage' I have is my fanny, which I walk to keep firm.  He likes it, as evidenced by the number of times he grabbs my *ss.  But I find that less intrusive and more pleasurable, because it's getting firmer as I get fitter. It's been over two years since BMX and I'm all healed up and scars are fading.  I go flat all the time so I'm adjusted to my now body and no longer self-conscious.  Sometimes DH forgets himself in bed and reaches for my breasts and comes up empty-handed.  Then he remembers and his hands wander elsewhere.  ",

Rearrange your living quarters so what you need is at or below shoulder height - toothbrush, coffee pot, etc. RE: toileting, I couldn't reach back to wipe from behind but could reach forward through my legs. Wipe from front to back. Don't wipe from back to front, to avoid cross-contamination. We have a hand-held shower so I could hose off my nether parts as long as I kept drains pinned up and incisions dry. A squeeze bottle is a great idea! I know people who recommend rectal wipes but I worried about flushing them. If the need arose, I used a washcloth. Did a weekly load of laundry with bleach anyway so no big deal to add a few small items. Best wishes and ((gentle hugs)).",
