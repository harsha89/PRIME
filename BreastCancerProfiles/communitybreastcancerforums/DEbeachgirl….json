As far as side effects w Gemzar; I've been tired and had a slight fever after. I also had my white count be low last time and felt pretty bad. But overall not as bad as ACT by a long shot.",

My main problem is that my part, I had really long hair that I cut shoulder length before this so I have a middle part, is thinned a lot and around the front of my head has some small bald patches. If I wear a wide headband or bandana you can't tell there is hair loss at all. I'm hoping that I can maintain this amount of hair as I've seen some people on this thread say they've had hair loss in the beginning and then it stopped and started growing back. I can deal with that. I'm not holding my breath though. I'm still getting a wig and I appreciate your suggestion. I need a wig for my part time job if I lose all of my hair. I DJ weddings. As far as SE's this time; I haven't been getting the decodrone bc I had a bad reaction to it back when I was on Gemzar. I felt like I had 4 tequila shots for about 45 minutes. It was super scary. So they weren't suppose to give it to me. Well I wasn't paying attention Monday and she gave me the Dec. I didn't have any problem with it and I actually felt better then afterward then the last 3 infusions so we're thinking that the one that made me dizzy was given too fast. My appetite is still down but I haven't had the bad nausea w almost vomiting that I've been having off and on for the past 6 weeks. (knock on wood). I haven't had to have neupogen. Is that fairly normal? I'm still on oxygen but I'm better every day and I can be off of it for short periods. I'm doing exercises with a Spirometer and have been improving with that each day. One suggestion I have for the ladies with constipation; I have added a lot of veggies and black beans to my diet. I have a salad for dinner every night with snap peas, avocado, good dark leaf lettuce and spinach, tomatoes, carrots, peppers, etc. I also drink pure organic juices. I don't have a juicer so I get Bolthouse Farms juice smoothies. They are in the produce section. I love the berry, mango, and green juice (it's ugly but it tastes like fruit). They also have single size flavors that are yummy too. I try to drink at least one serving of them a day. If I do get constipated I use Benefiber chewables for a few days. They taste good and they work if you aren't too constipated. You can also just take them every day if you need to.",

I had really bad nausea that Zofran didn't do anything for the first 3 cycles. They changed to compazine and that seems to help. I haven't had any foot issues. I already had a little neuropathy in my left foot from Gemzar but with the warmer weather it is mostly in my little toe and I'm mostly barefoot which helps. I did have significant hair thinning after my first and second cycle. I lost about half my hair. fortunately it was very thick. Unfortunately the worst hair loss was around my face and part. I can disguise it with a wide fabric headband. After the third cycle hair loss slowed down and I'm not losing hardly anything. I did get my long hair cut bc it was all over everything. It's chin length now. Which sucks for me bc I hate short hair on me but I have hair so.... I am also using Nioxin shampoo, conditioner and treatment. It seems to be helping some and I do have some \"sprouts\" filling in at the front of my head so I do go to treatment sometimes w/o the headband bc I don't want to wear them (I got a dozen for cheap on amazon) all the time in case it restricts some hair regrowth!!! My tumor markers have gone down 200 points since starting Eribilin too,",
