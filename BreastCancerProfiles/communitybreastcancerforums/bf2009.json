She said she tried for 4 hours to get a real live person at my insurance ( I have blue cross) and was unable. That the office was shorthanded and she was not able to do her work due to \"this thing with having to get your pre-cert for your MRI\" and even tried to tell me that my insurance did not require it WHEN THEY TOLD ME THEY DID and I was 100% sure. I got soooooooooooooooooooo mad. How incompetant can she be? Is she new or something? She not only called once, but twice and even a third time. I had to call my insurance FOR HER, the MA at the surgeons office and tell my insurance to call her. My surgeon needs to get rid of that M.A. That she called me whining about all her problems is a very bad thing. Sure did make me mad. I'm going to call my insurance in the morning to make sure that incompetant faxed that stuff to her. I wanted to drive to the surgeons and ask them what kind of show they ran to have the M.A. call me to cry she can't or doesn't know how to do her job... and WHINE TO ME about it. I asked to speak to her supervisor and she said there was none but sure going to mention it to the surgeon when I go back how she called me to whine she can't do her job, the office is short staffed and to tell me my MRI did not need pre-cert. She must have mistook me for an idiot or something !!!",

I had to explain it to him about 5 times and still not sure if he understands how important that test will be ( lymph node bopsy). He also is trying to be very optimistic and its just making me mad. If there is no sign of mets I can be more optimisitic although I have triple negative which means a high chance for mets within the first 3 years and to put it bluntly, my husband sometimes aggrivates me really bad as he is wanting to give hope before all the tests are in and being so pollyanna postive I'll be fine and the fact is, I may not be. I wish they would just hurry up and do that biopsy. Sometimes I feel everything is so rushed and I'm overloaded with all this info... and at other times I feel inpatient waiting for some bit of info or for a test to be sceduled. This is just too much information coming my way right now with all the beginnings of chemo and if it weren't for the Xanax the doctor gave me.... I would be insane by now... my mind is just racing trying to remember what I'm supoosed to be doing, what to bring, who I'm supposed to be talking to... etc etc. I guess I'm saying... I feel overwelmed ! Grrrrrr.",
