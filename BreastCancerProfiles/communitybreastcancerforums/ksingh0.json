I still ice as it seems to help the pain and keep them better longer.  I also soak my fingers in hydrogen peroxide to keep them from getting infected.  On the really high lifted ones I will sometimes but neosporin (sp?) underneath to keep them from getting infected.  Someone suggested tea tree oil but I hate the smell.  My toes are a nightmare and they look so yucky.  I love flip flops and sandals so I need to find some summer shoes that don't show off the toes.  =) ",

I kept draining.  I would get down to 50ml in 4 hours then it would go back up again.  When they did the next talc it was in my hospital room.  It did hurt a bit but not for long and they gave me some morphine.  My legs and ankles swelled too.  I went on a diuretic.   I hope your stay is much shorter than mine!!!  It is nice to be in your oown bed. =) and hugs, Kelly ",

I hope that the treatments knock the cancer back down.  As for the financial stuff - I couldn't work with my treatments and I don't regret it.  The time with my family and friends has been great but I have been very blessed with good benefits from work so I haven't had to worry as much as I could have... ",

The eye doc spoke like he evaluated many women on BC chemo treatments for blocked tear ducts.  Luckily, I had a quick surgery for the stints (under twilight sleep, not fully out). Feel free to PM me if you want more info. ",

If I tell him my QOL is not what I want it to be then he will of course stop any treatment and start a new one.  He is a strong believer in constant treatment.  But as I said before I think there are different views on that and not sure that either way is right or wrong.  I know that my current onc has a reputation for being very aggressive in particular with Stage 4.  This is why I chose him when I switched. I think you should have a long discussion with your onc on May 9th.  Or ask to talk to them beforehand if it helps.  If it is making you this stressed and anxious I would question, question, question them until you feel comfortable.  As you said in your post it is your life not theirs.   There is also nothing wrong with getting a second opinion from another onc.  Good luck and (((hugs))) sent your way. ",
