Worst birthday ever for me but I'm going to get thru this. I have 3 girls and I need to show them I can fight this. Had my bone scan and Cat Scan today so hopefully all goes well.  I got 2 different opinions on my chemo regimen from 2 big centers (CMF dose dense every 2 weeks for 4 months vs TC every 3 weeks for 3 months, followed by radiation and 5yr Tamox) So confused so I am going for a 3rd opinion on Thursday and will finalize my decision of which regimen I will do and hopefully start in the following week.  The MO that offered me CMF said I wouldn't lose my hair, may just get thin. Any one doing CMF and is it true about minimal hair loss?",
