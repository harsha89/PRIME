Lives with husband and our 9 yr old daughter. Dx on Sept 5 - the next day after celebrating my husband's birthday. I did my mammogram in 2011. Results normal. April this year, they sent me a reminder that my 2 yr mammogram appointment is due. I worked 50-60 hours all year round. Finally went to my OB appointment after all summer travels in late Aug. My OB (whom I met first day cos we moved) recommended ultrasound right away. That was the Friday before Labor Day. That weekend was a torture as I was scheduled for biopsy the Tue after Labor Day. Everything was an unknown and possibility that few days. The breast specialist called me at work and gave me the dx that 9/5 morning. I was pretty calm. Called my husband, informed my boss. Then I left cos I was so blessed that I got an appointment with my surgeon right away the same afternoon. She turned out to be my anchor the past few weeks. I had my MX surgery on 9/19. Drain out on 9/27. Lucky to have the best surgeon in the group. She also recommended me to her 'partner in crime' - one of the very best and experience MO to meet us - both before and after my surgery. I was told my IDC 1.8 cm plus other 0.3cm DCIS in my right breast after biopsy. That's when I decided mastectomy right away. My final pathology report said 2.6cm of my IDC, therefore put me in stage 2. No lymph node is a plus that made me Stage 2A. My MO recommended to check my Oncotype while waiting my incision to heal. I most likely to go through chemo - the insurance policy my MO referred to. Radiology therapy may not be needed she said. A quick recap of what a roller coaster ride I had the past weeks (I never rode roller coasters in my life....what an irony! I hate speed and height)! Like Kiko and many of us - I was in total shock! I stick to this website during the past weeks as I found many others were too scary and not relevant to me. With this, I am truly thankful to all of your encouragements, prayers and caring thoughts. Sometimes I felt I couldn't even share all my feelings with my best friends, however, I didn't even have to say a word when I hopped in here. I am a Catholic and never go to Church often due to heavy work. One year ago, I felt my life was not heading the right directions - never see my family, just work work work all the time...I started praying and bible reading diligently. I asked God for change. When I got my dx, I took off work immediately and all of a sudden, everything I asked God was gradually granted and realized - I could pick up my daughter from school, seeing her both weekends (rarely happened the past decade), spent as much time I love with my family. How beautiful is that! Of course I had my down time....but I just leave everything to God. He is really watching us. I am really blessed. I am a very strong will person. I figured He must have to send me this strong pathology report to remind me - time to head a different direction and hold a different perspective in life....... To all of us, take a deep breathe, say our prayers and leave it to God. His plans are amazing and are beyond any of our comprehensions. Love, Jen",
