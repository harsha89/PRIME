      "Content": "Sep 14, 2014 07:49PM - edited Sep 14, 2014 07:55PM by ganzgirl2010 I was dx'd with ilc in july. Last year I was dx'd with lcis. I was adamant last year about having a bmx but all the doc's said it was unneccesary. I had a gut feeling and they wouldnt listen to me. I have read a lot (well, the very little that's available) about ilc. It is known as the \"sneaky cancer\" because it does NOT form a lump rather it forms in a single file pattern. Which is why it is not found during self exam or doc exam most times. It a lot of times isn't picked up on mammo either. Mine didn't even show up on US..it was found on mri. And the only reason I was having the mri's is because of the lcis dx last year. Unfortunately there is not a lot of info out there about ilc because it only represents 10% of breast cancer cases. These doc's really need to do ALOT more research and studies on ilc/lcis because it seems to me that they mistreat it, atleast that's how I feel about my cancer. Even tho I had a bmx, I still worry ALOT about it coming back or mets. Ilc is also known to mestastisize within 3 years by means of the uteris and gi tract. Is it just me, or does anyone else worry ALOT ? I mean, on my mri guided biopsy in June, they said my cancer was 5 cm. But after bmx they said it was only .15cm's. That's a big difference !! Sometimes I get angry about all this because if they  got it right when they did the bx I could've avoided the bmx and just had lumpectomy. Yes, I know I said I wanted a bmx last year but when it came down to it this year, I was horrified at the thought of a bmx, now it wasn't my choice anymore. Im having a really hard time with not having my 34d's that Ive had since I was 15 years old ! Everytime I take a shower I cry when I look down. I have TE's but it's seeing the scars, the disfigurement that comes along with the TE's. Not to mentio the pain and constant discomfort. It's kind of hard to see the light at the end of this tunnel because its so far away. Sorry if I am mumbling here..just had an exhausting weekend emotionally. Thanks for listening ladies :/",

I was (and sometimes still ) a mess. I had myself buried when I was dx'd this past July. But..having had the surgery very recently and now Im at the the next stage of treatment, the fun part..recon, which involves getting bi weekly fills of saline until my skin is stretched to the size I want to be. Then exchange time :) It does get better ladies I PROMISE. Ask anyone on the august sisters thread, I was absolutely miserable from the pain and anxiety but I finally turned the corner over the last 5 or 6 days ! And it will all work out for you too ! Trying to stay positive is the best advice I can give. Im not saying it's easy. The surgical pathology report is what will decide your next step as far as treatment. As someone above said ILC is  \"sneaky\" cancer, it rarely shows up on mammo or u/s and sometimes it doesnt even show up on mri's ! ILC forms in a line not a lump like IDC. Think about a line you would draw with a pencil..thats what ILC looks like when it forma. ILC represents only 10% of BC cases so there isn't a whole lot of info on it.   Again..so sorry you find yourself here but you are in good hands ! This site has been a life saver for me thru this journey :)",

All great news..so, OFFICIALLY no chemo, no radiation and tumor was much smaller than they thought (it was the lcis that was 5.2cm, the invasive cancer was only .15cm !) SO the plan is Tamox, even tho they said in the beginning I was not a good candidate for it ??...but I will go with that. My MO also said having my  ovaries out was a good idea..so now Im trying to find a gyno . This is the best news we have heard all year ! But of course, the cancer stills makes you think crazy things persistently. I cant help but worry about mets down the line. Normal thoughts right ? My pain from the MX is getting better everyday..got the ok to drive but WOW was it painful..I dont think Im ready for that  yet. I go see my PS next week...hopefully for the first post op fill...lets get this show on the road !   Hope everyone is doing ok and keep your chins up...we will make it thru this, not matter what our treatments may be :)",

I feel kind of funny writing a post here because it seems like everyone here has had chemo and/or rads. My story ? Going into my bmx this past august, chemo was in my future. After surgery the path report showed my cancer was smaller than the doc's originally thought so I didn't have to have chemo or rads. My onc started me on Tamox in March. That was a nightmare, the hot flashes were unbearable ! So she switched me to arimidex. Hot flashes and not really anything to speak of thank goodness but the bone and joint pain is horrible. My hips, shoulders, back  and legs constantly hurt. Sleeping is next to impossible. My onc prescribed Percocet so I take one 5mg at bedtime and usually one during the day along with motrin. She also ordered an mri or my left shoulder, which hurts way more than the right (but that hurts pretty bad too). The mri showed that I have arthritis now in that shoulder so now she wants me to see a shoulder surgeon. Apparently it showed the humorous bone is extremely worn down. I am 42 years old and never really had any kind of pain other than an occasional backache. Then there was breast cancer. What the hell is happening to my body ? That's a rhetorical question...Im so frustrated because my quality of life is zilch ! I work as a waitress and cant work because of all this chronic pain. Does it ever get better ?? I see that a lot of the ladies here are using Benadryl, clariton and some others. My question is...how well do these meds work ? I am desperate. I so badly want to go back to work but I need some kind of relief..",

My bs says I don't need radiation and doubts I need chemo, but of course MO will decide that. When I met with bs, ps and mo preop, I was told they would do the onco test..now this morning when the bs called she said they didn't do it ! Im pissed about that..it makes me feel like just a number. Of course I don't want chemo but last year I was dx'd with lcis, had lumpectomy with NO further treatment, look where I am now ! I cant take tamox because of clot risk and the fact the I am a smoker (trying to quit). I don't want to be sitting in this position a year from now because they didn't do anything else. Bs said my tumor was smaller than originally thought 1.8mm. How does it go from 5cm's to 1.8mm's ??? All I do is worry about this..to the point where it consumes me. Another, when the bs first called with results (last Thursday) she said they found ALH in the opposite breast so I confirmed that this am when I was talking to MY bs..she said \"no it was LCIS\" so I said..precancer? she said no it is not precancer ! WTH ??  Last year I was told that LCIS is precancer. I am going to one of the the best cancer centers in boston (dana farber)...but I just don't trust them",
