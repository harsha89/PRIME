Due to the location of my tumor (very close to the chest wall), an excisional biopsy was the only to remove a sample. It was done on an out patient basis and I went back to work in a couple of days (I also had an office job that didn't require lifting). After receiving my bc diagnosis, I went back in the next week for a lumpectomy to remove the rest of the tissue and get clean margins. A sentinal node biopsy was also performed at this time. I didn't have any drains for either procedure. These procedures were also done as an out patient and I went back to work a week later. Good luck with your biopsy. I'll keep my fingers crossed for B9 results! Let us know.",

I was dx'd with high grade DCIS last year and opted for a lumpectomy & rads because I felt it was the right choice for me. Unfortunately my tissue didn't react well to rads and I ended up needing a mast after all. After much soul-searching, I chose to do a uni-lateral mast with ped tram flap recon and a lift on the other side. I just wasn't ready to remove my non-bc breast. I may have to face that in the future, but figured I'll cross that bridge if I come to it. In the meantime, I'm happy I kept my breast. Good luck with your decision. You will do what's right for you.

My surgery was 4/2 and it seems like everytime I think I'm getting close to cutting out the paid meds, I have a painful day. Guess I'll just quit worrying about being on them for so long and just take them until I feel better. Getting the drains out makes a big difference in how you feel.

You will be comfortable on your sofa recliner but will need help getting in and out of it. Lots of women have reported sleeping in their regular bed comfortably by using pillows for support. You will need to stay in a bent position for quite some time. Your stomach will be very tight following the tram.

If your husband has previous good experience with a PS, you should go talk to him. You will spend a lot of time with the doctor you choose and you really need to feel comfortable with them and their staff. The first time I saw my PS I went in convinced I wanted a bi-lateral and she spent a lot of time explaining all the pros and cons of the surgery to me. She also gave me the name of another PS to see because he was the only one in town who does free flaps. She does pedicled trams and doesn't advise bi-lateral peds due to the muscle loss. She would do it for me if I insisted, but she spent lots of time explaining everything to me. In the end I opted for a unilateral mast with the ped tram performed by her. I'm 2 1/2 weeks out from surgery and don't regret my decision. I will eventually have a lift on the other side and she feels like I'll have good results. Yes, there's still a little worry about reccurance, but I'll cross that bridge if I get to it. I don't know how fast other doctors are, but my PS took 6 hours to do the recon. It may have taken longer because she was working with radiated skin, I'm not sure. So far everything looks good and I don't feel like scars are going to be an issue. We haven't really discussed follow-up stuff like scars or lipo but we did spend a lot of time talking about what size I wanted my recon to be and how to get a good match to the other side. I think your PS is very wrong in saying this is not cosmetic surgery. I feel like that's exactly what it is. The mastectomy is what removes the cancer and saves your life, the recon is what makes you feel whole again and any PS who doesn't understand that probably shouldn't be dealing with bc patients. Sorry for going on so long. I just hate to hear that you feel uncomfortable and rushed. Remember that waiting a month or two to make a decision you're comfortable with will most likely not make a difference in your outcome. Your dx sounds a lot like mine. . .high grade DCIS. What I learned after rushing through surgeries last year was that the cancer had more than likely been in my breast for a long time before being detected and although it was aggressive in nature, it wasn't going to change that much in just a month or two. Unfortunately fear causes us to rush through a lot of the decision process. All I'm saying is to take your time to feel comfortable with your decision. Good luck. Hugs.",

So sometimes it just got the best of me and I let myself go to that \"why me, why can't I have my life back\" place (not a real good place to visit). Anyway, it does ease up although I think we're all going to have blue days thanks to this lousy disease but hopefully they'll get farther and farther apart. Hope you feel like going to your grandson's graduation. . .I don't know about you but it definitely makes me feel better to get out of the house. It's interesting to read how differently the PS's are handling your recon. Of course that's what I've found with all the procedures for bc. . .every doctor has their own way of handling it. I've read stories where some women get their other breast augmented at the same time as their mast & recon, but my PS wants to wait a few months until she feels the new one has stopped swelling and has settled into place. It makes sense that it will give her the chance to do a better match, but it sure sucks being lopsided. Now that I'm dealing with this wound, she won't do anything else until it is healed. I'm just hoping it doesn't take months to heal like so many I've read about (it's already been 6 weeks). I hope things continue to go well for both of you. Tina - I may check out those camisoles. I was just trying to spend as little as possible on stuff I won't use after this is all over, but if insurance will pay for it that would be nice. Do you think it would be really hot during the summer? Your story about Target was funny. . .boy do we learn our lessons the hard way! Good thing the attendant was so helpful. Kathy, if you get the shirt big enough or stretchy enough it doesn't involve raising your arms much above your shoulders. But I think you're wise to wait until after the drains are removed. You will be able to move your arms without pain alot more when they're gone. And then putting a shirt over your head can be a reward for putting up with drains for 4 freaking weeks! Take care",

Angel - I had the dye injections without numbing and I didn't think they were too bad. A little uncomfortable, but doable. Of course, I think it's one of those things were the person doing it can make a big difference in the pain incurred. Good luck tomorrow. I have to be at the hospital at 5:30 for 7:30 surgery. Got my alarm set for 4:15, but I doubt that I'll get much sleep tonight. My daughters and grandson spent the evening with us and I was doing really well until they hugged me when they were leaving. . .now I can't seem to get it back together. Good thing my husband is asleep and I can have this alone time. Think I'll fix myself a cup of calming tea before my 12:00 cutoff. I'm scheduled to be in the hospital until Saturday and I don't know how quickly I'll get to my pc when I get home, so I just want to say good luck to everyone. I'll be thinking of you. Hugs",

I'd read so many posts of drain removal being a piece of cake, it really took me by surprise to have it hurt so bad. The top one wasn't as bad as the bottom one and she said that's because it was round and the bottom one was flat. . .the bottom one brought me off the table. In the end, it is over in a matter of minutes and I feel sooo much better having them gone! On Wed I developed a lot of swelling in my legs and feet. So yesterday she sent me over the hospital for an U/S to rule out blood clots. Everything is fine and the swelling is beginning to go down. I was completely worn out by the time I got home and spent most of today in bed. Everyday is getting better. Take care everyone.",

I hope chemo goes well for you. I have been fortunate in not having it as part of my treatment, but it seems lots of women get through it very well. Keeping my fingers crossed that you get to take your trip. It helps so much to have something positive to look forward to while we go through this crap. My daughter is getting married next March and working on wedding plans definitely takes my mind off my own health. Take care",

My PS told me 3-4 months because she wants to be sure the recon side has completely settled and is no longer swelling before attempting a match. I bought a couple of those bras at Wal-Mart. They are basically the same style as the ones I bought from Penney's except the ones from Penney's are nylon. I like the cotton better and the price is a whole lot better. Then I had a visit with the PS today and she told me to stay out of bras except when necessary. Contrary to what the BS said about needing the support, the PS says I don't need the support and she feels the bra restricts the blood flow to the flap. Since the PS is the expert when it comes to the flap, I'm going with what she tells me. Plus I'm so thankful to not be sleeping in a bra again! The camisole sounds comfy, but since I'm very lopsided right now, I need a bra to hold the enhancer I'm using to fill out my natural side. . .can't wait to get that lift done. I'm finally able to get things over my head too. Isn't it great! I was so sick of wearing the same thing over and over.",

In fact, this morning while I was driving to the PS office, I ended up in tears. It just sort of crept up on me and before I knew it I was crying. . .I don't fight it anymore, it's best to just let it go. It did piss me off though that I messed up my make up since it takes me an eternity to get ready to go anywhere these days. I haven't had a major meltdown for several weeks now though. . .just little spurts of tears like this morning. So maybe it's not due to the meds at all, maybe it's just our brains catching up with everything we've been through. A good cry is probably just what you need. I'm thinking your drains must be soooo uncomfortable where they're placed. The one for my breast was under my arm, but just to the side of my breast. The other one was just above the pubic area. The scars aren't too bad, just the size of the drain hole. I had similar scars from my laproscopic gall bladder surgery and they faded really well. Too bad your outing had to turn into a good ole southern sermon. Being from Kentucky originally, I've set through a few of those myself!",

The first week was pretty rough and I was in the hospital 4 days of it. Be prepared to feel pretty much like you've been hit by a truck. I saw the PS after one week and she removed the drains. That definitely went a long way in making me feel better. I think just not looking at that gunk makes you feel better. This past week I've just been feeling better every day. I am now only taking pain meds at night to sleep and using tylenol during the day. I'm very close to standing up straight also. I saw the PS today and she said everything looks good. I'm still very swollen and she says that will take at least a month to go down. I don't have to go back to her for 2 more weeks now. It sounds like you've got things in order at home. I didn't use a walker so I'm not sure you'll really need that, plus I was limited in using the arm on my surgical side (not sure I could've even managed a walker). The one thing you might want to consider is your sleeping arrangements. I have an adjustable bed so it hasn't been an issue, but a lot of women either use a recliner or rent a hospital bed. You definitely need to be in a bent position for a while (I still cannot lie flat). You may also want to consider moving things you use a lot down to counter height as it's difficult to reach up when you first get home. I also only had my right side done and I can now reach pretty well with my left arm. Just remember to rest a lot and let hubby take care of you. Good luck.",

I am 3 weeks out from surgery and was feeling pretty good until today. I didn't sleep well last night and just felt like crap today. My recon breast started hurting quite a bit which worried me since I had been feeling so good. I'd even been off the pain pills for 2 days. Talked with my PS and she said it's normal and the new pain is just part of the healing process. She told me to quit being so hard on myself about the pain meds and just take them until the pain eases up. I've also developed a muscle spasm in my abdomen which she said is the result of probably doing too much while the muscle is trying to settle into it's new location (I had ped tram). So I'm with you, just going to try and relax and be good to myself. Take care.",

My PS gave me the go ahead to start stretching after a couple of weeks, but I had a tram. kes - Yes I have 2 chocolate labs. Brandy was a gift to my daughter on her 13th birthday and she will turn 8 next month. Luke was a rescue so we're not sure about his age but think he's about a year younger than Brandy.

I hate that you can't have a dog or cat. I also have fish which I love, but they're not really a replacement for a pet you can hold (or hug cuz I can't really hold my dogs). Maybe you should check into the hairless cats. I think people with allergies can have them. Take care all!",

I guess until it's all healed I'll just worry myself about losing the flap. Take care of yourself and keep us posted on how you're doing when you can. Hugs",

I can't wait for the swelling and bruising to go away so I can see what the end result will be. Then there's the poor, saggy girl on the other side that I will have to take care of eventually, but now I'm looking forward to that. My stomach is still swollen, but definitely flatter than when I went in last week. . .a real plus in my opinion! Oh well, sorry to drag on so long, I've just been away from my pc too long!

Rest and take care of yourself. kathy - I don't think a new PS will be concerned with matching the removed breast. In my case the PS created my new breast and will later do a lift and anything else that's needed on the other side to match it to the new breast. Right now I can't tell how close they're going to match because the new one is still very swollen. Also, don't you have the right have your file transferred to the new PS so they have all your pre-mast info? I've done that before when I changed PCPs, I would think it applies to all doctors. Good luck to the upcoming surgeries.",

It was a short trip to my daughter's house which is less than 5 minutes away, but still. . .I was out of the house on my own!! It felt wonderful! Have a follow-up visit with the PS tomorrow and am anxious to hear what she says about the oozing from my breast incision. She said it would happen, but it seems to be opening up more. I hope it's not as bad as I think it is (I always tend to think the worst and have no experience with what is normal here). Keep your fingers crossed.

As far as bras, I purchased a sports bra at Penney's that zips in the front so it's easy to get on and off but I've found it to just be too tight. I had a flap and it's still very swollen. Someone on the boards mentioned Glamorize front hook bras from Penney's so I've ordered one of those (they are only available on line).

BTW, I wasn't especially brave or anything to do tram flap surgery. . .flap surgery was the only option I had thanks to radiation. I didn't want to do lat flap, so tram was all I had left (no free flap or DIEP surgeons available in my area). I probably would've opted for a bilateral w/expanders if I'd had the choice. Wish I could wear the camisoles since a bra is still so uncomfortable, but I have to wear an enhancer on my other side to even things out and I don't think the little shelf in a cami would hold it (I may try it out though). Know what you mean about not spending a lot on stuff during this temporary period, but wearing the same thing over and over gets old too. I've purchased several bras trying to find a comfortable one -- a zip front sports bra from Penney's, a couple of front hook leisure bras from Penney's (have to be ordered) and a front hook sports bra from Wal-Mart. The one from Wal-Mart is the one I like the best and it was only $7, definitely a lot cheaper than the ones from Penney's! I've been working on ROM but it sure is tough to do when it hurts. Wonder if I should ask my PS about doing some PT just to get things going. Kathy -- I think I started putting things over my head about week 4. It's mostly tank tops and loose t-shirt because I don't think I could get anything fitted over my head even now. Try some things that are stretchy or a little loose fitting. I just put it over my head first and then get my surgery arm in before the other arm. This might not work for you since you have both arms impaired. With the change in weather, I needed something to wear besides the zip front hoodies and long sleeved shirts I had when I first had surgery. Plus t-shirts with a design on the front help to camoflauge my lopsideness. Good luck, hope you're able to get into some different things.",

I never started taking any other meds on a routine basis. I just take Motrin during the day when I feel the need for it, sometimes once a day and sometimes not at all. When I have trouble sleeping I take a Tylenol PM and it works like a charm. I have kept a supply of pain meds to use if I need them. I usually end up taking one on the day I see my PS and she does a lot of poking around and debriding my wound. I'm amazed you couldn't see the drain hole the next day. Now I wonder if they use different size tubes. Even though they closed quickly, both of mine left a scar. Hope you enjoyed getting out of the house and hope it made you feel better.

      "Content": "May 23, 2008 04:44PM - edited May 23, 2008 04:47PM by sam408 I had a lumpectomy and rads last year and developed a seroma a couple of months after completing rads. Since I also had a lot of contracture from the rads, my surgeon felt it was what caused the seroma too. She aspirated it a few times but it would fill back within a month and was quite painful. In the end my surgeon suggested that I proceed with a mastectomy to get rid of the tissue that wasn't healing properly. She felt, and I agreed, that I didn't have breast conserving surgery to end up with a painful, deformed breast. So I had unilateral mast with pedicled tram flap recon last month and so far things are going well. I'm 7 weeks out from surgery and the only problem I'm having is a small wound that my PS says is going to take a while to heal (thanks to the radiated skin) but she is confident it will heal. Good luck with your treatments. I personally couldn't deal with the constant pain and needle aspirations I was going through.",

I can't say now whether or not I'd have done things differently, but I do wish I'd slowed down a little and researched things more. I had no idea radiation would limit treatment options if I needed a mastectomy later (which I did). Does you doctor feel your surgery can't wait until after the wedding? I worry that you may not physically feel well in 4 weeks. Some people breeze through these surgeries and some do not, unfortunately we never know how it's going to turn out until afterward. As someone said earlier, you can use the time prior to the wedding to research, get second opinions, have other tests, etc.  I think there are lots of women who have waited longer than 4 weeks for their surgery and it hasn't affected their outcome. The waiting is horrendous, I know, but it may be in your best interest so you can be in good shape for the wedding. Good luck with the wedding. My daughter is getting married next March and I'm hoping to get my next surgery done this fall so I can be healed and ready. I'm currently healing from mast/tram on 4/2 and will be doing a lift on the other side in 3-4 months. Don't know if this has helped you any, good luck with your decision. It's a tough one and everyone makes it for their own reasons. Stay in touch and let us know how you're doing. Hugs",

She was the one who suggested mastectomy with recon when my breast became so disfigured after rads. She was very sensitive to the fact that I ended up with a pretty ugly boob and told me it didn't have to be that way. She did the mast and referred me to an excellent PS who did the immediate tram flap recon. Although I've still got some healing to do and maybe some more revision by the PS, I think I'm on my way to decent looking breasts (the PS just did a lift on the \"good\" breast). Anyway, I love my GS and am glad to have such a good relationship with her just in case I need any other surgeries. I agree with the others that you need to do what you feel comfortable with and if seeing a BS would put your mind at ease, then by all means do it. Good luck with your decision. Hugs to you",

But do take the stool softeners as long as you're on the pain meds. I didn't heed this advice and paid for it last week when the constipation became pretty much unbearable. The fact that I'm recovering from a tram and couldn't push made matters even worse. Anyway, here's a tip I got off the internet in the middle of the night when I was trying to get through this. Put your feet on a small stool in front of the toilet so that your knees are higher than your waist. Then lean forward and this puts your body in a squatting position which lines everything up and was the way our bodies were designed to eliminate. It worked! Stay on top of this bowel movement thing. You will be miserable if you don't. I definitely won't let myself get in that shape again.",

Since I was the first in our family to have bc, it was very difficult to tell my Mom, 3 sisters and 2 daughters, so I needed him to help me pass the news on to others who we felt needed to know. I think that helped him feel that he was helping me. . .does that make sense. Now that I've been through a year of treatment, he talks to everyone about it. An interesting thing about neighbors. . .the ones that live across the street from us have been there about 20 years but we're still just on a friendly-neighbor basis with them (you know, talk out in the yard when you see each other). It's still the original guy that bought the house, but a new wife of about 5 years. Anyway, last summer during one of our conversations my bc came up. Come to find out, his wife had bc in 2003. . .her tx was mast w/expanders & implants. It was all done during the winter when we rarely see each other and by the time summer rolled around, she never mentioned it. Now she's talked to me about it several times and we are able to offer support to each other. Had I not been open with them about my bc, odds are I may never have known about hers and now we're closer than we were plus the husbands seem to have a closer bond. So you never know what opening up to someone may bring.",

I had a unilateral tram flap and my PS didn't want me wearing anything that would constrict the breast because she feels it constricts the blood flow to the flap. As you read the experiences of different women, you'll find that most doctors have a certain way of doing things and it's not always the same as what another one does. But if your PS has a good track record, then I would follow whatever routine he sets up. I didn't wear any type of bra/camisole until about 4 weeks out and then began wearing front hook sports bras only. Wal-Mart sells a nice one that only costs $7. In the last couple of weeks I have graduated to regular bras, but they're still a little uncomfortable (I'm 12 weeks out). During the time I wasn't wearing a bra, I found that layering my tops camoflauged it nicely. I just wore t-shirts/tank tops with an unbuttoned blouse over them. As far as drains, you will have at least one ab drain if you have DIEP; some people have two. I had one breast drain and one ab drain. I pinned them to a lanyard that hung around my neck. That kept them in front of me when I was moving around and make it less likely to get them hung on something. The hospital provided me with a couple of the lanyards so I had an extra that I could get wet in the shower. When I made my first trip out of the house, I wore a loose fitting warm-up set and tucked them in the waistband of the pants. Luckily that was my first follow-up with the PS and she removed the drains that day (8 days post surgery). Again, I would ask your PS what post-surgery care he uses and go from there. It may save you from buying unnecessary items. Good luck with your surgery.",

I had a lumpectomy last Feb followed by rads in April & May. When I finished my rads I should've been able to put this behind me and move on. Unfortunately, I had a bad reaction to rads which resulted in having a mastectomy in April. There are definitely moments of anger and frustration along this journey, but just come here and vent. . .someone is always available to ease your burden. When I was at my PS's office this morning her nurse put it in perfect perspective. . .she said, \"My Mom always told be to be thankful I'm on the right side of the dirt.\" So I think that's where I'm going to put my thoughts.

My surgeon has drained it a couple of times and has determined it to be chronic because it fills up within a few weeks of being drained. Both my surgeon and rads onc feel the only way to correct the problem is to remove the tissue, so I have a mast w/ped tram flap scheduled for 4/2. Hopefully yours will clear up on its own, but I can't imagine not having it drained. Mine is very painful when it's full. Of course the aspiration is no cake walk either, so that's why I'm having it removed and hopefully will be able to move on. Good luck.",

They can do amazing things. When I first saw mine - long story short, rads really screwed up my breast tissue and I developed a chronic seroma and a badly contracted scar so ended up having a mast w/recon - she told me that if it wasn't for the fact that I had the seroma to deal with, she would probably be able to fix the contracted scar with fat injections (they lipo the fat from another area of your body and inject it into the breast). Keeping my fingers crossed you get B9 results today. BTW - We have a house on Nolin and love it down there. I assume you're on Cumberland since you're from Somerset.

I had no node involvement so did not need chemo. Over the last few weeks I developed a large collection of fluid at the surgical site and went to my surgeon to have it looked at because it was causing me a lot of pain. During her exam she found a lump in my other breast. She felt it may be fluid too but wanted to check it out further to be sure. In the end I went for an ultrasound yesterday to have both lumps looked at. They confirmed the one on the surgical breast was fluid and were able to aspirate it all off. Unfortunately the one on my other breast was not fluid and they did a core biopsy on the spot. I should have results tomorrow, but am not playing the waiting game as well as I did the last time. Last time I clung to those 80/20 odds and convinced myself that everything would be all right. After falling into the 20% side, I'm just not as optimistic this time. This thing just sucks and I'm angry that I didn't even get 6 months out of treatment before I'm staring it in the face again. I think I'm ready to kiss these girls goodbye and get a new pair. The bc breast looks like crap from the lumpectomy scar (tumor was very close to the chest wall, so scar is across the top of my breast) and the radiation caused the tissue to contract badly, so it is just very unattractive to look at.  Now with this new business going on in the other breast, I just can't take living with the constant fear. Also, the tamoxifen makes my joints ache and I feel like a 90 year old woman most of the time. Can anyone tell me if you have the bilateral do you still take tamoxifen? I would love to get off that stuff. Sorry for the long post, I just had to get it off my chest. The support of everyone on this board definitely helps make this thing a little easier to do.

I also wasn't too worried about the removal after reading several posts saying it was a piece of cake. The one under my arm came out fairly easily, some pain but doable. The one in my stomach hurt like hell when it came out. My PS explained that it hurt worse because it was a flat drain as opposed to a round one like the upper one. Thankfully the pain is short lived and having the drains gone is definitely worth it. Then again, maybe I'm just a wimp. . .LOL. Good luck. ",

When I had my first surgery last year, I had only microcalcifications that showed up on the mammo, so the wire had to be inserted to guide the surgeon to where they were. I just had another excisional biopsy in March to remove a lump in my other breast and it did not require the wire since it could be felt. The incision was made along the edge of my aerola and it is barely noticable now. . .surgery was on March 19. I wore a sports bra 24/7 for 2 weeks following both of those surgeries and I do believe it makes a huge difference to keep that breast immobilized. Just make sure you don't get anything that has to be pulled over your head because you won't be able to get it on. My suggestion for surgery day - button/zip up shirt, pull on pants, slip on shoes and sports bra to wear home. Good luck and keep us posted",

My dx was .7 cm DCIS and I originally opted for lumpectomy followed by radiation because it's the least invasive surgery and I wanted to save my breast. Unfortunately I did not react well to rads and my tissue never healed. This is not a common occurance. In order to correct this situation I needed to remove the bad tissue. I seriously considered having a bi-lateral but in the end I couldn't emotionally deal with losing my good breast. So last month I had a mastectomy on my right breast with immediate ped tram flap recon. So far I'm happy with the results and will eventually have my remaining breast lifted to match the new one. Good luck with your decision. Continue to ask questions on this site, the women here are so supportive.",
