My oncologist just ordered bone scan and cat scan with contrast to see \" if it has spread.\" I had a mammogram a year ago, how could this happen? To say that I am terrified is an understatement. I moved recently and have little to no support here. None of my girlfriends live close by! I'm rambling. If the test results show no spread to other organs I can face this war one battle at a time. If not I don't know what I'll do. I am just in shock. Any words of advice or wisdom until I have the scans and wait for the results? Thank you all so much.",

I thought I was moving along well even just taking Tylenol on day 5 until 8 days following surgery I started to feel a lot of pain under my arm which has been getting worse by the day. My 2 drains are still in for 2 more days because of the holiday weekend. I will have my follow up with surgeon then and get path results. Tonight I have been in agony. Even oxi condone hasn't helped. I can't help but wonder if this is temporary or if this will be my fate. I dreaded getting the axillary dissection because I have heard not so great things about it but then again if it got the cancer then it was worth it. Has anyone else had a similar experience? You are all so brave. It is a privilege to read your stories. Thanks.",

I've only known for 2 days that I'll need chemo so I'm still in a bit of shock. Will rely on the women like you here on these boards to help me through it. Thank you.",
