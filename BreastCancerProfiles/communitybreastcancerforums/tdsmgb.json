    "Content": "Jun 21, 2011 05:19PM - edited Jun 21, 2011 05:20PM by tdsmgb got my tats today, last of Taxol and herceptin will be 6/27, chemo port out 6/28. Dry run is 7/1 begin 35 days of \"fun in the sun\" 7/5.  My rad dr is a pain, made me sign a statement saying I am beginning radiation against his advice.  He wants me to wait 3 -4 wks.  No medical reason why, he just said it was protocol.  His assoc is starting a friend of mine 2 wks after her taxol ended. Protocol?  My rad dr also told me I would get cancer again, he said chemo and radiation mutates the cells and I will get cancer again, too bad for me being hormone neg and her2 pos too, oh well he said, it is worse than trip neg.  wow way to instill possitive attitude bud.  I am stuck with this group too, seems no one really likes their attitudes.  Got yelled at when I questioned his methodology too, was told I am the patient and he is the Dr and he knows best. Really, do tell, did not know I had no say in my treatment, my body, my life...guess not.  I will keep on questioning this Dr as I plan on outliving this guy, for me not a good possitive role model in my life.  Good thing I only have to see him 1x week too.  The technicians are really nice though and that is a blessing. So I start my trip through radiation 7/5 whether he likes it or not.",
