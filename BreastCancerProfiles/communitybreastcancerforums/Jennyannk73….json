I promise it wasn't that bad. Not fun... some pain- taste issues, stomach issues-- but the worst is just a few days at a time with a lot of weakness and fatigue. Do what they ask of you and remember a positive attitude is priceless-- perception is a big piece of how you feel and your attitude influences how sensitive you are to pain and discomfort. Pain meds are a great thing, and yes I used them, and no I didn't get addicted because I took them as prescribed for my joint pain. I wish you the very best of luck-- let me know if you need to talk! My chemo was over a year ago and believe me it will be over quickly! So far NED, hoping the same for you sister!",

I know what you are feeling is crazy scared right now but it will get better and you will cry less and less. Other than aromitase inhibitors and ovary suppressing drugs I am all done! You will get there too! Bless you, and let me know if I can help!",
