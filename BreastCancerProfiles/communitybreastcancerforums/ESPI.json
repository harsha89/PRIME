    "Content": "ESPI wrote: For just over a week I've had this weird vibration on the side of my left breast (like a cell phone was attached to it). I saw my obgyn today and she did a full breast exam and said everything feels fine. Contributing it to a possible pinched nerve or muscle spasm from an aching neck I've had for a little while. I asked her specifically (just to make sure) if that's a symptom of BC and she said no. I get my annual mamo this month. Log in to post a reply",
