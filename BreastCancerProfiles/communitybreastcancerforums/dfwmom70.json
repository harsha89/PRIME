Can a cyst hide a small cancerous area on an ultrasound?  I am just in disbelief that a lump could form so \"fast\".  And I didn't think to ask for the report.  I was pretty shocked to say the least and really didn't think of anything else other than leaving my husband to care for our children alone and in disbelief that a lump could form so fast.  It was a woman doctor this time...not sure she was thinking of her golf game.  She seemed equally shocked in the time...well maybe not equally. Husband is very supportive and has basically said what y'all have...we'll get through whatever comes.  It's been a hard weekend.",

This weekend, I am trying to stay strong for my kids.  So far so good, but all I want to do is breakdown and cry.

My radiation oncologist also told me when I have any scans (mammogram, MRI, chest x-rays, etc.) to make an appointment 3 days after the scan to go over the results.  He said 50% of the time after someone has radiation the results are misinterpreted.  He said it would be a quick no charge meeting.  Interesting.  Come to think of it, I don't remember handing my credit card over during any of my visits there. Hmmm. Now on to lose the weight I have gained through this process.  UGH!  But My 10 (almost 11) year old daughter wants to go to the gym with me. I can at least have a workout buddy now!  And she is my motivator to be a good example. Happy First Day of Spring!",

So glad.  Will make my MRI appointment after since my breast surgeon is just 2 floors up.  Can't wait to get to the next step.  Am really glad I did the chemo first.   Two weeks ago during my last exam, my onc said if I had come in just for a breast exam, it would be normal.  Good to hear.  And of course today's exam was the same. I was on 6 treatments of ACT with T being Taxotere.  During my 4th treatment, my fingers and toes started tingling.  That hadn't happened before during previous treatments...at least not during.  When I went to the week after visit I asked my onc what I could do.  She said Texas Oncology had just put out a supplement list that doesn't interfere with chemo treatments.  One for neuropathy was AlamaxCR, along with some vitamins.  She said the studies showed this to be more effective. It helps protect the outside layer of the nerves.  I really think that has helped.  I will see today.  I still have a little tingling but not all the time and more annoying than painful.  It's expensive though...almost $60 for a month's supply.  Since it's a supplement, it's not covered by insurance.   I am more of a lurker, but read the posts when I can.  Can't stay on here too long because some of the recurrances some have had.  It makes think negative thoughts about my own future sometimes.  And congrats to all those who have finished and to those that are close.  Before all this, I thought I'd never make it.  I didn't think I was strong enough.  I saw someone's signature today (can't remember who's) saying you don't know how strong you are until being strong is your only choice.  How true is that?? Well, I am now done with my treatment and am home and had a nap.  This has become an all day post. Texas Oncology gives balloons and a t-shirt after your last treatment.  All the nurses come in clapping to present it. Those nearby congragulated me.  The man sitting acriss from me has had 8 treatments and still had until late December for colon cancer.  Thankful for my 6. The Alamax must have worked since I didn't get tingly during the treatment. The benadryl affects are strong and then my sister came up from Waco to surprise me.  She caught me right in the middle of getting the benadryl and my drowsey self.  Didn't recognize her at first because 'she was at work and a 100+ miles away'.  :-)  Nice surprise and got to have lunch with my husband mother and sister today. Wish she lived here.  Not considering the chemo and the affects over the next 10 days, I had a good day.",

When she got my ki-67 number sent me to oncology. It was 74-75%. How was it grade 2? This morning my oncologist also said she can't feel it anymore either...yoohoo. Though she's the one who has been feeling the changes since my 1st treatment...steadily decreasing in size rather quickly. The benadryl has kicked in....",
