They told me to always use the other arm. Also, wear a sleeve when I fly.  I have a medical alert bracelet that I wear on my left wrist stating the no nos and that there is a lymphedema risk. It's not a sure deal that you will get lymphedema in the future. It's just a risk we need to be aware of and be proactive. I was very concerned about this when I was deciding to have the rest of my lymph nodes removed. I also asked a bunch of women I met on here if anyone had an issue with lymphedema.

These are the things I've learned... Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate... I drink 3 liters of mostly water every day. at least a few days before and about a week after treatment. It takes about 48-72 hours for the chemo drugs to leave your system so drink, drink, drink! This can also include soup and jello. Don't count caffeine intake as it dehydrates you. Take the meds as they are prescribed. Don't get behind. I took my meds just as I was told and I was not sick. I didn't feel very good for a few days. I was tired, cranky and my tummy just didn't feel right. I was constipated (sorry there is no such thing as TMI here) so add a colace (stool softener) to her meds. If she is constipated, she can take milk of magnesia or a tea called Smooth Move. Some milestones for me were... I lost my taste buds around day 4, I was tired and sad on day 5-6 which was also when I had some bad constipation. I stayed away from people day 7-10 because of my WBC being low. I didn't want to catch a cold. My hair started to come out (I could pull it out with no trouble) on day 14. I ended up having my honey buzz my hair on day 16 so it was easier to deal with. Now I just wear a scarf or ski cap when I am not at work. That took a bit to get used to. It's not like the old days. They give you lots of meds to combat sickness and side effects. Don't be afraid to call the Oncologist with ANY questions. They are used to it. Encurage her to join a Feb 2013 chemo group on here or start a thread. I'm in the jan 2013 chemo group and it has provided me with emotional support and tips from others going through this too. She can join in on our group if she wants and she can ask any question she wants. We will welcome her with open arms! And- A special thank you to you for being proactive with her chemo. It is hard for us survivors to go through this and it is equally hard to watch our dear husbands/partners go through it too. So, thank you. Give her all the love... tell her she is beautiful, hold her hand, rub her back. She is going to go through some pretty tough emotions and I bet she isn't going to feel very pretty sometimes, so, love on her. There is a caregiver thread on here for our husbands and partners. Join that for yourself. You are going to have some pretty strong emotion too... Hang in there... both of you.",

I stayed on top of the constipation and I stayed on the anti nausea meds. I had a bad night the first round because of constipation. So, I added colace the day before tx and while I took any meds.  I went back to work part time after the second round and did fine. I actually worked the nights of treatments. I took full advantage of the steroid high. So, first three days were fine with the emend and dex. Day 4 I would lose my taste buds. Day 6/7 I'd get them back and it also was the steroid crash. I was tired and sad. I took the compazine for three days after finishing the emend and dex. Other than that, I just had a general feeling of being tired. I needed a little help with the kid and housework just because of that. I would suggest having a girlfriend/sister/ husband someone cook meals that you can just heat up quick. I had and still have friends that insist on bringing casseroles every week. It really does help.  The first round was the hardest psycologically. I was freaking out about my hair. I must have asked people 100 times when my hair was going to fall out.  I thought I was going to be violently sick the entire time. I thought I was going to lose 50 lbs and look like I was near death. It sucked. Needless to say, none of this was unbearable. My hair did fall out around day 14. I buzzed it a few day after. I am done with AC and my eyebrows and lashes are very thin but still there.  I never got sick. I haven't lost more than 10 lbs. I think the weight loss is because I am a bit more careful about my food choices now. I also learned to speak up when I needed help. People don't really know how to help. So, just ask for help from your support people. You will do fine. It is doable.",

I just finished 4 rounds of AC (every three weeks) and I start Taxol on April 1st. I didn't have nausea/vomting with AC. I took the meds just as they said and I was not sick. Some side effects are unavoidable. I lost my taste buds for a few days, my hair started to fall out at day 14. I had a few solid headaches. I had a few days of fatigue.  All of it was managable. I went back to work the week of the 3rd treatment. Just part time but I did well. The docs and nurses are really good at keeping the side effects managable. This is doable. There are so many things I learned from the others on the Jan chemo 2013 thread. Use eachothers knowledge, experiences, ask LOTS of questions on here. I'm just going to give you the things that were a must for me... Stay hydrated- I drink 3 liters of water a day. Dont let yourself get dehydrated. Take a stool softner- I added colace to my pills on the day before treatment and until the day after I stopped the nausea meds. Constipation is a nasty one. Rest- Get lots of rest. Ask your MO for something to help you sleep. I took Ativan. Worked like a charm. Neulesta shot- A lot of the ladies in the Jan thread reported possible bone pain with the neulesta shot. They took Claritin to ward off the pain. It worked for most of them. I am not sure of the dosage or timing but I'm sure it can be Googled. I didn't have to get that shot. Anyway, like I said earlier, this is doable. You will have bad days and good days. I chose to celebrate the good ones and accept the bad ones. Before you know it you will be looking back on this and it will be a distant memory. Good luck to all of you. You will get through this and be on the other side before you know it. I couldn't have done it without the others on the Jan thread. I wish you all happy days!",

I was going to add a CoQ10 but I havent done enough of my own research to get a good feel for the benefits. Of course I do a quick check with the MO before I start anything new. Foods- I was told to limit caffeine, alcohol and dairy. I have a cup of coffee in the morning and every few days I have a beer or a glass of wine. I am not a milk drinker but I love cheese. I haven't totally eliminated these, I just cut back. I was also told to increase my protein intake. I heard somewhere to try to get around 100g of protein a day. I added a protein shake daily just to help with that increase. I also drink 3 liters of water a day. Stay well hydrated. You will figure out the meds. The names are weird and we just aren't used to them. I had my dry erase board and every time I took something I just wrote down the time and what I took. They gave me three different types of anti nausea meds. I settled on the Compazine (prochlorperazine) and the Ativan (lorazepam). The other ones I never used. They worked great. I never got sick. I had a bit of constipation the first round so I added a colace till I stopped taking the meds. Happy easter!!",

No fever, just a cold. I use the purell every time I touch something. A pen at the bank, a door handle, grocery carts. I use it when I get into my car and then wipe it on my steering wheel too. I do not hug people. It's strictly handshakes or fist pumps. I try to go to the stores in the off hours so I minimize people contact. I am going back to the gym next week after seeing what my count is for my taxol#2. I hope it is up some so I can get back into running. I plan on going early in the morning. hopefully not a lot of people will be there. I am wearing my Chemo Day t-shirt and a head wrap. Maybe that will be enough of a hint to stay away.

That's ok right?\"  I get my answer because you have forced her to make a decision. If you just simply ask... alot of times they will just say don't bother. So, I force the issue for things I read, hear, see... especially if I think it will benefit me somehow. You are doing way more research than they are right now. So, coming to them with information is beneficial to you... and expect answers and reasons. Not just a blanket no or don't bother. This happened with Vitamin D. I asked my primary if I should take more vit D (I have 1000 IU in my multi) and he said no I was fine. No test...nothing. HAHA nope, wrong answer. I went to my MO and after 4 months of taking 6000IU of Vit D my level was 47. She said to keep taking this amount and my levels were ok, not great. Anyway, my point is be you own advocate. I am constantly reading and learning more about this disease. There is so much to earn and a ton of studies being done. Hopefully they will find a cure.... someday.",

Your mind is going every which way. Ambien will make you sleep. I was never one to take something to help me sleep and I was taking it for a bit. Try to remain calm. Until you meet with the surgeon, you really have no idea what to research. They will have the pathology report from the biopsy and that will give you a ton of info. It took two weeks from diagnosis for me to meet with the surgeon. I had surgery about 8 weeks after diagnosis. That was a pretty normal time frame I was told. I also started to prepare my body for surgery. I started to eat healthier, I cut back on drinking alcohol and caffeine, I was a little better about getting to the gym, stuff like that. It is a tough battle. I fight because of my little boy and my list of things I want to do in life is no where near complete. I refuse to let cancer cheat me out of the joys I have yet to experience.
