I'm starting with my radio onco & I'm still seeing my PTO. My serious thought was to have them removed, but maybe that's not a good idea.Â  when I had my implants put in, my PS was SUPPOSE to release my armpit issue on the left rad side, but he didn't. I'm not really that comfortable with him, but I guess may that's where I'll end up next ;/ Please let me know how it goes if you decide to or maybe we can just compare notes. debbie BTW< I also have lymphedema and I feel like my whole chest has a band around it. UGH!",
