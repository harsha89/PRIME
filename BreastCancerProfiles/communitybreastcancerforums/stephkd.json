I don't really have anything to contribute regarding your breast issue, but in regards to the hormonal problems--I have endometriosis and adenomyosis. My doctor believes, based on many symptoms, that I have excess estrogen as well that is contributing to that. I have been taking Prometrium, a natural progesterone, to try to help it. It isn't really helping my endo/adeno, but I have noticed some of my suspected estrogen-dominance symptoms have gotten a little better. Initially she wanted me to take birth control. I was uncomfortable taking one with estrogen in it so we tried a synthetic progesterone only pill. I responded awfully to it, scary depression, no appetite, headaches, etc. We then switched to the Prometrium, and I don't get any of those nasty side effects. I'm not sure if it would be right for you, but maybe something you could look into and talk to your doctor or naturopath about regarding the hormone imbalance. Good luck.",
