I can tell this forum will be important to me because as BlueFrog76 said, our children are the most difficult aspect of our diagnosis! I will watch for the right time and circumstance to share with my kids. Right now, I need to work out how to share the news with my parents and my best friend. Luckily, my husband and sis have taken it well. Best wishes to all and be back soon.",

I am doing OK, still recovering from the shock as this year was my 5-year survival celebration. My kids are 7 and 9 and I hesitate to share my news with many people because I don't want my kids to find out. I have read that Stage IV survivors can live for many years so why inform them at this point? And if I share my news with friends, they will talk and my kids will clue in. Would love some advice on how you handled it with your kids. Thanks!",
