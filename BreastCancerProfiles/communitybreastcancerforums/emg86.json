She's had a lumpectomy and starts chemo tomorrow for 8 treatments and then 6.5wks of radiation (her margins were not clear after surgery). It's been a long few weeks for our family. She starts chemo tomorrow and we have all been incredibly anxious. I've been going to all of her appts and reading everything I can and passing it on to her. Thanks to this group and community my anxiety has come down so some and has also eased my mom's. She is very worried about work because her job is physically demanding and she would have to ride the bus (she doesn't drive) which makes me nervous this time of year",
