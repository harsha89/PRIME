I also had cancer scare last year when they had to do biopsy BIRAD 4 and it was B9 ! Here are very nice, supportive and informative ladies. But i would just tell you to stay off the internet trying to research everything, its just gonna make you even more scared. That was my experience :-) Good luck and let us know. Praying for B9 results for you !",

I just had my biopsy done 10 days ago for suspisious lumps birad 4 in my breast that showed on MRI. 6 months ago it was single nodule and at follow up it was three nodules so they requested biopsy. Just got results tuesday and it is BENIGN !!!!! Most of them turn out to be nothing, ... 80% !! I also have read that fibroadenoma can grow very quickly. I think they just want to make sure. And you are so young,...it can be anything. Good luck !! and keep us posted. kam",

Would never do that again. I was tempting to do the same thing before my 6 months folow up ( to see if they sometimes can get bad results i guess) but then i said NO way,...just couldn't do it to myself. Try to relax and live your life and maybe MRI would be good idea to consider. I wish you good luck and little piece of mind.",
