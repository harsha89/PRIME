The outpatient procedure provides a concentrated dosage over a longer period of time, while conserving normal liver tissue that surrounds the tumor. That means minimal side effects.\" tami boehmer., july 13, 2010. i found this on tami boehmer's site and she too has breast ca with liver mets.  i'm including a link to her page that is really helpful for all cancer survivor's.  she wrote a new book about it, and it sounds amazing. www.tamiboehmer.com/ here's the link. i hope this helps you an others, as i do have a friend that is going to be getting this treatment.  she is trying to get approval from her insurance company now.  she's had stage IV with mets for 5 years and her name is robin farley.  you can also find her blog online by googling her name.  she's an amazing person too! ",

it was confined only to the breast.  i told him about the strange reaction i've had from meds lately, after just going through a complicated hysterectomy, with multiple infections, and left hip pain.  i have severe, progressive scoliosis, and was finally being seen for harrington rod surgery at 49, so i could once again function as a whole person.  he begrudgingly agreed to do a pet scan, warning me that the insurance wouldn't cover their portion.  i had the pet scan on tueday...it's so hard to keep track of all of this in my mind at this point...and i got a call from the oncologists lpn telling me they had the preliminary results.  she was incredibly insensitive and downright rude, considering what she was telling me.  they found a large mass on my left leg, and 2 more on my spine at t12, and l3, and l4.  i have grade 1V mets.  i honestly think it's also in my lungs and liver, based on my recent symptoms.  i honestly feel as if i can't hang on, and that this is a death sentence at this point.  i was an oncology nurse at duke for many many years, treating only stage 1V breast ca patients, all that died while i was with them. this was, however, 10 years ago.  but the memories of all of those brave women, and all they endured, is giving me flash backs to what is to come for me. i have been up almost all night, unable to sleep since learning the news.  i cry, i mourn, and i just cannot wrap my mind around this.  i had a lump a year and a half ago, and have been having mammograms, with several biopsies for almost 20 years.  i've had them for the past 12 years at the same facility, and was told it was just \"breast tissue\", and sent the little card saying my mammo was the same as the year before.  i delayed getting the one for this year done because i had several surgeries during this time, and just couldn't get better enough to go.  i am alone.  one year and five mos. later, i got called in for an ultrasound, then biopsy, then sent to the oncologist, who assured me i didn't have mets.  why didn't they biopsy when i found the lump the year before, and how could i not have insisted with a very, very strong family history of breast ca?  i feel so stupid, so angry, and just cannot wrap my mind around all that's happened.   i've called several hotlines, hoping for help.  and until i knew i had bone mets, i truly believed there was a cure.  now, i don't know where to go from here, and how to deal with this news.  i go to the oncologist this morning, and the lpn told me palliative care only.  i'm angry at myself and angry at the radiologist who said i was \"fine\" even with a large lump in my left breast.  mentally, i had just begun to accept the cancer diagnosis only to learn i am already too far gone for any treatments except radiation, or so they say.  i have appointments lined up to see breast surgeons, and plastic surgeons for reconstruction.  i don't know what will happen with that, after reading all of your wonderful posts and learning that if it's this far advanced they often won't remove the primary tumor.  the mets to the spine is severe, and complicates my scoliosis diag. which has been debilitating.   i'm sorry to rant like this, but i am truly \"lost\", and am searching for a tad of hope right now.  i wish i didn't know all i know from my career, that's for sure.  she wouldn't say if other organs were involved, but  i honestly think it is also in the lungs and liver at the very least.  the lpn said \"you knew\" as if somehow that made it all ok.  i honestly didn't know.  it's only been since the big surgery and strange symptoms that after i got the cancer news that i wondered.  it's like my worst fears have come true, and i dearly want to hang on to life and find some hope.  i know things have changed since i worked in oncology, and i want to believe there is hope.  i want to find a way to stop the visions i keep having about my own death.  i want to live.   if anyone would be interested in speaking with me it would be greatly appreciated.  there are no stage 1V with bone mets, esp. with leisons this large, i can find from the different groups i've called for help.  i am just lost, and praying i can find others going through similiar things.   please know that i send my best to everyone here, and i apologize if this post is negative.  i am just still in shock.  thank you for posting, so i could find you in my darkest hour.  there must be a \"dawn\" someplace out there.          3/10 dx'd w/ grade 2, idc, 2 cm. stage IV, mets spine and pelvis, ER/ PR+, HER-2+(6+). here

information.  for those of you who pm'd me, i don't know how to do it, but would love the opportunity to talk further.  again, i hope that my post has not been too negative, and that i haven't brought anyone down with my words.  they are and were just my ramblings and disbelief.  i still feel stuck there as i don't believe that i know what to do next. i started zometa, herceptin, and femara.  the latter, i'm fighting to find ways to help with the costs as my insurance will only cover it up to a certain dollar amount that i'll reach really soon.  i don't know if i qualify for the patient assistance program, as i remember doing many of these applications for my patients.  it's over 500 a month.   i still don't know if i have brain mets.  other than the initial pet scan that i insisted on, i haven't had any further tests.  i am asking for a brain scan, but it hasn't been scheduled yet.  i had a \"multi-disciplinary conference\" with the same organization that my doctor is a part of, and this is what they said: systemic treatment is most important now, and none of them encouraged me to have breast surgery, as they didn't think it was appropriate, or that i could handle it at this time.  2 of them told me i seemed depressed....no, duh!  i asked for effexor, and was taking only a quarter a day for a few days, but am now taking the full dose and yes, am still very, very overwhelmed by this diagnosis.  i asked about traditional chemo, radiation, and the radiologist, head of the dept. and surgeon all said to try \"targeted therapy\" first, which yes, are \"slow burners\" and don't work fast, and they don't do any testing to see if it's working for at least three mos.  (er+ pr+ her2+).  seems like a long time to me.  the cancer on my spine on l3, l4, and t12 are large leisons, larger than the cancer in my breast, and the one on my pelvis is very very large.  the only plan is to continue with the meds i listed, every three weeks, and monitor the tumors after several cycles.  i wish i lived in an area with an major medical center, but i don't and traveling is hard for me.  it makes me want to buy a camper, so i can not only be seen, but to travel for sure!  we do have a teaching hospital but i wonder if it's any better.  they said no surgery, no radiation at this time, which to me doesn't feel like being aggressive enough.  i think they are afraid of litigation, and the director, whom i saw even mentioned it because he knows i requested my records(still don't have them).  the oncologist i have now, just plays down the seriousness of this all, and it seems like they all do, because there is nothing besides cookie cutter treatment that they start with.  that's how it feels to me, at least.  one suggested healing touch therapy.   i talked to a woman who suggested going to the metastatic breast cancer site, so since a few of you have mentioned this, i'm going to check it out.  as for support, it's hard.  i had a woman who is really kind from a local organization go with me for the multi team conference.  they fund the institution i'm going too, with a lot of money each year.  she had stage 2, so it's really hard for her to understand, i think, what this is like.  i truly believe that only those of you who have walked this path understand it, and i am hoping to make contact with someone from on here to talk with.  it's hard for me to be online, because of my back, so it's hard to sit, even short periods of time.  i've had pain from the scoliosis for a long, long time, and finally getting to a place that they were actually going to do something to make it better, and now knowing that won't happen bec. of the new diagnosis is difficult.  the primary tumor is just over 2 centimeters, and just a grade 2.  i don't know how to enter this info as i see many of you have with the diagnosis listed.  to me, that doesn't make sense.  it didn't to the doctors either, i know, because it's not the normal presentation.  i talked to 2 stage 4 survivors, one from the network of hope, and you don't keep in touch with them, and one here locally, who goes to the university for her care.  you're so right....friends don't get it, and i think that's the biggest deficit i have right now is not having support.  i have a room mate for the time being and she totally doesn't get it and is deathly afraid of being around anyone sick.  she avoids even talking to me, or is outwardly angry....nothing in between.  i have grown kids, and one hasn't called at all, one sees it as no big deal and the other, thinks i should do nothing and just wait.  i do have a sister who lives in florida who has helped some, by phone.  yes, all of this makes you want to travel and see things doesn't it?  i thnk about that a lot lately, but money is an issue for sure.   i guess i wanted to at least post again and let everyone know what was going on, say thank you sooo much for your support, and ask for any suggestions on what to do next.  the 2 things i have pending are the brain scan and a port placement.  that's about it.  the zometa, of all things, made me really, really sick. i had a fever of over 103, and wonder if that's normal?  as a nurse, i don't think so.  i did call the oncologist and he assured me it was normal.  ???  i felt soo bad, like everything hurt, and i could actually feel exactly where the tumors are.  strange huh?    i'm going to see if i can add my dx somehow on here, and go back to the posts that said i could pm, and see if i can figure out how to do it.  and yes, i'm still crying....does that ever stop?  i guess it doesn't help having absolutely no estrogen now, and the constant hot flashes and not being able to sleep.  i guess i feel like i just need a friend who really does get this and some good reliable \"steps\" to take next.   please know that i'm sending healing and loving hope, and energy to each of you who so kindly posted and cared.  this is the only site i found, in my search, with a place for stage IV survivors.  i know i'm still in a fog, and not thinking clearly at this point.  yes, it is like a constant radio on in the room, and it's always there, isn't it?  i hope it gets quieter very soon.  i am one big heart and that is the best description i know to let you all know who i really am.  very emotional, and very caring.   i've spent much of my life trying to do all i can to make this a better world.  i love helping people, and animals especially.  right now, i wish i was tougher.  i think a thicker skin would go a long, long way right now.  know that i'm trying, and please, if anyone is interested in actually talking on the phone, let me know. jenny",
