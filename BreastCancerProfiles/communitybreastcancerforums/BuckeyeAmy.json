For a good deal of that time, I looked so \"normal.\" Healthy, fit, full head of hair. I sometimes wonder if people think I am one of those people who fake a disease for attention and money: she can't possibly have this terrible illness, she works out 4 times a week! The myths I've see mostly over the years: * Stage IV is an automatic death sentence * Treatment has an \"end\" * eating asparagus, taking coconut oil, using CBD oil, changing your diet to alkaline, etc. will \"cure\" the cancer * despite my appearance and mood and activity level, I am still fighting a bitch of a disease. And it's sometimes exhausting. Emotionally and physically. One thing I would like to add: people generally mean well. It's tough to know what to say to someone facing their own mortality. \"Your attitude is so great. That's how you made it this long.\" \"Hey, we could all get hit by a beer truck tomorrow.\" \"My sister went to this clinic in California and her cancer is gone. I'll send you the info.\" They are trying to commiserate and empathize with you. Give 'em a break. Love to all my fellow Stage IV sisters - \"You Got This!\" ha ha ha",

I did 7 rounds of Kacyla and other than an itchy rash on my face and neck that lasted 9 days, I just had persistent fatigue. I did notice some hot flashes and increased thirst throughout the 3 weeks. Unfortunately, Kadycla did not work for me so I'm on to the Her2Climb trial. Are you still on this regimen?",
