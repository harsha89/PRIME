My diagnosis and treatment seems similar to yours. It amazes me that your first oncologist told me that you could just \"do nothing\"......unbelievable. My bone mets were so bad and I had so many compressions that in addition to going through the chemo regimen that you did, I was in a hard \"turtle shell\" brace that went from my hips to my chin so that I couldn't move. I wore it all the time except at night for three months. Anyway, the spine doctor that I saw for fitting me and follow up had 0 bedside manner.... when I told him I planned to be running again in a year, he told me that he was just \"hoping I would be alive next Christmas, let alone walking\"....?????   Anyway - your story is very inspiring. My recent PET scan also showed no activity and no signs of disease. I am hoping that I can maintain that until a cure IS found, which I know someday it will be. My children are a little older than yours (four teenagers) but I need to be here for them for a long time! I keep a little pink book called \"Hope\" right beside my bed and refer to it whenever I am having a bad day, and it always helps, as does connecting like women like you.

I am fortunate to have traveled pretty extensively all my life, but I can never get enough of it so places to go are always at the top of my list.

No particular order - here are a few: 1) Six month camping trip across the country - in a camper van or pulling little camper.  2) Backpack the Lost Coast in California 3) Climb Kilamajaro (stretch, I realize....) 4) Run another marathon. (Ran 4 pre-diagnosis and since then have managed 2 half marathons. Another stretch.) 5) Iceland/Northern Lights 6) New Zealand 7) Nova Scotia 8) Organize all of the pictures I have been taking since about 1988 and make photo books for my family. 9) See both my boys get married.  10) Learn to actually do yoga well 11) Create a blog 12) Live in a house on a lake. That's probably a good start...\u2026.I'm glad I am writing these down. We have two trips planned this year; one to the Turks and Caicos with a group of friends, and then I am going on a hiking trip of the Matterhorn - from somewhere in Italy to Zermatt - this summer with some girlfriends.

Katy, glad things are going well for you!  We missed not hearing from you. Your outdoor time hiking and biking sounds wonderful, as does your camper van trip to Utah. I just want to live vicariously through you! I just read a story about a couple that lived out of a van for 4 years and traveled around the US and then Europe; hiking, biking, mountain climbing.... just totally simplifying. Sounds SOOOOOOOO fun and tempting but of course, they were young and healthy and she didn't need to get treatments all the time and I am pretty sure they didn't even worry about health insurance. Totally carefree. I can't really even imagine. ANYWHOO, I hope Utah is nice and sunny. Are you going to Zion and Bryce?  LovefromPhilly your posts make me smile, and I think I need to jump on the Zumba bandwagon. I think if I had classes to go to I'd be a lot more motivated. I have no excuse; my company has this thing called Thrive; they give us $50 a month to put towards a gym, or yoga, or anything that is health and fitness related. I just need to commit and sign up. I know I would love it.  Oh, and yes to your question about soreness and recovery time. It takes me WAY longer to recover from a work out than my pre-cancer days, and a lot longer to get rid of any soreness. Of course, I always feel like I am about 90 when I first wake up in the morning, even if I haven't done a thing. I literally went a week with no exercise besides walking Lucie (our Newfoundland). I had big plans to do a long run yesterday, and then had some girlfriends over Friday night that I hadn't seen in a long time....drank waaaaaaaaay to much wine. I was worthless yesterday, and today woke up to a snowstorm; it snowed hard all day. I finally just bundled up and went for a run in the snow, which actually felt pretty good.... nice to be outside even thought it was freezing.  LoriCA, I hope it's not too smoky where you are from the Southern CA fires. Sorry to hear about H&P not working, but I think there are other good protocols that follow it, so hoping they get you on something else soon. Your snuggle up day with a book, pizza, TV and husband sounds perfect. :) We all deserve days like that.  Hello to everyone else! Hope everybody has a good week! XO Andrea ",

And Iwrite, thanks so much for sharing those articles. I am especially interested on the one dealing with neuropathy as I still have it quite badly in my left foot... it's almost always numb. I have definitely noticed that it's better when I am really working out and worse right after infusions.  We had a family related tragedy just before Xmas, which sort of derailed all of us. I responded to the stress with lots of running, which helped.  Then Christmas rolled around (totally chaotic Christmas Eve with tons of people and then nice quiet Christmas Day. I took my mom to see Mary Poppins) and we left the next day for our trip to Argentina. My husband and I, four kids and one girlfriend. Whew. It was mostly wonderful, with a few ups and downs. Lots and lots of walking around Buenos Aires, but not much else in terms of exercise. I optimistically took my running shoes, but never got to put them on.  We did go to an Estancia (ranch) for three days and rode horses every day.... so I felt like my inner thighs got a work out! That was probably the highlight. The kids took polo lessons and loved it... did very well. I tried one, but my horse didn't want to cooperate so I could never hit the ball! :(   The weather was beautiful - sunny and perfect. This last weekend I did a gym workout for the first time in a long time, and then skied (downhill) for the first time this year. Beautiful sunny day and the snow was wonderful. I felt great all day, although quads are a little sore this morning.  Hope everyone has a great week! Keep posting!

I do go through stretches where I give up alcohol (like a month or so) but I could never, ever give up coffee! Never have, never will.

Probably lots of walking, too.... so you can walk off all that amazing food!  Heidi - I will ask for all three. Pain hasn't subsided. MRI tomorrow night at 10pm! That was the only time they could get me in. Apparently MRI's are in demand in Denver. I am starting to freak out, both because I am worried it's something not good, and because I haven't been able to do anything besides some walking. I miss my running and yoga! This is going to force me to get in that swimming pool! Anyone who has been following this thread since whenever I joined knows that even thought I keep threatening to swim, I have never done it. A few weeks ago I even bought two new fairly cute suits - the kind specifically for swimming. I put one on, went to the pool on a 85 degree day ( I was in CA) and watched everyone else swim laps and then I got up and left!  So glad to see that everyone else's activity is making up for my lack of it! I love this group.... keep moving.... I'll do something soon, even if it involves water.  XO Andrea",

I've done both Tucson and the California marathon in Sacramento - both the first weekend of Dec - and loved them.

I have been doing a lot of hiking, and playing in a tennis league.  Also good exercise, and the social hour with wine afterwards is always fun.  HeidiHill - so glad to see you! I am definitely going to check out the Wednesday Weigh In or whatever you called it. In spite of the fact that I do stay very active and have a very ( I think ) healthy diet, I am still about 10-15 pounds over where I would like to be..... I am on a low dose of Lyrica for the neuropathy in my feet from chemo six years ago, and I am sure that is what is doing it. (that, and possibly my age.... although I prefer to blame the drugs) Maybe holding myself accountable would help.  That, and ADDING YOGA TO MY ROUTINE!!!!!  Have a great week! XO Andi",

My husband and I are buying each other mountain bikes for our anniversary, which is in a few weeks. We both used to love mountain biking - before kids - but haven't done it much in the last 15+ years so we are really excited about it. It will be nice to have something else to do together, since he doesn't like to run and that's sort of my main activity. I am so glad your appt went well. I have heard great things about Huntsman. And DGHoff - beautiful picture of backpacking! So happy that you got to do that, and envious! We love to camp, and backpacking is another thing we did \"pre-kids\" and that I used to do growing up with my own parents, but we haven't managed to find the time to fit in it. I love Minnesota, and that picture is lovely. I'm also curious about your port coming out. I get Herceptin as well. My port is in my arm - it has been for six years - and I would really, really like to get it. No particular reason - I am just tired of it, which I know is dumb as it's been helping to keep me alive all this time. I wouldn't mind IV's every month, but I have heard it can be hard on your veins. (?)   Gracie - I would also suggest talking to your MO about your shortness of breathe. I went through that several years ago and it turned out that my lungs were filling up with fluid from the treatment I was getting (not cancerous fluid - just fluid) I literally couldn't walk down the hall without stopping to rest. It was terrible...please do ask about it because I know it's very scary and frustrating.  Thanks for the pictures, stories and motivation from everyone! Love seeing that everyone is outside. I went on a 6 mile run yesterday; I am supposed to be up to 9 (yikes) miles if I want to be on target for the half marathon in November so I am a little behind.... so far today it's just coffee in bed and catching up with BCO. Enjoy the rest of your weekend!  XO Andi",

I ignored mine for six months (stupid, and really in denial) until I could barely walk \u2026. anyway, really glad that you are going to get some answers and hope that you can get something for the pain.  KatyK, what an amazing week you just had! I am so happy for you and so, so envious! Believe me, I don't need a backpack THAT bad! I can be up for van camping. Sounds beautiful. We had so much fun in Bozeman a few weeks ago. You live in such an amazing part of the country! I use picnic tables for push ups sometimes, too! I think that is why I am anxious to backpack; although I do run and hike, I don't do much for strength and core training, and I am really bad about yoga (which I have mentioned) and the gym. I just love to be outside, and so I figure if I have a goal and know that I am going to be carrying a 35-40 pounds (too much?) backpack, it might motivate me.  LovefromPhilly - I was going to run today and didn't make it either. It's actually been cold and foggy in Denver, and that doesn't entice me to do much, so no run for me. I did run over the weekend, but I need to find it in me SOMEWHERE to do some yoga or to swim. I had sort of a bad week last week - my oncologist misdiagnosed my PET scan (radiologist two weeks ago misdiagnosed CT scan.... prompting my oncologist to suggest PET scan)\u2026 anyway, I had one early in the morning - went by myself because husband out of town - went back a few hours later. She read the results before radiologist did and thought she saw progression to my lungs. (first radiologist had thought I had something in my perionatal area... abdomen, basically...he was wrong too. Nothing there) For three hours I was a total basket case... as was the rest of my family... and then she called (I was in a meeting and didn't answer) and then texted to tell me that she'd made a mistake - the radiologist had read it and I was fine... still totally NED. There is more to the story, but that's it in a nutshell. I swear, that day took so much out of me....even though relieved, I was SO drained all week.  Thanks for letting me vent, and for the continued motivation!  XO Andrea",

I did that trip with my dad a million years ago and loved it. I have been tell my husband that I need a REAL adventure - I suggested Mt. Kilamajaro, and he reminded me that perhaps we should start with something in our own backyard instead of traveling to Kenya. (always the logical one.... ) I would love to hear what you did and where you went in Wyoming. And... I am so impressed with KarPC for going solo. I wish I had the courage to do that. I go on my \"girls hiking trips\" but that usually involves about 12 women, and doing it alone sounds very peaceful.  On my cramps - I actually haven't had Perjeta for years. My SE's were pretty severe, and my oncologist didn't think the benefits of adding it to Herceptin outweighed them, so I've been getting Herceptin only for about 5 years. Mine seem to happen in cycles too - worse after an infusion, and better a few weeks after... and ALOT better if I happen to skip one. I know now that the Herceptin does make my neuropathy worse. Mine isn't painful - my right foot is just totally numb and cramps easily. I take one Lyrica a day, and that totally helps. I used to take more, but I gained a ton of weight so I have cut back as much as I can. One in the morning does the trick in terms of taking away the numbness.  LovefromPhilly - so impressed with the Abs class. If I did THAT, I would completely and totally cramp up!  You are all so inspiring with your commitment to staying active on an every day basis. I wish I didn't work....

No camping - we staying in the Point Reyes Lodge. We did a ten mile hike the first day, and I was a little bummed because it was so foggy that you really couldn't see anything, and the terrain wasn't very interesting.

I am way behind in posting... just caught up on what you all did over the last 10 days - 2 weeks and as usual, you are amazing! Love reading about all the classes, camping, outside activity, etc. I am having a hard time during the week. Work has been crazy and even though I intend to fit in a work out, I don't. I did run 5 miles yesterday and another 5.5 today in spite of the fact that it's freezing here in Denver. I was going to ski today, but the low was going to be 4 and the high 20 up in the mountains, so I opted out. Katy - we Nordic ski, snowshoe and downhill during the winter.  I need to get into the gym though, and try some of the classes that you guys are talking about. Our company does give us \"snow days\" in December, which is basically every Friday off, so at least I will have a nice long 3 day weekend to get some things in. Still need yoga and swimming. I sound like a broken record.....  I got an Echo on Friday for the first time in 5 years, and am curious about what it will say. Being on Herceptin, I am supposed to get them every 6 months or so...? For some reason my oncologist never worries about it, so I finally insisted that she order one. I am sure my heart is fine, but you never know. Does anyone else here get those regularly?  Hope you all have a great week!  XO Andi ",

I had mine... saw the results but didn't understand them. Emailed my oncologist and got an email back from the nurse saying that \"The Echo was Normal.\" That was it; four words. I am very grateful to be NED but I think sometimes when patients are in \"maintenance mode\" as my oncologist calls it, they forget that you still get very anxious about procedures and results and there is not as much communication. I've been running some but that's it. Twice last weekend and yesterday and I will go again today. It's a beautiful day here in Denver - sunny and supposed to get to 60 degrees. I DID sign UP for Yoga so that is a start, right?  There is a beginner class tonight that I am planning to go to. If I get there, I will take a selfie (which I normally hate, especially when I am the only one in it!) and post it here so you can help to hold me accountable going forward. I had an infusion last weekend and I am getting those weird abdominal muscle cramps (what are they called again?) and my biggest fear is that I am going to be in the middle of a class and not be able to breathe or move and totally cause a scene.  LoriCA, how are you doing? I've said this before, but it always amazes me when people can do ANYTHING when they are getting treatments like Taxol. I must be a lightweight, because I didn't move for 6 months. I hope you were able to bounce back after the crash day AND that the Taxol has brought that tumor growth to a fast halt. Totally agree with you on the mind/body connection. I am glad that you are somewhere warm so at the very least, you can get out and walk.  KatyK - I have never experienced an adrenaline rush, but I do notice breathing issues when I am hiking at altitude. Wearing a heart monitor is a good idea so you can rule that out. You've been active for so long - in the mountains - you must have a strong heart!  What's everybody doing for the holidays? I am really hoping I can page myself this year, not get stressed out with a house full of people, and take the time to get some sort of activity in every day. We are leaving on a trip to Argentina the day after Christmas. I know we will be doing lots of walking and we are going to be doing some horse back riding (does that count?) so hoping to counteract the eating and drinking we will also be doing.  Hope everyone is having a good weekend!

I am an intense, but slow skier - I love steep runs but make lots of turns so it's good for/hard on my legs. Last Sunday I took a fall (which I always try to avoid, convinced that my poor bones will break) and ended up skidding down the mountain head first and upside down for a while. A nice man came and helped me up - which is the hardest part for me. Anyway, great day - some snow, some sun and good to be outside.  Nothing this week except walking the dog and shoveling snow. It was negative 5 here in Denver last night, so when I get home I want to stay home. I need to make up for it this weekend - hopefully another run and some more yoga. Keep posting!

In the last year we have moved from Colorado to California and then back to Colorado again, so things have been a little crazy. I did lots of running and hiking in both places; was lucky enough to live about 50 yards from a Northern CA beach and spent lots of time running and walking. Joined a trail running group and had a lot of fun exploring the trails in the Santa Cruz mountains. I actually did well because of the altitude; California has so much more air! Really loved living there. Now back in Colorado and hiking with my hiking group every weekend and running a bit. Entered a half marathon in CA in November... ..really hoping to do it. I have been on one version of this thread or another for five years... every year I say I am going to do Yoga and SWIM (which I hate) and every year I don't do it.... so I am committing to work those in! I have also had some weight gain. I think it's the Lyrica that I take for my chemo induced neurophathy.  (or maybe just the fact that I am getting older, but I prefer to blame the drugs) Fun to see some of you getting together, and all of the pictures, and the fact so many of you have been here in Colorado enjoying our beautiful outdoors!

Although I was dx almost two years ago Stage IV, I am fairly new to BCO and have learned more from all of you in three months than I did in the last 8 years I have been dealing with BC. I've never heard the term \"remission\" from any of my oncologists (I've had several) but I often wondered about the difference between \"stable\" and \"NED\". I've asked my current onc and all three of the NP's in the office at separate times, and I've had different answers from all of them. It seems that they can each interpret what they see on a scan differently. My oncologist refers to me as NED because she can't see any \"active FDC uptake\" and from looking at the notes in my scan, I think the words \" No Evidence of Disease\" appear several times. However, one of the NP's said she's never classify me that way because in looking at my scan you will ALWAYS see evidence of cancer; even though the tumors are gone, you can see where they were. (bone mets) So to her I am \"stable\". As far as the comments from the poster in regards to the original poster, I think RosesToses nailed it when she said that we all come into this with different backgrounds and experience, and I'd add personalities (probably someone already did)  I don't know what the original poster was referring to, but I have seen similar stories, similar posts.... probably we all have. My feelings were complicated; on the one hand, I was truly happy for that person....thinking that if they were really \"cured\" then it meant hope for other Stage IV women and men, if not me. However, I was also a little skeptical and maybe a little fearful....thinking like someone else said that it would be difficult to retract that statement if you then had progression. I don't know if that's right or wrong...I guess if it were me, I'd handle it differently. Would I have hope? Yes. Would I have enough confidence to verbalize it? No. Always in the back of my mind I'd worry that I was being overly confident. That's probably the wrong approach, now that I write this down..... but it would be mine.

I am so sorry to hear about your hard day and being in the hospital. I have been in similar situations....while going through chemo four years ago, I had horrible plural effusions on both lungs. They were so filled with fluid (although not cancerous... that was just my bones and liver...) that I seriously couldn't walk down the hall without gasping for air. I had them drained many times and finally ended up having surgery on both lungs (two surgeries - separately - two weeks in the hospital) ... called Pluerodesis (sp?)...I am sure your doctor has mentioned it. While they were horrible and I was stuck in bed with huge tubes coming out of my ribs, they did the trick, and I haven't had any issues with fluid build up since then. Also, when I was initially diagnosed Stage IV, I had bone mets so wide spread that I also had compression fractures (don't ask me how I was walking around... no idea...) ... some that wouldn't heal on their own and I had another surgery called kyphoplasty which was actually an outpatient surgery and almost immediately relived my pain. So please do hang in there and don't lose hope. I know it's hard, especially when you are in the hospital... I hope that they can find solutions for you that will bring you some comfort. Sending good thoughts for healing... XO Andrea  ",

First time in 2 years for both of those... I have been having PET scans every six months but now my insurance company has decided not to pay for them. So, I too had that hot feeling of peeing your pants. I usually take some sort of anti anxiety pill when I have mine and I completely spaced, so my heart was racing the whole time. I didn't feel badly afterwards, though..... I drank as much water as possible and really didn't notice any affects. My next appointment with my onc is SEPTEMBER 4th, so she is supposed to call me with the results tomorrow. Needless to say, I have been freaking out most of the weekend. Also, my health care system automatically generates test results as they get them.... so I have also been watching my email every couple of hours. My tumor markers (which are good indicators for me) have been at the \"high side of normal\" for several months. I have been NED for almost two years now so hoping to continue that trend.... but of course I feel like every little ache and pain means it's back. I also dropped Perjeta from my monthly infusions.... and actually dropped the infusions for about six months last year because the side effects were starting to be so bad...... so I just want tomorrow to come and I WANT THE RESULTS! So happy for everyone that has recent positive news.... and will be thinking of everyone this week who is waiting for results too. I hate cancer, and I hate scans, but I am so glad I have BCO and such a strong group of women to share this very unwanted journey with. Thank you for being there. XO Andrea",

No rhyme or reason as to why I would have them...I am sure subcounscious stress working it's way out. When I have mine all the air literally leaves my windpipes... it's like my heart stops for several beats and then goes again, and suddenly my lungs realize there is no air. It's terrible.  Anyway - just wanted to add my two cents on the whole topic. I still get them (OBVIOUSLY) but no more frequently than I used to. And wow RonnieKay - I find it amazing that your doctor said you don't have to be scanned. I'm sort of jealous! I am still getting CT and Bone every six months, although I have also been stable for 3.5 years and TM's are always in normal range. Maybe I should talk to my oncologist about that. My next one is in September. Love and hugs to both of you and to everyone else here! XOXO Andi",

(or \"gorgeous\" as my oncologist says when mine come back NED/clean) Are you still getting PET scans? I am no longer able to do that - insurance wont' pay as they say it's \"investigational\"\".... so I get CT/Bone scans. Just had mine two weeks ago and spent two days in complete anxiety... but thankfully they were all okay.

I actually had to get my results via EMAIL... ugh... my oncologist didn't call me this time... so nerve wracking to get that email and then have to read it. BUT - all good news.... both CT scan and bone scan showed no progression. Whew. I like the PET scans better because they start out with \"No Evidence of Disease:\"... but with these I actually had to go through all of the details ... I needed a Xanex just for those few minutes. My oncologist did send me an email a few days later and said :\"terrific results\"..... so I was glad I was reading it right. So glad to hear so many positive results from so many of you! Annie, KT1966, Music Lover, Aoihobean (did I spell that right?) Ronnie Kay, Jenny Lee ( I had my ovaries shut down too...).. and RosesToses.... GREAT NEWS!
