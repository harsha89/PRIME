I went for an MRI to check status of tumor and am disappointed and worried because the tumor is still there and has only shrank a little from initial diagnosis.. :-( I received chemo first because of the high aggression of tumor..  stage 2b  possibly 3...  grade 9.. er+36% pr- her2- ki67- 44%  lymphnode involvement  started around 2cm,  blew up after  biopsy to almost 5cm,  due to swelling apparently,  now after 5 rounds it's 1.9X1.2cm..  shouldn't chemo have gotten rid of tumor???   I'm 31yo with 2 kiddos and am scared to death that I'm not gonna get to see them grow up...
