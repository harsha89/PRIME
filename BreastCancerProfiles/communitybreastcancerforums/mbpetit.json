Please do not post if you are unsure of what you are posting.  I know when I first came here over a year ago I read everything and took it all to heart.  We are here to support each other by giving advice and passing along current and accurate information, not to scare people or diagnosis them with metastic cancer.  I had 1 positive node...and I was devasted, but my doctor has never implied that my cancer has metastisized, nor should he.  Please do not scare anyone who may be new here looking for information. Just my 2 cents....",
