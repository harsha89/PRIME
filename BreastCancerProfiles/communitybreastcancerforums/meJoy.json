For me,the hardest part is my own immediate family (husb, kids). My BC was diagnosedin Nov and my uniMX was done in January- to them,my having BC is over. They have no understanding that its not over..and I have told them so. I DONT want to be defined by my BC, but I want them to understand that the process is not over.   My arimidex is kicking my butt with SE (of which I have told them about it)., and I still have my ulstra sounds and mri's I have to do at intervals and worry the heck out of me. . And I still have my exchange surgery next month.   Mostly there are no more questions about how I'm feeling.   Yet, I have to understand that for them,this long road  happened several months ago in Nov, and once I had my MX...its all over. What more is there to say? Some do not know HOW or WHAT to say. Some think its all over and that I beat it. My sister told me (and get this my MX was this past Jan.), that I am cancer free so what is there to think of.  I do think some people have to deny what's going on with us.   We go through denial, and so do our \"others\".  Some dont want to know we're still hurting, that we think about this all the time, and some know we think about it all the time, yet dont know the words to say.  .",
