So far everything has suggested that it hasn't gone through her lymph nodes, but we won't know for sure until the results come back. Hopefully good news and good health is coming for us and for you. I think I read you are getting a lumpectomy soon ML, I hope that goes well. Prayers for you",

She starts radiation next month I believe,and then hormone treatment. Does anyone know if it's normal for her arm to be feeling tingly/numb/and bruised a few days after the surgery? I figure it must be normal since they removed lymph nodes, but I just wanted to check. Also sorry if this is a dumb question but does this mean that her cancer journey is coming to an end basically? Just radiation,hormone treatment for a few years, and shes cancer free? I'm worried she's going to get cancer again in her other breast tissue and in her other breast, and by the time we found out it'll be more advanced. I think I worry about her more than she worries about herself lol. We haven't met with her oncologist since before the surgery, we'll be seeing him again soon, so I will ask him all of this stuff, but this has happened so fast and its all so new and confusing and I'd like to hear from you ladies. Thanks",
