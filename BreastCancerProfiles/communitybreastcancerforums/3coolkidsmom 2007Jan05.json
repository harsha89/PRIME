(am having PBMs with DIEP reconstruction for LCIS July 23)He spent A LOT of time talking about the risk for a cancer diagnosis following prophalactic mastectomy. He estimated this risk to be as high as 5% because of the breast cells he may not be able to remove during the surgery. When I asked about nipple-sparing, he said he had never done the procedure before but would ask around and would consider doing it during my surgery. He said he understood my desire for a nipple sparing procedure because I would be able to retain all of the feeling in my nipple with this procedure.( I have never heard of anyone retaining all of the feeling in the nipple, even with nipple sparing.) I really liked the surgeon, but he didn't instill a lot of confidence. On the way home, I kind of freaked out. I am left feeling like I need to cancel my surgery and start all over finding new surgeons. Is this just me being scared, or an instinct I need to act on? Help!!!! Amy H Log in to post a reply",
