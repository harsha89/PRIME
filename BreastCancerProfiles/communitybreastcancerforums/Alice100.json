Sick or tired or maybe fine?  I've stocked up on everything I can think of that I may or may not need.  The worst part is not knowing and the waiting. I just want to be there and get this done! I am relatively quiet on the site, but I can't tell you how comforting it is to read all the posts and know that there are people going through the same thing as me.  Before I discovered this website, I thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown!  Alice ",
