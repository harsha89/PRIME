Switching to oral pain meds later in the day. started moving my arm by the afternoon very very slowly. :) brought a stress ball with me and started using that in the afternoon too. no nausea or vomitting from the anesthesia. :) for the rest having surgery this week, best of luck! make you arm and chest muscles as strong as possible before surgery and eat protein after surgery. :)",

I'm hoping for a pcr too but then strange things are happening. if it makes you feel better, i feel the tumor shrink but the liquid takes over. So physical inspection doesn't seem like the tumor is shrinking. And some days it feels sore and heavy especially during my period (one more strange thing-- my period hasn't stopped all through EC and current chemo) but i'm still hoping for the best bec i will meet the surgeon soon and got an ultrasound and asked the technician to get images to determine if the fluid is another cyst different from my tumor. Likely that my MO and surgeon will discuss options",

I keep notes (in a personal journal). short notes on what day which side effect occured and update my MO in subsequebt infusions. some of these side effects are manageable on your own and will show up at around the same time as the next infusion and this helps you prepare for it. But still important that you tell your doctor so they can monitor. especially when you don't feel good. your MO will also give you a timeline which days after each infusion you expect a specific side effect. it's how the ladies here also keep track of how they're feeling after each infusion. the timeline will help you plan out what to do during days when you have energy when to go out and when it is required to wear a mask when meeting up with friends. try to find distractions too (tv series, funny videos, coloring books, deep breathing for 5 minutes in the morning, if you're luckier than most maybe you'll still have the taste for coffee). so that you don't focus on the side effects and it doesn't get magnified ten times over. you can do this. we're here. but you need to keep your MO well informed. Oh and give yourself a little treat for completing your first infusion... like a foot massage :)   ",

Hope99, i must admit i have had my moments and bad days too. But focus in the fact that chemo is systemic. that it hunts down possible stray cells that may have broken away. when I was first diagnosed, a cardiologist (long story) told me: never start treatment if you don\u2019t believe you will get better. Trust the treatment. Maybe a meditation app will help. (try Headspace) I was not one for meditation but i found that it helps to just breathe sometimes. and on some days to let yourself go through the worry and the fear. But don\u2019t let it take over. In the same way you are able to pick something from google that makes you feel bad, maybe try picking something that makes you feel better. i read so many things about having TNBC. but when i read that chemo works well for it, i knew that was the point i had to stop reading and hang on to that one article. the rest, let your medical team handle your questions for you. they have spent years dealing with cases like yours. the internet can be a tricky place. Blair, i hope your back feels better. :) been having trouble too from all the sitting/lying down. but i try to stretch it out twice a day. Rljes and magari, good luck on thw next round. we are with you :) ladies who are having their next round this week, best of luck. today i had a plate of spaghetti and boy did my taste buds celebrate. after two days of busted taste buds. if anything, each good meal that i have, i appreciate it more. :)",

Never start treatment if I didn't believe i was going to get better 2. Now is the time to accept all the help that is being offered. And I think what she said has helped me a lot. And the other hardest part for me is since i'm doing neo adjuvant chemo, i can physically feel the reactions of the tumor and some days it's encouraging and others it can be discouraging. and gettinf more bad news can sometimes make it worse so it's always a conscious effort of being positive all the time. SOme days i can manage being positive on my own, some days i ask for help from people around me. and if it happens to be a bad day, i let myself go through it. Every single thought i ever had about BC i write a lot too in my personal journal. and sometimes the meditation app helps. my brother also told me something: don\u2019t think of chemo as something that\u2019s bad for you. think of it as medicine for you. which kind of helps me avoid being anxious when i go for infusions.",

Guess who had a reaction to carboplatin today! ..... me. 🙋🏻♀️my brother walked into my space in the infusion room (patients are separated from other patients woth curtians) and was shocked to see swelling in JUST my sinus area. i had a big red stripe on my skin only on my tzone and my lips and nose were swollen. Nurses were there to handle it and another doctor. which is a good thing. we were all calm and when the other nurses asked my attending nurse what happened i just said \"i tried to put rouge/blush on my face... it didn't come with instructions\" 🤪 anyway they stopped carboplatin the second they saw it, monitored my blood pressure, and gave allergy meds and also waited until the swelling subsided before releasing me. And i have to take claritin until saturday. and avoid allergens until saturday. and also a follow up with my doctor tomorrow if symptoms persist. My doctor also said get an xray because the past two weeks, they were not able to get my carboplatin infusion to top speed (490-500mL per hour) and were giving me carboplatin at 400mL per hour during infusion 7 and 8. So they want to check my port if it's twisting inside or something. I'll know more about the next steps (reduce dosage, slow down infusion, or remove carboplatin) once i see my oncologist.:) I'd post photos but i think my brother callingb me rudolph for 20 mins was enough 🙃",

Or maybe i\u2019l just keep going without recon if by the time i decide one i\u2019ll get used to the UMX. there\u2019s so many puzzle pieces to treatment that it just consistently keeps yougrieving or feeling like you keep losing something. and sometimes i think i\u2019m stronger than i am but at the same time this whole thing makes you realize how fragile i am too. anyway... i hope this post wasn\u2019t too much of a downer. i hope things pick up... long treatment road ahead still in front of me. you ladies will be done with chemo and maybe less than a handful of us will still be going to surgery then rads. the gif works btw, frozentoes :)",

Someone has also recommended the same book to me. I\u2019ll try to read that next.

(Think tom yum soup without chilli). also water with any citrus juice (lemon, lime, orange,) will also help with the metallic taste. the sourness of it also helps produce more saliva in the mouth so that you avoid mouth sores too. haven't had a single mouth sore so far. I take Emend. and then another prescription for the first 3 days to deal with the nausea. i have hyperacidity meds (esomeprazole) on standby in case that happens during first 3 days after infusion. or i take them too on days that i have prescription meds and stop after day 4. Also probiotic drink (yakult) or a small serving of yoghurt or keffir maybe 3-4 times a week to rebalance good gut bacteria. especially on days i have meds/antibiotics. tons of water and fiber... and also prunes for constipation. for some, figs also help.",

Re: temperature, you don't have to monitor all the time. if you feel fine then let it be. I start monitoring only when i feel a fever coming on. MO gave guidelines such as if my temp hits 37.8 (celsius) i have to start taking antibiotics immediately. and if my temp consistently stays over 38 for several hours, ten i have to go to the ER. because if your body is fighting an infection the doctors need to get ahead of that and help your body recover faster. ask your MO what their guideline are and then stick by it. some MO will say antibiotics at 38, ER at 39. i had a scare once where i went out and kept switching between warm temp and airconditioning in an afternoon (outdoor mall, instore airconditioning, eating al fresco) and even without cancer, an entire afternoon switching temps with big differences usually makes a person feel like they'll run a fever. I was between 37.6 to 38.2 for a few hours on a friday night but was so inconsitent i took a tylenol and slept instead. NExt mornig temp had stabilized but i was monitoring every 2-3 hours and restinguntil Sunday. Outside if that one incident i never stringently monitored temp otherwise i would be stuck and adding to my worries for no reason at all. ALSo helps to have an in-ear thermometer. nurses told me that in-ear thermometers take accurate internal temperature. compared to getting your temperature with the digital ones that take temp from forehead surface, or digital ones that still need to take temp via armpit.",

I miss going out too. friends drop by and that\u2019s good i love them for it but cabin fever is terrible! hope99, i don\u2019t know anyone really. But i like to take a peek at the survivor threads here once in a while when i wonder what life will be like after treatment. rljes, hahaha that cracked me up. i would have loved to join you for a joint... i'm happy you found relief! ...i'll admit some days, treatment and having this much time just gets so rough mentally that i find myself wishing i could sneak in a cigarette somewhere within chemo. and then i feel guilty for all the months i've managed to quit and lose the urge have a cig. been having a rough time lately having to accept what's in store for me surgery-wise. so much grief. grief for the sense of normal that i have lost, the normal life that i had to give up, the parts of me (literal and figurative) that i am about to lose... and i guess some of them can be earned back. i just want that guarantee to be there too. no uncertainties. bah! wishful thinking. Anyway i don'y want to spiral into a foul mood (i think i'm still in the middle of it)... but man this sucks, this is rough, and yes i am harsher on myself than anyone else will ever be. saw the pilot episode of Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. Pretty good. Amazon prime has the pilot on youtube for free. Thinking of diving into a subscription to see the rest of the show. Any good books you ladies have managed to come across the past few months? :)",

I wonder about the big things and the little things like will instill be able to carry a backpack on both shoulders with a laptop in it or will i be able to travel as often as i used to or what will life be like after after UMX.

BUT! i was able to watch star wars at the cinema yesterday with my brothers. less than 30 people for a cinema that holds maybe 100. and was able to eat so much stuff before my taste buds have taken a vacation this week. so i will be back to weird food and tons of water today and maybe a little bit tomorrow. but i promised to make food for christmas. i get to boss my brothers around (haha) and hopefully the food won\u2019t taste weird. 😜 In general i watch the following: big bang theory, how i met your mother, friends, gilmore girls, brooklyn nine-nine, shark tank, fresh off the boat. these are tv series where i can just show a random episode and still laugh. i\u2019ve been told the new show written by Amy Sherman Palladino (gilmore girls and bunheads) is really good. The wonderful Ms. Paisel? So i\u2019m considering subscribing to Amazon Prime Video to watch that because i love how she writes. :) I busted out the Little Prince from my bookshelf. it\u2019s a book that as brought me comfort the past 15 years and Jerry Spinelli\u2019s Star Girl. i remember reading that until 4am and crying haha! but also reading other things. Timur Vermes\u2019 Look Who\u2019s Back is funny but needs historical context and a bit of knowledge on what modern day Germany is. I hope you ladies have a wonderful weekend and a wonderful holiday! hugs and strength to you all!",

      "Content": "Dec 29, 2017 12:13AM - edited Dec 29, 2017 12:17AM by mkn86 Hi Avalon! Welcome to the thread. :) taxol (paclitaxel) and taxotere (docetaxel) are i think both plant-based chemotherapy drugs. in general patients get allergic reactions to them that are preempted by benadryl. there are cases where the reaction to them is extreme that the doctors decide tk switch. when they first gave me paclitaxel, it took about 3-4 hours. they slow the drip down significantly to watch for allergic reactions the first time. which i think is also the protocol for paclitaxel. my succeeding infusions, the drip starts slow and then every ten minutes the nurses come and speed it up a little bit until they reach max of around 230ml per hour. so my second infusion onwards was down to 2 hours for paclitaxel and then they follow it with carboplatin (light sensitive hence covered in light protective bags) which can be administered up to 500ml per hour max. abraxane is the medicine their protocol usually says is the next chemotherapy drug to give if there is an allergic reaction to the previous two. abraxane is milder and more tolerable they said. At least in my case, first line of defense is cyclophosphamide and epirubicin (most doctors give adriamycin and gets abbreviated to AC), followed by taxol and depending on your case may or may not be given with carboplatin. then abraxane if there is a reaction to the taxol/taxotere drugs. some doctors give taxol first then AC (or EC). Hope this helps :)",

How else are we moved to support and see beauty in people we have never met? i just hope that eventually i can look at those scars and see ONLY the good things about it, like getting rid of my rogue cells, and saving my life. :) ultrasound and a mammogram tomorrow. i am more curious than hopeful about the effect of chemo on my tumor. and see also what the plastic surgeon says. initially the decision was they'll need tissue from elsewhere to close up the incision from UMX and it cannot be just a skin graft otherwise it won't hold up well during radiation. so i have asked them to pick a low risk donor site if needed so i can focus on UMX healing and get through rads. reconstruction, maybe later... once i get past high risk years. if at all. i am exhausted from being the patient and i just want to be healthy again and be out and about and be able to enjoy being at home instead of dealing with cabin fever. I have started drinking decaf green tea with lemon and turmeric. maybe more as a security blanket between chemo and surgery. and thinking of making a giant pitcher of that that i can drink through out the day. i went to run errands with my dad last friday and it was less than 2 hours of (brisk) walking in a tiny mall to get the errands done but it wiped me out for the rest of the day. i was awake until the evening but i felt tired and fell asleep at 930pm. but i was also able to make soup for dinner so still happy despite still not having energy. meowmmy and rljes, PASS THE VODKA! haven't had a drink since all of this started hahaha! (frankly i wouldn't mind a joint at this point) tina, i hope the lasagna has kept everyone happy! magari, happy grilling party! orangedaisy, i wish there was a back to normal switch too kate, i love cooking and cleaning and was really frustrated when i had to ease up on them too. made me grumpy and i felt like i wasn\u2019t achieving anything resting all day. hope99, i had taxol instead of taxotere but they are derived from the same family of treatment drugs (perhaps the same plant even). I'm not sure if my input will help. but taxol was more tolerable for me and nothing to be worried about. i had even more energy to do things (to worry about things) when it was just taxol without the carboplatin. frozentoes, congratulations!!! 🎉🎉 AC, i had epirubicin instead of adriamycin. if you consider infusion as day 1, I was tired usually day 3-5 after infusion, taste buds busted day 3-7, mask needed to wear them from day 4 to day 10. I had to take Emend from day 1 to day 3 and also Metoclopramide from day 1 to day 3. Since there are post chemo meds on these days, i also took Esomeprazole day 1 to day 4 just to help with acidity if any... otherwise i avoided hyperacidity by avoiding acidic food during these days (coffee, tomatoes, citrus fruits). And then day 5 onward i slowly reintroduce them back to my diet. SUn is shining and the air is cool today where i'm sitting. :) i can hear birds chirping outside the window... late risers as it is 11am, and i can smell lunch being prepared (fried milkfish marinated in vinegar and garlic probably with steamed aubergines and fresh tomatoes). Tonight it's my turn to make dinner: chicken with bell peppers and onions in teriyaki sauce with steamed mustard greens and rice. i haven't been cooking throughout chemo and i'm glad i can slowly ease into it. Have a good weekend everyone! :)",

Emend is one of them along with another that i was required to take for 3 days after infusion. and during days when i have no appetite or to avoid nausea i just have small snacks and light meals. soups with veggies, chicken noodle soup, local congee (savory rice porridge flavored with garlic and ginger and spring onions with potatoes and chicken with a liiiiiittle bit of lemon juice), snack on roasted nuts. for some people, ginger tea helps too. :) on days when you have energy back, make food that you can freeze so you can reheat them on days when you don't have much energy :) they don't inject neulasta all the time here (or to all patients) so we do have considerable downtime. so my doctor was also very specific when ishoudl avoid crowds, wear masks, etc",

Tina, sounds like a lovely funny memory to have despite the circumstances. i fully agree in laughing whenever we can. Ladies, having a rough evening. My wbc are too low and doctor has said to repeat blood counts tomorrow. I asked if this means i take a blood test early and trying to get chemo in the afternoon or if it's moved to Friday and i haven't gotten confirmation from my doctor's office. I know it's okay to push back a day or two I would just feel much better if the confirmation came from the medical experts, that's all. Sounds completely irrational but it's just one of those days where i don't know what to do next and i think it's too late to call or maybe my brothers can call the doctor on my behalf JUST THIS ONCE and figure out what to do next, or just sort out stuff so i know if i should start on pre-chemo meds tonight or not. and with christmas holidays being so close (which means if i need an infusion that day they might admit me instead), ad nauseam. One of those days when i wish i could just truly be a patient and show up at my infusion not think about all these things. With me trying not to stress out all week and then failing the blood test i sort of wish i let myself be sad at some point this week. It feels like today's a bust, you know? Anyway, enough moping. Thank you ladies for listening. Tomorrow, the sun rises, i try again. Fingers crossed that dose 7 of 12 happens this week! :)",

Welcome to the thread. :) If you\u2019re comfortable to do so, maybe you can display the diagnosis and we can also respond based on the BC subtype? the unknown can be scary but we\u2019re here with you. :) just a few tips: - ask your MO for the expected schedule of reactions. you doctor will be able to tell you something along the lines of day 1-2 you\u2019re fine, day. 3-5 energy crash, day 3-7 taste buds go, day 4-10 wear a mask and avoid crowded okaces when going out, day 7 taste buds start returning to normal. knowing how your body might react will help you manage :) it might not be exactly on the dot and may vary for each infusion and each individual but it helps to know what to anticipate. - there will be a host of medicines that will help manage side effects. ask your MO about them already and better to have them handy before you start chemo. You don\u2019t want to have to go out and get them when you\u2019re already in the middle of dealing with a side effect. some people will manage side effects through adjusting food instead of taking the meds. but have the meds handy anyway. some of them will be something for Diarrhea, Constipation, Hyperacidity, emergency antibiotics, supplements, paracetamol, allergy meds, painkillers, etc. - ask about your anti nausea and anti vomitting meds. your doctor will have recommendations on what works for you. i was taking prescription anti-nausea meds up until 3-days infusion - emergency protocols you need to ask your MO. my doctor recommends taking antibiotics if my temp hits 37.8 Celsius. and heading to the ER if i consistently hit above 38 Celsius. some doctors say antibiotics at 38, ER at 39 Degrees. :)",

If you\u2019re having trouble with all the information, i agree with klvans. take someone with you to the appointments or write down what your doctor says. i used to take notes during consultations. look, if it helps to stop you from googling all these things on the internet that scares you, there is a book that you can pick up about breast cancer written by a doctor. it is by far the most helpful book i have read and has helped me stop googling a lot of things. but that means all questions i had wwhen i was reading the book, i was directing all of it to my medical team.  yes having cancer is scary, yes going through chemo is not easy but scaring yourself silly does not help. you need to also be stress-free in order to heal properly. and i have also met others where they literally picked one book to read about breast cancer and resolved to move forward with treatment with what they\u2019ve read from one book. it really doesn\u2019t help to scare yourself with all the information out there. Also keep yourself busy. try to focus on hobbies that make you happy.",

      "Content": "Jan 13, 2018 09:39AM - edited Jan 13, 2018 10:34AM by mkn86 hi everyone, checking in. I've been off the boards for a while. Needed to deal with a few emotions i was not ready for. Did not take it well when my oncologist mentioned i mighr still need a mastectomy after chemo instead of a lumpectomy. meaning the chemo is not shrinking the tumor enough which means my tumor was already well over 5cm by the time i started chemo. My last ultrasound said it was at 7cm (taken between EC and taxol) and also this red patch on my skin hasn't gotten better. brought out fear and frustration. but i've calmed down about it now and i've read about some of the options and i\u2019ve seen pictures and i\u2019ve read of other ladies in threads here at BCO and what their life was like after all the surgery options and why they chose what they chose and it all sounds logical and reassuringto me. Still a tough pill to swallow of course but i\u2019m working on it. Aaaaand finished dose 10 of 12 yesterday. :) It was delayed by one day because of low blood counts. My oncologist removed Carboplatin from my meds considering last week's allergic reaction. Xray says my port is intact and in the right place. However, 20 mins into infusion of taxol i started getting palpitations. I usually sleep through it because of allergy meds but this time i woke up with a start. Anyway they had to stop infusion and called in an emergency ECG and emergency 2D Echo to check for any chemo-induced heart damage. They all came out normal. Once my blood pressure was stable for a good 20mins they started taxol again but at a lower speed as extra precaution. And i had 2 doctors and 2 nurses monitoring me every 5-10 minutes for the rest of the infusion. All good and happy with the medical team they are phenomenal :) I got through dose 10 :) i think the palpitations were a fluke thankfully. Or maybe it was just me thinking about surgery. Anyway my MO is flying out to San Francisco next week for a convention and he says considering that i had palpitations he was not comfortable for me to have chemo while he's away. So Dose 11 will be delayed until he returns which is maybe 3-4 days worth of delay. It's okay though. I think my body needs to rest and i'm already looking forward to the extra days where food will taste exceptional and i will be able to walk and do things without getting winded. :) I promise to backread your posts and update myself on what has been going on with you ladies. In the meantime please cross your fingers that I am able to have the last 2 doses without any allergic reactions. final stretch and despite the setbacks i have every intention if seeing this through. I'm off to deal with fatigue and muscle and bone pain tomorrow. I wish you all strength and a good weekend :)",

It's like watching your screensaver move if i did that). they're protective and they do it based on side effects they understand (sometimes fixate on)... losing taste buds and appetite and fatigue. and even if it's 2018, my brothers of course are speechless when i try to reach out and talk about other side effects and treatment steps that are limited to the female body (chemopause, hot flashes, cramps, mastectomy, oophorectomy, etc) my mother ironically reacts the same as my brothers heheh. they are struggling and i see all of them trying to overcome the struggle to support me and i love them for that. And on difficult days i am just thankful for friends and this forum for additional support. it's damn difficult sometimes. being a patient is tiring and resting is also tiring (does that make sense?) and sometimes having cancer makes me feel like it has turned me into a whiney person. Some days i think defiance gets me through instead of optimism. Hahaha I think about wanting to go back to my life before diagnosis already. and some days i wonder how exactly i will go back to it. (One day at a time) I digress. sorry. the point is good bloodwork and it's my last taxol infusion today. hopefully no allergic reactions. I'm nervous about surgery but wanting to go to the next step for treatment and i will check in after infusion. enjoy the weekend! :",

I was tired of dealing with the side effects all day. It did me more harm to push through with chemo on schedule than to allow myself a fee days of delay with some of the infusions. i hope that you rest a bit. and donsomething that you enjoy. Be strong blair but also, be proud of what you have accomplished. because we are also proudnof you. : ladies, i thank younfor your messages! I am still dealing with fatigue today but i promise to catch up with reading.",

Rljes - good to hear about the bloody mary and beer! some days i think i will have a hard time making that shift into a completely healthy lifestyle really. :)) nonahope - praying for good news for you! :) blair - i hope your back pain doesn\u2019t get worse. the coughing thing i had during taxol. it really dries everything out. try more fluids (water prefferably as anything with sugar will make it worse)and a diffuser in case that helps with the scratchy throat.",
