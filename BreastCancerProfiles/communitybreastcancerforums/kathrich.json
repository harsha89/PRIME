I have met with Dr Sardi and plan to have HIPEC done there next month but I am in dire need of case precedence to battle the insurance company. I am looking for anyone that is willing to share who had the HIPEC and had breast cancer metastisized in this manner. I would need some info from them so we can build a case precedence. Did you have the procedure done at Mercy? Would you be willing to assist me? Do you know of others?",
