Had BM with expanders on May 22nd.  That was 3 weeks 2 days ago.  Last friday I was feeling pretty good.  Not great but good.  I have had a Problem with the pain since surgery.  I am taking Oxycodone everyday.  They also started me on Plavix- a Blood thinner for a Heart problem they found 2 weeks before my surgery- I will need surgery for that this fall... Last Friday I said to my daughter...Maybe monday we can do a light work out.  The weekend went ok. Monday morning I get up & go to the couch to rest.  We went for a walk around the block mid morning & I hardly made it.  I had to stop & rest & catch my breath several times.  The rest of the day I laid on the couch & shivered & sweated all day.  No Fever.  Checked it several times. The rest of the week went similar.  I got weaker each day...To wear I dont have the energy to shower or walk up stairs.  I saw my PS (another story) But I dont have any signs of infection. So Thursday I call my PCP & schedule an Appt for Friday am.  I also called my Cardios Nurse & told her my symptoms & she didnt think it had anything to do with the Plavix- but would talk to him.  Never heard back from her. My Symptoms:  Extreme-Weakness, Tired, Nausea, Shortness of Breath, Headache. Chills & Sweats off & on. The shortness of breath is something I have had for 10 years- heart problem...But it is worse then it has ever been Friday my PCP checks me out.  Does my CBC & other tests.  Couldnt pee on demand to see if there is a bladder infection. (I never can)  My CBC is normal. My Thyroid is Normal.  My Hemoglobin which was 8.4 after surgery is back to normal 12.  Great- but I was assuming I was anemic & thats why I felt like this.  She did a D-Dime test which she called me with in the afternoon.  It was  Elevated & could mean I have a Blood clot in my chest.  So I had to get to the Imaging place for a CT scan or the ER.   30 minutes before I leave for the CT.  My New teen  driver calls me & said she got in a car accident.  She is fine- the car isnt.  Grrrr.  Not part of the story- but shows you a little of the stress here. Ok So I had my CT scan.  That was very painful being flat on my back & not having good arm movement at all yet & then having to raise my arms as High as i could (I can still only get them to elbow level)  Waited there & no  blood clot.  So that was very good news.  Allowed to leave -grabbed a Bite to eat & I got to go to same teens dance recital & sit in pain & with no energy for 4 hrs.  But its her last recital & I wasnt going to miss it. But I am still at a lose for my Symptoms. Dr doesnt know what to think...She thinks I should eat better...And see her in a week if things have not gotten better. Any ideas?  Anyone else feel much worse energy wise 3+ weeks after surgery then you did 1-2 weeks after?

( I know I need to find a different cardio) I did get myself off my time released Oxydodone over the weekend (I was taking 1 every 12 hrs)   I havent had any since Friday am. I am now taking 5 mg of regular Oxycodone about every 6-8 hrs.   I sometimes think I could go over 8 hrs...Then I wonder if the pain will be so bad...That it will be a while before I catch up....But really dont have a clue.  Neither my PS or PCP  are used to perscribing the drug for this long of a time. Hi Phyllis- Thanks.  Glad your friend is doing good.  Who knows when I should try to get my heart fixed.  Id say last Spring- When I tried to get them to find it!  Oh well to late for that now. Deja has been a good companion in helping me rest.  She is lazy & likes to cuddle. qsusie- how are you doing?  How did your weekend go? Pam",

My BS wanted to do an SNB on my good side.  He also didnt want me to have a BM.  he said why take off a healthy breast.  And I countered- Why do an SNB on a Healthy breast.  I just had a Mammo & an MRI & they all show me its clean...And you want me to keep my good breast...But you also dont trust your Scans  & want to do an SNB. ( I had previously had a Lumpectomy with SNB & the SNB made my Arm & Back very Numb & extremely sore- way worse then the Lumpectomy.  At the time of my BM 7 weeks later I was worried my left arm would never be the same- and some womens arms never are.  Mine is doing very good now-10 months later) I made my choice & skipped the SNB on my good side.  My Breast was clean altough it did have ADH. When I had my Heart surgery 3 weeks ago they took my blood pressure on my Good arm Every 15 minutes for 8 hours.  I was glad to have an arm to use. It is a very hard decision....One that you can only make & know what you will feel comfortable with. Pam",

I did not go to a LE therapist for this :o.  I did my own MLD ( I know I shouldnt without instruction)  I did tons of Deep breathing & I kept it elevated.  it was feeling alot better in 5 days...And much better in 8 days.

Sending Prayers & Hugs to you & Your kids.  Pam ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The Rainbow Bridge Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge. When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable. All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor; those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind. They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent; His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster. You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart. Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together.... Author unknown",

I felt just a little nauseated- but not much at all- considering it had been about 20 hrs since I ate.  I had a few crackers & some Ice water & they tasted good & helped with the nausea.  I went home about 2 1/2 hrs after my Surgery.

I choose a Bilateral Mastectomy with Immediate Reconstruction...Except my Surgeon wasnt listening to me.  So I had a Lumpectomy with SNB to start with.   And will have my BLM next week. Mine was also on my Left side and I worried about my Heart & Lung if I got Radiation.   (In hindsight that was good- because last week I found out  I have a hole in my heart.) So a Lump. & then Mastectomy later can be done. (If your Next tests show that as an Option still) It is 2 surgeries ...You might feel More healed after just a Lump.   I cant say for sure...since I havent had a Mastectomy yet...But I think it will be more painful. I felt pretty good from my Lumpectomy within a week.  The SNB took about 3 weeks to feel better.   4 weeks out I felt Well. It is a Personal decision & Hard to decide sometimes...Especially when you have a shorter time frame.   And no one can tell you what to do.  They can only give you their Opinion. Good Luck with your decision, Pam",

I just read through this thread & Found this \"21 Feb 2008 09:12 AM If I'm not mistaken, the Oncotype recurrence score is based on the assumption that you will be getting tamoxifen or an AI (such as Arimidex), whichever is appropriate.  I think the Oncotype test was originally designed to tell whether women with estrogen-sensitive tumors would do well on tamoxifen alone, or would need regular chemotherapy in addition to tamoxifen.  That work is being expanded to include aromatase inhibitors (AI) instead of tamoxifen in post-menopausal women. I don't know how radiation therapy fits into your treatment formula.  The Oncotype system assumes you've had surgical removal of the tumor, either by mastectomy or by lumpectomy+irradiation.  If you had lumpectomy, you will most likely need irradiation anyway--that's pretty much automatic.  What do you think you will do, with a score of 20?  I'm waiting to hear what my score is--it was just submitted a week ago.\" I didnt know that the test was based for women who planned on taking Tamoxifen or an AI. Is the test not really a good indicator if you arent going to take Tamoxifen? I had a TIA (mini Stroke) 9 years ago...So I do not know if Tamoxifen would be safe for me...I am having a Bubble Echo on Monday & that should help me decide...But isnt 100% to say it would be ok.",

I am alittle angry with Drs at the Moment.  Im sure I will get over it by this afternoon.  When I had my TIA 10 years ago.  It was late in the Evening.  And my Dh called the Dr on Call.  He asked if I was on BCP.  Yes 9for 3 months- to stop my heavy periods- Made it 10 times worse...Anyway.  He  said- to stopp takign the BCPs.  Thats it!  He ddi not say to go to the ER- which I know now you are supposed to.  he did not say to see my PCP the next day. I did not know what I had had until 5 years later when I researched the Episode...Told my PCP about it...But nothing was done.  Im sure everyone assumed it was in my head. My Main symptom has been SOB- Minly when I exert myself...Some years I could not climb up 6 stairs without stopping & huffing & Puffing. (Im not over weight)   But for years we assumed it was because I was Anemic (SOB is a Symptom) I had An Endometrial Ablation 3 years ago & my Periods then were normal again..I was no longer Anemic- but still breathless, although not as much for the 1st 2 years...So thats why last year I said- Something needs to be looked at. I was researching alot about COPD last year because thats what I felt like I had... I dont know why the Echo didnt pick it up.  Although while researching  already I read a Bubble Echo should  be done. Yes, it is a PFO that I have.  I read 1 out of 5 have it  : ) I will probably see a Cardio that is near here for now.  Just to see if Surgery is safe right now. My Onco said he recommended  a Guy named J Chambers- No kidding!  LOL. My Onco mentioned the 2 treatments- Blood thinners...Or Surgery...But was concerned about the foreign object left for the Hole patch  & chemo possibly years from now & Infection...Or something like that- hows that for a non recurance Confidence...:o I may consider Mayo later....When I think about how to treat this thing.  Pam  Edit...Missed this on my Report...It says I have Hypermobile interatrial septum (can not exclude Atrial Septal Aneurysm) with PFO.  With Moderate to Large Amounts of Contrast Passing through from right to left at reast & Post -Valsalva.  Sounds worse then if it was just PFO.",

I have many bc friends that dont even get it (they dont have LE) that hurts emotionally for me. I have friends with LE who are able to do so much still. I find I cant do much-everything seems to effect my LE. I hardly ever complain to friends & when I do they act like LE is no big deal & just get over it. My LE tends to cause me more pain then swelling (I have trunk & arm) My trunk never stops hurting...My arm never does either- but the pain is usually less . I also have surgical neuropathy from my SGAP. It too keeps me in constant pain & not mild. My pain level is always a 5 & often a 6 or 7. I have not had a pain free day since before bc 8+ years ago. I had no idea that I would be left in so much pain. I am almost always depressed & feel very alone. I knew in advance of surgery that I was at risk for LE- though very low risk according to statistics. My BS said I was not at any risk- I even argued with him about it...gave that up & took it upon myself to do the things to prevent LE...Except I had Truncal LE from day one...It was wrongly DX as temporary LE that would go away in 6 months or so....Its still here. It along with my arm LE was DX 4 years ago. I had 1 node removed. My BS who was against me doing a prophylactic in my good breast (he said I didnt have cancer in it why remove it) Yet he wanted to take a node from that side too! I said no way (after all I dont have cancer in the breast) I am so glad I stood my ground on that...How I wish I had never had a node removed at all.",

Put your feet on a small stool in front of the toilet so that your knees are higher than your waist.

Anyway, Now I have a Question...Binney...others...? Is there a better way to towal dry our arm, Rub lotion & Sunscreen on.  What direction should we use & stuff.  If my arm is sore I like to rub it (after the node surgery) But I am afraid to.

With Expanders Placed But Following surgery I did have 3 Heperin Shots every 8 Hrs.  2 days after leaving the Hospital I Started Plavix.   Probably different then what you are on. I was lucky & did not have any Hematoma Problems...Although I do think I lost alot of Blood during Surgery (before blood thinners) as my Hemoglobin went from 12 to 9. I healed well also. For my Exchange Surgery I was still on 81 MG Aspirin & also did not have any Bleeding problems then. Hope that helps a little.

But It is best to use your arms- Not for anything heavy.  But move them.  I had a lot of pain with my SNB & I did not move that arm because of it.  That made it much worse getting my range of motion back.   Later with my BLM I got my range of motion back almost in a month.  You will gain your range of motion back Much sooner if you use your arms & move them- dont keep them close to your sides all day.  Once you are feeling pretty good & have your Drs Approval- Stretching is very important.
