I took the cytoxan at night around 8 or 9pm. That way I didnt ever have to deal with feeling sick. They tell you to take it in the morn so you can drink more liquids during the day- it has something to do with not letting the drug build up in your bladder..?. But my nurses just told me to drink a couple of glasses that night, and cont. to drink lots during the day. and i never had any problems with taking it at night. I was never told anything about having to have an empty stomach.. so? hope that helps!",

Mine started falling out first at the nape (sp?) of my neck- back of my head, I just kinda grabbed a chuch and gave it a tug because I didnt think it was falling out and it just came out painless. It was slow at first and then I was shedding like crazy- I had buzzed my hair short, and in the shower when I would run my hands over my head they would be covered with hair. When it really starts to fall out it will be every where.. I suggest sleeping with a hood on because it catches the hair. Hope that helps.. The good news, it grows back FAST!",
