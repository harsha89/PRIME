Are you sure the nasties will find somewhere else to regrow? that scares me!!  I am really afraid of all the side effect of radiation therapy.. the doctors only treat us like breasts but not human being. Of course they will strongly suggest us to take rads and chemo, who cares about our lives 10 years later... all they want is short-term goal.. I am so sad .. it is so hard to make the decision...",

So I talked to a BS, she said\" I am almost 100% sure it is benign, you don't have to do anything\" I said \" No I want to remove it \" Long story short. the biopsy report came back with\" Mucinous carcinoma!!\" I don't have to repeat my emotions that everyone on this board has experienced. I checked in with MD Anderson right away after I got the biopsy report. they did another round thorough checks and will take 2nd surgery to clean margin ,then they will put me on radiation therapy.  I have done a lot of research, I know this type of cancer is very rare, I am wondering whether I can skip radiation, compare to the long term side effects ( possible new cancer and heart problem) I am so scared..  Can anyone give me some advice? anyone skip radiation and DOING FINE??    Dx 6/14/2010, 2cm, Stage I, Grade 1, ER+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
