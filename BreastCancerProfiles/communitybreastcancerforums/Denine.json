I had a baseling mammogram in 2003 when I was 35.  I had to go back for extra screening because they found calcifications which turned out to be nothing. I had my last mammo in May.  I had to go back again because of \"changes\". They found a suspicious area and wanted more pictures.  THey decided to do an ultrasound.  They could NOT find the area on US.  However, they found another area that looked dark and circular on the US.  This is what they want to biopsy. How many of you had something found on US that would not have been found otherwise and had it turn into something? They want to watch the other area with mammo in 6 months.  I am going to see if they will just biopsy it tomorrow as well. There is no palpable lump.  THe area is not seen on mammo.  BUt it is quite clear on US.  Any ideas what this could be? Log in to post a reply",
