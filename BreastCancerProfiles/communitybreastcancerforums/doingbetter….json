Which of course makes one wonder how much these pat downs can really reveal since people may have various kinds of \"items\" on their body for medical or hygeine purposes and real terrorists can figure out ways to hide things.  Meanwhile, I've heard from a couple of people we know how uncomfortable they felt by having a stranger rubbing her hands all over the body.  I've also been told that you are better off being screened in front of others with witnesses since some people have complained that in private the agents can be more abusive as there is no one there to see what is happening. The whole thing really stinks - bad enough for the average person, but especially problematic if you have a medical condition that you don't really feel like explaining or justifying to the whole world.  We used to travel quite a bit, but are definitely cutting back on the optional trips.",

Otherwise it's still pretty much dumb luck. I always opt out of the scanner, (no matter which type, I have serious concerns about their safety) and do not mention anything about prostheses. Based on what I've heard from others I know in similar situations, I am certain that more often than not the scanner will pick up the prostheses as an anomaly, possibly subjecting one to the patdown anyway. In those cases, the women have been subject to much more invasive patdowns and scrutiny of that area. By opting out of the scanner and not saying anything, aside from the generally uncomfortable nature of the patdown, there has been no additional invasion of privacy or scrutiny - I don't think they are feeling you hard enough in that area (at least they haven't been yet) to notice the difference between real breasts and prostheses. Just wear a good bra and top...My big concern is if we ever get to the point where you are no longer given the option to opt out. Aside from the privacy concerns, those machines are just way too new with absolutely no regulation for anyone to be saying they are safe.  Even the millimeter wave machine is basically the same technology as a microwave oven.

I'll keep my fingers crossed for you that you get a low enough oncotype score to avoid chemo - and at this point, you might as well believe that you will since that is more likely than not...On the flip side, there are many women who are able to get through chemo fairly well without too many issues so you may still be able to spare the kids too many details.",

Who knows what role that really plays, and not like most of us are \"unhealthy\" but it can't hurt to try.",

But the relative percentage benefit was extremely small. While everyone talks about getting through chemo okay, people fail to remember that even if you make it through fine, there is a very real risk of a secondary cancer such as leukemia developing later because of the chemo and that type of leukemia is not easily treatable. While the risk is small, if it is greater than the benefit one might get from adding chemo into the mix, then for these early stage cases with low oncotype scores, I don't think it's as simple as saying hit it with everything you've got since you could be setting yourself up for something worse down the road. I think people really need to think about all the benefits and risks very carefully - not just the immediate side effects. In my case I would have been more worried about the higher likelihood of a more problematic cancer than the small benefit chemo might have offered. Bottom line is none of us, especially in these borderline cases, will ever know if the chemo helped keep the cancer at bay or if we didn't choose chemo and cancer came back would the chemo have made any difference. You just have to really think through all the possibilities and work with trusted medical professionals to reach the decision that is right for you. ",

Then had a lumpectomy. It was very small with clear margins so no radiation was recommended at the time. A year later, more DCIS in the same breast. At that time, the choice was either lumpectomy and radiation or simple mastectomy. I'm also quite small and was tired of dealing with it and much more concerned about the radiation than the mastectomy. While no surgery is pleasant, once it's done, it's done and no side effects to speak of - I actually felt better after my mastectomy than my lumpectomies. I also chose no reconstruction, and must say that my woman surgeon was quite dumbfounded. She said none of her young patients would forego reconstruction when given the choice. My children were quite young at the time (I was 38) and I just wanted the simplest treatment so that I could get on with my life and I figured if and when the time came to deal with the second breast, I'd revisit the idea then. Other than the minor inconvenience when getting dressed, it has never bothered me or my husband, for that matter. Now I am dealing with IDC in my other breast and while the tumor is quite small, will again opt for the mastectomy. It is easier to decide that having been through it once before, but again, I prefer the more straightforward treatment. I know mortality may be the same, but personally, I can't deal with the angst of the 6 month mammos/sonos, etc. and suspicions and worries. I've also revisited the reconstruction issue and one thing that is clear is that if it is not an \"emotional\" issue for you, other than the fact that there will be an additional surgical procedure, it can be done at a later date. I remeber reading somewhere on these boards that you should be sure you really want it before you go ahead - it's easier to go back and reconstruct later than to go back and deconstruct if you're not happy.  So, I figure I need to really want it before I decide to go forward. Then I'll be more willing to put up with any pain, complications, etc. rather than wondering why I put myself through it. At the end of the day, it really has to be your decision which form of treatment your want and are most comfortable with so that you can live with the decision.",

I felt most comfortable with and my treatment became clear, I finally started to feel somewhat normal again. I think we all have our own ways to get through this time.  I know some will use some kind of medication.  In my case, I was quite nervous, but just kind of plodded through.  It did help to talk to a few people who had been through it a while back and were doing fine.  But I also did not tell many people so when I was going about my usual daily business I was able to get caught up in the usual routine of things without my condition being the focus.  I can tell you, as I'm sure you have heard from others on these boards, that the diagnosis and waiting stage is emotionally the hardest part.  Sounds like you're almost done with that, so just hang on to that thought.  I can tell you now, while I'm still not thrilled with the situation, I'm pretty much back to normal.  There is always a nagging worry in the back of my mind if something will recur at some point, but as I'm reminded by others something bad could happen to anyone at any time.  And, I have also used this wake up call to adopt an even healthier lifestyle. Not that it's any guarantee of anything, but I sure do feel better.",
