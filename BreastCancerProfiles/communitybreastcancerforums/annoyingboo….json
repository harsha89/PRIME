Or if you have bad genetics, then of course do everything you can! So I don't think there are easy yes/no answers. If there were, we wouldn't be agonizing on these threads. Educate yourself.

IMRT, or intensity modulated radiotherapy, its called. and APBI is the 'accelerated partial breast irradiation'. im doing that instead of the standard '3dconformal whole breast'. I need to dig up the article they gave me - its buried in a pile of tax paperwork that has taken over my coffeetable. gah - was hoping to tackle that before xrt. oh well. but basically, they really cone down the beam so as not to zap the surrounding tissues. they zap in 5 different planes. about a 20 sec breathhold for each. the study showed less side effects and damage to adjacent tissue bc the field is so small. I feel ok post day 1 - a little sore on the outside, so I have some ice there. a little tired, but more from the commute and relief that day 1 is over than fatigue from the actual procedure. I have no idea how fightingirl did all those appts her last week - I would be wrecked!! anywhooo, good luck!! tomorrow is my rest day, so ill try and dig up the article and post it for you and others to read. my treatment is every other day, so I go back Friday.",

The article I posted earlier shows that this targeted radiation, called imrt, has the same kickass benefits without all the side effects of whole breast. It's newer, so not all centers offer it, but ask if you are a candidate bc I just finished day 2 and feel pretty good. I'll go in MWF next week and that's it. I'm done!! Time to get on with my life",

I know its super hard, and I get your feelings. been there. you are half way there, so I would definitely mention it to ro and get advice - im sure everyone gets a little rattled at some point, so they might have other tricks to get you through it - good luck!!!",

The only thing is I thought I read somewhere that lavender oil had estrogenic properties, so I'd be careful of that one. But calendula and aloe Vera with coconut oil will definitely be part of my regimen! I emailed my dermatologist ages ago and he suggested an antioxidant with vit c and e, but I haven't seen anyone else recommend that, and the product he recommended is really expensive, so I'm going to hold off for now. Maybe when I'm all done I'll give it a go to help get rid of built up free radicals. The past few days I've been smothering my breast with aquaphor which is like Vaseline and very gooey. The calendula I have isn't the oil but a light cream, and I prefer that, but maybe I'll keep doing aquaphor at night bc it does seem to really keep the area moist. Good luck.

Now on to tamoxifen and I'll start tonight at half dose and go up to full Monday. 5 years. I'm not sure I've ever done anything for 5 years before, lol. My attention span is typically 5 min. Fingers crossed!! We have a survivorship program too but I forgot to make an appt. I guess the plan is mammos in 6 months - what has everyone told you girls? Is it 6 months from surgery or 6 months from xrt? I did meet my nutritionist today. No real insights, as I'm a healthy fruit and veg girl and haven't eaten red meat since high school. She encouraged me to check my vit d level. Some study showed 80% women w BC were vit d deficient. Not exactly sure the association, but there is not much from nutrition to replete your stores. If levels are 20-30 you can get away with 1000u maintenance dose. If less than 20, you will need to take more to ramp up. Watch the alcohol. Keep Bmi under control. Crank up the exercise. She said natural soy products, like tofu, tempeh, edamame and miso were ok up to 2servings/day. Avoid the processed stuff. She mentioned golden milk before bed to help you sleep - milk, ginger, turmeric, cinnamon. Said other versions/recipes online. That sounded like a yummy before bed treat and might help w insomnia. Again no huge revelations - I already know sugar is my big vice, and today is day 3 without it. I sooo wanted a congratulatory sweet, but came home and ate an apple with cheese instead. My new normal. At least I'm not starting right before the holidays!! Good luck all you sexy chemo starlets and to those midway and starting xrt!! I'll stick around to chat about tamoxifen but here's hoping no SE!!! Xxoo Happy weekend my lovelies",

Way to hold your ground and get the just price!! 3 bears- glad you are tolerating the T!!!!! I lasted only a month - had zero energy, gained 25 lbs (in a MONTH!!), and my uterine fibroids blossomed like weeds. I told my MO I would try it again once settled in Paris, but I haven't lost the weight yet and my uterus still feels huge, so nope. In every other way I feel great. I'll head back to Usa for follow up mammo this fall and plan to get a pelvic ultrasound then too just to figure out what to do with this uterine revolt. I should mention that I'm always sensitive to medication and tend to take half dose of most everything prescribed. Fingers crossed for clear health this fall bc I think full dose tamoxifen is just too much for my system. Paris has been hot hot hot - 85 and this week sposed to be in the 90s!! I've been doing the French version of soul cycle spin class everyday. In the beginning, I couldn't do it at all, and I'm getting better and feeling fitter each day. I wish the weight and fat gain would drop off, but it's not budging, and I've been good about alcohol only once a month and sugar 1-2x/week. Groan. I guess this is my welcome to middle age metabolism. Good luck to all you friends going through exchanges this summer!! In no time you will be back on your feet and getting in shape too! I'm super pleased with my new smaller size - maybe like a c cup? - I'd never have D+ again - clothes fit so much better now and exercise is so much easier. But I am noticing a little droop in leftie and radiated right boob shrunk a little, so you lucky implant ladies won't have that to worry about! Small victories,.. Stay cool and keep the updates coming until everyone has crossed the health finish line. I love hearing about the summers weddings and babies - enjoy!! Xoxo ",

At least it's not such an unknown. I have a team I like and trust, and that will make anything new easier. Remember how scary getting diagnosed AND trying to find the right people was? At least if anything shows up on these scans, we are pretty educated now. Plus we have each other. And that, my friends, has made all the difference,... ",

Pain wise, its more discomfort than pain - like wearing a tight underwire bra 24/7 - I have an incicision in the under crease from the reduction.Im sore laterally bc that's where the lumpectomies were done. It also feels like my boobs are way out in my armpits. I'm hoping with time they move back more centrally later this week, lol. Curious what my final cup size will be. No big poop yet. Took fiber gummies today, so that might help flush me out, but I've also not been eating much more than soups. But, basically I'm back to normal. Walking the dog, going to the post office, etc... lots of rain is a good excuse to stay inside and nest. By far the hardest part is anxiety leading up to surgery. Take lorazepam if you need to, and don't feel guilty. Exercise the week before, bc they told me not to exercise for 4 weeks after and I'm already antsy. I used an app called 'insight timer' and you can choose from hundreds of guided meditations. Learn to control your breath. Focus on our girlie island. Any positive visualizations help. That's my update post op day 3 from 3 lumpectomies and bilateral reductions/lifts. Good luck all!! Anyone have advice on how to get the marker off your skin? Preop they drew all kinds of lines on my chest for the lift. I've tried makeup remover and bioderma, but still there, just fainter. I have yet to shower, so maybe it will come off then.",

I spent the night in the hospital on a 23 hr observation bc I live alone and didn't want anything horrible to happen since I also live far from the hospital. by morning I felt great and only needed Tylenol, but still not too hungry, but they offered a full menu had I wanted it, I think you will be ok - first thing they do after you change into a gown is they start an IV, so if you are hypoglycemic, they can always give you some sugar through your vein since you cant eat. after surgery I had zero appetite but took some soup later that night. I found all the nurses to be very attuned to my needs, so if you let them know you might get hypoglycemic, they will keep an extra eye on you. the key is communication to everyone!! you have an entire team at the hospital working together to get you back to your gorgeous self. trust them and let go a bit! good luck - you got this!!!",

It's hard to believe how much your life can change based on 2mm, but it seems like you could really go either way - 1a or 2a - depending on your level of comfort. And here we thought the preopanxiety was the worst. Now it's these hard decisions where there really is no right or wrong. I wish you peace with whatever you decide. 3bears, I'm sorry for your disappointment. So much energy goes into preparing yourself for a certain outcome, so when they change the game midway through it's frustrating. But keep your focus on the final outcome which is your good health first and cute little foobs will follow eventually. Alli and left coastie, I'm saying a prayer for your nipples and I hope alli gets good path results today. Its been a tough week for everyone, so let's rally together and try to remind ourselves of the little things we are grateful for. Since the big things like health are a bit out of our control at the moment, we can be thankful that we are still here, we have this group and are lucid enough to talk to each other. Here in NorCal the torrential rains have stopped and we even have a little sun peeking through, with gushing waterfalls on the hill where I live. Stay strong ladies. You got this!!",

Vargadoll, I have only told 3 people about all this - 1 brother and 2 friends. I got diagnosed before Xmas and didn't want to ruin anyone's fun. I had my surgery on the sly last week and luckily it went smoothly. My 80 year old parents are going on vacation at the end of the month, and figured I would tell them when they got back. My mother was the care giver when her mom died of breast ca 40 years ago, so I really don't want to bring back upsetting memories for her. And I don't want any Carrie fisher/Debbie Reynolds scenarios - not that I think I'm going to die, but I certainly don't want to worry my parents and then have them have a stroke or something awful. So, I'll wait till they get back from vacation to spill the news, and thankfully I now have good news to share with them. But it's hard for me to keep secrets, so I get where you are coming from! Good luck tomorrow dcis and gma! Looking forward to your postop checkin!",

I had an afternoon surgery and stayed overnight bc I live far from hospital and I'm a single girl and didn't have anyone to care for me since I kept this a secret. It was kinda great bc they took really good care of me and I just left first thing in the morning. If I were home alone I would worry that every little symptom was some big monster coming to get me. But when I left in the am I was feeling good and ready. I vaguely recall doing the miss America wave as they wheeled me out, lol!! My reasons for reduction? I've had huge boobs all my life, but I'm a tall kind of slender gir. I crammed them into a 36dd but I was prolly more of an e or f, just in denial. I wanted to get lumpectomy path before deciding about my next step. Since my boobs were big and droopy, the ps said we could do a reduction/lift now and get my nipples in a more normal place. Then they can heal and vascularize so that down the line if I do choose mx, I might have the option for nipple sparing. Plus if I did mx I would have to tell family, and they are vacationing end of Jan, so I was really just buying some time. My path came back with 7mm dcis on the right, int-hi grade with necrosis and er/pr pos. Bs says 'yay, now just get xrt and take tamoxifen for 5 years'. I don't want xrt or tamoxifen though, which gives me 23% chance recurrence in 12 years. Or do dmx and don't need xrt or tam. My crazy mind is thinking, well you just took out most of my breast tissue, since I got reduced to a cute little b cup, so maybe I'll just wait it out for a bit and get mammos every 6 months and hope for the best and if I get new calcs, then go to mx. I know for those of you with more advanced bc this must sound really irresponsible and reckless. I get that. I am taking a week off of thinking about boobs and then I'll meet with ro and mo and see what they say. Apparently I have about 4 weeks to make up my mind, so there is time. But enough. I really just want to get back to my life. Call it denial. Call it cancer fatigue. It is what it is. Sorry for the long post but that's my story in a nutshell.",

I fainted during my initial core bx and was so worried I would do the same with the wire locs. I increased my lexapro after my diagnosis in dec and I think it took a few weeks to kick in, but now that it has my mind doesn't race anymore and I only used the lorazepam a few days before surgery and none since. And I didn't faint. And I haven't had any panic, thank god. So do what you need to do medication-wise to get through this. It was so important for me to realize that my mind racing and all the vertigo and presyncopal episodes I was having was a chemical imbalance. Not me going crazy or some deadly illness. I've just been taking medication for a few months, and I feel no stigma or shame. I just mention it bc maybe it can benefit someone else out there. This breast cancer gig is a tough one. If any of you feel unstable, tell your doctor. Get help. There are treatments, groups, and different kinds of therapy that is really beneficial. Mine started as dizziness so I thought something was really wrong. It's not a relief to have a panic disorder, it kinda sucks, but I can manage it now. So if anyone else has weird symptoms or stress they can't manage, please mention it and get the help you need ! Xx",

The important thing is to have a well versed team supporting you, so they can analyze your situation and the available data and help you make the choice best suited to your life, age, genetics, tumor characteristics, .... If it was black and white, we wouldn't need this board where we agonize over decisions and search for those with similarities to see what they have done and how they have faired. I wish all of us successful navigation through this journey. As for a fb page, I'm out. For me, fb is light - friends babies, animals, travels, pretty positive stuff. I had belonged to a bc page and I didn't like my happy time disrupted with reminders of this battle. I guess I'm a compartmentalizer, so if I can keep bc in this tiny little box, separate from friends and family, then I'm preventing it from becoming 'invasive'. But that's just me. I fully support a fb page for others, but I'm staying right here in my cabana. All my warmest welcome to the new girls! Congrats Shelly on finally getting an op date!! Good luck for the follow up appts today, and surgeries this week. May bandages come off, nipples(where present) be pink, drains pulled, and baths and showers be had by all!! Xx",

I've learned to just bob up and down and roll with it. today, its xrt. maybe next week ill change my mind again. good luck to all of us gorgeous gals!! xx",

I did get a migraine at the start(typical) and it was super heavy for a good 7 days, which is a bit much but I do have small fibroids. The boob thing I've noticed as time goes on is that they are still settling into their final size. I think now, a month out, this may be the final final size. The nipple incisions have become more sensitive with time. Not really painful, but more of an awareness that nipples are there and occasional zings, whereas before I never really noticed them on a minute by minute basis. The scars are already fading. My ps like yours said don't bother doing anything special, but I put some silicone on the other day just bc I had already bought it. Are you pleased with your reduction? My annoying boob looks great, but the 'good' one has a weird indentation medial to the nipple, so I think he sewed it a little too tight. I also feel like I have an underwire implanted under my skin - do you have that? Hoping that goes away with time, seems better this week and most noticeable when I twist. I think you are 2 weeks behind me - don't buy new lingerie yet, bc you may shrink a little more. Good luck",

I can post more once I'm in the thick of it. Pyrrh- are you all done now or will you be joining us on tamoxifen? I've had the prescription in my bag for weeks now and just don't really want to bring it to the pharmacy. Funny how your mind sets up roadblocks like that.

Wishing you peace of mind before your journey. Happy wig shopping to all you prechemo girls. I'm sure there is a lot of anxiety out there before you get going.

(funny enough, i went sugar free for a year last year, and then got cancer, lol) other than that, i eat a healthy plant based colorful diet already. ill add vit d to my supplements. i only drink alcohol a few times a year and i don't smoke. mostly, i pledge to take advantage of everything and not delay gratification - im cutting down my hours at work, spending more time with family, trying to plan a cabana trip irl, treasuring true friendships, working on my mindfulness and hoping to wean off my panic meds. i thought the non aluminum deodorant was just for radiation - is that sposed to cause bc? gah. at the end of the day, i feel like if this disease is going to get you, it will, regardless of what you eat or how heavy or slim you are. so ill try my best to ward it off, but i think there are some things beyond my control. good luck to us all!!",

I'm reading a book about neuroplasticity and how the brain forms neural networks and the author seems to think it's important when in pain to take the meds to 'trick' your brain. I just started the chapter though, so I'm no expert, lol. I hope relief is on its way with MM!!! Fightingirl, please don't feel bullied by us about taking tamoxifen. It is such a personal choice, and as we have seen along every step of this journey, we are all different. Like you, I was against everything from the beginning - in fact, my original plan was to do bmx just to avoid xrt and pills. Well, my short course xrt turned out to be not horrific. I can share with you my convo with MO. I was really worried about stroke and dvt. The paper of 1800 women had a 1% incidence of stroke across all ages. In his anecdotal experience, that was usually with older women who would have stroked anyway - smokers, obese, poor lifestyle. I get your concern with your blood pressure, so you are certainly a bit at risk there, but perhaps it's balanced by your young age, who knows? Then I was worried about endometrial cancer. MO said premenopausals slough their uterine lining each month, so it's unusual for endometrial cancer to take hold in that setting.again he said it was the older women who got that. Kinda confused by his answer bc postmenos would be on AIs, but that paper was from 1999 so maybe he meant 'back then'. And I have fibroids, which I have read on this board might grow, but he sorta shrugged that off too. I know it's his job to do a 'hard sell' but it's also had proven benefit for both breasts, so that's my decision on trying to take it. I say 'trying'. I can't promise I'll stick with it, but I'll try. I'd love to hear from whomever it was that had a meeting just to discuss SE. But at the end of the day, it's so personal. I'm glad some of you will be joining me in my tamoxifen cabana. Doors open a week from today!! Xxoo",

I'm taking escitalopram which is an ssri, but shouldn't inhibit the tamoxifen, so I can keep taking it (although I'm hoping to wean myself off in a few months) other ssri interact with liver metabolism and are more contraindicated so check with MO. There was someone who posted a Hopkins link that had a list of 'good'ones and 'bad' ones, but of course I can't find that now. But BENADRYL was on the list as interfering, so beware with your Tylenol pm or ask MO for a Benadryl alternative. ",

I want to read that one too, bc it has a section on anxiety, which I got last summer before all this bcbs began. I skipped ahead in this book to this really interesting section on electrical stimulation of your tongue to rewire your brain. fascinating. they don't sell the device yet, still testing it, but a friend of mine suggested I use a vibrator on my tongue and see if that worked - lol. not sure im quite ready for that!!! this book isn't as cool as the ones by oliver sachs - he had really fascinating stories about his neuro patients and odd syndromes. but it is neat to learn that the brain can change, bc they always thought it was so rigid. so chronic pain, ms, stroke, parkinsons - these are all conditions they are exploring with electric stimulation. I totally buy into it, and that's why ive been trying meditation/mindfulness and am trying to embrace my inner Buddha. my cousins daughter who I think has angelmans did well with hippotherapy - where you ride horses - I think its the same idea behind what you describe of using lots of parts of brain - have you tried that with your daughter??",

Here's hoping it's a walk in the park compared with everything you've gone through so far!! I did a soul cycle type spin class tonight. Holy hardness!! If you want to feel your age, try a cardio class with a bunch of 20 year olds!!!! Granted, it was my first cardio in 5 months, so I just went at a sloth's pace and trudged along, but it was fun!! It's nice and dark, so very non-judgey. I doubt I'll be able to get out of bed tomorrow though, so if you need me, I'll be at the cabana bar slurping on slushy fruity drinks replenishing my calories!! Love the barn!! Love a new pool in the yard!! Love a summer of weddings and babies!! So pleased to see everyone focusing on more fun things than recovery. Very grateful for my family of sisters - I love each and every one of you and I hope this little speedbump of 2017 means greater blessings are coming your way! You certainly have paid your dues!! Xxxoooo Ps - if any of you are too skinny for fat grafting, I have a bellyful that I'd be more than happy to donate!!!",

So now I\u2019m thinking of keeping insurance but dropping down to cheapest plan I can find. Such a waste of money though. What are all of you ladies doing or are you covered by work or husbands?

A lot of the girls were wearing pink and talking about the March. It was a super chill uplifting vibe. My instructor tailored the class to do more legs and abs instead of arms - god I love her. But even so, I feel a little sloshing that winchimed mentioned awhile ago in leftie, so there is prolly a seroma. I'm going to try to get to class all this week though - I want to be strong before xrt. My simulation is feb 1, and I'm nervous I won't have the energy for it. I echo the thoughts about less is more to bring to hospital. I'll add a hat to the list. I have a droopy hat - not wide brimmed- just something I wear walking the dog when I can't be bothered with a shower. It was great in the hospital bc it covered up bad hair, and I just tugged it over my eyes to sleep. I really do love all the dog and cat pics. I hope Claire is easy to train - the one of her passed out next to whatever she got into was gold!! We are all lucky to have our love bugs (and pugs!!). I'm sure this is all stressful for them too. My girl loves those bull penis tendons - lol - I'll have to get her an extra one as a thanks! Lots of girls went in today and lots of fu appts this week - good luck to all!!!",

Went to Pilates and was fine, just a little migraine aura after bc my period started, but popped a Tylenol and was ok. then off to MO appt and heartrate soared to 130!!!!! Resting for me is about 55. I felt so ill, and that was just in the waiting room! So I met mo and he was nice and smart and all. He recommends the 5yr tamoxifen plan after xrt. I knew this. I expected this. But somehow I'm angry that he didn't let me off the hook. Maybe I expected to bat my eyes and be charming and he would say, 'oh, ok. You are fine. Just go home and get back to your life'. But no, it didn't happen that way. So I feel like now I'm back to where I started at the very beginning of the month and maybe I should just have a bmx and be done. Truly done. No xrt. No 5 years of meds. No nothing. I like my newly reduced little boobs, but I think I might be ok staying flat with a nipple sparing mx. After a lifetime of dd++, little boobs are so fun and I finally get the no bra thing. As a big breasted gal, you need a little daily hoist, but not anymore. I bought some cute little bralettes and it's heaven. Most of lingerie used to be off limits bc you would need a crane to pick these girls up, but now I can look at the little triangle no underwire bras and the entire lingerie section has opened to me!!! Watch out, la perla, here I come!! So I dunno. I could just do xrt and get more frequent mammos, knowing I haven't reduced my risk as much as possible , I could try the tamoxifen and see how I go, or I could do the bmx. Now I'm home, exhausted. I feel totally depleted, but at least my heart rate is back to normal. Gah. Back to square one. Someone please take this fairy OUT!!!!",

A study of nearly 2,000 breast cancer survivors found that those who averaged as little as one serving a day of high-fat dairy foods had a 49 percent higher risk of dying from breast cancer than those who ate little or no high-fat dairy. The research was published in March in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. High-fat dairy includes whole milk, cream and anything made with them, such as cheese and ice cream.\" so, its no surprise I got breast cancer with my diet of cheese and ice cream!!! im going to try to give up ice cream - just writing it here so you can hold me accountable!! I already eat a mostly plant based meditteranean diet, but I do love my ice cream, so if I get super grumpy, you have been warned!!!!!!",

It's a genetic thing. They don't truly pass out. I honestly spent several hours last night and tonight watching videos of them!!! I figured you fellow animal lovers may enjoy them too, as it's something to giggle over while you pass the time in hospital or nesting in bed. Now I REALLY want a farm so I can get lots of these little guys. I showed a girl at the hospital this video and we were in tears laughing. Then she told me about 'goats of anarchy' which is a lady who rescues goats and posts cute pics of their progress on instagram. There is another crazy goat video I saw with goats jumping on a metal sheet in the yard. They didn't faint, just really cute and playful. Just a silly diversion from the C word. I feel like we all could use a little break. And now back to your scheduled programming.... Xxoo",

Is next week the chemo finale for pugsmama and 3bears? Seems we need to have a bungalow party for that for sure!! Keep your mental game strong girls!! 3 solid months are Xed off the calendar.

OR b.) bring it up again and reinforce that the reason i was gone for 5 months was to get treatment which was neither fun nor free. my gut says let it go and move on. its my journey not his. but my immature self wants some kind of validation from him. i know you girls are worried about more important things like finishing rads and having more surgeries, and healing skin issues, but id love a moment of how you deal with people who minimize your experience - has that happened to anyone? xoxo ",

We know the numbers regarding recurrence risk. I don't think we are being reckless - we will do self checks and continue mammos. It's not like we had early lung cancer and are continuing smoking. I haven't even made a follow up mo appt. will talk to my surgeon and radiologist, both of whom I love and trust. Maybe bc they are both women and my MO is a man? I might have a bias there. Ugh, I'm getting nervous already and still a month to go. On the bright side, I'm addicted to soulcycle(or at least the version here, which thankfully is a bit more affordable). And I feel myself starting to get fitter by the day. I've dropped 13 lbs, so still have more to lose from all I gained when on tamoxifen, but I feel it's really possible! And they do like 5 min of arms during the class, which doesn't sound like much, but in the beginning after radiation, it was such a chore, even with the lightest weight. And now I'm challenging myself and trying to use a slightly higher weight. I'm no pyrrh when it comes to fitness, but it sure feels good to get out and get moving again!! I'm also easing up on my sugar, and I'll have 1 cheat day/week. Although this week was 2, but when it's hot, gelato makes everything better. Fingers crossed I can keep this up for longer!! Xxcooo ",

Not sure if they mentioned it to you, but it takes a few weeks to kick in. So stay strong!! But once it kicks in, hopefully you will feel heaps better!! My doctor says I can try to wean off it once I've had 6 months of no panic. There is also a recent article in New York Times that says best results if you take it at least a year. Mental health is soo important and it's great that you can recognize you feel off, and get the help you need!! I was always sceptical of mental issues until it happened to me. And the more I talk about it, the more other people relay their issues, too. So please know you are not alone. And don't be scared to speak out. It's so much easier to speak out and be honest than to hide your emotions. I'm here for you if you want to chat!! Same goes for you bev mom!! Health is so much more than just your body parts, so be sure to take the time to nurture your mental health as much as your physical. Schedule it in your calendar. Listen to music. Use the free insight timer app for meditation. Go to yoga. Read a book. Sit in a warm bath. Walk in the mountains. Unplug. Eat ice cream.Whatever it takes. You got this!!",

I work from home too, so I'll be interested to hear how you do. I worked last week but was super distracted and slow and spent more time on this site than working!! And about that belly, I asked my ps preop if he wanted to give me a tummy tuck. He was like 'first things first', but I think that's going to be my gift to myself after all of this. So long, belly pooch. My glue on my incisions is flaking off slowly. I feel like a lizard. My rt baby boob is looking pretty good but left seems a bit dented. Still swollen and bruised though. The great thing about a reduction is bye bye boob sweat! I thought I would lose 10 lbs with the reduction but I gained 4 :(. I guess all the ifeelsorryformyselficecreams haven't helped. I have to wait another week to see my ps. I'm itching to get back and do Pilates. Its been raining here so no long walks. I feel a bit cooped up and I want to exercise. I suppose I could do squats in my living room, but I like classes. What if anything are you girls doing? (Mastectomy ladies you get a pass on this question.

I like your staying still to let that matrix stick - makes sense. ds - sounds like you are so lucky to not have the drains! and sounds like you have avoided any seromas so far - did they have you wrapped tight like a mummy too? that dress is beautiful.",

It might be worth meeting with someone like a psychiatrist if you haven't already. For me, a combination of medicine, mindfulness, and certain visualizations have been very helpful. There is this thing called cognitive behavioral therapy that is also great - you can buy workbooks on Amazon if you just want to go it alone. Hopefully, just a one-off from the stress of surgery and medicine, but if panic continues, there is treatment out there!!! I love each and every floofy picture posted.

Get yourself feeling great before your next surgery - at least it's after thanksgiving, so you can enjoy a yummy meal !! I had my bs and mammos today. Got called to do extra views on my normal breast which churned my stomach a bit, but they think it's just some artifact from the reduction surgery. She said I could do 6months or 1 year followup, and bs said see you in a year!! Wahooo!! Are any of you other Dcis girls doing yearly follow ups or is it 6 months? It's definitely a little stressful being in that waiting room again, with memories flooding in of last years biopsy. I rewarded myself with a bag of cheetos, which tasted good at first, then made me kinda ill. Should have stuck with ice cream, lol. 3 bears, I recall one of my doctors, at the beginning of all of this say that these days breast cancer is a treatable disease. Not that the treatments are any walk in the park, but still. May all of us be treated and cured and NED forever. That is my wish for this group. Love you girls, xxxxooo. ",

Like you, I had always colored my hair since my 20s. Then when the greys started rolling in, I just stopped. Screw it. I'm still mostly brunette but lots of salt and pepper now and I'm just going to let it do what it wants to do. A 70 year old lady friend of mine said 'you need to color your hair, it's so aging' but I don't care what she or anyone thinks. I don't NEED to do anything. My mother has never colored her hair a day in her life, went grey by 40 and now has the most beautiful white hair at 80. So im embracing the natural. I think your head looks beautiful, but who cares what I or anyone else thinks. It's all about YOU and what makes you comfortable. If you want to wear scarves or hats or wigs or just go natural, do it with your head held high. You have an inner radiance and strength and compassion that can penetrate any physicalbarrier. We see it. Your kids see it. Your husband sees it. I hope you see it too. You are a beautiful being, a gorgeous woman, and thank you for sharing your photo - I think you look great, but more important, you look vibrant and healthy!! Xx",

I've read more threads lately with women doing ok on it, so I'm trying to go in with a positive attitude. Mo gave me just a 1 month prescription, so I'll give it a go. His experience is that the awful SE occur in people who are already at high risk for them and less common with the young healthy girls. And that study showed an extra benefit for younger women. I'm just 3 years shy of 50, but I'll take any benefit I can get. And if it turns out horrible, I can stop, but at least I tried. Would love other girls to join me so we can dish on how we feel. Did you start already dcbc? Anyone else here on it yet? Buehler? Also a shoutout to leftcoastie who should be going in for her nipplerecovery surgery next week, right?

I went on a bit of a bender though, and ended up hitting the sales online and bought yoga pants, a tumi bag, a summer tunic, new running shoes - none of which I needed, but all in really bright colors which make me happy. Just a little feeling sorry myself retail therapy, but yknow what? It worked!! And the xrt tech commented on how cute my yoga pants and shoes were, lol, yay!! My girlfriend got me this shirt, but I can't bring myself to wear it. Is it weird that I'm still in denial? I kinda feel like dcis is a pre-cancer, and I didn't have to go through the chemo like you ladies, so parading a shirt that says 'survivor' seems really fake and inauthentic. I need one that says 'dodged a bullet'. Or 'solidarity with my sisters'. ",

What started as a completely life altering change all your plans and hunker down til it's over thing is now nearing completion for me (note again the denial that I'll be on a pill for 5 years, lol). I'm all in for resuming my life! I'd prefer to have this all in the rear view mirror. I don't think I want to parade around with a survivor shirt reminding me every day. I broke my leg about 10 years ago and I don't wear a 'former invalid' shirt. I just forgot about it and moved on. BUT, at the same time, I am so humbled by this process and proud of all of us for wading through and so grateful for the friendship and support of all of my January sisters. It really has been a journey, and I'd like to keep helping people buzz through it. So I guess the battle now is finding a balance between trying to forget about it but still be an advocate for those that still have a long road ahead and the newbies that begin daily. I'll figure it out, but in the meantime I'm wearing all my colorful new clothes and it's finally sunny here to enjoy the outside! I pray for all you girls while I'm getting xrt - for a gentle chemo, for hair to stay in, for children to be gracious, for foobs to stop leaking and hurting, for scars - mental and physical - to go away, for infections to heal, for medicines to work and SE be tolerable, for loved ones to be cherished...and mourned, for horses to be ridden and dogs to be walked, for grandbabies to be delivered easily into this world, for favorite activities - yoga, tkd, running, sex! - to be started again, for all these things and so much more. May all you gorgeous women continue this journey with grace and confidence!! Bevmom, good luck tomorrow. I know it will be a hard day. I'm holding your hand. Leftcoastie, may this next surgery be your last and healing swift! Varga, get that grand baby OUT - she looks like she is about to burst! Blessings upon all of you!! Cxoo",

There was a gay guy I worked with awhile back who got implants to make him look more muscular. His ended up moving all over his chest and ended up by his collarbone - poor kid. I hope that doesn't happen to you! I've been bed bound for 48 hours. Excruciating left pelvic pain to the point I was dry heaving. Couldn't straighten my legs or wal. It's just now getting better, so I'm guessing I ruptured an ovarian cyst or some fibroid went wacko on me. Have any of you had ovarian cysts before? I'm not on tamoxifen, so I can't blame that. Glad to be feeling a little better so I know it's not appendicitis, but Jeez that hurt!! Good to here from fightingirl! Our year is halfway done ladies!! Keep forging ahead. Xxxooo ",

I had big boobs too and had this reduction along with bilât lumpectomies, but I'd be ok going smaller still! I guess you always want what you don't have! But if you don't have much fat, you might not even be able to get an a cup. I have a big belly roll, and even with that, I recall ps saying it wasn't enough to form 2 breasts ( when I was thinking about mastectomy). So ask before you go taking them out! I'm back to normal health. I'm guessing I had a combo of ovarian cyst and bad cramps. My fibroids had grown on the 1 month I took tamoxifen, so maybe that contributed too, but jeez - I couldn't move for 2 whole days. I can't imagine being a woman who ruptures one like that every month - ugh. I'm already dreading next month!!

It was my first vacation since before this whole mess, and I HIGHLY recommend taking a break or a weekend away if you can spare the time and money. I feel refreshed. And even though I was in a bathing suit each day, i didn't obsess about boobs or body image. Prolly first time in my life. Enjoy your summers ladies, and I'm thinking of you girls getting follow ups - keep us posted!! Shelley beans, a big congratulations to you for finishing chemo!!

Having said that, I work from home in front of a computer, so I stayed in my jammies. I also didn't have any axillary dissection, just 2 lumpies on the rt, 1 on the left, and a bilateral reduction/lift. So the recovery is much easier than that from mastectomy with reconstruction. And everyone is different, so don't get frustrated if you heal slower. What I have learned from all of this is to be more accepting of my body and just appreciate however it wants to heal and roll with it. A good life lesson for me who tended to plan my life out a year at a time!! And for those healing, did anyone get glued back together? I told my ps I get a rash from steristrips, so he said he would use glue, and now post op day 5 that stuff itches like crazy!! Good luck to all you gorgeous ladies!!

It's not at all convenient or comforting, but that's the current standard of care as I understand it. I'm so sorry you have to go through another procedure",

I also think its important to seek the good in whatever gets thrown your way. I think the timing of breast cancer right after my panic diagnosis was meant to prove to myself that I can do this. may we all find whatever life lessons we need in this journey!! gt, plenty of huts. re:injections - I think fightingirl had hers once she was under anesthesia, and then dcis had hers mixed with lidocaine, so maybe just ask what they can do for you to make it as comfortable as possible. and don't race to the dx yet - its not worth the stress. baby steps. lets get you through the surgery and comfy and cozy in a bungalow before we start to think about path reports! 'patience grasshopper' (I think that was a cheezy line from some movie) elem, take care of your bronchitis, my sweet girl. lets not have any more surprises or cancelled surgeries! drink lots of fluids and breathing treatments if you need them. be gentle on yourself. the good news is that you kinda already know the drill for preop, so hopefully that soothes some of the jitters. dcis, your husband sounds hilarious. and thank god your ps cancelled instead of falling over midsurgery!! you can do this on jan 19. varga, I cant believe you are a grannie to 6 - that's so cool! I hope the shower went well today. take care of the dizzy spells - mine were super scary. I hope its just dehydration or something easy rather than panic, but if it is panic, im your girl for getting through it. as for me, I just peeled most of the glue off around my incisions. literally like 3 tablespoons of purple skin glue. but now I looks less monstrous. sure there are big incisions but hopefully they will fade with time. I even tried on some clothes I had that never looked good with big boobs, but I didn't toss them out bc they were so pretty. so im looking forward to a new wardrobe. and exercise. and hot tubs. I may sneak into the hot tub tonight since I looked pretty healed up...eek!!",

I have yet to meet with ro or mo, but that's the standard of care here in norcal. if you have low grade dcis or just a teensy tiny little spot, they may just do lumpectomy or watch it. after your surgery, when you have all the pathology reports, they plug your numbers into a 'nomogram' that spits out a bunch of percentages for recurrence and survival to help you decide.my bs said the memorial sloan kettering system was a bit more modern than van nuys, and she liked that one. so for my info and age, I have 23% risk recurrence after lumpectomy only for 12 years. if I do xrt, it falls to 9%. if I do xrt and tamoxifen it falls to 4%. so you can go online and plug in different numbers to get a sense of how it works. 23% doesn't sound too bad, but then my mom is 80, so multiply my 23% x 3 if I live as long as her, and that starts to get scary.",

But everyone is different. I do think that lifting a 112 lb child would be asking too much regardless of your surgery for a few weeks, varga. For sure for a 2 solid weeks at least you will need someone to help you help your child. I was told no lifting over 10lbs for 3 weeks. Of course at 1 week I felt like I could lift more, but you risk busting open your sutures and then an even longer recovery, so I just don't think it's worth it. No easy choices for anyone.",

I'm a counter, so I counted everything on that ceiling a zillion times - 6 sided exhaust fan, 2 cameras, 4 lights. Thank god they were all even numbers bc if I count odd numbers I start over until it's even - lol. Little OCD mind games to pass the time. Thank god I only have 5 sessions bc I really did not like my plan verification today. Not painful or anything, but the ptsd we all get.

Your mind thinks you are ready before your body does, so listen to both!! Elem, I will take hormonals, tamoxifen, after xrt. The 50% reduction in recurrence is worth a shot. 50% of women tolerate it, and I hope I'm in that camp. But if not, I'll stop. I made the mistake of reading a metastatic bc thread last night when I couldn't sleep - so many women treated with early stage disease then were diagnosed metastatic 10 years later - scared the bejeezus out of me I'd like to try to avoid that and hormonals certainly provide benefit. 3 bears, I can send you my book when I'm done if you like.

I've been using this meditation app called 'insight timer', kinda like headspace but free and much more variety. Last night I found a 10 min guided meditation just for cancer recovery. If you get the app, go to guided meditations, then playlists, and choose the box for recovery. Scroll down to 'healing meditation for people with cancer' and press play. I enjoyed it. If you don't want to bother, the jist is you visualize a golden orb before you, beautiful and warm like the sun, then you internalize it and the orb sends out healing energy in your body. Haha I know how hokey it sounds as I'm writing it (!!!!), but sometimes in the waiting room or before bed it's nice to listen to. ",

Basically, in patients with chronic pain, you can actually rewire your brain to not experience the pain. It's almost like a mindfulness or other meditation practice. Kinda fascinating. I'm reading it and thinking about all you girls with TE pain and wonder if you could apply some of the techniques.

I think different friends have different purposes, and his purpose is clearly not to let me wallow, but to kick me out of the cabana and back into the real world. I appreciate him for not enabling me to use the C card. Beachbaby is so right - no one can understand this journey. Nor do I want anyone to have to. Rise above, head held high, with new confidence and inner strength. I hope everyone is hanging in there - good luck Dcbc with your upcoming exchange!!! Cowboy, how is skin healing? Have you started the big T yet? Varga, I still don't know how you juggle everything you do!! Awe inspiring!! Proud of you beachbaby for walking tall given your 'condition'. There certainly are awkward encounters, but at the end of the day, everyone wishes you health, they just don't know how to express it. So may continued health and healing rain down upon everyone in the most torrential downpour, and may you open yourself to accept it and blossom anew. Happy May!!",

I've been starting to exercise more in attempts to get in shape, and though I have a long way to go, the endorphins feel soooo good. What I've learned since page 1: health is precious and something you have to work for. You have to take care of your body and mind to live your best life. I won't ever take it for granted. When I need to, I can bow my head down and power through almost anything, knowing I am strong enough to come out the other side, wherever that may be, and learn to navigate new waters. Other people's opinions matter less and less. I know who I am and what I've been through, and I Don't need outside validation. Scars are the beauty marks of perseverance, and grey hair is kinda cool. I'm fully embracing the new me. It's not flawless but it's real, honest, and authentic. Sometimes strangers can be your best friends. Thank you all for 100 pages of love. May your journey forward be filled with light. Xxxxxooooo",

As I understand it, the tamoxifen is an estrogen antagonist in the breast, so it blocks uptake, but in the uterus, it is an agonist, so it enhances hormonal action.

But they decided it was probably benign calcs and will keep an eye on it at the next mammo in 6 months which will be bilateral 2 years out from initial diagnosis. I'm not sure why, but I just want to get to 5 years - somehow I convinced myself that it's all downhill after 5 years.

Well, it started itching like crazy post op day 3 so I ripped it off. I read on another site how someone used maxi pads and paper tape, so that's what I replaced the clear stuff with! I put a little bacitracin on the spots where my drains were, then the maxi pads over all the incisions, then my postop bra. Sounds so silly but it worked! Today there was no drainage on the pads, so I'm down to just the bra. The glue they used on my incisions itches, but I think it should start flaking off next week. Ah, the joys of sensitive skin! Maybe you could try the maxipad and then just wrap yourself in an ace bandage! I can tolerate natural fibers, but any tape or sticky stuff is so irritating. Good luck!! And for those of you showering, are you still doing hibiclens? I used it preop but maybe I should do a light rinse with it post op too? The incisions all look clean, just a bit bruised still. Love you ladies!! It gets better!! Xx",

For those with more advanced disease, maya, Shelly beans, win chimed, left coastie, pugsmama, docmama, ( I hope I'm not leaving anyone out), I feel such compassion for all of you. Adding chemo into the mix does just add another level of stress. You all have been so generous in sharing your stories, and pugsmama, reading about all the other surgeries you have already had and the stress with the genetic test and the waiting, oh my. It shows what strong character you have to go through that, then go through more, and still have the grace to spend your time sharing with us and educating us when all you probably want to do is lie down and have a nap. Ladies, you are all goddesses among women. I am honored to know you, however virtual it may be. And I wish you all the complete pathological response/remission Docmama has! It is so very humbling to see our January list grow and grow, and then to think of all the months and all the years with the millions of women going through or having gone through this. Our journeys are all so different, but we share this sisterhood. Certainly we didn't want to be here, but I am grateful to all of you walking beside me today. X",

I drove the day after surgery, a 2 hour round trip, bc I wanted to get my dog to snuggle with. It's a little uncomfortable, but doable, and I have a mountain road with lots of twists and turns. Honestly I was impressed by how good I felt for the recovery. I'm 47 and pretty healthy. I would say count on 3 days postop of taking pain pills and being gentle on yourself and pooping, lol! Then you can ease yourself into daily life. I'm a week and a day postop today and drove around running errands all day and I can lift my 30lb dog with no pain. Incisions are healing well. Glue flaking off. Today is last day of antibiotics. I would say I'm pretty back to normal but haven't been cleared to exercise yet or get in a hot tub. The sides of my annoying boobs are sore still. Not painful, just sore. I can sleep on my side propped up on a bunch of pillows. The incision goes all the way around my nipple, then vertically down, then a big smiley face incision along the inframammary crease. Look at online pics to prepare yourself. Also, your boobs will feel ginormous right after surgery and you will think they weren't reduced, but now at a week, the swelling is almost gone and I think they are nearing their final cute little size. The anxiety leading up to surgery was the absolute worst. Exercise as much as possible preop. Take lorazepam for a few days before. Pray. Meditate. Whatever works. Then surgery and recovery are easy. Then waiting and analyzing path reports will give you jitters again. My bs told me one week for results then called me after 3 days, so that was nice. Expect a week, then you won't be freaking out every day. My top tips: ask anesthesiologist for scopolamine patch to reduce nausea associated with anesthesia, bring some kind of throat lozenge to hospital bc your throat will be sore from the intubation and ice chips are boring, bring a hat or scarf so you don't have to worry about bedhead - I pulled mine over my eyes to help me sleep, write down your nurses names so you remember, and have ice cream sandwiches and soup ready for you at home. You won't be too hungry but it's nice to have something to ease your throat. Oh, and get those round little ice packs to stuff in your bra. You will do great!! I sent my nurses thank you cards today. They were all wonderful angels and I felt so well taken care of.",

You girls are UNSTOPPABLE!! And to those headed to surgery this week, I can't help but think of the images of all the women in practically every city across the globe who were marching. I think of them as marching next to you and cheering as you head into the operating suite. What solidarity and sisterhood! What power!! (And yes, I second the idea of lip balm and throat lozenges for intubation, and I'd add ice cream at home, because, well, ice cream). The bungalows are waiting for you. The weather is warm and the water is divine. Don't be scared. We are all here for you. On a personal note, I saw my ps and got cleared for exercise and saunas!!! I jumped online to book my favorite Pilates teachers class for Monday morning and it's booked solid. Aaaaarrrrrgggghhh. When I met with RO he gave me a placard for the parking garage that will give me preferential parking. Now I need a placard to get me into my favorite class - so I'm just sending this out to the universe - all you ladies signed up for 11am Pilates tmro, please find something else to do. I'm 4th on the wait list and really really want to go. I'm going to try to get as strong as possible before they try knocking me down with xrt.

So I want to be a motivator for all who have a rougher road. But it is deflating when our list just grows and grows, and it sinks in how many women are suffering through these hard decisions and treatment. And as for work, I have no choice. I'm an independent contractor, so no vacation days. I can take all the time in the world off, but if I don't work, I can't get paid and these medical bills aren't paying themselves. No second income here to fall back on. I'm lucky to just sit in front of a computer. But I took a few days and just stayed in bed. I feel good but the mental exhaustion caught up to me. Everyone heals at their own pace. Be gentle to yourself when you need it, and plow through when you have to. The good news of the day is that everyone's positive vibes came to me, and they just called with an opening in my pilates class!!!!! First workout in forever!

My ps says Nsbmx has poor outcome if droopy boob and nipple. I may have posted an article about 10 pages back, I don't recall. But anyway, I like being smaller. It's much more appropriate for my frame. And going braless? Priceless. Path came back high grade dcis with necrosis on rt, with just some benign nonsense on lt.
