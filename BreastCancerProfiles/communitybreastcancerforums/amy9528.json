My mom was 1st DX'd with BC in 1997.  She had a masectomy, radiation and chemo, and then was cancer free for 7 years.  In 2004 she was suddenly diagnosed with a reoccurance, which was classified Stage 4 with lesions in her bones, lungs, and liver.  She has since had constant rounds of chemo, radiation, and various alternative treatments.  It seems as though she was able to keep things at bay until recently.  She does not want to talk about her health much or prognosis, and to get any information out of her results in her becoming furious and me in tears.  Her favorite responses are \"I don't know anything\", and \"We'll deal with it when we need to\".... (But I think the \"when\" was a long time ago).   Here is what I do know:  Her tumor marker levels (CA 15-3) have recently doubled within the last month, from the 2000's to the 4000's... if that means anything to anyone.  She has just started a new chemo treatment last week, not sure which one.  The last several chemo's have been completely ineffective.  She finally admitted to me today that her Dr. can see growth in the lesions in her liver.  In the last month she has gone from being very active, to almost housebound due to complete lack of energy.  She says her muscles feel completely weak.  She can get up for about 10 min at a time, and then is forced to sit or lay back down until she can recoup.  She is having a hard time keeping food down and is throwing up 3 to 4 X's a day.  She was already thin, and has now lost 20 lbs just in this last month.  I'm praying this new chemo will work, but I'm worried I need to prepare for the worst.  So my 1st question is, considering that the chemos are not currently working anymore and considering the advancement of lesions in her liver, is there anyway to guess or gauge how much time we have left with her??  I'm guessing we may only have a few months left, but I don't know what to even base this off of??  If anyone can give me some sort of educated guess or their own experience it would be greatly appreciated, because I will be left with 3 young brothers in my care, one of which has severe cerebal palsy, and I want to be able to prepare for the worst while still holding on to hope. This leads me to my next question...  She is a single mother, and my father is out of the country and out of the picture for that matter.  I am the oldest child and there are 3 children, one with very severe cerebal palsy still living in her care.  I am married and 26, with a 1 yr old baby myself.  My husband and I have moved in with her to help out.  I have a 25 year old sister but she has just started a new and promising career out of state. Asking her to move back is out of the question.  My husband works round the clock, so I am basically the only caregiver around for mother, my brothers, and my own daughter.  My brother with cerebal palsy is wheel chair bound and needs 24 hr care, which my mom has been providing until now.  She is insisting that she can still take care of him with my help, but just last week decided to take a leave from her job because she physically cannot do it.  With my own 1 yr old running around, I've barely been able to make things work as is.  My mom is still able to bathe and feed herself, and I don't think she is at the point of needing or accepting hospice care.  Basically I just feel stretched so thin already, I don't know how we'll manage with my mother's increasingly failing health.  And I love my brother to death, but I don't know how I will take on the 24 hr care, along with 2 other brothers and my daughter.  Somehow we're taking it one day at a time right now, but the long term seems impossible.  I don't know who to turn to for help, and I'm feeling terribly lost and alone.  If anyone has any advice, I'd be completely appreciative.   I've been seeing a counselor, but she seems lost for an answer other than to put my brother in a home.  My mother has dedicated her whole life to taking care of my brother, and I have been a big part of his caretaking as well.  This would break my heart and my mom's for sure.  I worry that it would also damage her spirits completely.  This just doesn't seem to be an option right now.  I'm at a loss for answers, and any advice would help so much!  Sorry for the lengthy post.
