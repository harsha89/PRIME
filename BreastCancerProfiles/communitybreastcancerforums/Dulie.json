I'm not okay with him volunteering to be in the waiting room during and after my surgery to talk to the surgeon (my daughter injured her back and was flat out for a few days, my boys out of town) but left to go smoke a cigarette and call his girlfriend (his guilty admission).  He is just as stunned.  He has been telling me he planned to quit work and leave the area to move in with his girlfriend.  I of course panicked a little... he told me the other day to go slower on the divorce (finding a good stand still part so to say) and he will stay at his job so I can have medical insurance and reminded me to submit claims to Aflac... I guess that policy is going to pay out-not that I hoped it would... sigh.  I was a little naive thinking it would be a fairly straight forward process and that within a very short time I would be in surgery, having radiation etc.  It is obvious there is still so much more to \"do\" and know and in the end it really is for the best. I appreciate the response... It's nice to have a place to go for support and info... and as I am reading a wicked sense of humor here and there... which is how I have tried to tackle this challenge although it doesn't always tickle my funny bone... ",

My seroma was painful and although the surgeon offered to draw some of the fluid out I opted not to have it done and give it a little time.  It took a couple of weeks but I woke up one day and realized that it wasn't bother ing me.  Have you asked your surgeon or ps if they can withdraw some of the fluid?  Mine was quick to suggest it because she felt it wasn't necessary to hurt more if there was something she could do to help make me comfortable. I'm sorry to hear about your discomfort and so glad to hear you won't require further treatment!  What a blessing! ",

It showed up on the ultrasound but not the mammo or dx mammo.  However, there were calcifications found in a different area of my breast and I had a stereotactic breast biopsy done which my reg. dr said was \"negative\", now the surgeon is gather all my path reports to see just what \"negative\" means. Well, I elected to have a lumpectomy.  I have aunts on both sides of my family that have breast cancer and I am 47 so... and I am in the middle of a divorce and figured get the dental, paps, etc completed before I lose insurance.  No one ever expected cancer, not even the surgeon.  She thought it to be an inflammed Montgomery Gland...  I think she was just a shocked as I was...  I was so stunned I just found out today just what type of cancer I have...  and I'm finding there is so much more to knowing what \"type\" of bc do I have... it's more what type of bc type do I have.   Just today my insurance approved the MRI and we're waiting for word if they will cover the BRCA1 and 2 tests... oh and now I see there are HER something or the other testing that needs to happen and on and on it seems to go.  (Oh, I must give these support forums my accolades!  It was after lurking here for a couple of days I can see that there are more questions and answers that need shared). So while I have the dx of IDC there is still more to know and learn.  I do know at minimum the recommendation is to have more breast tissue removed, lymph nodes for testing and radiation... but I can see that has a potential to change. For now, I'm just Dulie, nanapants to nine grands and four adult kids, momma to critter kids-three dogs and a one-eyed side swimming fish.  Single and divorcing... I was ready to hit the road running but ran straight into a brickwall.  Now to brush myself off and get busy...  sigh... Dulie Mum says I've always been an overachiever. DX'd with IDC, DCIS, Paget's and Papillary BC. Two tumors RT breast, one benign tumor LT breast. Stage 1c. BMX 2/23/12 w/clean margins. Now the journey of Tamoxifen and getting back on my feet. Dx 1/4/2012, 1cm, Grade 3, 0/2 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
