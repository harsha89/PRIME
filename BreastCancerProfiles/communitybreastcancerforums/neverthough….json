Changed antibiotic and symptoms are better, though still have redness, itching and numbness in hands and feet. Eyes were really red too, but now better. I am still afraid to have next treatment of taxotere, both because of reaction and tooth abcess. But MO said all should be well provided my blood counts are OK the day before. I am hoping maybe wait another week until done with antibiotics. Silly thing is that I am more afraid of seeing myself bald than I was of seeing mastectomy scar. Still have a little hair, but a couple of days I expect it will be gone. Wore a hat to work yesterday because getting so thin. There are a lot of ecsentric people where I work so I fit right in. Please excuse my spelling. ",
