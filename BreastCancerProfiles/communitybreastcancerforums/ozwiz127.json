I couldn't move my head afterward so when i turned on my back i just tried to relax and gradually move my neck. The edge of the hole that you put your breast thru was digging into my ribs so they put a small pillow there which helped some, thenmy chhekbone started hurting bcz it was smashed into the table (i have neck problems anyway). It would have been helpful to me if they had shown me the table before i came in for appt so i could lay on it & figure out how to best be comfortable. I recommend taking 2 small memory foam pillows, one of which should b a cervical pillow or a flax bag. It was cold n the room so i asked for xtra covers & wore jeans even tho it was 90 degrees out.",
