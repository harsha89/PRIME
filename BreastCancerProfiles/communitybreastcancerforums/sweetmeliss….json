I am currently on STD through my employer so is is a little different. I am eligible however they are only covering me from one appointment to the next so I have to call after every appointment and get my progress notes sent to them. And as we know, paperwork doesn't always get transfered like it should. I have found it very helpful to be very organized. I was diagnosed only 4 weeks ago but when there was even a speculation I immediately got myself a binder. In the binder I have folders and each has a section. the sections I have are doctor/lab contact info, current medications ( I have a list that I just made copies of and I also keep the leaflets from the pharmacy in this section), test results ( I always get copies of any bloodwork and any cd copies of scans that I keep in a cd case), upcoming appointments, financial info (this is currently my thickest section - I keep any and all receipts, bills, STD paperwork etc), thingis to follow up on (I keep a running sheet of all those questions  need to ask the doctor but can wait until my next appointment or follow up phone calls I need to make) and another section for \"other\". I have found that receptionists, nurses, doctors, insurences, basically everyone is much easier to deal with since I have this binder. It also helps me to feel like I have some control in this situation. It helps me to feel less helpless. I have decorated teh front with pictures of my son and positive affirmations. Hope the suggestion helps and good luck with everything. ~Melissa",
