For me, the lasting effects of the Taxol have been brutal. I am still dealing with a significant amount of neuropathy. I continued to exercise, jogging short paces during my whole entire chemo regimen. My neighbors got use to seeing me bald, crying and puking on the side of the road. Needless to say, it wasn't a good look but I was given the advice that it would prevent the neuropathyÂ from becoming permanent. I have such severe joint pain that if it is cold, I can not get out of bed. My face and nose tingle constantly. I finally gave in and started taking a lose dose of Cymbalta. It is helping somewhat. I am Triple Negative, rumor has it that we are hit the hardest with everything so who knows. My Dr. has told me that it will take a full year to recover from the chemo so I should remain optimistic. Hope this helps.",
