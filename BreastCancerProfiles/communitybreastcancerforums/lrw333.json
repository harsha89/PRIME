She was so brave and always made me laugh.. I can not begin to tell you the sadness I am feeling. Since we lived so close together we wanted to have lunch one day when she was better. Not once did she give up hope. A true inspiration to anyone whao had the pleasure of talking with her...I hope her family finds the comfort and support they need right now. I pray Shan is finally resting in peace. Cancer is so evil. Now it has taken another Angel... Hugs and prayers to her family, lisa",

You have to hold your arm over your head a good 40 mins or longer. I came out crying and in so much pain. They asked if I had not been doing my exercises??? NO ONE bothered to even tell me about them. MY BS told me I did not need radiation treatment. He referred me to this Dr. Then told me he would not write me anymore medicine That the radiation Dr. would have to.  Seems like MY BS is upset I went against his wishes???   Not crazy about my Rads Dr.  My BS started me on arimadex last week. The radiation Dr. took me off of it till after I am through with treaatment. I asked for something for anixety for treatment. He gave me 1  2mg ativan. whoo hoo that should do me 6 weeks. LOL Is it me or is he lacking just a little bedside manner. This is really weighing heavy on me. Truly scared of what it is going to be like and to have a Dr. like this does not help. I am in a constant state of being dazed and confused. It is hard enough w/o having the proper information and such .  Any suggestions???",

He said he felt better if the cancer specialist treated me on this part. LOL I think just a little compassion for what we have to go thru would be nice. I feel like a number sometime not even a person. I feel almost certain if some of these people treating me had to go through it I would be treated better...Just praying it is over soon or I find another Rad Dr.",
