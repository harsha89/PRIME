About a year ago I started receiving acupuncture for problems related to my stroke.  Quite accidentally I also realized that my \"post mastectomy\" pain was decreasing with weekly acupuncture treatments.  At present time the area is not as sensitive and the pain and tightness is much less.  As a result I am able to move my arm much easier and my shirt goes on with no problem!  I am also happy to say that what physical therapy could not do with my mobility the acupuncture has help with  tremendously as I am able to walk by myself now!  pattybay",
