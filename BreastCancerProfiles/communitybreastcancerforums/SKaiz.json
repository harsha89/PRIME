Greenish/Brown. I was also able to express it. Mammo/US were pretty inconclusive, I have VERY dense & cystic breasts. Dr sent me to BS who took slides to sample the discharge- cytology showed papilary & \"rare epithelial\" cells, Couldn't differentiate between a papilloma and BC. She recommended a total duct excision to remove it. So my surgery is scheduled for the 1st week in Jan (for insurance purposes). I'm more nervous about how my breast will look after the surgery then the actual surgery lol I have pretty small breasts, 34B, so i feel like i will just be left with a huge deformity. Has anyone had any similar experience? Any advice for before or after the surgery? Or advice for what questions to ask at my Pre-Op appointment? My husband is taking this all very lightly, but I just have a really strong feeling the pathology will come back positive for cancer. I will cross that bridge when I get to it, but it also makes me a little nervous that I'm waiting an extra month for the surgery (almost 3 months since I first noticed the diacharge). I haven't told anyone else about it yet, because I don't want my family and friends worrying so soon. I just wanted to maybe hear from someone who has had a similar experience? Thanks for listening!
