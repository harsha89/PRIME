My fiance' is a nurse, so I will let him check it for infection. Only 5 days to go. A nurse case manager called from my health insurance company. He says he will ok as many nights as I need, plus home care if I want it and my doctor writes for it. I will be alone during the day while DD and her husband are at work. Would it be a good idea to have someone check in on me?  Has anyone else had home care visits, and what is your opinion? I guess this is really going to happen. I took a \"before\" picture of my boobs yesterday. The left one with the inflammatory breast cancer in it looks red and angry and diseased(and huge) in the picture. It is time to part ways with that breast, do rads and get on with my life. Our wedding is still scheduled for March 28, rads or not. We are planning to go away that weekend, and take a longer honeymoon when I am fully recovered from rads. So one way to look at this is that I get TWO honeymoons out of the situation. Wedding arrangements:caterer, cake, flowers, photography, music, invitations, are complete. One missing item is THE DRESS, which I will not shop for until I see what kind of body I have to put in it. I know it will not be a low-cut garment. Just have to see what is available off the rack. Francine, I will be praying for your mastectomy to heal so that you do not need more surgery. Thank you for starting this thread. It has been an encouragement to me. HotandCold, I too have had chemo and am bald and scarred( I have incisions already from port placement and SNB, and soon the Mx scar). I will not know if I need more chemo until I get the pathology report from surgery. I do know that rads are in my immediate future. I have decided to handle it one day at a time. Each day I try to schedule something pleasant, so that I don't feel as if the whole day was wrapped up in cancer. Today I met someone at a diner for coffee and pastry. I put on nice clothes and all my \"Look Good, Feel Better\" makeup that I got for free at the ACS workshop. I felt like a normal woman joining a friend for coffee. When I have to stay in, I make time for reading a good book, seeing a funny movie, doing my nails, or  something to pamper myself. I know these activities will be limited for a time after the surgery, but I'll sneak them in as soon as possible, because it is too depressing for me to look at all the cancer treatments stretching out into my future. One day I can handle.  Bette ",

Due to pain, I still take the narcotics from time to time, but  am trying to transition to Advil. Another reason not to drive. If this drain ever quits draining, it can be removed and life can get back to normal. I am getting married on March 28 and hope to be drainless by then. Next step for me is rads. Bette ",

So far, I do not have more chemo in my future, but I do have rads starting soon, then tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor for 5 years.  I pray for complete and fast recovery for all of us who have recently had surgery.

Even now it is uncomfortable to raise my arm on the side of the tumor due to an infection I have in my biopsied breast so I thought I would stay away from any over-the head styles. First-aid tape gives me blisters, so I will be sure and tell them about that. What else do I need to remember?  Bette ",

I spent the day in bed on pain pills. Today I bravely went off to work, a small pillow under my arm to prevent rubbing. I still found that the incision pulled and burned, although I was trying to do everything right-handed. Tonight it feels a bit better, so I am encouraged. Port placement is next Wednesday in the \"Interventional Radiology \" department. Not looking forward to it, but hoping that my left side will be feeling a lot better before the right side gets \"attacked\" According to what I have been told, I will be awake for the port placement.
