The doctor says the first node looks hot, but the other two don't look to be involved. I should find out in a couple of days. So I seem to fit firmly in this group. I won't see an oncologist for a few weeks still, but I'm expecting chemo and Herceptin, followed by rads. Linda ",

Just last week I started having symptoms of what seems to be Restless Leg Syndrome, according to the Mayo Clinic website. Does that go along with the neuropathy? Hopefully it will start fading after I hit the 3 week mark of this last cycle. Has anyone else experienced the Restless Legs stuff?",

The incisions don't really hurt, as long as I'm careful about my movements, but the dysthesia (stinging/burning/ raw feeling) that runs from the underneath part of my upperarm and around to the inside of my breast drives me crazy. It starts out in the morning as just annoying, but by lunch time it hurts a lot! It reminds me of having sunburns when I was teenager. I see the surgeon on Tuesday, so I plan to ask him for details of how to deal with it. ",
