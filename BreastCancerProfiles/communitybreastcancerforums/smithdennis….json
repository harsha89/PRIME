But I want to know if there could be permanent damage from the chemo to her heart or kidneys or if it's only until the chemo is completely out of her body.",

But she has also picked up side effects from the chemo such as dizziness and nausea. If these are temporary, could the high blood pressure be group with those? She hasn't felt the heartbeat change much and had taken a dose of the chemo (Arimidex) since thursday last week. Does anyone know how long it takes the chemo to leave your body, and how much of it would remain after a week?",
