The radiologist thinks its just scar tissue, but wants to make sure. I just was done with my radiation treatment in June. Mine was stage 1, so I am hoping it is just scar tissue. The ultrasound tech said the scar tissue was about 4 cm.",

I still have a couple more days on keflex. He wrote me a script for kelfex, just in case it comes back since this is the second time around with celluitis. I guess this dosen't happen too often with people who had breast cancer surgery. I read about 1% gets this complication. He said I'm his first patient to have celluitis to the bresat. Thanks for asking Kira.",

This time the rash was on my breast, part of my back and upper arm. I went to m doctor who put me on keflex for 10 days, but said if it gets worse to go to emerg. But in 2 days it did get a lot better, but my breast and arm the skin is dry and peeling. The skin color is pink and blochy. Does anybody know how long does it take to clear up?",
