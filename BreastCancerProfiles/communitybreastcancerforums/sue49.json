Clear margins around the tumors and nodes clear. My Onc says I have a 30% chance of getting it back again and recommends the whole chemo/tamoxifen/herceptin to reduce my risk. I am an anti-drug person and am trying to find women who are the same way and what help them decide what option to take...treatment or no treatment. If I'm not in the right place for this post, I appologize, please point me in the right direction. Â thanks",
