I could, however, give them advice I learned from the women in my family: 1. You are not in this alone. People .. men, women and children .. have been through this experience, too. 2. Relax. Meditate. Go outside and fly a kite, buy a yo-yo, sit under a tree and find weird images in the clouds above. Pray. Remember that worry stirs up the hormones and cancer loves those agitated li' hormones. 3. Write down 10 things you want to do in your life. Put it in your wallet. Refer to it often. Then, resolve to do ONE THING EVERY DAY toward one of those goals. Little things count. If you want a house on the beach, doing some architectural drawings of your dream home definitely counts. If you want a college degree, browsing courses and figuring out GPA's also counts. Want to learn to ice skate? Learn a language? Go for it! 4. Resolve to be the best, happiest, most serene and contented gal you can be .. like before your biopsy, perhaps? Worrying will not change one thing...except your complexion. 5. Study what other women in your circumstance have done to get through the rough spot. Hint: virtually all of them rely on humor and faith. Me? I operated on a very warped sense of humor and profound Faith. If I live through the cancer (which is not likely, considering my exposure to military toxins, then I will be here will my family and enjoying life. If I die, then I will be with my Heavenly family and enjoying Eternal life. Either way, I win. I do not worry about what happens to this physical body, knowing that it is temporal. The human spirit is eternal .. that is what I nurture. I made jokes like .. how can I lose all the hair on my head, and still have to shave my legs?! What's up with that?! When someone asked me how I was doing, the answer was (and is) a smile and the words thoroughly blessed Your outlook and your enthusiasm will play a great part in your recovery, if indeed the test results are positive. If not, your outlook and enthusiasm will play a great part in preventing cancer.",
