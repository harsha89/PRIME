Seaglasser, collecting sea glass, shells, rocks, driftwood & other stuff which washes ashore to turn them in collections in ball jars, jewelry (wire-wrapped, don't beli in drilling glass) and sea glass mobiles. Was working on getting an Etsy shop going but my parents were badly injured in a bad car accident and have been nurturing them back to Heath, happily they are much better. You're ne at rest when your loved ones are ill. They are 88 & 89 and I am very blessed to have them alongside me during my healing journey :) I am also interested in photography and had been practicing soft focus shots on my garden and porch plants. I'd grown those to give beauty and nuture to my Mom and Dad while they recovered and were housebound and like a boomerang it came back to bless me with cheerful flowers and indoor plants still lasting into November- although the garden outside is probably going to go soon as I'm in the northeast :( I did manage some herbs but would like to restart an indoor garden if I can find seeds online as my chemo is 6 months and I will be on TDIas the commute is long and the environment is steady/busy and immune concerns with 450+ people I interact with... Because I am a computer person in my day job :) which is fun, it's fun, it's never the same and LOL everybody knows my name. Last day was Friday as my chemo starts Monday and I felt very teary as there's been a lot of love and support. I also love to dabble with drawing and painting... I did not have an iPad but splurged on iPad air 2 and am loving it!!! It's got some drawing & painting apps I've purchased, along with I Love Lucy videos from tv series- I will always laugh wTching her!!! And oh yeah this game called Covet, fashion app, fair warning very addictive!!! I live with my Mom & Dad, totally blessed as they are amazing and two beautiful black cats rescued from the local shelter last year. Zoey is my cat and she's been keeping a close eye on me lately- so sweet!!! I have a beautiful 32 old daughter, 11 year old grandson and a great son in law who I call my son. Never got married but having a good life. I'm glad to part of all of your lives, I'm an ear if you need one:) Sorry wordy huh??? Stocked up veggies frozen fruit greek yogurt, kefir,lentils, black beans, spices etc. nd making a chemo soup in the crockpot and going to dye my hair one more time. Tomorrow my daughter is helping me put pink streaks in, I love the color pink, luckily it coincidences with breast cancer colors LOL Hugs and Love to all of you",

Today was my last work day, love and support from co-workers helped but felt such loss leaving, even though it's temporary it felt like goodbye. So I am right there with you, you're not alone, k? Hugs! Btw stupid flu shot side effects today mild and totally annoyed last \"feel good\" days may be stolen but beats getting the flu full on later ;) I too have been feeling broken, a bit stripped down by the process that has been and is to come. We'll never be who we were before, which is really tugging at me for myself and in all the stories I read. It's true. But there are a lot of beautiful things this beast can't have and that is our spirit and our soul, as well as our love and support for one another I will check out the you tube video, thanks :) Trying to slip into weekend mode and ignore Monday - it's not coming this week, really it isn't lol  ",

Wishing all of us starting or entering in another round this week peace and healing and all the best outcome and lots of hugs!!! I start tomorrow, this am was very rough emotionally for me (I hugged my yoga mat as I cried and realized that this is the last day of the old me, chemo will impact me and change me, hmmm maybe I'll become Wonder Woman! Zap Kapow, oops think that was in Batman, little cartoon sayings popped up to hide the violent scenes :) I may take the anxiety meds from my oncologist tomorrow after all, as my OB/GYN nurse told me now is not the time to be macho. So for anyone on here feeling that know you are not alone. It's ok. It's ok to need the meds as Wendy, aka Tigger2 said take them when you need them. I just wish I had them tonight but I do have chamomile tea thanks to BonnieD's suggestion so will go \"there\" tonight :) - thank you BonnieD, would love to hear more about herbs, I am big on pulling anything in to support my body in all that it will go through and I've been interested in them but too busy and overwhelmed to focus and try stuff. That all being said I feel so very blessed to be with all of you, through all the good, the difficult and inspiring. What an amazing group of women you all are!!! If you don't realize it look in the mirror and smile at yourself, BALD IS BEAUTIFUL. I did try to dye my hair pink today, LOL it only took on a couple of strands and the rest stayed blonde. For a moment I had this false little hope my hair is also going to resist the chemo... so NOT! So I too will shave it down soon. And then it will hats...I've picked up a few from Ocean State Job Lot, thankfully its Winter season so there are some nice fleece lined and cute ones. I may wig shop but I'd really like a pink/blonde one for fun. Tigger2/Wendy LOL oops sorry, but sooooo glad your one nighter turned into 22 years, here is to 22 more and congratulations, he sounds like a keeper :) and thank you for remembering all of us starting chemo tomorrow, a virtual hug! LeslienVA I think you are making a smart decision for your circumstances, we're sort of in the same place on that one. It's hard because it's such an individual decision, for me I felt no pressure from my coworkers or bosses but overall when my navigator and others would ask if I was working through it I was wondering how I'd pull it off as I've been bad off all year with fatigue (even slept at the hotel near work a couple of times). Long commute, big exposure being IT support to over 400 people with colds and flu and my oncologist said no. So I think it really is relative. It would be nice if I could as I can distract myself with it and ignore the cancer stuff. But I do have a project (when I go back) but I can research now if I need to escape (Office 2013 and what it implies for how our environment will work). That's not them asking that is me being able to use what I need to get through this beast... HUGS to you. Heal, be well, take that time to sustain your future ahead. We'll be through this before we know it, at least my nurse said I'll be surprised at how fast it goes by... BTW ladies, have heard the real tough part comes post treatments, when all is said and done the \"crash\" no future support, nowhere to go to etc. So maybe if that is true we have a POST CHEMO/RADs etc group? I know I'm missing some of your posts here, I've been on here reading less the last couple of days as I made sure I got Mom and Dad out for lunch and grocery shopping yesterday, prepped for soup and hair dying and today my daughter, grandson and son (in-law) and Mom and Dad all went for lunch and shopping (need to lay in bird seed as who knows when me the driver will be up and about)... stuff. If I missed you I'll catch up but until then YOU ARE ALL IN MY PRAYERS and ALL OF YOU GET HUGS (not shouting just emphasis ;) Love and Hugs my dear friends ",

I did drink icy cold water during treatment. And I drank a lot of water the days ahead and when I got home. I got nauseous on the way home and took the pills. At home I then drank ginger tea and tried to keep getting water in. I fell asleep, woke up, got off the couch, showered and to bed, slept all way through night & most of am. I too stayed on nausea meds 4/5 days. I did not get constipated, but I normally take magnesium anyways, cleared that onc doc and am finding it helps. I was very fatigued that first week and could not concentrate etc but it was not horrible. Everyone seems to react different but we're getting different drugs... Mine are a/c. I will keep you in prayer. For me I also had a port put in that same day. That terrified me too but I gave it over to Jesus and then I was a lot calmer. Love and hugs - chris",

He sang,recorded and toured too, how wonderful, hoping you have access to those recordings to revisit and I know you must have terrific memories to sink into. I definitely have felt my brother and best friend as they moved on, they've been with me, but the grieving process takes its time. Be kind to yourself and lean into Jesus as you need to. Healing takes time. He's definitely in a better place, probably singing and working in the Lords church actively. Love and hugs my friend. Thinking of you and prayingfor you! Ugh 3xs thankful they finally got it. Hoping you heal ok there. Port went ok, numbing creme applied but still felt it but ok. Last time had really bad nausea, fatigue and back pain after round 2. So far loose stool, heartburn, slight nausea. So am happy that's it. We're 3/4 done. Think you have 4 Cytoxan & Taxotere now, or is Taxotere later? Chris",

Someone on the Facebook group mentioned their port malfunctioned too, they couldn't draw blood but apparently could dispense through it, so stuff can happen... I remember reading a story on one board of a blood draw which the tech kept going at over and over and the husband spoke up and told the tech to get a nurse, the tech never tied off with a tourniquet so that's why it wasn't working!

Let's face it the process is not conducive to forming positive thoughts, it's ok to vent :) So sorry to hear of the issue for you vein Monday, the port is not totally terrible, I am thinking of you and will keep you in prayer for you port surgery on the 22nd, sending you gentle hugs and much love And when it gets back think ahead to your marvelous trip coming up :)",

Those hurting days passed. I am not shaving, I just can't let go of it :( so I comb over and wear hats outside. Sunday we went out for lunch and I did go hatless in the restaurant. If it were me I'd go wigless, oops don't have one still, but however you feel comfortable warmth wise and setting wise ... I'm hoping you can hold onto your hair too :) Thank you, am much better now I can get healthy foods in I'm feeling better energy too :) How are you doing, where are you in your rounds??? I didn't know about the chemo angels - that package sounds awesome!!! Love and hugs to you :)",

I've just made chamomile tea to calm it down a bit. Spices in my soup. Really want to take goldenseal & echinacea as I've found they lessened a bout with flu years back and believe they help me stave off colds. Wanted to do dandelion root for liver support and marshmallow root? for lining of digestive I think it was but education nurse warned some herbs may be counterproductive - hoping my oncologist will green light them and can order online/deliver in if can't get out. I give you props for healthy eating, I don't think it will let you down and it seems like BC is just luck of the draw, you like me are hormone positive and at 53 I can say my PMS has been progressively nastier and more difficult each decade. So long point is you may have been unable to avoid it. I'm guessing it's how our hormones behave...

I asked them about marshmallow root (believe if memory serves that is good for your linings of your digestive tract) and she and my nurse said they'd never heard of it but it was ok... so have a combo herb tea I found with echinacea that I am using.

I had a lot of anxiety too but it went fine. The nurses and my doc were there at each step - even when I kiddingly told my nurse not come in my pod with two drip bags, then I greenlighted her as they were Antinausea and steroids ;) I did accept ativan for calming me down as I was pretty nervous. You'll be in my prayers, hang onto your faith in the Lord, and for me I have to picture Jesus face then I feel peace, just standing with Him helps :) You are not a weirdo, social anxiety is a real thing, I hate being a focal point and will always deflect attention away from myself as fast as I can. Hugs. Scared is normal and in my mind you can be scared and still be positive - not the same thing :) As my gyno/ oc told me now is not to be Macho, if you need the MEDS take them, and I'm here if need an ear :) Hugs my friend",

I am so unused to any hair pampering anyways, I've dyed it blonde and trimmed it myself since high school (am 53)... So it's awkward for me to go, and I don't sit still well. When my daughter put in pink color a few weeks back I was so grateful for it because I had no experience with using that type of color, but I was champing at the bit to get out of the chair... I got to see if she can go with me to wig shop, if not I'll go and take my Mom... I think my daughter will be a huge help on deciding but she's so busy in her own life I don't want to steal her time :) Now, how about you, how are you feeling?",
