Pretty soon after I noticed the there is an extra flabby bit on my trunk just below armpit to on/above bra line on RHS as well as a dimple/pit where Mx scar finishes It is not the same on LHS. BS tried to say swelling that would go down. But it's not and even having lost 3kg it doesn't seem to have changed either. It seems to rub/chaff a bit on my upper arm too. Is it the bit they leave incase you want recon ? I think the bit above at front looks fatty to compared to LHS when you were a sleeveless TShirt where arm meets top of where breast was when arms are held by your side ( if that makes sense) Don't think it is lymphodena but I did have ALD too Any answers ladies ??
