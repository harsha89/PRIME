Finished day 2 today! I anguished over the choice of 3 1\\2 weeks versus 6 1\\2 weeks....finally decided on 3 1\\2 and the song playing during my very first treatment ...Beatle's \"let it be\"...it felt like such a God moment for me. Had a little tear sliding down my cheek and I couldn't move, which gave me a little chuckle!. After this week of trying to \" decide\" I almost feel like in addition to being a treatment survivor I will be a decision maker survivor! Keep on slathering those breasts!",

Rang the bell and passed out Almond Joy bars to everyone I came in contact with from the parking attendant who waved me in every day to the 'cancer parking only lot' to the girls who registered me, to the multiple techs who wanted to know my name birthday and which breast they were treating to the nurses and docs! I thanked them for bringing \" joy\" to this very nutty time!!!! It felt good to give to them what they have given to me for each of these 18 treatments. There was one tech who really brought a smile to my face and I couldn't figure it out for a few days, then I realized as she was lining me up and they were confirming markings etc, she always referred to each one as beautiful! It sounded odd at first but it put such a sweet positive spin on it all for me! In this difficult journey I do feel blessed for the people God has shared with me. I have had major redness, itchiness that really kicked in around #14. lots of zingers or just plain breast pain and a very angry nipple most days ( only way to describe it). One day I sat with a bowl over my breast so nothing would touch it!! Pretty funny, but worked wonders. So now I move on to Tamoxifen and keep my fingers crossed that I don't have any issues! I have not posted much but I gained much by reading, so thank you all for that! I wish all of you success in your treatments and a life filled with little joys along the way!!!",

Ironically I did bring a small bag of bite size Mounds and my doc thought that was funnier.....\"thanks for treating my mounds\"!! I just brought them for anyone who didn't like nuts!!! Very funny! I like the Spring 15 drug start idea. I should be starting tamoxifen in a few weeks but I want to delay until June. Want a chance to get \"me\" back before I have to lose \"me\" again. Also going on a big trip and don't want to risk SE's. My MO does not want me to wait. anyone have any insight?",
