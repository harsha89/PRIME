I started drinking aloe juice daily after the first treatment - it is very soothing to your digestive tract. I also added prune juice just before my 2nd treatment, and that helped eliminate constipation, which I had badly the first time. Pure juice for both, no added sugars or anything, and they are not medication. Maybe they would help you too.",
