Radiologist told me to prepare for cancer. 1cm mass to R breast, lymphnodes clear on ultrasound. I am an RN so it only makes this worse cuz I have seen the worst and know too much! Radiologist assured me I am going to be fine, its small, we caught it early and he doesn't see node involvement. Trying to keep positive but also prepared to hear its cancer. If so, I will be ok...a bump in the road! xo",

Even still its hard going thru the fears and unknowns of BC and the emotions of ending a bad relationship. Cant stop thinking of what Im gna hear when I wake up..,are my nodes clear?? Will I need chemo?? May 15th cant come soon enough",
