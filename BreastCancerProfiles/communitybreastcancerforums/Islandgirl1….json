I now intimately know the fear, inability to sleep, inability to eat...and the myriad of emotions that have accompanied my every waking minute these past few weeks since I was told \"there is a suspicious finding on your mammogram.\"  And I don't want to keep going through that.  And I will, because it is my nature.  It will begin about a month before I'm due to have a mammogram.  It will continue until I receive an \"all clear.\"  If I don't receive an \"all clear\", then I will have to once again go through what I'm going through now.  I do not want that black cloud hanging over me every 6 or 12 months.  I want to take care of this and move on.  No one has \"frightened\" me into this.  I am a very intelligent woman, and this is an informed choice, not an emotional one. My doctor and I had a very detailed discussion of the  \"no difference between length of life between bilateral mastectomy and lumpectomy\" statistics, but this is not just about \"length\" of life, it is about qualify of life.  That black cloud would reduce my quality of life because I am a person who can face anything when I know what I'm dealing with...but who does not do as well with the unknown. Those 364 days a year of \"unknown\" before and after the day of hearing \"all clear\", will be of reduced quality for me.  Of course there will still be some of that \"unknown\" because not all breast tissue can be removed, but the chances are greatly reduced. My doctor does not feel that a bilateral mastectomy is overkill.  He stated it clearly as one of my options and said the choice is entirely up to me, as it should be. When I place the worth of my breasts up against the worth of my peace of mind and ability to move forward....peace of mind wins every time.  That's just how I roll. :)",
