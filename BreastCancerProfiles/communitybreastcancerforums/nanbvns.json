I found my MRI results on my portal and saw otherwise.Â  I don't want to be be a pest, but I don't have another scheduled appointment for 6 weeks. Is it alright to make an appointment for a face to face and discuss my condition? Dx 1/2008, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IIIA, Grade 3, 7/22 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

Does anyone have any thoughts on this before I call my doctor. I was diagnosed with bi-lateral breast cancer with nodes positive 6 years ago and had bi-lateral mastectomy, lots of chemo and radiation. Now I'm worried about the lumps being from the radiation.
