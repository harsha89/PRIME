She was the one who wrote the script for the sleeve, she said some times we do the therapy but we're going to leave that up to the oncologist when you come back on June 11th for you regular appointment. So I'm supposed to wear this for the next 2 weeks and see what the dr. says. Thanks binney and moogie. :) I also woke this morning with itching on the same arm, is that a symptom  of lymphedema?",

I was also told to stop being on the computer unless I could learn left handed, is that true? I was told stop crocheting and doing anything that makes the arm just keep moving, like washing dishes, folding clothes, mopping, anything I HAVE to do I now have to stop.I have nobody to take over all my stuff plus they have to do their stuff and jobs too. I'm going to call the dr. office tomorrow morning and see what they have to say about me not going for my fitting appointment. The PA did say get it asap. Is a sleeve and glove covered under insurances? This whole thing is so confusing to me.",

After July 1st my insurance changes and I'm not sure if I'll be able to pay for office visits. Right now I have NO copays. My husband works for the school system and hes off work starting Monday until school goes back in September. Now I know why she asked if my chemo brain ever went away. ",

I wore the wrapping over night, took it off the next morning to shower and could not figure out how to wrap it by myself. She made it look so easy. So I've been wearing my sleeve since Friday. My husband tried helping wrap me today but it feels a little tight. Any help on how to teach him would be greatly appreaciated! ",

I started chemo in March 2008 and I finished chemo one year ago this month. They say I'm a year and a half survivor! When I started my hair started falling out one week after my first treatment. The private area lost it maybe a few weeks later. That part has not grown back in completely but I'm not complaining. About a week after I stopped treatment my head starting getting peach fuzz, by December my head  was covered with hair but it looked like a militery cut. LOL I was blond with a little gray. It came back in black but went to all gray after a few months. I now have wavey, curly hair almost shoulder length. It was always wavey but now I have curls in the back that I never had. I did the hat and scarf thing all the time, the only time I felt comfitable showing my bald head was at the cancer center. But thats just me. Take a friend it makes the time fly when you're sitting waiting for the meds to go through. I always had my bag ready to go, a book, lunch, eye glasses, water bottle, MP3 player, cell phone and cross stitch. You will make it though all the treatments, sometimes you think you won't but I'm proof that you will. :) I just celebrated my 50th bithday on July 9th.",
