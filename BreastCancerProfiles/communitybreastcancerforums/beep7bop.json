It is never easy being a new mother, I can remember sitting with my baby rocking and crying. I didn't know why I was crying just cried. I loved being a new mother, but I was so tired. You have every reason to cry if that is what you need to do. Don't be so hard on yourself. Just Love your baby, your husband because he is lost in this too and most of all love yourself.. You will pull thru thus. Life will get better. God Bless You.. You will Smile threw those tears. Kick BC in the BUTT!!!",
