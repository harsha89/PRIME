I have good range of motion - I was able to lift my arm to my shoulder on Friday morning, so I guess that is a good place to start.  It gets a little better each day.

And yet, I don't know her or her situation, so I am trying not to judge.  Like alesta said, no easy answers.    Anyway,  that was my experience.  Also, sidebar - I got incredibly crappy pain management from that hospital during my stay, so it wasn't like my cheerful, educated, and engaged self got better medical care.   ",

I am in a similar situation - several friends have put me in touch with a mutual friend who was diagnosed Stage IV from the get-go.  Our friends all think that we are in the same boat, but I know that isn't true at all.  I got some great advice on how to approach the situation from the women on these boards and and I honestly think I did it right.  I mostly correspond with her through her husband (she's had a rough first few months), but he said that she feels really supported by me.  Anyway, the ladies here are giving you good advice.  And stormynyte, I'm so sorry about what your dad did.  He was probably trying to help, but dear lord. ",

(One was a palpable lump on diagnosis.) I make sure to exercise every day, even the day after treatment.  Treadmill or yoga.  I also drank a ton of water DURING the actual infusion.  It helped to move the chemo through my system and I didn't have as much nausea.  Don't worry, it will still be in there long enough to do its job.  On my third treatment, I didn't drink enough water during infusion and I felt MUCH sicker later.    I do a lot of guided imagery and visualization, too.  That really helps.    Claire, what was your recovery from your lymph node surgery like?  How long before you were exercising etc?  Any tips for preventing lymphedema? ",

There are women who can smoke, drink, and eat sausage until they are 103 and they will never get cancer.  We are not those women.    That being said, did we cause our cancer?  Nope.  Can we influence our prognosis through diet and lifestyle choices?  I firmly believe so.    (I don't believe I am genetically predisposed to cancer - I am the only one with cancer in my family, including my identical twin sister.) ",

She did ACT last year, which didn't work at all.  The tumor barely shrank.  Then she had a BMX and radiation.  Then she did Tamoxifen, which obviously failed.  I'm guessing that it is now behaving as a TN cancer, since our onc is trying a platinum drug and not a hormonal.  (She isn't super clear on the details and I don't want to pepper her with questions.   She jokingly asked me if I wanted to come sit with her during her infusion tomorrow.  I'd have to rearrange work, but I'm thinking about it.)   Any advice about Cisplatin and its side effects would be greatly appreciated.  She is 32, engaged to be married to a great guy, and has an adorable 5 year-old boy.   Many thanks and much love...

And while I don't think that we \"caused\" our cancer,  I have also read enough to know that diet/lifestyle does make a difference.  I also know that there are plenty of health nut/vegans that get cancer.  However, I don't think that  they are in the majority.  I considered myself a health nut before I got diagnosed, but I was still able to make a lot of changes which means my lifestyle wasn't as healthy as I thought it was.   hdangelbaby, I'm sorry that your friend said that.  She is probably scared out of her mind for both of you.  People say the strangest things to reassure themselves that they won't get cancer.   But, if I were you, I'd cut out the alcohol except for special occasions.  Totally up to you, though. ",
