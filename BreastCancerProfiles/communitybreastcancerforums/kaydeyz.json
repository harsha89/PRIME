Would you do it again? Have you heard anything about recurrence? Log in to post a reply",

The incision from surgery is approx 2-2.5\", and I still had an area around it that was still raised and swollen (?). Also, the cavity is center and back near my chest. I'm not sure if location makes a difference. All I can say for sure is that I feel better than I ever imagined I would. The pain in my breast is minimal, and as I mentioned before, it seems that the incision and my skin are the most sensitive. Hopefully good results continue. Thanks so much for your input!",

I was told that side effects might not be noticeable until after treatment. I am a teacher and will have to prepare for a sub for the week of treatment as I have a 120 mile round trip each day. I am hoping to continue in the classroom after that. Did your side effects show up later as well? Thank you so much for your input!",

Actually, what happened was I happened to catch a story on brachytherapy on the local news just 3 days before my rad setup. I was very interested and talked with my onc, who thought the external radiation would fit my case best.  I think I had to be signed up for treatment within 45(?) days of surgery, which gave me just a week of consideration (I had a second biopsy before rads could begin). At any rate, I gathered information from my rad onc, the research nurse, the radiation nurses that had experience with this treatment, and positive input from CherylRubie. I looked for information online also, but have no idea of the sites I visited. The study is in stage 3, and I just had a strong gut feeling that this was the way to go for me. Tomorrow is my first appt since radiation. I did neglect to mention shortness of breath as a side effect, but that is improving as well. Others have told me that is expected. I will ask my dr tomorrow. You have to do what you feel comfortable with. Good Luck to You!",

My breast feels fairly normal so far, no weird lumpiness or pain! Hope this helps you!",

I had a 50/50 chance to receive conventional radiation or partial. Wow, finally someone that might be able to relate to my experiences! Member CherylRubie has been the only person to respond to my inquiries thus far. She participated in the study in 2006. I believe you can find our conversations if you click on my name.  I am glad I was in the group that received the newer treatment. I believe my side effects have been less intense than those receiving conventional rads. I had slight burning toward the end of the 5 day treatment and developed an itchy rash a week out. The area at the incision was the worst. I wore a sports bra for a week, but then felt well enough to go back to my regular bra. I had mild fatique for a couple weeks afterward...not drop-dead tired, more like curling up with a blanket on the sofa after work and thinking about how exhausted I was! My cavity is center and back toward the chest wall, and is approx the size of an egg, but my breast still looks and feels normal at this time. Three weeks out and I'm feeling good. No pain. Like Cheryl told me, once lumpectomy and radiation was experimental, and now we know it is as good as a mastectomy. I have 2 daughters, and I hope this treatment will benefit them should they land in my shoes. I am hoping for the best results possible, and wish the same for you! Keep me posted!",
