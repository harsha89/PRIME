Good luck to you.  I found through this whole process that people want to feel useful to YOU.  I would normally have a hard time with that, but realized it made them feel better about what was going on with me so I just sat back and enjoyed it.  Thoughts will be with you.

Here's to many cancerversaries for us all! Cindy",
