I am almost on the same regimen and I felt great for the first 3 days. Infusion on Wednesday and Sunday was my first down slide, lasted until Wednesday. And by noon Wednesday I was pretty much back to myself. Still having a little bathroom issues but other than that nothing else. So I am after some TMI this morning. Is it just me or does anyone held have freaky BM??? Meaning it just doesn\u2019t look right at all. No big D it\u2019s normal but it don\u2019t look normal at all. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s connected to what I am eating or it\u2019s just supposed to look like that. Since I\u2019m throwing (hushed about) stuff out there, I never got mouth sores but I did get some little bumps all over my face, some on my neck and scalp, then in my bikini line area, they have pretty much healed now, but this morning I have one on my lady bits...ouch! Seriously??? It\u2019s amazing how treatment is varied so much from clinic to clinic and state to state. I switched oncologists 3 times until I found one I was comfortable with, so for those of you having issues with your doctor, switch...it\u2019s worth it in the long run. I\u2019m in Clearwater Florida and our clinical support system is amazing here. We have CapSS which give us free support, they have classes for makeup and hair, they have yoga, counseling and just pretty much anything you need. I\u2019m sure they have something in every state. On this site look up the \u201cfreebies\u201d you can send away for free stuff like care kits and hats and even enter for trips later on. LIVESTRONG is a company that offers help, they do free classes throughout the country at local YMCA\u2019s. Help is out there you just have to dig for it. On a somber note, saw the update on my insurance app last night and just about had a stroke!! 54,000.00 for 1 chemo treatment. OMFG! That\u2019s more than my car! I\u2019m going to be worth about a million dollars when this is over, wonder if I can insure my self for that much like the stars do??? Take today to be a little less serious and enjoy Tina. ",

Definitely starting to shed today. I have a ton of hair and I lose a lot all the time anyway, but it seemed to be more when I showered so I cleaned my hair brush before I brushed my hair and sure enough, filled the whole hairbrush when I was done. 😩. It won\u2019t be noticeable for a little bit because I have so much but it won\u2019t be long.

I did wear a mask all day at work because I am in nursing, it\u2019s actually required when we are putting patients on and off but I just kept it on around the patients. Which of course caused patients to question why I was wearing it and did I have a cold etc. etc. Once my hair disappears I won\u2019t be able to avoid those questions as easily. But I don\u2019t want them feeling sorry for me. I am supposed to be taking care of them, they don\u2019t need to worry about me. I\u2019m in dialysis so I have the same patients 3 days a week so everyone is like family to us and to each other. Rljes- my white count on Monday was 2.2 and that was day 12, my MO said she could tell by the other labs that is was on its way up and today I had zero aches, so I\u2019m assuming that low white count is causing my achy feelings. I can\u2019t imagine how low it was at day 7 if it was 2.2 5 days later. Meowmmy- I didn\u2019t have itching per se, but I had a break out down there. It was mostly on my bikini line but some creeped a little further in. I also got it on my face, neck and hairline. They were a cross between blisters and acne. Kinda weird. But I\u2019m a picker, so I pretty much popped them when they showed up and they quit itching and healed up fairly quickly. My MO put me on Claritin for my constant runny nose and it has worked wonders. No runny nose at all. She thinks I probably have allergies that my body usually fights off but now it can\u2019t, hence the Claritin. I\u2019m so happy it worked. She also changed how I take my steroids post infusion hoping to keep me feeling better longer after chemo so I don\u2019t have to take so many days off work and to keep me from feeling miserable over Christmas. Fingers crossed it works!! Hope everyone is doing well, have to catch up on reading everyone\u2019s posts! Hope99- how are you feeling today girl? Stay strong, you can do this!! Tina",

The Claritin is working, im taking it once a day and if I am and hour late the nose just starts running, sneezing and runny eyes. I agree it may be lack of hairs, but also your immune system is needed to fight allergies and with it being reduced there\u2019s no extra to fight it. My son is allergic to dust and as a child his poor body couldn\u2019t fight off anything because it spent all it\u2019s time fighting his allergies. They checked him for HIV and Cystic Fibrosis because they were so sure he had some horrible disease, but it was all just allergies. Luckily he outgrew it, but his childhood was spent mostly in hospitals. Mkn86- I\u2019m the same way with foods when my taste goes. Orange soda is the only thing I can drink besides water. And I throw turmeric and ginger from the health food store into my water. Nothing with sugar substitutes tastes good. Potatoes and toast are a big go to food. Even peanut butter which I hate normally. And sweets...I live on sweets. Especially at work right now since we are overflowing with them from patients for the holidays.

Last week my tire pressure light was on, fixed it, the next day my change oil light on, fixed that. Now today there is a little wrench light that came on when I left work. Really???

Just my little vent for the day, I don\u2019t vent to anyone because people tend to pity you when you do, and I am so glad I can just say what I need to to people that get it. On a plus note one of my patients got me scrub hats from a nursing shop that are so cute, I can\u2019t wait to wear one tomorrow. Tina.",

For this worrying about the \u201cfunny\u201d hair growing in, italjed to someone today that told me her dad had a head full of fuzzy gray hair post chemo and it all fell out and his normal black hair came in just fine, so apparently this is all normal. Fingers crossed. It did ease my mind some. Swimming pool is nearly up to 75, maybe by this weekend I can get out there and get some snorkeling practice in. For some reason I just float and have to keep practicing to dive to the bottom so I can do some good snorkeling in the gulf this summer. That and this fat lady needs to do some laps.

I\u2019m using an app called Chemowave, it lets you put in how you feel and each symptom and it tracks it so you can remember how you felt and when. That way if I forget I can go back and make sure I don\u2019t schedule work or things to do on those bad days. It also helps me see that I\u2019m improving as the days go on. Kinda like seeing the contraction is almost over in labor only a very long contraction. Tina",

Orangedaisy- I was all for hoping facial hair and body hair would disappear forever! No more shaving or plucking...how awesome would that be. Just keep that brows, lashes and head hair!!

When tracking your numbers either weekly or monthly you will see the drop in your trend which is mainly what I am watching plus what\u2019s meds I take on what days. As for numbers, your counts drop around day 7 or 8 then they are supposed to start trending up, most have their nadir done at day 7, unfortunately my MO was on vacation so I couldn\u2019t get mine done on day 7, mine is getting done on day 12 which, whatever it isn\u2019t going to be accurate anyway. That said I am kinda winging it so I would think you would feel tired and generally off of your counts were down. Which I don\u2019t, so I am assuming they are fine. I did take major precautions the whole time I was out when it came to touching things and public restrooms, etc. the escalator just freaked me out. Idk how many people touch that thing.

I see from everyone\u2019s posts that they all do it in a way that works for them. I had to take compazine twice during round 1 and not at all during round two.

I\u2019m taking the fight the symptoms that show up approach instead of the prevent the symptoms that may never show up anyway approach. If that makes sense. The runny nose, heartburn and swelling last through my whole 3 weeks between cycles which is why I take those three meds regularly. Meowmmy- love it!!

I don\u2019t want my patients feeling sorry for me, it\u2019s my job to take care of them and to worry about them. My Tuesday Thursday Saturday patients have seen me all week with no hair so the questions have stopped mostly. Tomorrow is my first day back with my Monday Wednesday Friday patients since I shaved the head, so it\u2019s going to be a little overwhelming with their sympathy, even though they mean well. As for small town, I live in a pretty big area, and I don\u2019t run into people I know. I can imagine how uncomfortable that could be. It\u2019s the fact that people are feeling sorry for you that makes you feel uncomfortable, you aren\u2019t dead you don\u2019t need people to say how sorry they are. I wish people realized that\u2019s it just makes it worse when they do that. That was my rant of the day....🙄 Tina",

I was told to be careful from day 7-14 due to our white counts dropping so low, we are at risk to pick up infections. The nadir number is when you drop, that\u2019s why most had a set of labs drawn at 1 week post first infusion to see what their numbers were. Mine wasn\u2019t drawn until day 12 due to my MO being on vacation and on day 12 my wbc\u2019s were 2.2 which is pretty low but it was already on its way up so idk how low it got. I can feel when it starts dropping, I start getting achy and it gets worse until it comes back up. I wear a mask at work on those days and I sanitize constantly. If I go in public, I keep a 3 ft distance from people (droplets only got 3ft from people coughing), and sanitize every time I touch something I know a lot of people have touched. Shopping carts, escalators, money...before I eat or even put my hands near my face for anything I wash them. You can protect yourself without being in a bubble. I have the same regimen as you, just without the neulasta. You\u2019re probably getting a little cabin fever going on if you\u2019re staying cooped up all the time. I was told to get out and walk a little everyday, and that helped a lot. Being back at work has been a tremendous help so that I\u2019m not sitting at home wallowing. Hope you start feeling better soon, hopefully it is just from chemo and you haven\u2019t caught a bug. I don\u2019t know where you are or what the weather is like, but fresh air might help too.

Anything you can think of everyone has worried about. Most of us are through round 2 so far, some further and a few not as far. What I have learned so far is chemo day is a piece of cake, boring and long, but Netflix will travel with some headphones, snacks, lots of water and a nice fluffy blanket to make the day go by comfortably. I don\u2019t think anyone has been throwing up all the time, I haven\u2019t at all yet...today was close but that was my own fault. Depending on your regimen, which is different from mine, the next 3 days aren\u2019t too bad. Taste disappears by day 2. Day 4 is when I started feeling frumpy in round 1 ( tired, digestive issues). Lasted about 2-3 days, then felt achy like the flu was coming on. Ibuprofen kept that under control, by day 10 I was almost myself. Everyone has their own idiosyncrasies with chemo SE\u2019s which we take meds for regularly. Mine is fluid retention, runny nose and watery eyes and heartburn. Others have bone pain, neuropathy, mouth sores etc. there are a few cold capping, I did not. So they can let you know how that is going. Wasn\u2019t worth the effort for possibly not working. Hair has gone for most of us here and we are embracing it with humor!! Good news is, I get an extra 15 min of sleep since I don\u2019t have to do my hair, showers are a breeze, no shaving or plucking chin hairs. It\u2019s all good and 1 more step forward to being cancer free! Tina",

Still a 1A due to size but it had grown exponentially in 4 weeks. That being said mine is a grade 3, that tells you how many abnormal cells are visualized. Higher the grade the more abnormal with 3 being the highest. I\u2019m HER2+ so I know that\u2019s what\u2019s feeding my tumor, so herceptin is the med they are using to block that. Lymph node involvement let\u2019s you know if it\u2019s travelled. Triple negative becomes more difficult because they don\u2019t know what\u2019s feeding it. The other numbers you get are the oncology score (which I don\u2019t have) and your ki-67 which mine is 70%. That is the rate of growth. The one I had was growing extremely rapid. If I hadnt found my lump purely by accident, I would have been in big trouble. So stage really has little to do with the big picture. They removed all of mine, but if they missed anything it will come back, so I have to do the chemo. Blair2- glad today is a good day today for you too (for the most part anyway).

This will sound horrible (and it really was awful) but they gave me injections into my nipple and traced the path of the lymph nodes. That way they knew which ones fed where in the body and they could avoid the ones needed to drain fluid to the arms. Idk if they do this for all surgery\u2019s or only specific ones. It was worth it, no signs so far of lymphedema, but I really wanted to punch the radiologist and I called him a choice few names, it hurt that bad. Pain was over as quick as he did it but OMG!

I was glad they did mine first because they put the port in at the same time and I was relieved the tumor was gone because it was growing so stinking fast. As a nursing professional I can understand the reasoning behind doing chemo first, but as a patient I would rather have it out ASAP! Since yours was in the nodes they are wanting to destroy any cells that have escaped through those nodes before they worry about the cells in the breast.

After my lumpectomy I had bumps at the edges of all my incisions, I think it was the dissolvable stitches, once they dissolved the bumps disappeared. Hope99- take it one day at a time girl.

Idk which med caused it, but if it's the herceptin, it's here to stay for a while. I have neuropathy now, which started a little after my 4th and worse after my 5th. Last week she put me on b12, l-glutamine and folate for that, and it seems to be helping.i hate the swelling because it's Florida's and swimsuit season and I have no idea what my weight is because it fluctuates so much. I started a new diet to try and get some of it off. I thought i would loose weight during chemo, no such luck. Blair2- I am so glad they are working on your back pain. You suffered way too long with no real answers. Hope you find some relief soon. Just finished my second radiation treatment. The first one took forever with all the X-rays they were taking. I didn't even know they did my actual radiation until she told me I was done. I paid more attention today, no I realize the radiation part is the machine with the teeth like the movie alien. Every time I look at that thing with the teeth opening and closing that's what I see! Tina ",

Just feel cold all the time. Still swelling like crazy, all the lasix is causing me to have really low potassium so I have added supplements to my daily meds along with biotin. Come on hair!!!! Slowly getting off all the meds I was put on for side effects, down to vitamins, lasix and the occasional steroid well swelling gets ridiculous. Still weighing my options for rads, I was on board until another technician at work put their notice in. So now we are 5 short starting April 1st. So now it\u2019s up in the air again. I need to decide by April 4th which is my initial appt pre rads. I did get my echo today, I will check my online portal and see if the get it transcribed by tomorrow. Otherwise no new is good news and hopefully I don\u2019t decrease more than 15%, changing tx days will really throw a monkey wrench into the balls I juggle every day. So happy for all of us for finally making it across the line with chemo. Everyone\u2019s journey is different, but everyones journey is towards the same goal.

Hope99- As hard as it is....don\u2019t make yourself crazy. If you file away every piece of information and SE that you are given, you will lose your mind. Absorb each step a little at a time. I took the common SE and prepared for them. Grabbed suggestions from others to have on hand. IE: ginger, lots of water, bag for chemo, lotions, mints, mouthwash. Then take each SE as it comes. I track mine on Chemowave. So far I have been very lucky, day 5- no vomiting, little nausea, horrible mouth tastes,some fatigue and aches and pains. Every combo is different and person is different. I believe in mind over matter, you have to be strong mentally to be strong physically, don\u2019t let the fear overrule that. Tina",

Unfortunately or fortunately depending on how you look at it chocolate and sweets still taste amazing. Cheese is way too salty, and I normally love cheese.

I had friends in school, but they told me I had to quit because I couldn't do clinicals with chemo, so I don't really hear from them at all anymore, except 1 who works at my MO office. I took me 20 years to raise my kids and go back to school and this happens halfway through, idk if I will try it again. I had such plans for when I finished. I share a house with my mom and my oldest son, but all my other kids and grandkids are spread all over the country so I don't get to see them. I had a male \u201cfriend\" I would go out with a couple of times a month, but he has just kind of faded into the woodwork. I get a text every once in a blue moon. Saying hey let's get together for dinner or whatever and I let him know my schedule and then I don't hear from him. So I think that's a wash. He was a good friend too. I miss talking to him. So I work, a lot. It's not like we can join tinder or dating apps right now. My son is my plus one for my Christmas party next week, and his friends (who are mostly my age) are my social contacts. It's funny, we go fishing and out to play darts or pool. I am the designated driver since I'm not drinking and it's gives me a chance to get out of the house and socialize. They really have been great and they don't ask stupid questions and act just like they did before all this. So now that I'm a little teary-eyed writing this down, I feel a little better realizing who you're true friendsare. On a good note I slept 9hours straight through last night, no big D and feel great this morning. My mom bought a whole cut up fryer chicken and is making her fried chicken we had as kids in my new electric skillet I got for Christmas! Made Swedish meatballs in it Thursday, I love it!! Have a great weekend ladies! Tina",

I think tomorrow is going to be a challenge at work but I\u2019m off Tuesday and I should be back to normal Wednesday. The cold here isn\u2019t helping, it\u2019s sapping any energy I have, I\u2019m going to bundle up in a little bit just to get out of the house before football game at 1. Grabbed some chicken wings and fries for the game and will hunker down the rest of the day. Every morning is one day closer to being done!! Tina",

I should have cut my hair into a shorter style, I think it would of lasted longer. I had to shave it because it was so long it got into a tangled mess in the shower. So I grabbed the clippers and cut it to the shortest setting with no guard. Yeah that looked horrible because my hair is so thick and dark that what hair I still had connected looked patchy. Next day I grabbed shaving cream and a razor and shaved it. I had someone to help do that, but I think real barbers will do it for you. Be prepared...depending on your level of tan, you scalp is so pale, I have a tan line where my part runs down the middle. So to remedy this, I had on hand, lotion from Avon with a bronzer in it, I put that all over my head to even it out a little. I\u2019m not going to do wigs, just hats and a free head.

The lasix helps some but not very well. Today was pretty rough, mostly hip and thigh pain, almost fell in the garage when I got home from work. Luckily I am off tomorrow, I was able to drop my car off finally and get it fixed, so happy for that. They said it should be done tomorrow late morning. Then I have to take it back sometime next month for them to replace a recalled part. So besides that I\u2019m not going to be doing much tomorrow but resting. I have a feeling this round is going to hit me a little harder than the past 3 but we shall see. Strength and good vibes to everyone! Tina.",

I also have what I asssume is intestinal twitching. I feel like I have a toddler kicking around in there. I just ignore it. Runny nose constantly, claritin helps there, gassy as well, have anti gas meds for that, works like a champ. Can\u2019t be tooting around the patients. One bout of the big D, always at 1am, popped some Imodium, problem solved. Taste is coming back on day 8. No nausea at all, very little fatigue but muscle weakness. I think it\u2019s from just not moving as much as I normally do. I am bought about getting a membership to LA fitness to use on my days off to start some strength training. I worry about who used the equipment before me though. Swelling is starting, I\u2019m taking less lasix and adding the occasional steroid to combat that as needed. Rljes- I have the bruising as well, my platelets were 112 last go around so I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s why. It\u2019s minor but I keep a close watch for anything major and try not to injure myself. I\u2019m seriously accident prone. No mouth sores, but sores seem to pop up elsewhere like blisters, bought some baby diaper rash cream (balmex) and that keeps them from getting worse. Not so bad this go around, but last one it was really bad. On a good note I made lasagna for dinner (even made my own pasta). So everyone is fed for the rest of the week, Florida state fair starts today, so Saturday I am hoping to get my boy out there for day!! Tina.",

Orange daisy- I was worried about my hair growth but not so much now. They reduced both my meds tx4 and I have fuzzy growth, but it\u2019s white. I too had dark hair. I was getting a little scared. Started Biotin 5000 mcg yesterday just to give it a boost! So good news at infusion 5, I am officially done with chemo! Yeah!!! She said my labs aren\u2019t recovering well even with the reduced chemo amount so she is stopping the chemo. So I need to call my radiation oncologist and give her the heads up. Still have to go in every 3 weeks for herceptin and labs at least the next infusion. I may postpone rads a little bit since my March work schedule is already out and I didn\u2019t put in for the time off. But I can get the first appointment knocked out of the way. Tina.",

Hopefully I remember to tell them to order my meds ASAP so I\u2019m not waiting in the chair for an hour or more for pharmacy to bring them. Appt with MO at 820, then infusion and then appt with RO at 11. I hate having to squeeze everything into my only day off, and I feel so guilty actually having a day off. We are so short staffed at work it is borderline unsafe for the patients. Luckily we have about 100 years experience combined with the staff we have which makes it easier. Put in 30 hours Monday and Tuesday combined. No wonder my feet are still swollen. On the plus side my pool is up to 78 degrees yesterday so that\u2019s means swimming temps today. Bout dang time. I am usually in that pool a month by now, but the weather has no taste cooperated. Started getting the \u201cridges\u201d on my nails, it\u2019s only at the bottom half where the new nail has grown in. It\u2019s more of a normal color where the top half is kind of discolored. So once all the discolored part is gone I am heading to get a mani pedi. That\u2019s my sign that the new nail will be fully attached and grown in. Numb feet are making me crazy and it\u2019s worse at the end of the day. Being on them for 14hours probably isn\u2019t helping any. My laugh of the day yesterday, so I spent all day at work, I got home about 630p and jumped in the shower. When I took off my cap to get in, I looked in the mirror and did a double take. Holy hell, there is a large patch of hair in the front that wasn\u2019t there in the morning. Kinda shocked me that it grew that much in half a day. The back seems to moving along, the front not so much. I am waiting on the leg shaving. There is some fuzz there, but I am thinking back to when we were 12 and we were told \u201c don\u2019t shave your legs or it will come back darker and thicker\u201d maybe those rules apply now. I may look into a good electric razor and no blades. Might keep it down. No pit hair or jay-jay hair yet. If I had a man in my life, they would be oh so pleased. Lmao. It does help make bathing suit dressing much easier! I haven\u2019t braved the beach yet, hoping for a little more head growth before I do that. Maybe next weekend. Hope everyone has a great week and had an awesome Easter. Tina",

I am 7 weeks past chemo and I couldn\u2019t loose anything plus I still have swelling. Last Monday I decided I have had enough! I started my 7 days of the cabbage soup diet and so far I have dropped 10 lbs in 5 days. You can only do it for 7 days at a time. Hopefully I will keep going on the right track and get back down. I\u2019m doing radiation and they told me not to loose weight because it moves the markers and I pretty much told them that wasn\u2019t going to happen. I am not going to be like this anymore. As for memory, I was fuzzy. Not really memory loss, but it took me longer to say what I wanted to and I r ally had to focus. Especially when driving. I have noticed it seems to effect you worse the older you are, and I don\u2019t know your age. Mine is completely back to normal now. The only residual I have left besides very little hair, is the neuropathy which they prescribed vitamins for and the swelling which I take lasix for. I would suggest talking to your MO and see if they have suggestions, but my guess is it will be vitamins that aid in memory function. Good luck with the weight loss. I feel for you, I had to get new work clothes as well since I couldn\u2019t wear my regular ones anymore, I just keep washing and wearing the few I got. It sucks. Tina.",
