I was told that with surgery and radiation only there was a 58% chance of recurrence and that number decreases with each treatment option you choose. For instance, if you have hormonal therapy or chemotherapy it decreases, and if you do a combined therapy, hormonal and chemotherapy decreases even more. My oncologist used a tool called Â shared decision making to give me that info. I was diagnosed 3/5/08 . I have a histology grade 3, ER- POSITIVE, nodes negative, tumor size greater than 5 cm. Hope this helps.",

I finish Taxol 7/30 and was wondering how long after chemo do I have to wait until I have my mastectomy. Does anyone know the answer?",
