I am scheduled to get the results of my biopsy Friday and keep thinking how ironic it is that my situation is coming (hopefully) to conclusion now. I have had a lump for over a year and have been putting off a biopsy for months, a decision I hope I dont regret.  I had an excisional biopsy that I was so anxious over but it was relatively painless and I even travelled  7 hours the next day to visit my son at college. I feel much less anxious now that its over for some reason. I guess I am just going to be happy to have answers. I wish you all the best! ",
