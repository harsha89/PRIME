I just got my pathology report and it seems I have an extranodal extension of 0,50 cm on lymph node, the only one with cancer of 22 extracted. This was totally unexpected and hard to digest since it seems I have a higher risk of recurrence and lower survival chance. I would like to know if anyone of you had a similar case. My cancer is hormonal and Her2 positive. I had chemo already and double mastectomy on 12/5/17. The plan is start radiotherapy for 5 weeks on January and continue with Herceptin every 3 week for a year. Tamoxifen will be added soon along with a new medication. Thank you and hope to all! ",
