I ask because I have a condition called aquagenic pruritis (itching induced by water) that I developed at about your age, and it absolutely made me think I was losing my mind. In any case, I agree with the earlier post that a dermatology consult is in order. There are many, many things that cause itching, and I think a dermatologist might be the person to help rule out some, and refer you elsewhere if they can't make a firm diagnosis. Good luck!",
