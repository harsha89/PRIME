I have no religious or faith commitment or identification.  The closest I can get is to see the power and force of good in every human being (god?).  Tanya is a Presbyterian minister and is the chaplain whose beat is the outpatient oncology center.  Every week when I am in the chair, Tanya comes to see me so we can commune together.  We talk about books (we both read nonstop), family (she has a wife, I have a husband), travel and so on.  At the end of the visit we hold hands and meditate for a moment or two.  I care about her and she helps me. As I was dragging my terrified heart to the scan dept, who should I see but the excellent Tanya coming down the hall.  She knew I was heading for scans (how?) and just wanted to tell me she thought all would be well, her nose told her so.  Talk about taking a risk - Sounds like such a stupid little thing when I put it into words, but my heart soared at the time. Somebody in this world feels like it's going to be OK.  Is this what they call a blessing?  Love to all, SUE Dx 12/2010, IDC, Stage IV, 26/35 nodes, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

I decided early on to tell people - not strangers or distant folks, but all my close friends know, all my family members know (we are a close family), even my friends at soup kitchen where I work. For me, this has just made things more simple. On the other hand, I also definitely did not want to deal with \"the look\" from people who know (pity, fear, etc) nor did I want to fool with inappropriate or intrusive questions. I have to admit that my solution has been to \"do my theater\" - that is, I adapt a tone and demeanor when \"it\" comes up so that I get the kind of response I want. Pretty controlling I know. But the good news is that for the most part I feel pretty good and have been pretty lucky, so that's what gets communicated. When I need some TLC, I know who I can lean on. I'm sorry that your situation has changed, Stef, but there is good news to be had on these boards and love and support as well. SUE",

Actually not quite, but they really are huge and so aggressive. And wherever I am, those boogers make a B-line for my port. They are like vampires, and I know they can smell me coming. Since I had port infections twice over the last two summers, once requiring hospitalization, and each time right after returning from Chincoteague, it is my theory that these vampire bugs infect me with other people's germs, since they imbibe over and over from host to host (ewwwwww!). Today I returned from the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and there they are: four huge mosquito bites all too close to my port. And this time I kept it covered with gauze and tape. I sprayed (sorta, certainly not too near the port) but used a spray that didn't have the poisonous DEET ingredient. So I'm trying to figure out how to ward off these monsters. Just go ahead and saturate myself with poison? Skin-So-Soft? (Remember that?) Turtlenecks? Waddya think, girls? Grateful for anyinteresting ideas.

In brief, since mid June I have been on a combo of herceptin/perjeta/navelbine.  I have had sometimes terrible/sometimes managable/ongoing/all over the place and finally escalating abdominal & stomach pain, which culminated in a very long visit to the ER a couple of days ago.  After testing for everything in the book, we learned a) that my lung mets are reduced by 1/3 to 1/2 (!!!) b) that the whole rest of my body, including abdomen, colon, liver and etc are completely clean (again, !!!) c) that I don't have C-diff or any other kind of infection So what is causing this awful pain?  The prevailing theory is that I am having a very rare pain reaction to the navelbine.  Nobody seems to have heard of this happening before, but it is an unlikely but documented SE.  The only temporary solution has been acupuncture (works for a day or two) and for me to take oxycodone throughout the day, which I am doing.  The question:  We have a pow-wow set up with trusted oncologist for Friday to explore strategies.  Oncologist's first suggestion is to reduce the chemo (please, nooooooooo).  We also have thought about a GI consult, a visit to a pain management clinic, medical marijuana.  Anybody else have a good idea?  I am so happy about the scans, but this SE is unrelenting.  PS:  my bone mets sisters - I have a new understanding of the daily pain that you suffer.  I humbly salute you and send my love.    Thanks folks - SUE Dx 12/2010, IDC, Stage IV, 26/35 nodes, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

I too am HER2+ and have been from the start. Over the last several years HER2+ breast cancers have received huge amounts of attention and research time and money. Consequently there are great drugs which have been developed especially for us and that work very well. You will likely receive herceptin and might also be given perjeta. Both of these are \"targeted therapies \" which basically means that they attack the cancer cells and for the most part leave your healthy cells alone, meaning minimal side effects (!). There will be a lot for you to learn about your new status, but take a breath - HER2 + doesn't mean what it used to. Good luck - SUE",

Just wanted to comment about the herceptin fail you described. Most of we Hersies have been on herceptin for long periods of time, thru progressions and past them. I am no doctor, but my understanding is that combos that include herceptin are greater than the sum of their parts. For instance: when herceptin is given with taxol and perjeta, the three boost each other's effectiveness (1+1+1 = 5). I'm sure that your doctor can describe this better than I, but you might want to ask him/her. Good luck Macy - better living thru science. SUE",

They became particularly bad last month, and in desperation I tried a solution that I read about in a newspaper column in our local called \"The People's Pharmacy\".  Folks had written in over the years to claim that putting a bar of soap in their bed stopped leg cramps -HUH?  I assumed that if by chance this weird solution did work, it was for people with restless leg syndrome or etc.  However I put a bar of Dove soap under the bottom sheet of our bed between the mattress and the sheet,  and ladies I kid you not:  I have not had a single cramp in my legs since.  I have waited for two weeks to see if anything changes, but nope, my leg thing seems to be fixed.

Ophthalmologist told me to get into his office pronto - worried about a retinal tear.  After four hours there, the greatest little Doogie Houser of a doctor told me the following:  \"Brain mets?  Off the table.  Retinal tear?  Off the table.  Sinus infection?  No connection.  However, you do have a little bit of age on you, hon\".  Yup, my girlfriend nailed it - flashers like mine are caused by the vitreous fluid of the eye thinning and pulling just a bit on the eye.  No fix, just gotta live with it.  So after torturing myself and everyone around me for 3 weeks, after being completely insane for 3 weeks,  the answer is:  I'm old.   I really, really wish I knew how to not be a crazy person when this kind of thing happens.  I hate cancer.  SUE Dx 12/2010, IDC, Stage IV, 26/35 nodes, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
