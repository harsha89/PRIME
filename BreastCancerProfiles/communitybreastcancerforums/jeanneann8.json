My oncologist is concerned regarding a 5mm spiculated density.She did find it on the u/s in her office. Wasn't seen on previous.  Waiting another week...I am still extremely nauseated but doing better. She stated that they have a 24 hour turnaround time for the results and scheduled an office visit for the 25th. They also took my cell number and told me if the results are in sooner that they will call as well. The Imaging Center said that the 24th was the soonest because my oncologist prefers specific radiologists to do the procedure only. I am so ok with that. The mammotome is a larger bx and gets a lot of tissue to sample so that they can distinguish more pathology from it. It also allows for a quicker return on the results!!! I am still such a wreck...typically I handle things better. I know I will truley feel better once I know what I am dealing with. I know my oncologist was concerned by the looks of things. She is well respected in the area. I just have that feeling.........just knowing will be good. I did have a fine needle bx about 15 years ago to aspirate a cyst. It was completely gone after and nothing showed up on mammograms after that. I don't think that scarring can appear from that 15 years later!!!!!  Anyway ........here waiting and waiting and waiting Jeannie Dx 9/25/2009, IDC, <1cm, Stage IB, Grade 1, 0/2 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I don't think I fear that it is cancer...  I just don't have the feeling of control and it's so hard focus. You would think that working would help, but it is just difficult to focus on anything else! Right now I am not feeling very productive. Thank you..so much!!! Jeannie",

I had my lumpectomy on October 7th and still have bruising. I had a core bx in the end of Sept and was bruised with that alone. Both may create swelling and discomfort. After my lumpectomy I had several seromas which is actually (I think) blood that forms very hard lumps. I am still sore. Some say that they could go back to work with no problems and others have more discomfort. I am heavy breasted and that alone may cause more discomfort...I am not sure but it feels like it pulls sometimes due to the heaviness. I think that gravity is not on our side. I would rest if you can..but after an excisional I would expect discomfort, and the bruising is from them removing the problem and tissue surrounding the area. I would think that to be normal. Good luck with everything. You didn't mention size or anything else. Please let me know how you are doing. Take care..hope this brought some comfort. Jeannie",

This was my 55th birthday present. I am so amazed at the different types of breast cancer and just how many people don't \"get it\"!! My personell director at work had told me that she has alot in her immediate family but when I spoke to her recently she made some very off comments!! It was regarding me being stage 1 and insisted that I was wrong and that it wasn't invasive!!! I thought \"oh well\"...glad I took the time off for rads!! My oncotype came back at 12..so that is good! No chemo. 33 rounds of rads. I am stage 1 as well. Just had 3 tattoos on last Wednesday and have another appointment this Wednesday and I will get my rads schedule.  So sorry that you are having your second lumpectomy..let me know how that goes.",

      "Content": "jeanneann8 wrote: Hi again..so I have been sitting here somewhat stressed. I had my appt. with the specialist today and she did a complete exam. On my original mammogram they found a 5mm spiculated nodule that was irregular. It did not show up on a sonogram that was given after the second mammogram. My PCP sent me to the Onc/Sur. The Onc did her own sonogrm in the office and was able to locate the nodule although it was dim. The thing is....that when she pushed on the area I experienced a sharp pain and soreness for the first time.. She apologized and she did not comment on what that meant or if it was significant. She did tell me that the spiculation. \"little fingers\" was an indicator and of concern. I heard that breast cancer does not hurt when it is small. I am left wondering what her impression was. I am having a mammotone cone bx next. I am pretty scared!! Any info or comments are welcomed ......I love this specialist and she is very gentle and compassionate. I think I was so stressed that I forgot to ask additional questions. Now I am waiting for the imaging center to call with the bx time and date. More waiting!!!

She told me to call back anytime to check but she assured me that she will call as soon as she receives it. She understood my anxiousness and I felt better just having her be understanding. My Oncologist said that she schedules an appointment for the day after the bx to go over results.  She is well known in this area so I guess they are on it!! That ws a relief as well. I have lost 4 lbs..but am still going to work and I feelsick to my stomach. I think I am handling it ok. I plan on taking some time off regardless of the results. I, myself, am a social worker..si I am feeling drained. Thanks so much!!!!! .",
