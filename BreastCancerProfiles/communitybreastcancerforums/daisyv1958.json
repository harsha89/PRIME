I also have a strong history of breast cancer in my family, but I was not diagnosed until I was 44.  My mom was diagnosed when she was 54.  I have read a study that suggests the children should start testing 10-15 yrs younger than the mother was diagnosed.  That makes sense in my case, but I have 3 sisters who have been diagnosed at varous times with non-cancerous cysts and tumers.  I am the only who has had cancer. A lump does not always mean cancer, even if you have a family history.  You are in my prayers!!  Please let us know what happens.!!",

Anyone else out there with similar experience? Log in to post a reply",
