I have a scar from a boil at the starting point of this pain. Not sure if it has anything to do with the pains.  Also, 12 yrs ago, i had a large abscess removed from my right breast and they had to remove most of my milk ducts/glands. I have a cousin, and an uncle, both on my mothers side, who have had breast cancer. My uncle had the test done to see if its genetic and it is not. not sure if i should wait it out and see if the pain goes away or to talk to my doctor.  Thanks for your time and any and all responses.  God Bless Log in to post a reply",
