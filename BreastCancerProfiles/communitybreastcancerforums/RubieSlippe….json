Some pathologists think that the biopsy specimen is stage 0 (DCIS) others think that it's a stage 1. The doctor at Vanderbilt Tn. tells me that there is no way to tell until it is removed. Two different surgeons tell me that I need a MX. I wish the biopsy could be more reliable. The tumor has grown so fast that it leans more toward invasive on assessment. It was 1inch when biopsied.",
