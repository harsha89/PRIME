It hasn't gone away after my baby's delivery 2 weeks ago, so yesterday I went to ER room for it. They suspected pulmonary embolism but CT didn't find anything. Heart/heart sac is normal, left lung seems ok. But in addition, they found that my heart rate at rest is at 67, but when standing up, it quickly turned into 100. lying down the heart rate went back to 67 again. And I'm not dehydrated. Now it's officially a medical mystery. I'm due for A/C dose 3 tomorrow, but I'm not sure whether I should keep it, due to this weird heart/lung condition. Urgently need advice on this. My onco is out on thanksgiving vacation, I'll need to talk to onduty nurse practitioner about this. Another thing, they found a 4mm nodule in the lower apical peripheral of right lung. They didn't say much, but told me to ask onco to restage me and said it's unlikely to be infection though anybody can have small nodules (etc...). I got the CD, but i haven't had the courage to look.

But my primary doc told me to go have biopsy.   I kept twiddling thumbs.  fast forward 3 months, the mass has grown to 3cm.  my primary doc strongly suggested me to go see the breast surgeon. I can't quite figure out what he is worried about, is it because the size doubled/tripled in 3 months?  is this typical growth rate for fibroadenoma or phyllodes?  is he worried about the latter, or something else entirely? So, i  followed my primary doc's advice and went in to see a breast surgeon. he gave me too options, core needle biopsy and excisional biopsy (w/o margin removed).   Either way, if the pathology results are bad, i'll have to do another lumpectomy.   So i asked, can i do a lumpectomy, so biopsy can be more complete and include the surrounding tissue?    The surgeon said no.   he just gave me the two choices. With either kind of biopsy, surgery, earliest date is 12 days away.  I'm a little frustrated, if the primary doc seems so urgent about biopsy, then why does the surgeon seems not in hurry at all?   I kind of prefer to avoid 2 surgeries (excisional biopsy+lumpectomy or core needle biopsy+lumpectomy) as much as possible in the worst case scenario, yet, the surgeon seems very adamant about not cutting the margin off the tumor.  why?  i thought maybe he wasn't sure about how much to cut, and i suggested i want to do MRI, again the answer is no.   MRI is supposed to be able to see phyllodes very well. so maybe they are not worried about phyllodes at all, but some other scenario.    Fundamentally, i can't figure out what they are thinking.   Anyhow, any suggestions?  I'm so glad i found about this forum! more details in my blog killerboob.blogspot.com Log in to post a reply",

I also found this article: emedicine.medscape.com/article...  It seems to emphasize that margin and method of excision as important factors in preventing recurrence of phyllodes.   Also, makes me tend toward asking for wide margin excision to start with.  Phyllodes is notoriously difficult to diagnose from core biopsy anyway.   ",

My understanding is:  mets is a casino game.   the total number of breast cells you have (original breast cells + tumor cells + mets cells) is the total chips that cancer owns.    Since it sounds like you have some inherited condition that makes your \"original breast cells\" more likely to turn into tumor cells, you might want the the original breast cells out. That said,  major surgery is said by some to stimulate cancer cells into growth.   So, you need to find a good time (stability is great!  immunity is good) to do the surgery.     I don't have as much experience as others, recently diagnosed myself.   Sending hugs and positive thoughts your way",
