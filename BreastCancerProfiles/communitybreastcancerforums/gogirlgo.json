Last year I heard a tape on the way lymphedema was treated in Russia, they used selenium with great results. (Brazil nuts have selenium in them) My naturopath advised me to start with two brazil nuts a day for the first week and then 1 a day for ever afterwards. I have had a masectomy with 13 lymph nodes removed but have been lucky enough not to have lymphedema. But....my girlfriend does have it badly. She is a driving instructor and by the end of the day, as she is sitting most of the day, her arm, swells even more and hurts. (She has a therapist massage it often) well I told her about the brazil nuts, she started taking them. Well the other day I saw her and she said she has been taking them and her arm is a whole lot better! I didn't post this until I personally knew that it had worked. Good luck ladies Kind regards Kim Log in to post a reply",
