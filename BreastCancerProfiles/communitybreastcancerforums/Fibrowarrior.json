    "Content": "Fibrowarrior wrote: I went for regular mammogram which showed a change from last mammogram as a small heterogeneous microcalicifications present within the posterior third of the left breast. I went back and 5 more microfided and enhanced digital mammograms showed the same thing. Bi-RADS- category 4. Suspicious adnormality. Biopsy should be considered. Biopsy was not able to be obtained due to dense breast tissue and the radiologist said the he would not even try at this point and to wait about 3 months and go back to the Dr. No one called or anything, I had to call and they said that if they couldn't find anything that there was probably nothing to worry about and I felt promptly dismissed without any regard's to what I had been through. has anyone else ever had this experience before???? so now I am waiting for someone to decided that I am worth followup.
