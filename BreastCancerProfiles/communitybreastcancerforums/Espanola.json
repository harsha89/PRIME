I saw a picture where someone had something in their mouth, like a scuba like mouth piece. I hope not. I'm also very bothered by the tattoos they forced me into after the RO said I didn't need them. They just kept saying they will be small you won't even really see them. That's not the point, I know they are there. :(",

I've always had stretch marks (since giving birth 17 yes ago) but they have been barely noticeable. A little history, since I finished rads, I have been going to PT for swelling and stretching. It has helped with my range of motion quite a bit. I do still have pain on my left side when I lay on that side but I've been told it's due to scar tissue.
