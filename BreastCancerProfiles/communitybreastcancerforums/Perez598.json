I worked all through chemo and only took time off the day of chemo and the next day. I had treatment every other week due to TNBC status. I am now in the middle of 33 radiation treatments. I found out staging after surgery and 10 days after surgery, while my mom was at my house taking care of me, she passed away suddenly of a stroke. I thought there is no way I am going to get through all of this without her but I am doing it. One day at a time. You can do this! It is all doable if you just get through each phase.",
