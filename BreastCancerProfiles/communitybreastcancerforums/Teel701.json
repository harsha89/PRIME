I'll blame it on my blonde hair! ;) TexasRose - I have only spoken to the nurses at my PS office and they don't seem too concerned about my claim of fluid build up. They told me to just put on a support bra for compression that should help my body absorb it.  They don't believe in apirating it unless it's by the fill up port.  Who knows.  I go in for my second fill on Friday, so I will bring it up again and see what they say. Rachelvk - I feel the same way you do...\"are we there yet\". Although I'm only 3.5 weeks out of surgery, I just want my life back. I'm not one to sit and relax. I\"m always moving. You'll be fine alone...it'll make you push yourself a bit more and stretch those muscles.  I thought when my husband went back to work this week I wouldn't survive, but all is fine and I just move slowly.  I also understand your tightness, but you know what, if the Terminator wanted a feel, I think I wouldn't mind it. ;) Kellyod - advil has been my friend as well.  I'm also thinking that my TE's are moving, which is a bit scary. I keep thinking one of them is going to pop out from under the muscle.  Just wish I had a picture of what everything looks like inside.  MargieC - I actually slept in a support bra last night and what a difference when sitting up. I too didn't have so much discomfort. I think I'll be keeping it on from now on!  Everyone - prayers and smiley faces go out to all of you. Stay strong and try to do things that make you happy.  In time, we should all be able to move on with out lives. :)",

I have been reading these boards for over a month prior to my bmx that I had 10/13, looking for what to expect and hoping it would be an easy thing. Ha, what was I thinking? I'm reaching out today to find out how to deal with expander pain, seroma, and pectoral tightness. I was hoping by week 3 things would be considerably better, but that is not the case. My bs is not concerned with seroma, but it makes the expansion process more painful. I have another 3-4 months before implant exchange...that's a long time to work through this pain. Your suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance! :)",

Yes, I realize that everyone has a different recovery schedule, but I guess I've been living in lala land hoping mine would be quick and easy. :-p I'm definitely someone who can't sit still and it's hard for me to relax and get better. Hmmm, maybe this is all a learning experience for me. I had my first fill last Wednesday. Uneventful and thought it went well. Only 30cc since I wanted to start slowly. I'm small on top and therefore the bs agreed to do small fills. I believe the original fill was 160cc each side. Each day though I'm finding that I am filling up with fluid and becoming more uncomfortable. Of course a call to the doc tomorrow is necessary. Good luck at your first fill and speedy recovery to you!",
