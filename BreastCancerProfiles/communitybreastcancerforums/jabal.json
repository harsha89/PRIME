Had to stop that and symptoms are horrible.  My good breast hurts and the armpit also.  My back hurts and just pain about everywhere.  No pain anywhere until I stopped the HRT's.  The second I found out I had cancer I took the patch off cold turkey.  I can't find any info on these symptoms from stopping therapy but can't imagine what else it could be. The doctor said because the cancer was so small they could not get enough tissue to give me many details other than what you mentioned.  I have the lumpectomy Tuesday and he will do the node you mentioned.  He was optimistic and said probably radiation and meds.  I know nothing about radiation, but it doesnt sound good.  I talked to an 86 yr old woman today who had lumpectomy 20 years ago and they wanted her to do radiation and she said no.  She has had no reoccurance of cancer.  There are so many variables.  I guess  I will just wait until after surgery.  Yes, I get out the same day and go home.  You know the mind is a crazy thing.  I went in feeling fit as a fiddle to get a routine mammo and now after this every inch of my body hurts in one way or the other.  The only place not bothering me is the breast that is bad.  I did get some anxiety meds because I was off the charts with worry and although I have never had anxiety attacks felt them coming on...a feeling of doom and death.  They help.  I will let you know how surgery goes and thanks again for responding...oh geeeezzzz another hot flash   grrrrrrrrrrrrrr   Any insight into above symptoms after quiting HRT let me know",

Also,  I just thought of something.....would they know if I got breast cancer from the node or the other way round.  I would think that would make a lot of difference and they would have told me if that were the case? Also has anyone had a test called onco type dx?  I hear it is something we should have?  Also, is it normal to put all this off as they tell me until I heal from my lumpectomy?  I hate to wait a month for any treatment.  I want to get rid of this now.  I am so confused about chemo vs a pill...any insight or thoughts any of you have I would appreciate.  I trust the women in this forum more than doctors at this point.  Hugs to all of you for being there Dx 12/11/2012, IDC, <1cm, Stage IIA, Grade 1, 1/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Your stats are almost exactly like mine.  Can you tell me what kind of treatment you did? What supplements are you taking?  I know I can beat this damn thing.  I saw my surgeon today for followup on surgery and he said i need chemo because the one node was positive and he can't say it has not spread to my blood.  I just have to believe an oynco test would not make a difference.  Anyway, anything you can share about your last year would be appreciated. Thanks ladies",

I know it will take a few weeks but I am not starting any treatment until I get the results.  I will see what he says Monday.  Thanks to all of you for your advice and comments.  Thank God we have each other!",

Also,  I just thought of something.....would they know if I got breast cancer from the node or the other way round.  I would think that would make a lot of difference and they would have told me if that were the case? Also has anyone had a test called onco type dx?  I hear it is something we should have?  Also, is it normal to put all this off as they tell me until I heal from my lumpectomy?  I hate to wait a month for any treatment.  I want to get rid of this now.  I am so confused about chemo vs a pill...any insight or thoughts any of you have I would appreciate.  I trust the women in this forum more than doctors at this point.  Hugs to all of you for being there Dx 12/11/2012, IDC, <1cm, Stage IIA, Grade 1, 1/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
