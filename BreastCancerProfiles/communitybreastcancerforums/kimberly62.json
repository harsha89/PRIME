I haven't had any side effects that I can tell, and this drug has the bonus of being bone strengthening. I had a bone scan last year and had osteopenia, so having something to help strengthen my bones was a plus for me. Good luck with your decisions, it is all so very confusing at times. This is the 3rd one I have tried, so far, so good!",

I was previously on Tamoxifen, then my Doctor switched me to Exemestane after menopause which caused all sorts of side effects. I have been pleasantly surprised with Evista, and it's not hard on your bones like aromatase inhibitors are.",
