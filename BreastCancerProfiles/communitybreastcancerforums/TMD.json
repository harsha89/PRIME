I am drinking lots of water in hopes that this will help me.  I have put benefiber in my coffee for the last serveral days.  I eat my lunch during chemo--PBJ, some dried prunes and apricots--came home and had a bowl of oatmeal.  My DH came with me but had to leave before I finished so my sister-in-law and friend came to visit and drive me home.  The nurses were great and explained thngs to be.  I will be administering my wn Neulasta shot--Is anyone else doing this?  It will save time.  I think I can do it!  Wish me well.  Talk to you soon.",
