Core biopsy found a mucinous matter in cyst. they can not rule out the possibility of Mucinous  Carcinoma with out doing a surgical biopsy. I did ask the dr. if I could just be mucinous matter that if left alone would not turn into Carcinoma and he said he could not tell me that. The only way to rule out breast Cancer is to have the surgical Biopsy. Were they albe to rule out Carcinoma with your core biopsy.  I will be happy to update you with any information from my surgical biopsy.",

So I talked to my radiologist again and she confirmed it was best  not to wait. I find this most frustrating the doctors do not seem to agree on what is the best approach so how are we suppose to know. Any way had the lumpectomy last week get results in the morning.",

I was then was called back end of Dec. for a second mammogram, they then decided to also do a ultra sound after the second mammogram, There was a lump in my right breast that had not been on previous mammograms..  I was then scheduled for a core biopsy the results came back from the core biopsy with mucinous cyst, due to a type of rare breast cancer mucinous carcinoma they sent me to the breast surgeon for a lumpectomy and now I wait for what I hope to be B9 results, my follow up with the surgeon is this Tuesday.  I will be sending you good thoughts for your surgery. Please let us know how you are.",
