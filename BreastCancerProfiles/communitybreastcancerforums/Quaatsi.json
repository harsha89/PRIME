I had my first treatment of Kadcyla 2 weeks ago. 10 days of high to medium high fevers and then, blood work came back--my liver function declined. Going in for more specific labs but I think I have already \"failed\" on this drug. I am hoping there is something else?????? I have done Tykerb and Navelbine while in stage 4. feeling a bit down about it. Q",
