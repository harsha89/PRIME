I have lost three fingernails and one toenail, also quite amusing.  The good news is that the rest of my nails no longer feel like they are going to come off if I touch them.  I feel as if I am regaining strength each day.  I actually went for a very short walk with my husband and the dogs yesterday.  Aslo my taste buds are starting to come back, yahoo! The main reason I have gotten through this is because of the support of my family and friends.  My sister-in-law, whom I am close too, has gone to every doctors appointment, test and treatment I have had.  She is my go to person and was the second person I told after I was diagnosed.  One of the other reasons I have gotten through this is a sense of humor, well at least most of the time. I have not read all the threads yet but plan on starting from beginning and working my way through.  I know we all have stories to tell and I truly wish I could have been a part of all of your journeys from the beginning.   My next phase is radiation.  I have been told that is the normal protocol but I am not yet convinced that I will go that route.  A lot will depend on what my doctor has to say next week.  Well thanks all for listening and best of luck to you all.",
