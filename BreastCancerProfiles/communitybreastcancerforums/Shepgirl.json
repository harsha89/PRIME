Sorry for not posting more Sept - Jan 10th are my busy times!  The start of school, holidays and two Birthdays is about all I can take!  Luckly the kids take a break from Baseball. This year I get the Xeloda reaction issue too!!!!!  Can't wait until Feb - May! which is a quiter time for me.... school work and Karate is about all I can take these days! ",

In general.... good news.  The BC is stable.... and liver and blood values are looking better.  THe liver has 10 lesions but all have not increased in size, so they believe the Carbo/Gemzar could be \"kicking in\".  My platelets are back to 141,000. Red blood cells are low HCT=29, so I got a red cell booster. Hope they hold for the day 8 Gemzar (Nov 26)  treatment!  I started my third cycle of Carbo/Genzar yesterday.   I will have a 2 day treatment of rads starting today on that right arm hot spot...even through it activity level had deceased.  They want to make sure it does not fracture and everything was planned to \"shoot\" it!  So the plan is to contine Carbo/Genzar for a few more cycles than RESCAN!  Have not got my 27.29 marker back yet but hopfully they went down!  Hoping the liver lesions shrink to do RFA!  And of course keep an eye on the brain lesions.. I believe that MRI in Dec!  but so far the are gone!!!! So happy with some good news for the Holidays.  We are heading to my mom's house.   Still bummed I could not get to the MBCN conference in Houston. Can t wait to hear the results! Bad timing BUT I will be there next year! Happy Holidays everyone.",

I filled out the form and they called the next day! Not sure not going there ,at least once, is an option.  Honestly, I would send just the written stuff.  If you can summarize your case, referencing each report.  In general, Sloan does not review digital scans from others. Sometimes you can have them put \"into\" their system; but they usually do not  re-interput other's images. They just review the written report and use that for input.  You might want to consider having scans there so you can get the complete picture of whats going on. Any scans I've had there were read immediately and that really helps.  My Neuro guy reviews them on the screen with me.  There are many great Oncs;  I have Dr. Modi (breast cancer onc) and Dr Nolan (neuro guy).  I know many ladies who have used others and are pleased. Hotels are not the cheapest in NYC :but we stay at the Bentley in Mahatten. If you say you have a appointment(s) with Sloan- their rate is usually $99. Not the most modern hotels; but the rooms are clean and comfortable. There is quite a view from their dining room at the top of the building.  It is also right between the offices ( the place covers several blocks!). Plan on taking Taxis, it cheaper and less stressful then paying for parking and driving! My Sloan Onc are my leaders in most areas. If my disease progresses, I head to Sloan (which is 7 hours from me by car- we usually fly).  My Oncs up here are more than willing to consult and \"so far\" have come to a common treatment plan.  So far, I have been able to be treated locally.  Good Luck. BTW- I've been told the big cancer centers that are located within reasonable distances (same region) tend to share the same ideas.   If you truly want to separate (independent) opinion you have to visit two that are in different regions.    I know in my case, if I don't find the answer at Sloan - I will go to Anderson or another mid-west center.  You absolutely have the right to refuse treatment direction for any Onc.  However, it is usually better to see how approachable you local Onc is to working with others.   If they are not or seem \"frighten\" - get another Onc who is willing.  Most Oncs welcome the chance to consult with the big centers.",

Recently it was found that the disorder of DPD deficiency is more frequent than initially thought (Diasio and Lu, 1994, J. Clin. Oncol., 12, 2239-2242). It is thus important to identify patients with DPD deficiency. \" My Liver LDH level (marker that measures the amount of Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase (DPD) in your body was 4X higher in my blood work today!!!!    Remember this DPD is required to break down the Xeloda.    The DPD DNA test said I did not have a deficiency in DPD.........  it looks like I have TOO much.   Or maybe my reaction just trigger my liver to produce more DPD???? One article states: \"The presence of 5-FU can impact on DPD activity\" Even way will be discussing this with the Oncs on Monday!  If you are deficient in DPD , 5 - FU derivatives (like Xeloda) can be fatal.  I found one documented case of death due to 5-FU toxicity!  I read one article that estimated around 8% of us have DPD deficiency.  Now that scary!  If you have not done Xeloda yet- I would ask to be tested before you start. Here the link of the company that did my testing- http://www.mdl-labs.com/testing/DPDEnzymeDeficiencyDihydropyrimidineDehydrogenase.html",

I have found very inclusive info on the dosing of this drug! --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Lower dose capecitabine has a more favorable therapeutic index in metastatic breast cancer: retrospective analysis of patients treated at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and a review of capecitabine toxicity in the literature 1 Department of Breast Medical Oncology and 2 Division of Pharmacy, The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA * Correspondence to: Dr B. Hennessy, Faculty of Breast Medical Oncology, The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, TX 77 030, USA. Tel: +1-713-792-2740; Fax: +1-713-792-3708; Email: bhennessy{at}mdanderson.org Background: Capecitabine is active against anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated metastatic breast cancer. Post-marketing use of capecitabine at the FDA-approved dose (2500 mg/m2/day) leads to unacceptable toxicity in many patients. Dose reductions anecdotally improve tolerability without compromising efficacy. This retrospective analysis was designed to verify these anecdotal reports. Patients and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 141 consecutive patients with metastatic breast cancer identified from pharmacy records as receiving capecitabine outside of a clinical trial between May 1998 and February 1999. Responses were defined as clinical improvement (ID), stabilization of disease (SD) for 6 weeks or longer, or progression (PD). Patients were grouped according to the starting dose level of capecitabine: A=2500±5% (dose range 2385-2560) mg/m2/day; B=2250±5% (range 2130-2350) mg/m2/day; C 2000+5% (range 1000-2100) mg/m2/day. We also reviewed the safety profile of capecitabine at these doses and performed a safety review of capecitabine in phase II and III metastatic breast and colorectal cancer trials. Results: Clinical data were available for 113 patients (105 for response, 106 for toxicity). The median age was 52.5 years and the mean number of prior metastatic chemotherapy regimens was 2 (range 0-7). The mean capecitabine starting dose was 2220 mg/m2/day and the median number of cycles administered was 4 (range 1-19). The mean tolerated dose was 2040 mg/m2/day (range 960-2670). Grade 3/4 toxic effects at dose levels A, B and C, respectively, included palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (33%, 63%, 20%), diarrhea (13%, 12%, 3%), stomatitis (8%, 0%, 3%), and nausea/vomiting (4%, 6%, 5%). Forty per cent of all patients required capecitabine dose reductions; fewer patients treated with 2000 mg/m2/day required dose modification (28%). Five per cent of the patients required discontinuation of capecitabine owing to toxicity. Patients started at the lowest doses of capecitabine did not have poorer response rates or shorter time to progression. Conclusions: This retrospective analysis supports a starting dose of 2000 mg/m2/day because of its superior therapeutic index; however, patients may still have toxic effects and individualization of dosing is necessary. A phase III, multicenter, randomized study to establish the safety and efficacy of different doses of capecitabine is urgently needed.",

Previous research has shown that tumors can develop resistance to radiation by increasing vessel formation through hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1)-regulated cytokines. In the current study, Dr. Claire Magnon, from Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, and colleagues show that combining radioiodide therapy with angiogenic inhibitors, like canstatin, can overcome HIF-1-dependent tumor survival pathways and enhance tumor cell apoptosis in vitro and in a murine mammary tumor model. The results indicate that angiogenesis inhibitors can play a key role in shifting radiation-induced HIF-1 activity from promoting radioresistance to causing apoptosis, the authors state. \"This study provides a basis for developing new biology-based clinically relevant strategies to improve the efficacy of radiation oncology, using HIF-1 as an ally for cancer therapy,\" Dr. Magnon's team concludes.

However, some factors put patients at higher risk. Women who are under 50 years of age, who have Her2-positive tumors, estrogen receptor-negative tumors, and lung or liver metastases are somewhat more likely to be diagnosed with brain metastases. Studies indicate that mutations in the BRCA1 gene are also a risk factor. Women who have Her2 metastatic disease have a risk of brain metastases ranging from 25-40%.",

All NSAIDs, including CELEBREX, help relieve arthritis pain, but only you and your doctor can decide which one is right for you. An NSAID like CELEBREX might be an arthritis treatment option. It helps controls inflammation (which they say is  required for Cancer cells to grow). Aspirin is a COX1 inhibitor.  Tumeric is a natural COX2 inhibitor too! Many Oncs also think Celebrex has anti-cancer properties.... but some Cox2 inhibitors have been linked to heart issues so they pulled alot of the clinical studies.  The \"jury \" still out on both the anti-cancer and heart issues.  Funny that they prescribe Celebrex for prostate cancer as a preventative for men with beign polops (sp)!!!  The info sheet even tells you it can help prevent prostate cancer.  Again, its not the last we hear about Celebrex.",

      "Content": "Shepgirl wrote: This is really important for us METS ladies, for if down right it should take some of the \"guessing\" game for our treatment. Today many of the Insurance Companies do not cover: however If Medicare will cover they usually follow suit! Chemosensitivity (Resistance) Testing - Coding and Billing  The following guidance is based on articles published in September and November of 2000. As stated in the LCD, assays are NOT covered simply because they are asserted to be a type of \"chemosensitivity assay.\" Assay types and supporting data are considered individually. EXTREME CHEMOTHERAPY RESISTANCE (ECR) ASSAY Extreme Chemotherapy Resistance (ECR) assays (also referred to as extreme drug resistance assays) involve the exposure of human tumor cells in tissue culture to tumor type-specific antineoplastic agents. After the first three days of drug exposure, tritiated thymidine is incorporated into the tumor cells to determine the cytotoxic effects of the drug(s) used. Chemotherapy drug-resistant cells will grow more than drug-sensitive cells, and therefore, will take up more radiolabelled thymidine. The radioactivity within the cells is determined by using a liquid scintillation counter. In this test, a positive resistance to a specific drug should prevent the selection of \"ineffective\" drugs for the human tumor cells in the individual patient. Following the 1999 MCAC meeting, NHIC, Corp. allowed reimbursement for testing in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Effective July 1, 2000, coverage was extended to solid tumors such as ovarian, breast, lung, and colon. Testing must be necessary for the individual patient. ECR involves harvesting fresh tissue from surgical specimen, transporting the tissue to a laboratory, microscopic review of the surgical pathology specimen, disassociation of the tumor cells, special staining of the cells and plating into a tissue culture medium, exposing the cells to antineoplastic agents, determining toxic activity, and morphometric analysis of the cells in culture. Tests should be billed with CPT services 88305, 88104, 89050, 88313, 87230, 88358 as appropriate. CPT code 87230 should be billed per drug tested and CPT code 88358 per seven drugs tested. NHIC generally would expect testing of no more than seven chemotherapy drugs on a single tumor specimen. Bills should not be submitted for incomplete testing on inadequate specimens. This is a general principle in laboratory medicine. ATP/MTT/STAINING BASED TESTS A slightly different form of tumor cell resistance assay consists of exposing tumor cells to antineoplastic agents and performing at least one or more of the following three cell death endpoint tests to determine tumor cell survival: 1) Differential cell staining and microscopic counting; 2) microplating and use of coloring reagent MTT (Dimethyl thiazol-diphenyltetrzolium thiazolyl blue); and 3) measuring ATP content. This test will be covered for the same tumors as extreme chemotherapy resistance: chronic lymphocytic leukemia and solid tumors including ovarian, breast, lung, and colon; other tumors may be covered based on evidence and clinical circumstances. To bill for this type of chemotherapy resistance use the miscellaneous immunology CPT code 86849 and include the words \"cell culture tumor resistance\" in the comment field of the claim form.
