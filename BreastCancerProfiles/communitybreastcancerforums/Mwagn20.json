And then Friday I decided to investigate the pain I had in my breast on that side too and found a pea sized lump that shifted. I'm very worried. My mom had several lumpectomies at my age for stage 0, her mom passed away at 50 from complications of diabetes but had breast cancer when she passed and my paternal grandpa and his brother both had aggressive breast cancer along with prostrate cancer, in their 40s. My mom said hers too also moved like mine and was painful in the same spot. They then went on to find more lumps you couldn't feel in her. So I have a family history which freaks me out even more. I just feel like my my gyn will blow me off because I'm 34 Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Mwagn20 wrote: I finally had my mammogram after finding a lump and month ago due to pain. They said I have 5 nodules-- 2 in my left and 3 in my right, which the doctor believed to be either a cysts or tumors. They said they want to wait 6mo to see how they grow but felt they are suspicious. I'm not sure i feel comfortable with this, am I wrong to think with my family history and a genetic link, that I should see another doctor??? The doctor even said my family history is terrible. I don't understand the wait and see approach when my mom had breast cancer, stage 0, at my age that was found the same way--with pain and then a mammogram. I'm only 33. Does anyone have a suggestion as to the next step, should I push for a biopsy or a second opinion, or both?? Log in to post a reply",

When I got home tonight and checked my voicemail, it was my gyn. I'm worried because she called on a day they are closed. I was told it's important I need to call when they open at 8am Monday and come in to see her as soon as possible to discuss my results. I'm not feeling good about this.",
