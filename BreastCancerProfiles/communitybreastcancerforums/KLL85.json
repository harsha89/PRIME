    "Content": "KLL85 wrote: Hi there, About six weeks ago I found a very small lump on the right side of my breast about two inches from my nipple. I went to the doctors a couple of weeks later and she told me she wasn't concerned and to come back in a month just to get it checked again. Well I went back yesterday and she eamined me again and has now referred me to a breast clinic. She said she still doesn't think it's anything sinister but has referred me as an urgent appointment. Surely if she really didn't think it was anything serious she wouldn't have put it as an urgent appointment. I'm paranoid that she was just telling me she didn't think it was serious just to stop me worrying and cos she knew that would be what I wanted to hear. Anyway I now have to wait for an appointment to be sent through and I am terrified that I've got cancer. She said I should be seen within two weeks but I just want the appointment letter to hurry up and come through so I know how long I've got to wait. How long does this usually take? I'm trying not to let it affect my day to day life but I am struggling to stop worrying. Log in to post a reply",
