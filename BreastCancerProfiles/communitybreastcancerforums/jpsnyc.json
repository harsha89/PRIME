I developed neuropathy followng my AC/T tretments, which ended nine months ago.  The neuropathy is still with me, but I do feel a change in the works.  I have needles and pins in my toes, and I cannot wear \"regular\" shoes.  Here are somethings that help me: Medication:  don't be afraid to see a neuroogist to get some medication for the neuropathy.  My oncologist referred me to a neurologist who put me on gabapentin.  I was able to tolerate 600 mg/day, and I even tried Cymbolta for a while.  But now I want to come off the meds to see if the neropathy is subsiding.   take 1000/mg B 12/day (as per the neurologist and recommendtion as well from my onoclogist).  I tired the L-Glutamine, Alpha Liboic Acid.  I also tried acupnucture.  Did not work for me. Shoes:  UGGs (or any sheepskin-lined shoe) help immensely.  I can walk and stand.  The downside is that they don't offer much support, but at least the pins and needles are cushioned. Sketchers Memory Foam shoes.  These allow me to wear a \"regular\" shoe and walk!  Socks with individual toes.  These are saving me!  I can wear them and walk and walk and walk!!!!  Before discovering these, recommended by my physical theorapist, I had a hard time walking or getting any exercise.  Not cheap, but so worth the price.  Available on Amazon.  Look at Injinji lightweight. Trade Joe's Body Cream:  I massage this on my toes and feet when they are \"active\", and it calms them right down.  I hav eno idea why, but this is a must have. Hope this helps!",
