The radiologist was unable to insert the catheter, after 45 minutes of trying, he gave up. Said it would have been easier if I had children and breast fed. As I did not have children, the ducts were extremely small, so couldnt insert. Would have been much easier if they had agreed with my initial feeling that I should take an Ativan! So I agree that you should ask your doctor for something to ease the anxiety.",
