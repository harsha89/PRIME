So I started round 2 friday..ding ding...and they decreased my dose 20 % to see how it goes and i must say its better but i have only that horror to compare it to. I hope i get through this day. thanks for the vent. Holly",

I have read the chemo \"shopping list\" and got a bit overwhelmed so i got a few things and will hope i dont need all the stuff and will get it as i go. I can add it onto the back to school shopping i guess. I am 43 with and 8 year old and work in a restaurant.  So I was trying to pick the best day to start chemo this week as they told me i can't change it once i start.  I am hearing that the first 2 days are the good and the 3rd day is the worst so i will stick to Friday because my busy work time and family day is the weekend.   Thanks to all for the info and support.  ",

No ice maker here either, 2 trays i try to bag and stock up.  Is the ice for drinks??  Sorry to sound stupid, just wondering if it was for something else. Madsmommy, I didn't really get a choice of chemo day but i asked and would have to go with another doc or to a different location not too far. Its good to know that those were your concerns also with the days and S/E.  I guess once I start I will have a better idea and feel better about it. My port placement hasn't been scheduled yet so I will get the first treatment in my vein and go from there.  I hear how it isnt bad and I am sure it will be easier at least for me but it does gross me out a bit. I thought i would loose my hair 14 days in but the nurse told me it will be about 6 weeks.  Anyone?  Trying to wait for my hairdresser cousin to come with me for my wig when she is in town but they say you should go before you loose your hair. Glad your feeling good Michell!",
