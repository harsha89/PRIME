I am currently on Herceptin every 3 weeks and I take tamoxifen because I am 2% estrogen positive. I started a new job when I started treatment I can't believe I worked through it all but I did. I slept a lot on the weekends. and had the day off the day of treatments. and I did my treatments on a Wednesday so that my worse days would be the weekend. My scans last month showed NED. and I will have more in 3 months. and I hope they always show NED. I am sure you will get there too. good luck to you.",
