I've been looking to meet up with other women in LA area for support and compare notes etc. I'm happy to host at my house (hollywood area) or we can FaceTime or Skype if travel not possible. I'm stage 1, 0/2 lymph (ER/PR+, Her2-) with oncotype score 14 and had double mastectomy on 5/28/16 and just put in implants on tuesday 10/4 so surgery over (fingers crossed). Starting November 1, 2016 I will start taking Arimidex (purchasing directly from phrama for better prices) Aromatase Inhibitor which I've been researching like crazy and also best practices for diet etc to support my system. I'm 52 (post menopause) years old with 5th grade daughter and intend to live to see her through adulthood. ...luckily don't need radiation or chemo but i'm feeling frustrated with my Oncologist. My BC surgeon was Kristi Funk (who I loved but now she won't see me anymore), my PS is Dr. Tiffancy Grunwald (who has been my absolute favorite doctor out of them all) and my Oncologist is Dr. Philomena McAndrew (who everyone says is the best [whatever that means] but I've found her to be closed minded about answering questions and thinking outside of the pharmaceutical box)...I\"m going to see a few other Oncologists who may be a better fit for me. I really want to understand as much as I can because I feel like the factory system that is healthcare just throws us all in a set protocol regardless based on (mainly pharama -funded) studies without and gray areas of what might work for individual systems. I am also looking for a primary care and/or GYN who has had BC so they have a special insight into watching for blood results etc to catch anything funky going on. Also, my semi-distrust of 'the system' also stems from the fact that I found my lump and 2 doctors (internist and gyn) felt it and said probably nothing and sent me for yet another mammogram that did not show the lump (11 years of mammogram radiation on my dense breasts was a waste of radiation) and wasn't until I pushed back that they gave me a (no radiation) ultrasound and found the invasive cancer 1.2cm. Had we done it a year prior I could have been stage 0! Had I done nothing, I\"d still be here with cancer growing in my breast! Anyhow, the drugs Tamoxifen (not for me b/c family history of blood clots) and the AIs are heavy duty toxic drugs which have permanent side effects which of course i'm going to take and see how I do (starting 11/1 after final surgery recovery) but i'm not taking them lightly as they are a form of chemotherapy ....and yes those effects are better than having metastasized BC but bone loss is serious and then the (more chemotherapy) infusions to try and prevent bone loss can cause jaw bone necrosis (no cure) or cause your large femur bone to break in half from just walking. Again, these are less common side effects but they are real and I like to fully understand all the options and possibilities before making a decision. Sorry for the long post but hoping to find like minded women to stay in contact with (outside this forum) to compare notes, doctors, ideas, studies. BTW, if you've not checked out the really great website www.foodforbreastcancer.com, I highly suggest it. It's run by a fellow BC survivor who has been following studies and protocols for 8 years and has lots of great info on how we can make good choices every day in eating. Also the site www.nutritionfacts.org is another great (not for profit) site with unbiased nutritional info run by a doctor and team of researchers who look at all the studies published daily. Thanks. best, jp",

I live in Los Angeles and looking for a new Medical Oncologist...mine is considered 'the best' but she is impatient with my questions and seems to be very trigger happy with meds based on studies which I understand but this is my life and I really want to feel like I can explore options and have a dialogue about it all. Would love to find an Oncologist who has had breast cancer (or GYN or internist). Would love any suggestions...thanks!",
