I see the dr June 9, 2009 and I would love to have it all done at one time.  My chemo dr. wants to start asap.  I'm pulled in everyway you can think of. I'm a stage 2 with sentinel node and the seven lymph nodes they tested with metastatic carcinoma involvement.  Does it ever end????    fighting the battle and praying for us all      Mary",

So, I'll try to keep updated on everyone here every couple days, I'm still very weak and very sore from the surgery.  But, I tell you, I am so grateful to be alive and know that most of the cancer is out of my body.  As soon as I've healed enough I'm to resume my chemo and my onco.promises to watch me ever so closely to keep my red and white blood cells up to a save level.  I also had to have my pic line taken out, because I got a skin bacteria when it when in, one of the causes for the high temps. I kept running.. God Bless you all, and I pray no one has to go through what I had happen so suddenly to me. Just_Mary",

I'm heading after my 14 year old neice, and go shopping and get out of here.  She's more of a daughter to me, I love her to death, said she would help me around the house when I needed help...(I have a son) I shave my honey's head, he might actually enjoy shaving mine, I was gonna have my hair dresser do it, but I think I'll let him, if he is brave enough  (I can be very mouthy)....be my luck my hair will come out while his in the hospital with this cancer surg. (colon is coming completely out) but his alive, second time with his beast.. After I get through this chemo session, I'm having a double mastectomy, not taking any chances, my left breast is multifocal spread, and my mom died of this 9 years ago- not me, I'm with you girls we will beat this and stand strong, no hair and all!!! All my prayers, Mary",

I was sure I could not handle having no breast at all. I was wrong, I'm now considering not even doing reconstruction.  I have some soreness in the breast bone area, but its not that bad.  First couple days are the hardest, when getting up or down.  You do what you feel is best for you, we all have different pain levels.  Keep reading and researching and ask God for his help, and he will.  That's how I came to my answer. I see my surgeon next Tuesday for a decision on my left side, my trouble side-may need another surg. to  fix it (skin dying)  due to the infection I have on that side. Then its to my onco.to see about getting me back to chemo treatments, his thinking about putting me on the chemo pill while my breast is healing. Keeping all of you in my prayers as we fight this battle that we will all win.... Mary ",

Dr. said I would lose my hair, I quess he said that because my hair is so long. Didn't want me to have any false hopes.  Has anyone here had those treatments and how long afterwards did it begin to come out?? I'm trying to get ready for all this, but its very hard.
