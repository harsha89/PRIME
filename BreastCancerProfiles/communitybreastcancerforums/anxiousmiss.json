Everything else in my life seems to have gone to crap and I guess I feel like it would just be my luck with everything else that is going on in my life that I would have something like breast cancer. I'm a sickly person, ever since I had my son two and a half years ago it's as if all of the life was sucked from my body, always dehydrated, peeing brown, always a foul stomach, always sick with UTIs and and URIs and bronccitis. Never go more than a few weeks without getting sick and becoming a hermit to keep from passing it around to everyone like ALWAYS happens. I just found out if my brother lives to see the surgery he needs (which is medically debatable) the surgery will consist of putting him on ice, killing him, stopping ALL organs completely, putting him on bypass, repairing the second stab wound in his heart, and reviving him. My sister from another family is pregnant and basically homeless on the edge of miscarriage and suicide. My mother wants custody of my son. My rather large mass is in the most common place for b/c to be, it runs in my family, I've got endometriosis which puts me at an even higher risk, oh and did I mention I have bad luck? I'm afraid that I'll have it and I'll be alone because I would have to hide it, if my brother were to find out the stress on his heart could -literally- kill him. He's just turned 18 a few days ago for goodness sakes. I've read so much about b/c and the strength that all of the wonderful ladies on here and out in the world have to muster up so that they can over come the illness... I've cried for the people who have to go through b/c because my heart has always hurt for them and if I were to be diagnosed with it I don't know that I could be that brave or that strong. Everyone I've tried to talk to about it, including my husband (who begged me not to talk to him about it) panics and just kind of awkwardly smiles at me. I guess between my uncle being murdered last year and with my brother being so sick the family and our close friends are just too on edge to even approach. I mean I could very well JUST as easly be PERFECTLY okay but that doesn't mean I'm not worried, you know? Or that I don't need someone to talk about it. But I kind of also don't need people to panic at me about it either. Or maybe Im just expecting too much? In my head it'd make sense, because bad things just always seem to happen. But I've also lived through quite a few things that should have ended with me 6 feet in the ground, so I've had luck in weird places, too. I guess I'm just really wondering what kind of luck I'm going to have this time and in what place. Log in to post a reply",

He told me if there wasn't enough tissue that I could get one on the next appointment (today). So is it a surprise that the tests came back inconclusive because there weren't enough cells to test? Not a bit. How long do I have to wait for the next biopsy? Today, like he said right? Newp! 3 months. 3 crappin' months. Then as I was leaving he was like \"Oh there was a suspicious lymph node under your arm I realy wanted to check... I'll just wait have to wait till next time.\" He finally told me my U/S results, they apparently didn't see anything? Then he explains to me how very, very important it is that I go to my next appointment for the biopsy and he makes me schedule the next appointment in front of him so he could make sure I did it. I'm pretty sure the reason I have to wait is because there's a limit on what you can get done when you're getting the Drs appointments and biopsies paid for by a grant. So basically I have to wait because the Dr dropped my slide and screwed up my test results. Not having health insurance is a bitch X.X So basically I have to wait about 4 months before I get any actual results. Grr.",

I think thats why I have to wait so long, I know there are limits with the grants and I already went over mine :( I am livid though. Completely insensed. It doesn't help that I'm sick, yet again for the millionth time in the last year and in the process of quitting smoking. Grrrrrrrrrr! And I'm still irritated that he didn't go over the U/S with me. I looked up what breast ultra sounds are supposed to look like and mine did not look like any that I saw and all he could tell me was nothing was found. I wish there was a way I could upload it here lol",

And when the nurse found out I rememberd my nipples were always kind of crusty with a weird discharge she kind of started shouting at me o.O She was like \"YEAH? OKAY. YEAH, ALRIGHT. WELL. ILL DEFINTELY TELL THE DR THAT FOR YOU. OKAY. YEAH.\" Even I wasn't acting that nervous! lol It all feels so crazy. I'm going to watch my u/s vid since they didn't even ask to watch it (I waited 30 minutes for the darn thing for nothing)",
