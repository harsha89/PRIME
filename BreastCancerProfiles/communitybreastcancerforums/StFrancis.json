      "Content": "StFrancis wrote: Hi - I've been reading through prior posts discussing this decision (there are a lot!) but everyone's case is unique. It's hard to get a clear picture. I was diagnosed with an IDC in my left breast at the beginning of March 2015 - the tumor is slightly over 1 cm. I am 44 years old with some very minor family history of BC. My doc ordered genetic testing done (b/c of my age) and all the major markers (BRCA1/BRCA2 and several others) were all negative. Standard protocol at this point seems to lumpectomy, then radiation, then possibly chemo, then hormonal therapy for a decade. HOWEVER, I am strongly considering a double mastectomy with autologous reconstruction at the same time. My \"pros\" for this are: 1) reduce the recurrence risk as much as possible 2) avoid radiation 3) I also have small, dense breasts that don't do mammos well 4) I'm about to lose my health insurance in August and kind of want to do as much as possible before that happens 5) I have a pretty easy summer ahead - there will never be a better time for me to recover from surgery given my work plans and 2 young children and 6) small breasts - taking out a lump bigger than 1cm plus margins is going to be disfiguring - I just don't think there's any way around it. Cons are obviously longer recovery time, scarring, etc. I'm glad of any advice or suggestions. I'm currently waiting on a referral from my general surgeon to a plastic surgeon. Thanks!

I'm thinking I might get a second oncologist opinion as well. I like my doc, but he is awfully young. Part of me wants to see somebody more \"seasoned\" who's seen everything. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but it might make me feel better about my decision.",

Yes, I will need to have oncotype testing and a sentinel node biopsy when the surgery happens to determine if I need chemo. I spent about 90 minutes yesterday consulting with the plastic surgeon about reconstruction options. I liked him quite a lot and he thought I was a good candidate for the PAP flap procedure if I choose BMX with immediate reconstruction. He said have enough tummy tissue to build one new breast (with the DIEP flap procedure) but not two. But....baby got back. ;) He could reconstruct both breasts with tissue from the back of the thighs/buttocks with the PAP procedure. I realize this seems a little extreme given my relatively \"mild\" BC diagnosis, but there are some pros to that decision to mean a lot to me. I think primarily, it will make me feel ACTIVE about this -- like I'm choosing to do something rather than having something done to me. I'm going to think on it for a bit, and get a second opinion from another oncologist about my overall treatment next week. I like my current doc, but he's awfully young. I'd like to hear from someone seasoned who's seen everything. Also, I haven't seen too much info (or photos) about the PAP procedure since it seems relatively new. I am fortunate to have access to a PS experienced with it. If I do decide to go that route, I will do my best to share what I learn and find a way to share photos with anyone interested. Thanks again!",
