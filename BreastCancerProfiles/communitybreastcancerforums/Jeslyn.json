So anyway.... I wish I could say that feeling will go away soon.  I'm not going to say \"just stay strong\", \"everything will be ok\", or whatever (mainly b/c when people say that to me, I pretty much wana punch them in the face....sorry :-/).  But seriously, your a mom, no doubt you'll be as strong as you can, as strong as you must, if only for the sake of your son.  And no doubt, you do hope \"everything will be ok\", but that doesn't mean it will be, nor does everyone & their mother telling you so, make it any more likely/believable. That's the s*** of it, you know?  There are no guarantees w/this sorta thing, and its absolutely terrifying.   That being said, you should try hard not to think too often or too hard about the uncertainty, the worst case scenario (or even everything you'll have to go through in the best case).  Trust me, I know how hard it is, but there are some things that... Well, it's easier to give examples.  For instance, after my chemo, I'm doing the whole double mastectomy. Sure, there is a plethora of unpleasant aspects of this that I can drive myself crazy with.  However, as often as I can, I try and think I'm gona have \"Pre-Pregnancy Boobs!!\" (this is quite the happy thought for me, as mine deflated after I had my kids).  Dont get me wrong, I wouldn't choose cancer, for the nicest perkiest breasts in the world, but I don't let myself look at them as......idk, part of the same thing?  Like, when I'm buggin out about being sick, I dont tell myself, \"it's ok, b/c i'll have nice boobs when/if this is finally over\".  Sometimes I bug about being sick, other times i think about my all expenses paid breast augmentation.....(e.g. surf the web researching implants, joke w/my buddy about how he's gona do a 'field study' on implants whenever he goes out, and report back w/the results...).  Another thing I've found some joy in is dancing (when i feel up to it).  My kids and I decided that when I'm better, we're going to go out country line dancing.  So, we've been going on youtube, and learning the different dances, so that when we go, we'll know all the steps (and they'll be like the coolest little kids ever b/c they'll be able to keep up ;-). I'm not gona lie, now that i'm going through chemo, the nightmare that couldn't possibly get worse, became a night terror. Sometimes, I can hardly get out of bed, and just having to get up and walk to the bathroom..... Well, since i was 'trying' to keep this short, and your not yet there anyway, I'll just say, It SUCKS.  But, I also know I'll not survive (mentally & emotionally) if I let myself wallow too long.  So I'm  having to become more inventive w/my distractions (e.g. medical marijuana helps.  I was worried b/c i have kids, and didn't want to be \"high\" trying to take care of them.  However, sometimes I'm just to sick to take care of them, and I need help anyway.  At these times, the medical \"green\" not only helps w/my stomach, difficulty sleeping, pain, etc...... it also takes the edge off.  And for me, unlike alcohol, it doesn't lead to hysterical crying.  Ok, really have to wrap it up for now, but will check later in case you want to talk (type). I guess what i'm suggesting is....try and embrace any joys, simple pleasures that you can, and try very hard not to measure it up against the magnitude of your situation. Also, take advantage of everything your hospital has to offer.  For instance,the Cancer Center I go to offers all sorts of things; therapy, support groups, yoga, massages, etc. There's even arts & crafts for patients/survivors. You can also check out the Cancer Society (i'm not sure about Canada b/c I dont live there, but I attended an american cancer society \"Look Good Feel Better\" seminar and received all sorts of free high-end cosmetics.  Anyway, wish you the best of luck w/everything, and i apologize if I'm too...whatever.  This is all just my own opinion based on my circumstances, and the only thing that's certain is that every situation truly is different.",
