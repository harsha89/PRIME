Plus, I think a place like Mayo is likely to have a good \"team\" approach between breast surgeon, plastic surgeon, radiology oncologist, medical oncologist. Wherever you go for surgery should be a place where they do the Sentinel Node Biopsy (SNB) -- even if you were Stage 1 you should have this.  They inject your breast with a radioactive dye close to the tumor, and then they can tell which is the first lymph node \"in line\" -- they biopsy that node.  This means they usually don't have to take as many nodes as in years past.  (If you already know this, I apologize -- I didn't know about it when I was diagnosed -- and I'm just concerned that a general surgeon in a smaller-town hospital might not have the capability to perform the SNB.  If they can't offer it, that's yet another reason to go to a bigger place.) I'm so sorry you had to \"join our club\" -- but I wish you all the best of luck from here on, Ann",

I hope your primary has some other recommendations. I can see not canceling your MRI and biopsy appointments while you try to make other appointments -- but these procedures also require skill in performance and interpretation, so you do need to have confidence in the providers. The surgeon you saw -- is he a breast oncologic surgeon?  That is the type of doctor you should be seeing.  Does he practice in a group?  Was his office in some kind of breast cancer services unit?  Ideally, you should be at a place that provides comprehensive breast cancer service, which would include a social worker or nurse practitioner or other patient education person who would be available to you from Day 1.  The fact that none of this seemed apparent to you at the place you went to -- strengthens my inclination to say you are right in never wanting to go back there.  Maybe your primary can tell you whether any such resources are available at the place she referred you to -- or at any other facility in your area. If there is a \"breast center\" at the hospital you went to, maybe you can find the patient rep person who is supposed to be the human face, and you will be reassured about the hospital. I guess keep your MRI and biopsy appointments, but vigorously search for other options.  If your biopsy at the \"bad\" place is scheduled for next week, but some other highly-rated place can get you in two weeks after that, I wouldn't think those 2 extra weeks are such a big deal -- it just depends which would be more stressful for you: going someplace you feel bad about, or waiting 2 more weeks.",

With the DIEP and TRAM surgeries, there is microscopic suturing of blood vessels, which is why smoking makes these surgeries \"iffier.\"  But since you are having a mastectomy anyway -- if you want TE/implant reconstruction, that kind of reconstruction will not add much time or complexity (and no microsurgery) to the mastectomy that you're having anyway. Just a thought -- TE/implants might be an option for you, if it would be what you want. Whatever you decide, I'm sending you best wishes and hugs, Ann",

The possible side effects of oxycodone include weakness (\"asthenia\") and chills (as well as nausea and headache, which you also mentioned).  But if you're in pain, you're not supposed to take aspirin or NSAIDs with Plavix, so if your pain is still severe, I guess oxycodone is the option?  Still, I would review all this with your PCP -- she might work out a test withdrawal from the oxycodone to see if that helps, and have ideas about other pain control options that are possible while taking Plavix.

I hope you take their words to heart, and get the best treatment you can. What I have to say is about the other \"option\" you asked about (\"should I do nothing and have a better time in months I have left?\") -- I don't think that is an accurate option. This is based on seeing the experience of a friend who chose no treatment at all, other than palliative care -- but her last months were VERY difficult. She really didn't have time to have any \"good times.\"   I think there is an occasional misconception that \"no treatment\" leads to a better quality of life in whatever time one has left.  But I think that is a misconception. The unchecked progression of cancer usually doesn't provide a good quality of life.  Most people just don't see untreated cancer these days, so they don't know that.  I think today's chemo and other treatments extend life AND its quality, for the most part.",

      "Content": "Jun 21, 2008 06:32PM - edited Jun 21, 2008 06:49PM by AnnNYC Hi AMANN, I see you have asked this question a few times -- I guess maybe no one here has experience with thalassemia minor and chemotherapy. I do think you deserve more input from your doctors.  Like you say, it's not just a question of what you would \"prefer\" to do. Do you see a hematologist for your thalassemia?  If so, can that doctor give you some input? Maybe the Thalassemia Foundation would be helpful? http://www.thalassemia.org/ I didn't find anything about chemo on their website, but I did find a Patient Services Department.  They say \"The Patient Services Department is here to serve you. If you have a question or a problem, please don't hesitate to contact us at (800) 522-7222.\" (It's called the Cooley's Anemia Foundation patient services dept, and I know that's major thalassemia -- but they have info about beta/minor thalassemia on the website too, so maybe they can help you.  They say they offer \"Physician Referrals: contact information on hematologists located throughout the US who are familiar with thalassemia; contact information on the 6 major thalassemia treatment centers in the US and their satellite hospitals.\") I found contradictory statements in the medical literature about chemotherapy in people with minor thalassemia. I found a 2007 report from Sicily (where 6% of the population has thalassemia minor) - the doctors looked at the records of 26 patients with thalassemia minor who had chemotherapy for solid tumors.  55% of the patients had worsening anemia with chemo.  Two needed transfusions.  It recommends treatment with drugs called epoietins - but in the U.S. epoietins (Procrit, Aranesp) now have a warning that they can increase tumor growth and worsen survival rates after chemo. [So, if chemo meant I would have to take epoietins, I might decide not to take chemo.  But, if I felt that I needed chemo to reduce recurrence risk, I guess transfusions would be a safe option if needed for anemia, especially if donors were lined up in advance -- can you discuss the what-ifs with your oncologist?  If your oncologist can't be available to discuss how they would treat worsening anemia in case that happened to you -- then I would really seek out a second opinion from an oncologist.] A report from back in 1997 said chemo IMPROVED the anemia in 2 of 4 breast cancer patients with minor thalassemia.  It studied 245 patients with Stage 2 breast cancer who received chemotherapy.  Four of them had thalassemia minor.  Two of the thalassemia patients had their anemia improve after chemo; and all 4 thalassemia patients had better hemoglobin after chemo than the non-thalassemia women.  Of course, 4 women with thalassemia minor is a very small sample, so it's hard to draw a conclusion. http://sarcomaca.asco.org/ASCO/Abstracts+&+Virtual+Meeting/Abstracts?&vmview=abst_detail_view&confID=30&abstractID=4352 I don't know if this info is helpful to you -- I think you are in a small subset, so maybe being in touch with a thalassemia group or doctor might increase your chances of hearing from someone else with thalassemia who has undergone chemo.

Others here may have more expertise to judge what your surgeon is saying -- but it seems \"off\" to me, especially given that your radiologist and oncologist disagree with surgeon.  Is your surgeon a breast oncologic specialist?  Are you being seen in a specialized cancer center? This definitely sounds like a time to get a second opinion.  Also, it sounds like the surgeon is not part of a \"team\" with your radiologist and oncologist -- I think it would be preferable to have more of a \"team\" working with you. When the surgeon says there's a  \"50% chance\" that you have another malignant tumor -- is he talking about the spot on the MRI?  In that case, \"50%\" does not sound scientific, but instead like some vernacular scare tactic that I would not want from a doctor. Did you get MRI of both breasts? (I think that should be part of your general workup as you wait for BRCA testing to make your decision, as you indicated was your basic plan.) As part of the process of getting your second opinion, I think you should ask your current surgeon to write up his concerns and recommendations.  I would think he would be happy to do this if his motivation is to provide you with the best care.  In fact, I think he should already have done this and sent it to your oncologist and radiologist.  They should all be putting their plans and recommendations in writing. You can ask for a copy of each doctor's  correspondence/consult letter to be sent to you. just MHO... Ann",

The terminology in breast cancer all reflects a very longstanding idea that surgery is the primary therapy. Chemo, rads, hormone treatment (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, oophorectomy), and herceptin are all \"adjuvant\" therapy. \"Neoadjuvant\" means \"the secondary therapy is given first, before the primary\"!!! http://www.breastcancer.org/dictionary/n/neoadjuvanttherapy_t.jsp This hierarchical idea of \"primary\" and \"secondary\" isn't absolutely true anymore in a perfect descriptive sense -- as adjuvants become more precise, refined, and effective -- but it's still a useful framework. (But surgeons notoriously have big egos anyway, and it sounds like yours is really invested in surgery being the primary therapy!!!)",

In your case, this doesn't even really sound like \"neoadjuvant chemo\" because you already had lumpectomy (with good margins, right?) and SNB (clear). If I understand correctly, onc wants chemo next because your tumors are Her2+ and you had \"lymphovascular invasion.\" Surgeon wants mast because there were 2 tumors, not 1 -- but they were in same quadrant, only 2 cm apart, and presumably of the same type (triple-positive), so according to most current guidelines, this is NOT a definite indication for mast. Surgeon may also want mast because of \"spot on MRI\" that doesn't show up on PET scan or US.  I'm assuming onc thinks this may be false positive, may shrink to nothing after chemo, and if you want to conserve your breast, it's probably a little too traumatized right now to do an MRI-guided biopsy... so it's okay to wait and see what appears on another MRI after chemo + rads. It's interesting that I wrote \"surgeon WANTS mast\" -- in other cases I would expect to be writing \"recommends\" but clearly this guy WANTS it -- I believe he wants it because he thinks you need it, but still...  You deserve someone who is listening to you, who is not hysterical, who is up to date, who knows how to be a team player.",

You asked \"what do I say to her to let her know that I love her and will be with her through all of it?\"  I think you could say exactly those words \"I love you, and I will be here with you through everything\"",

      "Content": "Apr 9, 2009 03:27PM AnnNYC wrote: fulloflife, First of all, it's spelled \"sentinel\" -- not \"sentinal.\" The term \"sentinel node biopsy\" or \"SNB\" refers to a relatively new procedure.  Radioactive dye is injected near the primary tumor, and then whichever lymph node (or nodes) has picked up the radioactivity (as detected by Geiger counter) OR has been dyed blue by the radioactive dye (upon visual observation by the surgeon) is/are removed for histopathologic review.  Biopsied.  To see if any cancer cells are in the node(s). This can pretty commonly be anywhere from one to five nodes.  Sometimes no node appears to have received the dye. The rationale for this procedure is: our lymph systems are pretty mysterious, idiosyncratic, individualized.  In the bad old days, doctors would guess, and just sample a bunch of lymph nodes (increasing the risk for lymphedema -- while still \"rolling the dice\" about whether any of the nodes they DIDN'T remove were in fact cancerous).  (The bad old days include a friend of mine with melanoma in 1994, who had a number of lymph nodes sampled from his groin which were all benign -- but he died of metastatic melanoma in 1998.  It was right around then that I first started to hear of the development of the SNB procedure, originally invented for melanoma, and then quickly adopted for use with breast cancer.) So -- \"sentinel node\" -- this term coined in about 1998 -- means \"the node that we think was first in line for lymph draining from your particular primary tumor, and if that node is benign, we think it's likely that all your nodes are benign.\" As noted above by Beesie, the sentinel nodes of breast tumors are usually armpit (axillary) nodes. When you found something in a medical dictionary about the left supraclavicular node being \"usually indicative of primary carcinoma of thoracic or abdominal organs\" -- this is an OLD sign, also called \"Virchow's node\" because it was described by Rudolf Virchow (the \"Father of Pathology\") in the 19th century, as \"signalling\" the possible presence of stomach or lung cancer.  (Also called \"Troisier's sign\" for a French physician who noticed the same thing.) So. An enlarged left supraclavicular node was recognized in the 19th century to be a sign (or \"signal\") of advanced stomach or lung (NOT BREAST!) cancer -- back in the days when there was no x-ray, CT or PET scan, gastroscopy, or MRI to notice stomach or lung cancer before it was so advanced that it was messing up your left supraclavicular node. It has NOTHING TO DO with a technique developed in 1998 to try to determine which axillary (armpit) lymph node was first in line (\"sentinel\") from an individual's breast cancer. Am I yelling, with these capital letters?  YES!!!!!!!!! I \"work in the medical field\" too -- and I don't know why you're digging yourself deeper and deeper into your mistake.  \"Sentinel node\" does not mean \"malignant.\"  End of story.",

Metastatic means that cancerous cells are found elsewhere in the body, outside the primary tumor.  A metastatic node would have cancerous cells in it.  To say that a lymph node receives drainage means it receives lymphatic fluid. To say that a node is \"the very first to receive lymphatic fluid from a particular area\" does NOT mean the node received cancer cells!  It received lymphatic fluid!  But if it's first in line to receive fluid from the area of a tumor, then it's a good node to test -- if it is not cancerous (i.e., if it is not metastatic) then you can be pretty sure the other nodes further down the line are not cancerous either. The phrases you cite -- yours and Beesie's -- are NOT the same thing \"just worded differently.\" Actually, there are women here who do know a lot -- and actually, sometimes more than a given doctor, which often is an incentive for a woman to find a better doctor.  Certainly, information needs to come from credible sources.  But not every doctor is credible!  (Certainly not the occasional doctor who is unfamiliar with inflammatory breast cancer and tells a 30 year old woman she's too young to have breast cancer, and anyway breast cancer doesn't hurt!)  I wouldn't necessarily characterize the responses you got as \"offended\" -- unfortunately, you were simply wrong.  Incorrect information will quickly be corrected here, which is a virtue of this kind of website that has been noted in scientific reports.",

Sorry to be so late in responding -- I can only echo what everyone else has said, in recommending second opinions/reviews.  And also that it would be great if you could see an orthopedist and/or rheumatologist who has experience with bone mets, with making a  DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS between bone mets and other conditions, and with helping someone's bones and joints FEEL BETTER whatever the correct diagnosis is!  Was it LuAnn's or Fitztwin's orthopedist who was so incensed that referral to him was long delayed by the oncologists?  As if the bone/joint specialists are an afterthought or last resort?  [As for rheumatology, in addition to rheumatoid factor (RF) and antinuclear antibodies (ANA), there are other pertinent tests including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP).  And even if these tests are NORMAL, it doesn't rule out rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or some other inflammatory process.] Hugs, Ann",

      "Content": "Feb 20, 2009 06:44PM - edited Feb 20, 2009 06:48PM by AnnNYC Hi June -- your breast surgeon (BS) and/or plastic surgeon (PS) will probably prescribe post-surgery physical therapy for you.  If they don't suggest it, ask them about it when you are consulting prior to surgery.  I wonder if it might be a good idea to see the physical therapist pre-surgery, with your flute, so the PT can see the work you do and map out a plan to get you back in shape to do it. From my own mastectomy experience, I would guess that \"rehabbing\" your arms and the chest muscles that help you lift and extend your arms to hold the flute would be a bit more of a challenge than breathing.  It really hurt me to take a breath for about 6 hours after mastectomy (maybe 18 hours, but I was kind of drugged by then, so I don't really remember) -- but on the second day, I think that particular pain was all gone -- and in fact they brought me a plastic Spirometer thingie in the hospital, and commanded me to use it for the next two weeks, to prevent pneumonia.  You forcefully exhale and try to suspend a little plastic ball in a tube with your exhalation for as long and as \"high\" as you can.  This was not at all painful. There are women on this board who have resumed strenuous exercise like weightlifting, karate, rockclimbing. There are mixed reports from musicians.  I have done a search for a lot of previous conversations about musicians, and here they are (if any of these doesn't work as a \"hot link\", it should work if you copy it and paste it into your browser). http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/84/topic/728534?page=1#post_1223490 http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/7/topic/709344?page=1#post_1029931 http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/73/topic/708194?page=1#post_989680 http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/73/topic/708194?page=1#post_969092 [The last link is to the following comment by Sarah Schm (Sarah Schmalenberger), who ...published an expository article about the \"research problem\" that generated this Life and Livelihood Study on musicians and breast cancer.  Aptly titled \"Life and Livelihood:  Musicians Coping With Breast Cancer,\" the article is accessible online from the journal Review of Disabilities International - which published a two-issue set of essays on the problems of performing artists.   Find the article at  http://www.rds.hawaii.edu/downloads/ Select from the volumes of RDS articles the first choice, Volume 4 Issue 1, 2008, and look for the title above.] Sarah is a hornist who is currently conducting a study at: http://www.musiciansurvivor.org/ Wishing you the best -- PM me if you want, Ann",

Keeping my fingers crossed that your lump turns out to be benign!  In a way, maybe I was a bit like your husband in that I didn't want to look too far ahead -- \"I'll cross that bridge when I come to it\" was what I told myself -- maybe I was in a bit of denial -- but we're all individual and have to deal with our own feelings in our own way.  I guess I ended up not talking much to anyone in the biopsy process -- because I remember mostly everyone said \"I'm sure you'll be fine\" and I wasn't sure.  I didn't really want to imagine \"what if I'm not?\" \"what if I need a mastectomy?\" (turned out I did) -- but it wasn't helpful when people said \"I'm sure you'll be fine\" -- in fact, that kind of scared me. Didn't find this Board until 6 months later -- wish I'd found it sooner! Just want to send you hugs and hope -- hope you can take this one step at a time, and hope your \"steps\" will end with a benign biopsy report -- but whatever step ends up being required, somebody here has had to take it, and will be glad to talk to you about it. Hope that made sense and was at least a teeny bit helpful!  This biopsy stage is a very stressful process, that's for sure!  ((((((Hugs))))))  Ann",

Also -- as to whether an excisional biopsy is a more invasive or difficult procedure -- I had an excisional biopsy on my left breast (which showed IDC -- this was the spot that was \"inconclusive\" by FNA).  A few weeks later I had MRI-guided core needle biopsy on my right breast (turned out to be benign) -- which, in my experience, was far more brutal than the excisional!  My right breast turned entirely purple, and was discolored and painful for weeks!  The site of the excisional biopsy on the left seemed far more \"controlled\" and easier to recover from. Your mileage may vary. Erin1, after my excisional biopsy, I took only one of the prescribed Tylenol with codeine.  The thing that was most painful for me was any kind of bumpy ride -- if at all possible, I would suggest you avoid those! Good luck -- wishing you the best!",

For 22 years (in a medical research department, though not cancer research), I've been the person handling manuscripts, revisions, submissions, more revisions,getting Accounts Payable to pay the page charges (yes, it costs money to publish in most med/sci journals!), getting all the authors to sign their copyright and conflict of interest forms, proofing the galleys...  So I'm guessing 1.5 to 2 years to analyze the data, 3 to 6 months to write the paper (lots of authors on these), 6 months to 1.5 years from submission of a manuscript until it sees the light of day!  And the info is \"embargoed\" until publication date.  And I bet these authors got a lot of rejection notices saying the results weren't that groundbreaking! One good thing these days (last 3 years or so) is that many journals will now publish papers online \"in advance of print publication\" -- so even though the paper issue of the journal won't come out until August 2008, for example, an accepted paper can now appear online at least 6 months earlier...

As geebung and LUVmy2girlZ have indicated, it is not at all unusual to go through these changing steps: aspiration, biopsy, lumpectomy, mastectomy, change of postmastectomy treatment plan. I had a little lump that I felt, it didn't show up on mammo or ultrasound, the fine needle aspiration was inconclusive, the surgeon recommended an excisional biopsy (would have been called a lumpectomy if they knew ahead of time that it was cancer).  Surgeon kept saying \"it's probably benign but let's just get it out.\" Well, it was IDC, with associated DCIS, not clean margins, involving nipple -- so I had to have a mastectomy.  In my case, the mastectomy DID have clean margins, so I didn't need radiation. As frustrating as it is to keep having these other shoes drop -- I think it's a lot better than 40 years ago, when women would go under anesthesia for a biopsy and wake up to find their entire breast and chest muscle removed.  Unfortunately, it can take all these steps for a diagnosis.  The whole process is grueling -- and having to go through it is unfair.  But the many steps, and the changes along the way, stem from 2 good motives: 1) to make sure a correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment are given while 2) trying not to inflict treatment that is more invasive or harsh than the situation requires. And finally, it is so good that you and your wife are clearly such a strong team in dealing with this.  You may think, \"of course -- I couldn't be any other way,\" but not everyone is that way!  Take care, Ann",

Did you ever have MRI before?  If you didn't have MRI before your original lumpectomy, is it possible your \"new\" 6 mm tumor was there all along? Were you tested for the gene for the liver enzyme CYP2D6?  This is the enzyme that metabolizes tamoxifen, making it work -- a small percentage of women will have genetic variants that make this enzyme far less active, and therefore tamoxifen is unlikely to be of use. (I am in this small percentage -- since I am postmenopausal, I was switched to aromasin. For premenopausal women who are poor metabolizers of tamoxifen, oophorectomy should be considered.)",

Also, I had a mastectomy following lumpectomy (because tumor involved nipple, and margins after lx weren't clear), no radiation, and I'm taking Aromasin. I was 54 at dx, like you. I didn't have chemo -- really trusted my oncologist, and was happy to hear she felt the benefit of chemo would be very slight, if any. I don't know what to say about the 4-point difference in Oncotype Dx score.  This is certainly a huge decision. All I can say is, with very similar circumstances, and a score of 16, I am okay with my \"no chemo\" decision, and am 16 months out from dx.",

The question is -- why do the data seem contradictory? I think if the graph on the right showed the absolute risk of distant recurrence at 10 years for the intermediate group that DIDN'T get chemo, it would go a little further below zero than the chemo group that is shown.  That's why the relative risk of the chemo group is 0.62 of the risk of the non-chemo group -- but both chemo and non-chemo \"intermediates\" have some small absolute risk of distant recurrence at 10 years.  Does that make sense? (BTW, I was 54, my score was \"intermediate\" at 16, and I didn't do chemo.)",

They will accept orders for single roses, to be put in vase(s) with card(s) saying \"With love from sisters on BCO Discussion Boards\" -- also listing individual names/screen names.   Because it is so close to Valentine's Day (service is on Sunday Feb 15), they asked if mixed colors would be okay.  Personally, I think that will be beautiful.  They can accept orders through Friday, but I think the sooner the better.  I spoke to both Susan, the owner of the shop, and Crystal, who were both incredibly sweet.

I'm another one whose IDC was not seen on mammo or ultrasound.  Fortunately, I had really good doctors every step of the way who kept moving to the next step, because we could all feel the bump, even though the mammo and US couldn't \"see\" it. I'm guessing the doctors were a little more proactive because I was 54, not 41 -- but Goldie, you're 41 with a family history! That's one of the reasons this board is so important -- to learn from others' experiences. The insurance company not paying for MRI is REALLY messed-up, IMHO.  Denser breasts may make tumors hard to see on mammo or US. Younger women have denser breasts.  You were a younger woman with symptoms and a family history.  ABSOLUTELY medically indicated for you to have MRI. Well, I'm glad you're being taken care of now.  Please keep us posted, (((hugs))) Ann",

Our IRB has to approve all advertising and recruitment materials/flyers/ads/etc. in addition to the study itself.  And after approval, the flyer/ad has to state that it was approved by the IRB.",

My BS ordered mammo/US, but the radiology place kept taking US \"off the menu\" -- breast surgeon and I tried to order it 4 different times between us, but on the day of my mammo, the tech insisted, \"the radiology says there's nothing suspicious on your mammo, so you don't need US.\"  I said, \"Even with my history of BC in the contralateral breast that was never seen on mammo?\" Scurry, scurry, scurry.  Whisper, whisper, whisper.  Return: \"Get Dr. G (breast surgeon) to order it.\"  Me: \"she has ordered it, about 4 times.\"  They: \"Oh.  Well, we can't fit you into our schedule for US today.\"  Me, fuming to myself, \"but I have only been saying 'plus ultrasound' until I'm blue in the face trying to book this appt for the last 4 months\" but I bit my tongue and just said: \"Okay, when can you?\" So, a week later, I got my ultrasound.  Clear.  (That's good!)  And I'll have MRI in about 6 months. I think that if you would prefer more than annual or semiannual mammo, you could at least call your insurance to see what they'll cover?  Also, maybe your BS or onc has a different imaging protocol in mind than your radiologist (or her staff) does, and if they prescribe it, radiologist and insurance might comply?",

I had a small painful bump at the side of my areola (3 o'clock on the areola of left breast) -- diagnostic mammo and ultrasound showed nothing, but fortunately I had a great radiologist (who specializes in breast imaging and has done thousands upon thousands) who basically said, \"you have dense breasts which can make it hard to see a tumor, and the nipple/areola complex is also very hard to visualize with mammo/US -- so we can't see anything, but we can feel the lump, and we don't know what it is, so I'm referring you to a breast surgeon for a biopsy.\" BS first did a fine needle aspiration (FNA), where they take cells out of the lump through a (duh!) fine needle -- this was \"inconclusive\" so the BS recommended an excisional biopsy (surgical biopsy, wide excision, would be called a lumpectomy if they knew in advance that it was cancer).  The result of the excisional biopsy is in my signature line: IDC, Stage 1, Grade 2. My experience is not rare -- except maybe in having experienced doctors who recommended the biopsies, instead of me having to push them to do it.  My doctors kept saying, \"It's probably benign, but let's make sure\" -- and I guess that's what I'm saying to both of you!",

      "Content": "Jan 4, 2008 09:25PM - edited Jan 4, 2008 09:29PM by AnnNYC I felt the lump starting almost exactly a year ago!  Right after New Year's 2007, I had what felt and looked like a little pimple or boil at the outer edge of my left nipple (about \"3 o'clock\" if you were looking straight at me). It was very painful and red.  It reminded me of plugged milk duct preceding mastitis when I was nursing 23 years earlier. (I had bought a new bra for New Year's Eve and wore it without washing first -- my skin is very sensitive, so I thought maybe it was an allergic reaction to fabric sizing or dye -- and in fact maybe part of the \"inflamed\" appearance was an allergic reaction, in which case I was really lucky that it made this bump more noticeable.) Well, I didn't act on this immediately, because it really seemed like an allergy or infection, and in fact the redness, heat and pain subsided in a few days -- but the lump didn't. I needed annual mammo anyway -- made appointment, and had mammo on Feb 2.  Mammo normal.  But because I made the radiologist feel the lump (which felt a little \"fixed\" -- the surface bump felt like a mushroom head on a stalk \"anchored\" about 1/2 inch below the surface) she did ultrasound also.  Also appeared normal.  But radiologist said, \"the nipple/areola can be a difficult area to image -- you should see a breast surgeon who may want to biopsy anyway\" and referred me to BS.  That appt was Feb 14 -- what a Valentine's Day -- had fine needle aspiration (FNA) and was told of \"abnormal cells\" that were probably benign hyperplasia/fibroadenoma, but BS thought it would be wise to perform excisional biopsy to get a better look and remove the lump as it was painful anyway.  Biopsy was March 2.  Surgeon said she would have results for me by March 13, and made appt for that day (a Tuesday).  But on Friday, March 9 -- she left a message on my voicemail saying \"call me when you can, I'll be here late.\" Well, that was scary. I heard the message about 8 in the evening, and called the number she had left.  It was her service, and the first guy I spoke to asked what I was calling about and I said \"to get results.\"  He was snippy and said \"We won't relay a message asking for results over the weekend.  She'll see it when she gets in on Monday.\"  I argued that her message said I should call her anytime over the weekend, and wanted to play it for him...  but he was giving me the classic bitchy \"buh-bye\"...  So I hung up and immediately dialed back and reached a different person on the service -- didn't mention \"results\" -- said \"Dr. G asked me to speak to her immediately\" -- left my number, and BS called me back in 5 minutes. Okay. It's a bit of a blur.  I think she said \"It's not benign.  It's a small well-behaved cancer in a bit of a bad location.  But this thing is very fixable.\"  I said \"This may sound superficial, but what I'm really worried about right this second is -- am I going to lose my nipple?\"  She said, \"That's a legitimate concern.  You're coming to see me on Tuesday and we'll talk about options.  But this is very fixable, and you'll be just fine.\" Whoa. On Tuesday, she showed me path report, explained to me that margins were not clean, and a lumpectomy would offer me the \"worst of both worlds\" -- whole point of lumpectomy is to have cosmetically, functionally acceptable breast -- but with the whole nipple/areola complex removed it wouldn't be -- and would necessitate rads and perhaps chemo.  So, suddenly I joined the club, and learned new words like TRAM, DIEP, S-GAP...  chose tissue expander only. About my Ob-Gyn -- I went to see her for annual exam Feb 28 or so, between FNA and excisional bx -- she did breast exam and was the only doctor to find the lump without my laying her finger on it and rolling it around!  She said \"Is this what they're gonna biopsy? Yes?  Good!\"  She also said, about BS and PS -- even though she hadn't been the one to refer me to them -- that if she was ever in my shoes, she would see the same docs.  That made me feel great.  And she called me after me biopsy to learn dx.  And told me to let her know when mastectomy was scheduled.  And then called me the day of just to say she was thinking of me and wishing me well!  What a doll. (Basil16883 -- I've PM'd you the names of my doctors here in NYC -- I think you can tell I've been very happy with all of them)",

Even if there is no suspicious area identified in your right breast, SNB seems to have about a 95% chance of finding the first lymph node draining the breast. SO... I would discuss all this with your doctor(s) to make sure.",

I don't remember if you know your friend's ER/PR/HER2 status.  If she is estrogen-receptor (ER) positive, and HER2-negative -- then given small tumor size and no lymph node involvement, she might be a candidate for no-chemo.  (I would think she would still have radiation treatment following her lumpectomy, and take some kind of anti-hormonal pill like tamoxifen or arimidex.)",

My thought on seeing the word \"rare\" in that report is that the cells are \"rare\" within the tissue taken from you -- meaning there are only a FEW \"chronic inflammatory cells\" present \"around\" the duct (\"periductal\"), not a whole lot of them. As for the significance of ANY \"chronic inflammatory cells\", I can't answer that.  But as for the meaning of \"rare\" -- I'll bet money that the pathologist means there are \"only a few\" in your tissue.",

In a few cases different injection sites identify different, often closely interconnected sLNs.\" So, I am revising my previous \"guesses\" -- it looks like, even with out localizing dye injection into an identified suspicious area in the right breast, a SNB is pretty likely to identify the actual \"sentinel\" node, i.e., the one that is first reached by lymph fluid draining from the breast.",

They also have affiliate centers in Marysville and Merced, and an infusion center (should you end up needing chemo) in Roseville. About making an appointment as a new patient, the website says: \"Your doctor may refer you to UC Davis Cancer Center. Or, you may schedule an appointment on your own, if your health insurance plan gives you that flexibility. To make a first appointment, please call the Cancer Center's New Patient Referral Office at (916) 703-5210 or (800) 362-5566.\" 2) I found a group called \"Save Ourselves - The Breast Cancer Organization of Sacramento\" (http://www.save-ourselves.org/) They have a 24-hour hotline: 1-800-422-9747 or 916-448-5432.  Maybe someone can recommend a group of breast cancer specialists close to you, or maybe they have other resources that might be helpful to you. 3) On a San Diego State University website (http://qap.sdsu.edu/screening/breastcancer/guide/index.html), you can download a pamphlet about BC that your doctor was legally obligated to give to you!!!  The website says: \"The State of California requires that doctors give a copy of  \u2018A Woman's Guide to Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment'  to a patient about to have a breast biopsy or who has been diagnosed with cancer. The guide was developed by The California Department of Health Services, Breast Cancer Early Detection Program.\" Did your doctor give you this booklet when he told you he was sure it was \"bad\", warned you about possible mastectomy, and asked you to carry your slides to pathology lab yourself? I'm guessing NOT, because page 5 of the booklet says: \"Doctors used to believe that it was best to biopsy a woman's lump and remove her breast in the same operation if cancer was found. A woman went into surgery for a biopsy not knowing whether she would wake up with her breast. This rarely happens today. Studies show that it is safe to start treatment within several weeks after your biopsy. This two-step procedure gives you time to:",

Well -- enough of that.

About the bump on your areola -- if it does not show up on mammogram or ultrasound, I really think you should ask for it to be biopsied in some way.  The first step would probably be fine needle aspiration (FNA) -- they take some cells with a very thin needle to look at under a microscope. The reason I say this is because the nipple and areola can be \"very hard to visualize\" with mammo or US -- in the words of the radiologists who did mine -- I had a bump on my areola that everyone could feel.  It didn't show up on mammo or US.  Then I was referred for FNA, which was \"inconclusive.\"  Then my breast surgeon did an excisional biopsy, trying to take out the whole bump -- and it was invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Please understand, I'm not saying this to scare you.  More to scare your doctors!  I'm so thankful I had doctors who pushed to get a definitive answer right away -- they could easily have said \"let's wait six months and do another mammo\" -- and if nothing showed up then, they could have been waiting for years for this to show up on mammo. 80% of biopsies turn out benign, but I just think it's very important to biopsy to make sure. The good news for me was that this was very small and early.  (The other good news, psychologically, was that it DIDN'T show up on mammo, so I didn't have to beat myself up for not having gotten my mammo for 3 years!) Hoping you get the \"all-clear\" from your doctors, after they thoroughly check this out, Hugs, Ann",

With a lump that small, the excisional biopsy makes sure they got the right thing, they have plenty of tissue for all tests, and you won't need another biopsy. I think it's very practical of your doctor to do this.  Try not to worry too much -- easier said than done, I know -- but remember, 80% of biopsies come back benign. About telling your children -- I would say it depends on how nervous each of them is and if any is under particular stress themselves (sick child, for example).  But another poster here (iodine) points out that we deny our families the opportunity to be close and really know what's going on with us if we \"tough it out\" and don't tell them.  You might want to tell your kids \"I'm having this test\" so that they ARE included.

Mastectomy (MX) recommended.  MARCH/APRIL -- Meet with PS about recon.  Have another ultrasound and two MRIs (one an MRI-guided biopsy) of other breast to see whether I need bilateral.  Takes forever to get these appointments and results.  Oh yeah, transvaginal ultrasound too to check my ovaries.  FINALLY... 4/16/07 -- left MX, SNB and recon. I worried about the time passing.  They kept saying \"no problem.\"  I guess it's not really a problem, but it is distressing. I'd be interested to hear others' experiences, too. My nodes were entirely clear, Nancy, so in my case it certainly appears that the waiting wasn't a problem -- except for my psyche!! Of course, my surgeon did know on March 9 that my tumor was ER+ PR+ and HER2-negative.  I'd like to think that for someone HER-2 positive or triple-negative, things would have moved along faster.  In fact, maybe my appts moved along at a leisurely pace while my docs WERE prioritizing triple-neg, HER2+, larger tumors -- which is as it should be. If you're feeling changes in your breast, I hope you're calling your doctor and telling him/her -- Good luck to you, Nancy -- please keep us posted. Hugs, Ann",

Pantene Beautiful Lengths -- the only place I know of that provides wigs to adult women with cancer, 2,000 wigs in a year and a half. They provide good donation instructions, and most hair donated is used. http://www.beautifullengths.com/en_US/index_home.jsp Note -- I have no connection with any of these charities!  or with the following link!  But if someone (like the friends of ibcspouse's wife) wants to help out someone in particular, I think the most practical and effective thing would be to make a gift of something like \"HatsWithHair\" http://www.hatswithhair.com/DonateHairToMakeWig.aspx http://www.hatswithhair.com/HowToOrder.aspx to have hat or scarf or \"fall\" made for about $230 to $330, with a donation of one person's long hair, either a friend, or a woman with long hair who wants to cut it before chemo to have a hairpiece made of her own hair -- I know someone here who did it, and someone else who wanted to, but couldn't afford it.",

Lesion is a broad term, including wounds, sores, ulcers, tumors, cataracts, and any other tissue damage. They range from the skin sores associated with eczema to the changes in lung tissue that occur in tuberculosis. Dana, in your mom's case, my guess is that they are sure they can identify the \"lesions\" in her liver as tumors, so they used the word \"tumor.\"  As for bones,as wishiwere and DebC said, what happens with bone mets is often in the nature of erosions, rather than \"growths\" -- but in any case, the scans showed some abnormal spots.",

Even if you actually are in Stage IV (which is not clear at all ! ), the idea that mastectomy is of no use to women who are Stage IV may be outdated.  Recent research seems to show improved survival for some women.  I apologize for the length, but thought this may be helpful -- even if you don't go back to your twit-onc, maybe she should read some of this! http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16614878 Babiera GV, et al. Effect of primary tumor extirpation in breast cancer patients who present with stage IV disease and an intact primary tumor.  Annals of Surgical Oncology 2006;13(6):776-782. Reviewed the records of all breast cancer patients treated at M.D. Anderson (Houston, TX) between 1997 and 2002 who presented with stage IV disease and an intact primary tumor. Of 224 patients identified, 82 (37%) underwent surgical extirpation of the primary tumor (segmental mastectomy in 39 [48%] and mastectomy in 43 [52%]), and 142 (63%) were treated without surgery. The median follow-up time was 32.1 months. After adjustment for other covariates, surgery was associated with a trend toward improvement in overall survival (P=.12; relative risk, .50; 95% confidence interval, .21-1.19) and a significant improvement in metastatic progression-free survival (P=.0007; relative risk, .54; 95% confidence interval, .38-.77). CONCLUSIONS: Removal of the intact primary tumor for breast cancer patients with synchronous stage IV disease is associated with improvement in metastatic progression-free survival. Prospective studies are needed to validate these findings. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17522944 Gnerlich J, et al. Surgical removal of the primary tumor increases overall survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer: analysis of the 1988-2003 SEER data.  Annals of Surgical Oncology 2007;14:2187-2194. A retrospective, population-based cohort study by using the 1988-2003 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data. Overall survival in women with stage IV disease was compared between women who underwent surgical excision of their breast tumor with women who did not, controlling for potential confounding demographic, tumor- and treatment-related variables, and propensity scores (accounting for variables associated with the likelihood of having surgery). RESULTS: Of 9734 SEER patients with stage IV breast cancer, 47% underwent breast cancer surgery and 53% did not. Median survival was longer for women who had surgery than for women who did not, both among women who were alive at the end of the study period (36.00 vs. 21.00 months; P < .001) and among women who had died during follow-up (18.00 vs. 7.00 months; P < .001). After controlling for potential confounding variables and propensity scores, patients who underwent surgery were less likely to die during the study period compared with women who did not undergo surgery (adjusted hazard ratio, .63, 95% confidence interval, .60-.66). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the 1988-2003 SEER data indicated that extirpation of the primary breast tumor in patients with stage IV disease was associated with a marked reduction in risk of dying after controlling for variables associated with survival. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17687611 Fields RC, et al. Surgical resection of the primary tumor is associated with increased long-term survival in patients with stage IV breast cancer after controlling for site of metastasis.  Annals of Surgical Oncology 2007;14:3345-3351. Chart review (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO) identified 409 patients with stage IV breast cancer treated from 1996 to 2005; 187 received surgical excision of their primary tumor and 222 did not. 102 patients had bone-only metastases, 281 had metastases to other organs +/- bone, and 26 had no metastases recorded. RESULTS: After controlling for age, comorbidity, tumor grade, histology, and sites of metastasis, patients who underwent surgical resection had longer median survival when compared with patients who did not undergo surgical resection (31.9 vs. 15.4 months, p < 0.0001; aHR 0.53 [95% CI 0.42-0.67]). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical excision of the primary breast tumor was associated with significantly longer survival in this cohort of stage IV breast cancer patients, even after controlling for other factors associated with survival. Randomized clinical trials are needed to validate these findings. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17687611 Blanchard DK, et al. Association of surgery with improved survival in stage IV breast cancer patients. Annals of Surgery 2008;247:732-738. Using a large database (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) of women who presented with stage IV breast cancer, we compared outcome of patients who had resection of their primary cancer to those who did not. METHODS: Of 16,401 patients, 807 had stage IV disease at presentation, and 395 survived >90 days and were included in this analysis. Clinical and tumor characteristics, surgical treatment, and survival were compared for the surgically versus nonsurgically treated patients. Two hundred and forty-two patients (61.3%) had definitive surgery for their primary tumor and 153 (38.7%) did not. Patients who underwent surgery were significantly older, were more likely to be white, more often had hormone receptor positive disease, had small primary tumors, and had fewer metastatic sites and less visceral involvement. The median survival of surgically treated patients was 27.1 months versus 16.8 months for patients without surgical resection (P < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, which included surgical treatment, age, race, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, number of metastatic sites, and presence of visceral metastases, surgery remained an independent factor associated with improved survival (P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Patients with stage IV breast cancer who had definitive surgical treatment of their primary tumors had more favorable disease characteristics. However, after adjustment for these characteristics, surgical treatment remained an independent factor associated with improved survival. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18357493 Rao R, et al. Timing of surgical intervention for the intact primary in stage IV breast cancer patients. Annals of Surgical Oncology 2008;15:1696-702. BACKGROUND: Recent studies demonstrate improved progression-free survival (PFS) and improved overall survival (OS) with extirpation of the primary tumor in breast cancer patients who present with metastatic disease at initial diagnosis. The subset of patients who would most benefit from surgery remains unclear. This study evaluates the pathological attributes and optimum timing for surgery in patients who present with stage IV breast cancer and an intact primary. METHODS: Retrospective, single-institution (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas) review of all breast cancer patients between 1997 and 2002 presenting with an intact tumor and synchronous metastatic disease. Information collected included: demographics, tumor characteristics, metastatic sites, type/timing of surgery, and radiation/systemic therapy received. Patients initiated treatment within 3 months of their diagnosis. Patients were divided into three groups based on time interval from diagnosis date to surgery date. Disease progression and vital status at last follow-up were evaluated. Analysis of metastatic PFS (defined by progression of systemic disease) benefit in relation to surgical timing was performed. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis revealed patients having only one site of metastasis, negative margins, and Caucasian race had improved PFS. Further analysis revealed non-Caucasian patients more often underwent surgical intervention for palliation versus surgery for curative intent, possibly explaining their worse outcome. Patients who underwent surgery in the 3-8.9 month or later period had improved metastatic PFS. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical extirpation of the primary tumor in patients with synchronous stage IV disease is associated with improved metastatic PFS when performed more than 3 months after diagnosis. Resection should be planned with the intent of obtaining negative margins.",

I too think that there ought to be some way for them to get a definitive biopsy before proceeding to remove your nipple and areola -- and that if the definitive biopsy is not benign, then mastectomy might actually be more reasonable than a \"lumpectomy\" that removes nipple and areola.  But I agree that it seems someone should be able to give you a definitive diagnosis first. I will say that 4 cm by 2 cm does not sound small to me. Also, the kind of ultrasound-guided biopsy you had (a core biopsy, maybe?) can miss the lump it is trying to sample -- unfortunately.  I don't know how common it is, but it did happen to a good friend of mine, whose doctor also wrote something that in effect said \"sampled tissue benign, but I still think it's cancer\" -- and it was.",

I do think you should pay attention to your own gut feeling about this.  If it doesn't feel like your fibromyalgia, you should keep pushing for an explanation.  Like I said already, others may know more about this than I do, but I do believe that lobular breast cancer (ILC) is much harder to \"see\" on a mammogram than ductal breast cancer (IDC).  A clear mammogram does not necessarily mean everything's fine -- an MRI might be the next step if your pain persists. Also, there is a type of breast cancer called inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) that can best be diagnosed by a \"punch\" biopsy of some of the skin of the breast.  It doesn't start with a lump, and isn't typically seen on a mammogram.  Typically it has other symptoms besides pain, like a red rashy or bruised appearance, an increase in size of the breast, feelings of heaviness and/or heat and/or itching, dimpling or pitting of the breast skin.  I hesitate to bring it up -- maybe I'm way off base in mentioning it -- but on the other hand, I just think an intense pain like yours merits attention.  Can you get a referral to a breast specialist?  I think that would be the best thing to do.",

Before a Phase I study can be started, there have been test-tube and animal studies that show strong reason to believe this will work in people. In the case of lithium, it is not a new drug, as it has been used for more than 50 years to treat bipolar disorder.  So more is understood about the risks of lithium, the adverse effects and what is an excessive dose.  The researchers are starting off with more knowledge than they do in many other Phase I studies.  But the knowledge that is missing is how well it will work to protect the brain from radiation toxicity.  From reading the study description, and looking online for other studies (I found studies showing that it works in mice), it looks to me like this Vanderbilt study is really the first -- probably the only people with experience would be anyone already in this Vanderbilt study. Have they given you an informed consent form to read, to help you decide about the trial?",

The unlimited MetroCard is a good idea -- besides the subway, they work on buses too (I'm a big fan of city buses anyway, and especially for people who want to see the city).  I love Carmine's, and John's Pizza is great -- if you get down to Greenwich Village, the original John's is really charming (http://www.johnsbrickovenpizza.com/).  Katz's Deli is in my neck of the woods -- but really, there are great restaurants everywhere.  One I discovered when my brother and SIL were visiting is Becco, in the Theater District on 46th Street between 8th and 9th Avenues (http://becco-nyc.com/#13056091572521&true) -- it's one of Lidia Bastianich's restaurants.  (Obviously, I figure no one can ever have too much Italian food!) The food court in the lower level of Grand Central Station is really great.  AND the Eneslow shoe store!  Don't know how you feel about churches, but whenever I'm around St. Patrick's Cathedral (5th Avenue between 50th & 51st Streets) on a weekday afternoon, I love to step in for a few minutes.  It's a block east of Rockefeller Center (6th Ave, 47th to 50th Streets) -- so that's a little sightseeing jaunt...  And if you don't make it down to Greenwich Village, the Magnolia Bakery now has a shop in Rockefeller Center AND Grand Central Station!

Sometimes, it's a fine line for a loved one to walk, between being worried and optimistic -- as much as you can, it's best just to listen and empathize and say you're there for her, for whatever she wants or needs.  (Not to tell her what she should be feeling! but I don't get the sense you're the kind of person who would do that, anyway!)

Can you get a note from a doctor?  (I supposed you'd have to get an appointment for getting the note...) I think it really sucks and is outrageous.  It's also unfortunate that you would have to compromise your privacy in order to have your health needs met -- but is there possibly someone in a position of more power that you can trust to be discreet but sympathetic, who might have the clout to say \"she needs this day off for medical reasons\"? What would they do if a person happened to get sick on that day? Not saying you can call in sick now, because you already asked and they know you need that date -- but surely they must have enough staff not on holiday to accommodate the possibility that someone might have the flu or break their ankle on Feb 1 ??????????  They ought to plan for such a contingency, and you ought to qualify as such a contingency: You have a pressing medical need. Sorry for the rant, Wishing you luck, Ann",

You'd rather not have radiation, if possible.  Survival rates are equivalent but some recurrence rates are higher for lumpectomy than mastectomy.  Even the big paper (http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/347/16/1233) that is the basis for the National Cancer Institute's statement that lumpectomy and mastectomy are equivalent for early, small tumors, says that  \"Lumpectomy followed by breast irradiation continues to be appropriate therapy for women with breast cancer, provided that the margins of resected specimens are free of tumor and an acceptable cosmetic result can be obtained.\" I added the emphasis.  That sentence strongly implies what my breast surgeon said to me -- the reason for doing a lumpectomy is to retain a breast that has an acceptable appearance.  That's why doctors and patients accept the need for radiation tx, and the greater risk of local recurrence.  If the lump to be removed is big and the breast is small, that's a frequent and entirely valid reason for choosing mastectomy.  Need (and inability) to travel a great distance for rads tx is another frequent and valid reason to opt for mast instead of lumpectomy. I had an excisional biopsy first, but it didn't have clean margins.  Nipple was involved, so surgeon strongly recommended mastectomy, which I had in April 2007.  Knock on wood - so far, so good.",

But I will say that people make progress -- a person (or one of their \"parts\" -- in my case, knee) can feel so weak or injured that activity is next to impossible -- but within a surprising time frame, it can improve dramatically. You have a back problem, and you had surgery on your back -- I really would hope you could be provided with some kind of brief, in-home PT.  Or at the very least, some suggestions for building your strength.

Mammograms can see some things we can't feel -- but they can't see everything, unfortunately. There is no one perfect tool. I know that's not the most reassuring answer -- but I think it is very important to follow this up to get a definitive answer -- which is what you are doing.  It's said that 80% of biopsies are benign, so I hope you can just reassure yourself that you are taking good care of yourself by checking this out.  If your anxiety is getting the upper hand, please do whatever you need to make yourself feel better, including asking your doctor for an anti-anxiety medication or something to help you sleep.

Mine was in for 4 weeks after unilateral mx, and NEVER got down to the fabled \"30 cc for two days in a row.\" (My surgeon took it out at 4 weeks when it had been bouncing between 35 and 50 for a week, and said that some people continue to generate fluid in response to the presence of the tube/drain, so if it hadn't gotten down to 30cc/day by 4 weeks, it might never!  I was fine after they finally pulled it.) I did notice that the more active I was, the more fluid drained out -- and I think some of that was more fluid being generated, though I'm just guessing about that...  But 75 or 80cc five days after surgery sounds completely normal. P.S.  Four weeks is WAY out on the far end of the bell curve, and I hope and pray that you are on the \"near\" side, or at least somewhere in the middle (2 weeks, I think)!!!",

Radiotherapy involves much greater exposure than diagnostic x-rays.  Also, women who in girlhood had scoliosis that was monitored with x-rays over many years (particularly in the 1950s or earlier, as Linda said above) do seem to have an increased risk for breast cancer. Here is an article from Cornell University that I think explains the breast-cancer-risk of radiation pretty well: http://envirocancer.cornell.edu/factsheet/physical/fs52.radiation.cfm One thing it says is that the age at exposure makes a difference.  I do think that you should mention your x-ray exposure to a doctor when you're having a breast exam.  A doctor who specializes in breast health, even an ob-gyn, should be able to put this into context for you. But, from my reading of the article, I think it supports what Barbe and Linda said -- your exposure to diagnostic x-rays for one infection is probably not the kind of exposure that puts you in a higher risk category for breast cancer. Best, Ann",

The biggest problem in NYC, which is a problem everywhere, is supply -- which is usually lowest in the summer.  You could certainly ask friends and family to donate for you -- especially if you have an unusual blood type -- it's also generous to just donate to the Blood Center on general principle.  The NYBC charges a fee and requires a doctor's prescription/plan for \"autologous or directed donation\" -- and they also say \"there is no evidence that blood from donors selected by patients is safer than blood from the volunteer blood supply.\" Anyway -- they are excellent, in my experience.  They were in the forefront of safety with regard to AIDS/HIV, way out in front in that field. The American Red Cross has been having some trouble with their blood banking lately (as in this story from last week's New York Times, which prompted this letter from the head of the NYBC suggesting the ARC might do better to break up its Blood Bank division into, say, 5 autonomous smaller regional units...).",

I too am a little confused about your dx; as Cheryl Rubie said,  <1 cm with no affected nodes would appear to be Stage I.  Where I differ with CherylRubie is that I don't think Grade 2 automatically means you should have radiation.  As far as I know, Grade 2 is intermediate, Grade 3 would be more likely aggressive. Radiation has been standard with lumpectomy, but there are studies ongoing to evaluate results of lumpectomy without rads for early-stage BC. On the other hand, women with lupus who have more advanced BC have undergone rads successfully. RubyTuesday is right -- ask for all your pathology reports, and get a second opinion.  Also -- do you see a rheumatologist regularly for your lupus?  This might also be someone with experience and helpful opinions, who has seen other SLE patients treated for cancer, and might have a recommendation for an oncologist who \"works and plays well\" with your rheumatologist!",

The specific reason I'm writing is to ask if your Mom has been paying for any supplemental insurance or is enrolled in any Medicare HMO -- because I had the experience of looking into that stuff for my Mom when she could no longer live by herself, and moved closer to one of my sisters -- it was an in-state move, but to a county that wasn't covered by her existing HMO -- changing everything just took more research and time than we expected.  Both the county she moved from and the county she moved to had helpful info about this -- maybe Las Vegas/Clark County does too? [ http://www.nvaging.net/medicare.htm ]  Of course, if your Mom is just using plain old Medicare (\"Original\" Medicare Plans A, B and D), then this probably won't be an issue.",

It was not a terribly big deal... BUT... don't let anybody push you beyond your endurance.  I had a horrible boss at the time, a woman physician, who thought if you were able to sit up, you were able to sit up and work for her for 24 hours straight.  I had the biopsy on a Friday morning -- she was upset that I didn't come to work on Friday afternoon! -- and I didn't take any other time off.  I was expected to continue 10-hour days, and compelled to do an all-nighter on a grant deadline 2 weeks after biopsy, and I developed a painful seroma (collection of fluid under the incision). So -- I'm saying it's not a huge deal -- but don't let that fact allow people around you to treat you like it's NOTHING, either!

Maybe direct assistance to individuals isn't part of the mission of Susan G. Komen for the Cure.  Okay. But obviously, direct assistance to individuals is needed! For some, including some people in need, some people raising funds and some people donating funds, direct assistance to individuals may currently hold higher priority than research or \"raising public awareness.\" That's their right, to make that judgment! There are other foundations that both fund research AND provide a lot of direct assistance to individuals.  The SLE Foundation of New York not only funds research (extensively) but maintains an office that provides all kinds of direct assistance to people (mostly women) with lupus -- referrals, education, and a program of emergency financial assistance -- with forms to fill out, and documentation from physicians required, it doesn't seem they have a problem determining who has a valid need. I understand the frustration of those for whom the local Komen affiliate is the \"only game in town\" -- and in their town the local affiliate doesn't provide much in the way of direct help, whereas other local chapters do. There is an unmet need. ",

Avoid accumulating funds that could be used for current program activities. To meet this standard, the charity's unrestricted net assets available for use should not be more than three times the size of the past year's expenses or three times the size of the current year's budget, whichever is higher.\" It looked to me that the year's expenses were $1,083,099 (including about a quarter million each in payroll and in printed materials) but they retained unrestricted net assets of $3,410,748. I guess that's just slightly over 3 times the expenses -- but the expenses don't seem to have all that much to do with providing wigs!",

I do think I'm extra-sensitive bordering on jumpy.  Or maybe everybody is this sensitive but the people with needles like to act like I'm crazy!?  I had an MRI-guided biopsy, and the doctor told me not to move and then injected my breast with a needle that I didn't see coming -- and my body involuntarily jerked 2 inches off the MRI table -- the doc was furious!  I thought that was nuts of her.  No one ever told me about numbing cream, but for every breast injection after that MRI (including injection of the dye for the sentinel node biopsy or SNB) I asked the person with the needle to lay the point of the needle on my skin and then wait for me to say \"okay\" before pushing it in.  This way my body was prepared and didn't fly off the chair, bed or table.  I don't know if this would help you -- but it has helped me a lot, since for me it's not my brain but my body that goes nuts when hit by an intense sensation (er, pain!) that it was unprepared for. I would echo what Sally and Deb said: tell all your doctors and their nurses/assistants how you feel about needles and procedures.  Maybe one of them might even refer you to a behavioral therapist -- the kind who help people through other phobias, using desensitizing techniques?  Maybe you won't have the time for this, but some medical centers now have \"prepare for surgery -- heal faster\" relaxation and stress-reduction classes, and might be enlightened enough to have someone on staff who knows techniques to help desensitize people to their phobias. About people bursting into tears -- that is a tough one.  I only had two of those (one of my sisters, one of my best friends), but two was enough -- made me wary about when and how I told people, and who I told -- I didn't want to have to worry about drying any MORE tears.  I hope you have one person around you who is saying \"I won't let anything bad happen to you, I'll make sure you're okay\" -- my boyfriend said that and it was wonderful.  We both knew it was kind of \"magical thinking\" -- but it worked its magic!  I love him for not letting on that he was scared.  I know he WAS scared, but he really knew to keep it under wraps and just tell me everything would be okay. If you don't have someone saying that -- maybe there is someone who will \"obey\" you and say it once you tell them to say it!  And then they can help you with the others who are crying.  You need someone to say \"we'll get through this.\"  Because you will. You will. (P.S. Oh yes, we had some drinks -- me & my boyfriend and a bottle of tequila...)",

You should be given more information about your cancer before consenting to a mastectomy.  You should not have to go into surgery wondering whether it will be lumpectomy or mast.  If you are having mast, you should have the opportunity to consult with a plastic surgeon beforehand and arrange for immediate reconstruction to be performed in the same procedure, if that's what you choose. I don't see any reason for such speed -- except possibly in the case of inflammatory BC, which your description doesn't really fit, and which is quite rare -- which would be all the more reason to see a breast specialist.",

Most places have a list of instructions that you take home with you after the procedure (how long before you can shower, what signs to watch for that you should call the doctor about, etc.).  I always think it would have been nice if they'd given out those instructions a week ahead of time so you'd have a better idea what was happening!

I think your husband may be on to something about just starting chemo in 2 days and not thinking about it until later. Did the first place recommend mast be done after chemo?  Then you really have time to weigh this. I would ask both your first and second opinion doctors their ideas of the following \"plan\": Since MRIs are known for false positives -- they find lots of suspicious areas, and an abnormal blood vessel can look especially suspicious -- I really don't see why a suspicious finding on MRI, with no further assessment, should prompt a mastectomy if you want to keep your breast.

(I myself had \"suspicious blood flow\" on an MRI that turned out to be benign -- they were checking my right breast after finding cancer in the left -- so I know this can be very worrisome, but can turn out to be benign.)

I also want to thank you for sharing the story of your son's recent birthday, with Olga at home with the cat in her lap, and your trip to Lake Placid which your boys were able to tell Olga about.  I'm sure these memories will shine like gold for your sons, forever, and it is so beautiful that you and Olga made these memories happen. I am wishing you strength in the days to come - if there are moments when the strength is not inside you, I hope you will be buoyed by family and friends.  You and Olga are such beautiful people and created such a beautiful family.  My heart breaks for you, and there's not more I can say, except that you and yours are in my thoughts.

I think you'll feel better being proactive with a doctor -- your friends (and us, and your DOCTORS!) can talk about what it MIGHT be, but I think you probably really want to find out what it really IS.  Odds are high that it is benign, and I think the best thing is to KNOW that it is benign.

You are completely right about how we don't creep around in silence about other diseases -- which is why I think this is about your husband not wanting to experience the feelings he is faced with, and not wanting to be \"seen\" feeling them -- maybe he also has some more generalized old-fashioned idea that people don't talk about diseases of the breast, uterus, prostate, etc. --   but I hope he's not the kind of guy who is too hung up on being the \"sole authority\" in his family -- if he isn't usually authoritarian, I think you can just keep gently asserting the way you see things and the way you need to do things.

[I had IDC diagnosed in left breast by excisional biopsy, for which I needed mastectomy, and they wanted to make sure what was going on in right breast -- if cancer, they would have done bilateral mast.  The right turned out B9 despite \"suspicious enhancement uptake kinetics.\"] It was like a regular MRI in that I lay face-down with my breasts hanging through little holes in the MRI table, and had contrast material injected by IV.  Then, the radiologist said, \"I'm going to inject a local anesthetic, you'll feel a little pinch, don't move\" and she jammed a needle into the side of my right breast and my whole body involuntarily jumped about 3 inches off the table!  The radiologist was really pissed at me!  And I, in turn, was pissed at her!  No numbing cream, no \"countdown\" to the injection, no hands on my back on the part of the TWO assistants alongside us!  That was the worst part for me, the anxiety over whether I still corresponded to the established \"grid\" after jumping -- frankly, 2 years later, I'm still not sure! -- and the doctor wondering out loud whether to quit the procedure and reschedule a week later, or forge ahead.  She forged ahead.  By then the anesthetic had taken effect, she put in some instrument that sounded like a dentist drill, got a big sample, I didn't feel any of this, there was a fair amount of bleeding and subsequent bruising, and I iced the hell out of my breast for the next two days, and wore a sports bra 24/7 for the next two weeks. In other words, to me, the most crucial part is before they anesthetize you for the procedure.  Ask for numbing cream, and what I have done ever since is ask the person with the needle to lay the tip of the needle to my skin, ask for my okay, and then count with me, \"3, 2, 1, IN\" -- this way I don't jump.  It is apparently essential that your body remain in the same \"grid\" mapped out by the MRI before the injection. Wishing you the best -- MRIs are hypersensitive and view as \"suspicious\" a lot of things that turn out to be benign.  Fingers crossed! Ann",

I'm a longtime poster (pre-BC) on jazz boards and politics boards that all have hands-on moderators.  On such boards, there are moderators observing closely.  This appeal has been going on for a while, and has been on the front page of the \"active conversations\" for days.  On the jazz/politics boards, moderators would have glanced at such a hot topic on day 1.  If it were a shady proposition, some action would have been taken BEFORE scores of members had gotten involved (the fact that scores of us have gotten involved ought to tell you this is no shady operation!!!!!). And I will say that on the jazz boards, there have always been notices posted of paypal accounts to contribute to an individual's medical bills (always a huge issue for self-employed professional musicians, among whom even those you might consider famous are just a missed tour away from financial ruin), or to group funds, or to support a cultural/educational project.  Ditto on the politics boards. And, to reiterate -- moderators on those boards are more of an interactive, instructive presence -- capable of distinguishing the scammers from the truehearted, and of helping the latter come into compliance with rules if there has been a misunderstanding, rather than tromping in well after the fact with a heavy hand.",

There is a clinical trial, the TAILORx Trial, going on right now to learn more about the risks and benefits of chemo versus \"no chemo\" for women whose Oncotype scores are between 11 and 25.  If your score is less than 11, you are assigned to take tamoxifen or an AI, and no chemo.  If your score is greater than 25, you are assigned to take chemo (followed by tamoxifen or an AI). If your score is from 11 through 25, you are randomly assigned to one of those two treatment regimens (tamoxifen or AI and no chemo; OR chemo followed by tamoxifen or AI). This trial started in 2006 and is scheduled to end in 2014.  If there was evidence that \"chemo does more harm than good\" in women with a score of 17, this trial would have to be stopped, or the protocol would have to be changed. Obviously, scores between 11 and 25 are in a classic \"gray area\" -- some women are almost literally \"rolling the dice\" by participating in a trial that chooses their treatment for them.  Others of us are making the best decision we can for ourselves.  I was 54, with a Grade 2 tumor, and a score of 16, and I chose \"no chemo.\"  But even at my age, a Grade 3 would have made me more concerned, and if on top of Grade 3 I had been 37, like Yunlee is, I am pretty sure I would have chosen chemo.",

He is \"Dr.\" Moss because he has a PhD in classics from Stanford. That's not to say he couldn't have learned a lot on his own by reading... but it's not a direction I would go in.  Plus, he claims that all conventional medicine/cancer treatment is driven by the profit motive... and yet, as you note, his own services are quite pricey. Ralph Moss worked at Sloan Kettering only from 1974 to 1977 (as he himself describes in this letter). For him to list that job so prominently among his credentials doesn't seem kosher to me. On the other hand, the medical establishment does seem to reach out to him for information about alternative treatments. Still, for myself, I would turn to someone with actual training in science/medicine, like Andrew Weil, for their thoughts on alternative therapies.",

In 1996, according to the World Health Organization, 3.5 women per 100,000 died of breast cancer per year in China, compared to 32.7 women per 100,000 per year in the U.S.  That difference is a factor of 10 -- not a factor of 1,000 as implied by Jane Plant's sentence above.  In 2004, the number of breast cancer deaths  in China had risen to 10 per 100,000 women per year -- compared to 30 deaths per 100,000 women per year in the U.S. -- a factor of 3. So it seems like Jane Plant's \"1 in 10,000\" is correct for China in 2004 -- but the \"1 in 10\" in Western countries is more like a lifetime incidence rate.  So it's mistaken and/or misleading (or even deceitful) of her to compare these numbers as if they're the same thing.  One in 10 (or 1 in 7) women in Western countries may be diagnosed with BC in their lifetimes (and more surveillance in Western countries may lead to higher diagnosis rates) -- but about 10 of 100,000 (1 in 10,000) women in China and 30 of 100,000 (3 in 1,000) women in the U.S. die of BC in a single year.",

To me, the logical first step would be genetic testing, and I hope you can get it. If you already KNOW your genetic information, or know that your mother had BRCA1 or BRCA2 -- then I think your doctors are being really dismissive. Maybe some women on this board who have had PBM will chime in -- I think most do NOT regret it. You might also find some helpful info on this website that is specifically for women with a family history of breast and ovarian cancer: http://www.facingourrisk.org/ Wishing you the best, Ann",

The breast surgeon (BS) may indeed order an ultrasound or MRI next -- or a fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy -- a good, experienced breast surgeon who specializes in breast cancer will go through diagnostic steps starting with the least invasive.  That type of breast surgeon is very often the \"team leader\" in arriving at a \"real diagnosis\" (which sometimes can't be established until a surgical biopsy is performed).  I agree -- breathe deeply -- I think it's far better for your OBGYN to err on the side of caution than to be dismissive -- and hopefully that is all this will turn out to be (erring on the side of caution).

I'm just saying this as an example that sometimes a medical condition really forces us to undergo treatments we would prefer not to have!  And sometimes that requires a bit of a stern \"talking-to\" on somebody's part! As I was early stage, not triple-negative, not HER2+, and had an Oncotype score of 16 at age 54, chemo was not recommended, and I didn't have it.  (I had the perhaps unusual experience that this worried some of my friends, because we'd had a mutual friend who refused chemo 10 years earlier and had died -- but I tried to explain to my friends that she had likely been TN or HER2+.) But PatMom's comment reminded me of a dear friend on BCO who died in 2009 -- she was in her mid-30s when dx'd with very small TN tumor, and was not given chemo by her onc at the time.  When mets were discovered a few years later, she was so outraged that she had been told chemo wasn't necessary at her initial dx.",

This may be a little off-topic, but I keep having this idea that someone should organize a voluntary study comparing the outcomes among women with similar stats (diagnostic, stage, grade, receptor type, age, weight, comorbidities, etc., etc.,) who voluntarily choose their preferred treatment.  (Is Susan Love's \"Army of Women\" doing anything like this?)  This would be an \"open-label, non-randomized, prospectively followed, case-matched, observational study\" -- comparing outcomes (including QOL and \"well-being\") at 5, 10, 15 years among women with similar dx and demographic stats who chose all-alternative, versus various chemo drugs/doses/timing regimens, versus AI-with-no chemo,  etc.  Everytime one of these threads gets going, I have this idea...  I think it could yield valuable data, and because individuals would be making their own treatment choices, it wouldn't be stymied by the safety issues of a randomized trial where people can't be assigned to treatments that are thought to have too much risk. Edited to add my apologies to PlantLover if I've been too OT.  I really appreciate everything you've said in this thread!",

I think more and more women are having sentinel node biopsy (SNB) instead of axillary dissection.  MaryLynn -- if your surgeon/hospital cannot provide SNB, can you go somewhere that does?  I agree that with a tumor <1 cm with no lympho-vascular invasion, you shouldn't have to have all armpit lymph nodes removed.  SNB is becoming more and more available, so maybe you can find a provider that will do simple mast plus SNB on the affected side? You can definitely change your mind about prophylactic mast on the right -- if you are having misgivings, you should heed them! (I am identifying with you, because I had .9 cm IDC in left breast, unclean margin after lumpectomy, then mastectomy with SNB of left, implant recon -- and kept the right breast, untouched.  Rather than removal of right breast -- can you get an MRI of the right breast, as Beesie recommended?  And if anything looks suspicious on MRI, biopsy it before consenting to bilateral mast?  That's what I did after cancer dx in left: MRI of right, biopsy of suspicious area, turned out to be B9, so kept the right breast.)",

If you want to speak to another doctor, I think that would be a great idea.  My recollection of starting tamoxifen is that my doctor told me to start with 10 mg every other day for a week (or two???), then 10 mg every day for a week, then 20 mg a day.  In fact, there seem to be reports that 10 mg/day or 10 mg every other day might be as effective as 20 mg/day to prevent recurrence. There is also the issue of genetic testing for the CYP2D6 alleles -- the gene that produces the liver enzyme CYP2D6, which is responsible for metabolizing tamoxifen into the active metabolite endoxifen, which is what provides the protection against BC.  About 7-10% of the population have two \"null\" alleles and are poor producers of CYP2D6 -- and therefore poor metabolizers of tamoxifen.  Apparently there is controversy about whether to test premenopausal women for this allele at all -- but if you are already having strong feelings about not taking tamoxifen, finding out how well your body metabolizes and uses this drug might be something you want to know. If you want me to send you some links about these studies, let me know. Hugs, Ann",

I have been trying to look up statistics for you, but most studies about tamoxifen are about Stages I and II.  What I found about Stage III women who already had mastectomy and chemo is a study in comparing tamoxifen-only versus tamoxifen plus radiation.  That study said, absolutely radiation reduces recurrence and increases survival, tamoxifen alone is not enough. An interesting study about patient use of the drug in the U.S. said women are more likely to continue taking tamoxifen if they feel included in the decision, feel they have enough input from their doctor, and are told about side effects in advance.  Women who don't get these things are more likely to stop taking tamoxifen. (Reminds me of an old Saturday Night Live Weekend Update joke: \"as reported in the medical journal 'Duh'!\"  )",

Sweetie, you are so loved.  And your boys need you.  And you know how often you have told OTHERS not to be ashamed of feeling scared and needing help. I hope you are finding someone to tell you that your despair is not reasonable.  It is a desperate feeling and I hope you are with some one who can put that feeling to sleep and awaken the feeling of gentle hope. I love you from reading your brilliant posts, without ever having met you or even having exchanged notes before!  Please come back!  Please know that your despair is cyclical and will pass -- your despair is a bootface, too!  Maybe the worst bootface of all.  You have a horrible cold, and you're having chemo. Please try to just bundle yourself up and take tiny, tiny steps.  Stay right here and right now.  Please don't run ahead looking for trouble!  I think the people at your job love you.  Everyone must be in awe of how hard you've been working.  Besides, there must be laws against firing people with cancer.  There are such laws in the U.S. and we're horribly backward that way!  And even if one bad prediction were to come true, it's not possible that no one else would employ you. Even though you don't know me, I'm sending hugs and prayers your way.  All the more so, I'm sure, from people you do know. You can be weak.  Let all the others who love you give back the strength you've expended on their behalf.",

The tumor genetics are different from a blood DNA test. The blood DNA test for the BRCA gene tells if you have a known BRCA mutation that puts you at risk for breast or ovarian cancer, that you inherited from your parents and can pass along to your kids. Tumor genetics include \"somatic\" mutations that happened in your \"body\" cells (not passed on through inheritance) to turn them into cancer cells.",

The night John Lennon was shot, one of the bands I was in had a gig scheduled, at the Mudd Club in NYC.  We were all in a daze, bands and clubgoers.  Terrible. Princess Di did die on a Saturday -- it was on the night-time news.  I was very upset -- I remember leaving the house and walking, it was a mild summer night -- just walking and walking. 9/11 -- I had a Dr.'s appointment at 9:45 AM at Broadway and 91st Street -- I live in lower Manhattan.  At around 9 AM I was waiting for a bus at First Avenue and Houston Street (NancyD knows where this is) and I saw a huge plume of smoke -- I thought \"that's a really big fire -- maybe it's in Chinatown\" -- I asked other people waiting for the bus if they knew what the fire was, but they didn't.  Then at 14th Street I got on the L train (subway from the East to the West side of Manhattan) and a woman who got on the train with me said \"Did you hear a plane flew into the World Trade Center?  A friend of mine works there and I hope he's okay.\"  At that point, I immediately thought some little private plane had a crazy accident -- she did too.  Then I switched from the L to the 2 or 3 train at 7th Avenue, and took the 2 uptown to 96th.  No talk of WTC.  But the minute I got off the subway uptown, chaos.  People saying a SECOND plane, and these were both jumbo jets.  Oh my God.  I get to my doctor's office and he's freaking out too.  Just heard on the news about the Pentagon, and at that point news reports (later said to be mistaken) about car bombs in Washington, DC.  Brief doctor visit!  (My ex-husband had been given novocaine for a dental procedure in Brooklyn, in an office with a view of the WTC, and he and his dentist SAW the first plane hit the first tower.  They both freaked out and decided not to continue, even though his mouth was already numb.)  So, about 10:30, I'm heading back down to my job (17th Street and Second Ave) from Bdwy and 91st.  It's of course a gorgeous day.  Buses are crowded and I'm so freaked, I figure I'll walk for a while.  Streets are full of people gathered around, listening to news on radios from the open doors of parked cars, vans.  My plan is to walk to 72nd and get the subway -- but when I get there, the subway is shut down.  I keep walking down Broadway.  At about 56th Street -- the David Letterman theater -- huge TVs in the lobby window are showing the collapse of the towers!  I am completely freaked -- it looks so surreal -- for a minute I wonder if people are making some sick broadcast joke, or if it's a news simulation/speculation -- I say to the people standing around \"Did this really happen?\"  Yes.  Oh my God. Now I think, I'll get on a bus around Times Square or 42nd Street -- but when I get there, no VEHICLES are being allowed below 42nd Street.  Police officers are saying there are reports of bombs in subway tunnels, parked cars near WTC.  I keep walking.  Around 28th Street, I start smelling the smoke.  Acrid.  About 25th, we see a wave of people covered in ash.  Most of us walking downtown stare silently at the ashen people walking uptown.  I see one young woman, tiny, in her 20s, no shoes, looking freaked, covered in ash.  I ask her very gently if there is anything I can do to help her -- cash, water -- she says, no, she's been given water, she has reached a friend, she has a place to go, but she says in a voice that is trying not to cry or scream -- \"I could have died!  I thought I would die!\" But she is now near her friend's house and insists she'll be okay. So, soon I get to work -- a hospital at 17th and 2nd -- gurneys and IVs and nurses and doctors are lined up at the front entrance -- we're not a trauma center but specialize in non-life-threatening joint injuries -- apparently there had already been a first wave of people needing treatment -- but that was the most tragic thing, that there was never a second wave. Anyway, I get up to my desk -- lots of emails from family in Midwest, friends in Texas, etc. -- I tell them I'm okay.  Phone service is nearly nonexistent.  My son had just started his freshman year of college about 40 miles outside the city -- we finally spoke late in the afternoon -- he said school was called off for the next few days, but I told him to stay put for at least 24 hours. So at the end of the day I headed to my apartment, where I live alone, below 14th Street -- there were National Guardsmen on every corner -- you could only walk below 14th if you showed ID with a home address below 14th.  No vehicles allowed at all.  Just as I was walking home, there was a freakout of police vehicles rushing to Con Edison power plant at 14th and Ave C/D.  Some (false) bomb threat.  That one really got my heart rate up.  There were so many false alarms that day, and the next few days.  I still wonder about that: crazy people, malicious people, paranoid people, overanxious people?  Or part of the attacks? A woman in my building was a security guard at WTC -- she survived the 1993 bombing, and 9/11, thank God -- her two kids were in high school -- downtown -- at the time, and kind of ran all over the place freaking out trying to find her -- but fortunately the whole family was physically okay.  Financially -- well, the Red Cross was far stingier with security guards going without pay than they were with stockbrokers.  This is true, and I'll never understand it. Okay, that was longwinded... But someone on this board lived right near the WTC and a piece of falling plane and building crashed into her building...  I can't imagine.",
