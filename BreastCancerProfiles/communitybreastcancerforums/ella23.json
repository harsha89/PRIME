I've learned a ton from everyone here and can confidently say you're in the right place for encouragement, support and information. Just to share what my journey has looked like these past few weeks: I'm 38 and was initially told I had \"high grade\" bilateral IDC and DCIS. The IDC on my right side measured 3cm via mammo/ultrasound. A subsequent MRI showed what appears to be 8cm of a web of IDC and DCIS practically covering my entire breast. Like you, no node involvement apparent. I was referred to an MO who suggested neo-adjuvant chemo. My issues with that were: 1) my Ki67 score is 10. It's low; it means my cancer is not fast-growing. (My understanding is that chemo is most effective on fast-growing cancers.) 2) I am ER/PR+. I have been told that chemo is not as effective for my type of BS. (I know everyone's situation is different; this was a general statement made by my MO that is applicable to my situation.) 3) my oncotype score is unknown. Without the oncotype score, it's difficult to gauge how beneficial chemo will be for me. 4) yes, I'm \"young\" and the suspicious area is quite big; but that doesn't necessarily mean that I have a fast-growing, highly aggressive cancer. In addition to having fertility preservation concerns, my main concern is that I do not want to be over-treated for my BC...if it's not a sure thing that I need it (I don't have any node involvement; I'm not HER2+), or that my cancer will respond to it, I don't want it. I would rather wait until after surgery, when I have more info about what's going on inside my breasts, to make this decision. Chemo may be in my future, but by doing it after surgery rather than before gives me more information and more time. It's not a luxury everyone has but as my docs could not clearly justify why I \"need\" neoadjuvant chemo, I am taking this luxury of making this choice for myself. I share this to say, please don't be afraid to push your docs for explanations and answers. Make them justify all their recommendations with crystal-clear explanations. Then, get second opinions. I'm dizzy from all the docs I've been seeing lately but I'm so thankful for getting more than one opinion and can sleep better at night with the decisions I've made. Huge hugs, and best wishes :) -E.
