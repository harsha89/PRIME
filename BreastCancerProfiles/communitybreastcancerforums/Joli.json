I had radiation, no chemo. implant faired very well during rad. My rad oncologist researched studies for me/us prior to making the decision to proceed with rad & leave implant intact. Radiation is the gift that keeps on giving & so your skin may not heal well (ever!) after rad. So, if you want to keep your implants you may want to take your chances &/or have a tissue expander inserted prior to treatment. Best of luck!",
