Well, met with the onc. yesterday.  It turns out that my cancer is a 9/9 in terms of aggressiveness.  I have googled this, but cannot find any info on it. My onc. gave me a couple of options on chemo and I wanted to get your opinions.   I can do the AC-TH x 4 or TCH-H x 6.  I am leaning toward the AC-TH because it has a 3-4% higher success rate.  I know the dangers to my heart, but frankly I am worried about being alive 5 years from now vs. what will happen years from now with my heart.  I would like to live to a ripe old age.  The doc says if it comes back they cannot cure it.   I am 40 and have a 15 mo son.   Thanks in advance for your support.  ",
