    "Content": "Comper68 wrote: I am 41 years old and a little over 7 weeks out from a total hysterectomy.  I had everything removed due to heavy bleeding.  I am still hurting and suffering with sudden onset menopause.  The path report from my hysterectomy showed endometriosis, andemyosis, ovarian cysts, adhesions, an andefibroma in one of my ovaries and mild chronic cervicits.  All of that was a major shocker as we did not expect it at all.  At my 6 week check up my GYN sent me for my first mammo.  It came back suspicous so I need follow up tests.  More mammo pictures and an ultrasound of both breasts.  The ultrasound comes back with a 1.5 cm mass in my left breast.  I saw the nurse at the Breast Center at my clinic today and she went over the results of the ultrasound with me.  The ultrasound is suspicous for malignacy, some of what they are seeing are bad signs that it is malignant (there are a couple of good signs also).  I am scheduled for a biopsy on the 21st.   I am so freaked out right now.  With dealing with healing still from surgery and sudden onset menopause, then add this  -  I want drugs and I want them now!!!  On top of all of this I get migraines.  I have a family history of various types of cancers so I am feeling doomed rights now.  I just started back to work this week after beeing out now this - sigh.
