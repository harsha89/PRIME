Since birth my life has been one trial after another and now this. I don't want to be a quitter, and i don't want to dissappoint my God, but I'm tired of fighting at every turn. I'm just so tired, emotionally and physically. I'm ready to let go and move on to a better promise than what we have here. Where life is not one trial after another, one let down after another. I'm just not prepare for another crises. All my hope has been sucked out of me and i don't know where I misplaced it. Karen Log in to post a reply",
