Had a lumpectomy oct. 30th.Â Hopefully no chemo.Â  Just radiation. I am stage 1 took out 4 lymph nodes.Â  The tumor was 1.72Â  You areÂ in the the right place.. This web site is VERY helpful, very reassuring. It has a lot of information for all yourÂ  questions. I became little over whelmed. BUT, I am fine. I am positive I will be fine.Â  I will do what ever it takes. Tuesday I get the reults from my octontype dx test. It took two weeks to get. This test will tell weather the BC can reoccur and what grade level will depend on chemo or no chemo. You hang in there, KEEP positive. We are all here for you. Good luck!!!!",
