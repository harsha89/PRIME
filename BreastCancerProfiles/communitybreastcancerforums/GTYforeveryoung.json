When it starts I am going to have a shaving party with my girlfriends.  Someone said that since I am just on 4 doses of TC every 3 weeks it may not fall out.  That would be great but I am mentally preparing for the worst and if it doesn't I will pleasantly surprised.  I usually get it highlighted and am due for a touch up but I don't want to spend the $$$$ if it is going to fall out soon!  Know what I mean?  Anyway, has anyone NOT had their hair fall out?  I am not good at all this waiting!  Thanks in advance for sharing.
