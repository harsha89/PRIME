I'm not a \"heavy\" tanner, but I do like to keep some color throughout the year. I gave up the tanning beds during my treatments, gave the area a couple of weeks to recover/heal and then gradually eased my way back to some color again. From working in the medical field, I've learned physicians, generally, aren't going to promote the use of tanning beds... especially to us, cancer patients. However, I find it a means of therapy for my personal treatment plan in order to regain some positive self image with a little \"shine\" after all this has done to me. I would appreciate anyone's input on their experience with changes in their breasts after radiation in conjunction with the tanning process. After surgery, the radiated breast seemed to be larger than the other. However, I'm concerned that the tanning sessions cause my breast to become more enlarged (which has me a little worried). I'm hesitant to ask a professional for fear they will tell me I should quit tanning. I've read/heard that both enlarged and smaller breasts can occur after surgery and radiation but I don't know if my \"bad\" habits are making this situation worse. Any comments?",
