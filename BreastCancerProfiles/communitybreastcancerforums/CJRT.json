I'm going to try to enjoy mine before having to go in for my next treatment Wednesday. I'm also hoping to shake a cold I picked up from my daughter so that my treatment isn't delayed.",

I did 3/6 of my carbo, taxotere, herceptin cycles and had really bad side effects.  My onc. and the tumor board recommended sandwiching my surgery in the middle of the chemo to give my body a break. Fortunately I had a great clinical response to the chemo (no more invasive cancer!).  I opted to go aggressive with the surgery and had a NSBMX the beginning of December and will now be returning for the remainder of my chemo starting 1/4. I am hoping that the break will help my body be better able to face the chemo, since I had started the initial chemo when my body was still recovering from delivering my baby boy.    I learned a lot thus far along the way but the biggest tip I can offer is to hydrate.  I learned the hard way that I just didn't drink enough for my initial cycle, so I now go for fluid infusions and that has helped tremendously. I wish everyone the best of luck and know what a wonderful support my Sept. start ladies have been to me.",

Aloxi is the standard one given on chemo day in the IV prior to the treatment. From what the chemo nurses told me, it's supposed to last as long as 3 days.  However, I was told to start taking my prn ones as soon as the night of chemo or following morning.  My oncologist also recommended Florastar priobiotic tablets, which you can get OTC at most pharmacies, to deal with heartburn, constipation, or diarrhea.",

I felt a physical response to even driving in the vicinity of the chemo center this weekend on the way to a park with my kids.  I cannot think about eating this kind of chicken that I ate a lot during chemo - not because of the nausea but because it reminds me of chemo. We were planning to sell our house anyway, but I feel like I cannot get rid of my bedroom quickly enough because it reminds me of days spent in bed with chemo. I talked to a survivor that burned the outfit she used to wear all the time to chemo.I wonder how long we will carry this since the \"trauma\" is more ongoing, rather than a discrete episode. ",

I know several people who have shaved their heads. I just cut mine short and let it fall out on its own. I buzzed what was left a month or so later.

      "Content": "Jan 30, 2015 08:51AM - edited Jan 30, 2015 08:52AM by CJRT I've been in Kadcyla/TDM1 since March of 2013 for a bone met and one metastatic node. As of May of 2013, the only think picked up on scans was the metastatic node, which lingered for a long time but is now less than 8 mm with a low enough uptake value that it is now considered \"inflammatory.\" My tumor markers have been in the normal range since about 3 months after starting Kadcyla. Though my liver enzymes might dance right around the threshold of the high range at times, they are typically normal, and though my platelets occasionally drop, they have never been a cause of clinical concern. I was never given premeds. I cannot recall the specifics of my first infusion, as I had a surgery two days following it. However, since that time, my SE's are fairly predictable. The first night after my infusion I feel drained and a tiny bit woozy. That night, I get a bit chilled. I do have difficulty sleeping for several nights and feel mild increase in inflammation (areas I had surgery, etc.) and experience some fluid retention. The day after the infusion I feel fatigued and sometimes a bit queasy. If I eat through it (like morning sickness), I feel better. I try not to schedule much, if anything, this day. By that evening, the nausea has passed. The following day I might still feel somewhat fatigued but still can manage my normal routine. I frequently get a migraine-like headache for 1-3 days starting around day 4. I have heard weird headaches are a common complaint with Kadcyla, and I even had a brain MRI at a certain point just to be safe. I get help with my 2 young children the day after the infusion, but generally maintain a very normal routine on this drug and an excellent quality of life. For me, it is a dramatic difference from how I fared on traditional chemo the first time around. Wishing all of you newcomers the best of luck with Kadcyla.",

Moni- I've been on Kadcyla for 2.5 years and haven't shifted my schedule much during that time. Nothing has been said about delaying it 4 or 5 days when it's fallen on thanksgiving or another long holiday weekend, but I know my MO would have issues with it being delayed more than a week. After the first infusion though, my administration time is only an hour (30 min infusion and 30 min observation) so I can usually do it at the start or end of the day if scheduling is an issue.Any possibility that they can do what's needed at another location? I once was able to arrange for a zoladex shot out of state. Took some legwork on my end, but perhaps it's an option if your MO doesn't want you waiting 7 weeks. Good luck!",

Nosebleeds are actually listed as side effects, though they are considered less common (10%-29%) according to what I found. chemocare.com/chemotherapy/dru... I've had them sporadically for the past two years, starting about 6 months after starting Kadcyla. Mine are coming from the front part of the nose and consequently attributed more to dryness and capillaries close to the surface, according to my ENT. I actually went to the ENT because I freaked out with the first nosebleed, since I had never had them in the past. He's not as familiar with Kadcyla but had said many patients report chronic runny nose with Herceptin, so it stands to reason patients might get that with Kadcyla, too. He said the chemo agent in Kadcyla might further dry things out, which is why he suggested the saline gel for prevention and the antibiotic ointment for when it is particularly inflamed.",

The irony of your story is that I came back here to see what others are saying about their nosebleeds because I have had one every day for the last 8 days and couldn't get an ENT appointment until Monday morning. I had one this morning and just wound up with a blood clot in my throat (which I've never had) and am very freaked. My bloodwork this week was fine, so my oncologist feels it's an issue for the ENT and not related to my counts. I never had a nosebleed before Kadcyla. I know this is a minor inconvenience, but it's hard not to get scared or frustrated with one more thing to deal with. Hope you get some sleep and the gum issues heals quickly.

He also said some people prefer to squirt it on a cotton ball and put the cotton ball into the end of the nostril and pinch onto the cotton ball. I've only done it twice and it seemed to work very quickly for me. Last night I had a light trickle, but it stopped without pressure. The watery eye thing is so weird to me!

My eye doctor says that it's chronic dry eye and some corneal abrasion that takes place when the eye gets too irritated from the dryness. My right eye always seems fine. About 6 weeks ago I gave in and finally started Restasis drops, which are very expensive, but I had gone through 2 rounds of steroid drops for the inflammation. I never made any connection to the nosebleeds. So strange!",

Pwilmarth and Denny already provided great information, so I will just add my personal experience. Because I was triple positive and was diagnosed with metastasis while on tamoxifen after having been early stage, I was put on kadcyla and was told I needed to shut down my ovaries. So I had zoladex shots for ovarian suppression until I had my oopherectomy. Because I was relatively young and my cancer was aggressive, we made the decision to target both the estrogen and HER2. I've be been kadcyla for 3 years and 9 months and have found it very manageable thus far. At this point, despite a stretch of NED, I will remain on active treatment indefinitely",

      "Content": "Apr 3, 2018 03:50AM - edited Apr 3, 2018 03:52AM by CJRT I realize this is a ridiculous complaint in the scheme of things, but I went from never having a cavity until cancer treatment to having one (or 4!) every time we take an X-ray. I get cleanings every 6 months and try to maintain better oral hygiene than I ever have in the past, but I still just found out I have a cavity that needs filling on a tooth that has a filling at the gum line from erosion. The dentist mentioned that I might need a crown if I have another issue with the tooth. I have to go back for a regular filling, which hopefully takes care of the issue. It's particularly annoying to me because I have to premedicate with antibiotics prior to dental cleaning/work. Anyone else have this problem and gotten any helpful recommendations to combat tooth issues? My chemo brain is blanking on the types of dentist that I read people on cancer treatment sometimes see- is it a biologic dentist? Chemo/radtioj/surgeries and I am tough but then almost left the dentist in tears.Any advice welcome!!",

I live on saline nasal gel and literally never blow my nose. I haven't taken anything with ibuprofen since my original cancer diagnosis over five years ago, so it's not anything related to that for me either. I've been on kadcyla for 3.5 years, and my first nosebleed was 6 months in. Originally I'd get them for 2-3 days every other cycle or so and never was severe enough for the ENT to do anything. About six months ago I started getting them nearly daily, and I then have had two cauterizations. I've had a couple stretches of 2-3 weeks without one, but I literally don't go anywhere without tissues and some Afrin (which ENT said would stop one quickly if I can't get it to stop).

I had just had a baby about 12 weeks before starting TCH at the time of my initial diagnosis and can tell you I got horrible hot flashes with the chemo and temporary cessation of my cycles.  (Not sure if this was the chemo or postpartum) My cycles returned after the chemo until I started Zoladex.  My hot flashes with Tamoxifen and Zoladex were much less in intensity and frequency that I had had on chemo. You have many more options related to the sexual side effects, as gritgirl mentioned. If the over the counter things don't help, I know a friend's MO prescribed her an estrogen cream and even discussed hormone therapies with her if the menopause symptoms remain and are problematic for her. My MO suggested over the counter Primrose Oil for hot flashes and low dose Effexor if it really bothered me.  Good luck on Kadcyla!  For me, it is a breeze compared to my TCH (Taxotere/Carbo/Herceptin).",

WAY easier for me than my Carbo, Taxotere, and Herceptin combo. It's also rather predictable to me when I'll be feeling queasy and fatigued, so I scheduled my days accordingly. I hope that Kadcyla brings you good results and that the side effects are very manageable.  Denny - I've intermittently gotten nosebleeds as well, despite blood counts not being overly concerning (platelets dip at times but have never dropped below 100). I went to an ENT twice, who was not concerned. He blames it on Kadcyla. I also have a runny nose much of the time...like a water-type drip. He recommended Azyr (sp?) saline gel to prevent it and using an antibiotic ointment in my affected nostril (always same side) twice a day for 7 days when the nosebleeds flair up.",

I'm so very sorry for all that you've been through recently!! I hope that you heal quickly and feel better emotionally now that you have a bit more freedom to get out of the house. I'm hoping you're feeling more comfortable and that your rehab is progressing well. Sending hugs! gramen- I get an itchy rash on my neck and back most infusion cycles. I have seen a dermatologist, my MO, and my RO...and all attributed to the Kadcyla. The dermatologist said I can alternate a topical steroid cream when it gets worse and also gave me an Rx for a topical antibiotic at one point because she said I had developed folliculitis because of the irritation.",

I have been on Kadcyla without any breaks since March of 2013....so a little over 70 infusions, if my math serves me ;). My PET scans have been clear for nearly the past 2 years. Generally this medication has allowed me a great quality of life. The night of the infusion I am a little light-headed, mildly achy, and chilled. The following day I feel a bit queasy and fatigued. I occasionally get a headache on the 4th or 5th day, and I frequently have a runny nose. I try not to schedule anything the day after the infusion, but otherwise haven't changed any activities. I have experienced some mildly elevated liver enzymes and low platelets. Otherwise, my primary complaint is my nosebleeds. They began about 6 months after starting Kadcyla, and I can get several in one week to then months without. The unpredictability of it is very stressful (and embarrassing), and although I'm very proactive about it (not blowing my nose, using saline gel, etc.), I still have to see the ENT once or twice a year for a cauterization. Hoping Kadcyla serves you well!!",

My MO and dermatologist say it's normal and are not the least bit concerned. I also get nosebleeds on Kadcyla and had found some rare bleeding condition that could have broken similar spots, along with nosebleeds, and mentioned it to my ENT (since apparently this rare disorder is usually first diagnosed by ENT's); he said I did not have the disorder and echoed the lack of concern of the other two doctors. My platelets also fall but not too low and don't stay there for too long. I've just added the red dots to the list of weird, innocuous issues I attribute to the Kadcyla. ;)",

One treatment center wanted to do nothing, another wanted surgery and radiation (difficult surgery with high potential for complications), and my own center suggested radiation alone before newer research suggested that as a viable option. Had one dose of SBRT with curative intent in April of 2015. The node no longer lit up on the 3 PET scans since I had it. Hope yours ls smooth and effective with little collateral damage!",
