I'm stressed, although my moods swing from reasonable to crazy. My Mom is a 2-time survivor, so one would think I could be a little more rational. Mom had two primary bcs, over 2 decade apart. Her mom, and her mom's mom were also bc survivors.  I'm in my early 40s now. Since I turned 30, my annual mammogram has been a gut-wrenching experience. I always wonder, \"Will this be the year?\" There's this sense of inevitability. So I had my routine mammo on Monday. Tuesday morning I got the dreaded callback. Tuesday afternoon I had a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. When the rad heard my family hx, she recommended an MRI. The family hx apparently tipped the scale from waiting 6 mo for another diagnostic to MRI. I had the MRI Thursday evening. When they injected the contrast dye, it was instant PAIN. I said, \"Is it supposed to hurt a lot,\" but as I finished the word a lot, they turned the machine on--I knew that part of the test would be 8 minutes. I had no idea if it was supposed to hurt, and I was afraid to hit the panic button to stop the test that the dr fought so hard to get, so I just concentrated on breathing in and out. What I found out once they got me out of the machine was that my vein blew out and the dye went into my arm. The tech feels that enough of the dye got into my breasts (based on the pictures that he saw; not all were developed), but the hospital assures me that they can repeat the procedure at no charge if the test isn't valid. They called twice the next day to check on me, and a doctor did see me immediately after the infiltration. I don't know if this is something that just happens or if they nicked my vein and caused it. I do know it was very painful, not intolerable, not passing-out type pain, but def pain. I was scared. My arm really swelled up. So now the waiting is prolonged. I don't even know if the test will come back as valid or if they'll have to repeat. If they repeat, it's another sleepless week of worry. I'm kind of angry about that part, but I'm not sure if it's fair to be angry. What's the most odd is the mood swings. Seriously, I go from sane, rational, and calm to a mess in less than a minute. I walk through the day terrified of the phone ringing. Crazy, I know. In my head it's game over, diagnosed. There's this little rational part of my brain that says that I don't know anything yet, but the anxiety and fear drown that voice out with some regularity. Then there's a part of me that says, \"I'm sick of living in fear, constantly worrying when it's going to catch up to me. Just bring it on already and let's get this over with.\" Are these normal feelings? Does everybody feel this way with the wildly fluctuating emotions? Are you exhausted but can't sleep?
