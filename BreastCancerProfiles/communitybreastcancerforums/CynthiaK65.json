Although i am not seeing any leakage, drainage or such - at times it feels like it is \"leaking\" and the other morning i awoke to find a spot of blood on my sheet where my breast lays (as i sleep on my stomach) So with all this i must say i am terrified - so i am hoping the doc tells me this is just a side effect of having to cut through the muscle in my armpit to remove the 2\" diameter swollen lymph node back in March.. but another part tells me... the swollen node was just a warning sign...",

So quick question - if these symptoms are combined with thickening of the skin at the nipple - why do they not test women sooner? especially if you have had one round of anitbiotics - would that not save more lives?

For all those out there following - i was first treated with Bactrim (2x day) - then Cephoflaxin (4x day = 2K mg) and now i am on Levaquin (1x day)... after brining up IBC and explaining how it differs from other cancers (yes i had to explain this - thank goodness for all the people who give their stories and accounts)  i received a call on Wednesday following my appointment from the Nurse stating the doctor had reached out to others in his profession and inquired about IBC - he was told send her for an MRI quickly - so i will go in for an MRI on Tuesday July 2nd. at 8:30am... so question - will an MRI showing anything? I had the thickening show on the mammogram.. but the radiologist just stated mastitis - thickening due to fluid retension... is there a difference in the appearance of thickening when caused from mastitis or IBC? or is it just seeing it and following through with more thorough testing that makes the diagnosis... i believe this is the experience of all experience (shy of the birth of my children and grandchildren) in my life.... hopefully we shall all learn something - patients will learn to be outspoken when the have a feeling of something wrong, doctors will learn to listen and learn from their patients.... and this terrible disease will at some point be diagnosed long before it becomes as advanced as it does currently before diagnosis and treatment. Thank you all for well wishes, your notes of encouragment - you hopes and your prayers and your support to not just me but all others who are researching this topic either because they have or may have IBC.

The redness fades (not so apparent first thing in the morning) and increases throughout the day - my breast continues to have stabbing pains and hurts to touch... my nipple at times appears to be trying to become erect - but then it will shrivel and become puckered and flush.. and as of this morning i noticed while looking at the underneath i have what appears to be tiny dark looking veins in such a large number my breast looks black (bruised)... i also have a sore spot under my left arm - a tiny knot that unless you were used to examining you would possibly miss. Is this dark coloration normal for cellulitis/mastitis or is this just one more thing i should share with my doctor?",
