I posted a few weeks ago that I had this come up a year ago and then it went away. Dr. was ready to send me to a specialist when it just got better on it's own. It came back over a month ago. Nothing stops the itch and it changes in color from purple to red, but it is in the exact same spot and pattern as one year ago. It started with a \"bite\" or what looked like a bite. I have thickened ridges underneath the area and sporadic pain in the breast and my breast is much bigger than the other (but I am still breastfeeding once a day). Your rash looks almost identical to mine, so I am very interested to find out what you find out!",
