About a week and a half ago, I started to notice some redness around my areola. I thought it was a normal hormonal thing. Both my breasts started itching suddenly last Saturday night (Oct 25th). They itch a lot during the day, and while I googled my symptoms immediately, I thought I was being crazy for worrying. (I used to get swollen lymph nodes around my neck and armpits all the time when I was a teenager, but I'm all clear right now.) I saw a doctor on Wednesday and she gave me some cream for the itching and we scheduled an ultrasound. I have been using the cream since Thursday night, and the itching has become more dull, but it still kind of comes and goes. My nipples seem to be a little more flat than usual, and the rash isn't flaky - just redness around the areola. There are deffinetely some palpable masses around my areola as well. No orange skin, hot breasts , or discharge, though. What should I ask when I get the ultrasound? I am very worried about IBC. I keep reading IBC is commonly misdiagnosed, so I'd want to push them as much as possible not to be neglectful and let me get a biopsy.  Anyway, any advice would be very much appreciated. Thanks everyone! Log in to post a reply",

On Friday, I started using Betaderm, which my GP prescribed. I don't think it has made a big dofference, if any. I started taking Reactine a few days ago as well. This has gotten rid of most of my symptoms. My breasts are less swollen and they don't feel warm during the day.  I had an ultrasound today, and while my GP even made a diagram of where my palpable masses were, the radiologist didn't find anything. She seemed to look thoroughly and for a while, as well. She told me to talk to my GP again if the masses reappeared in 2 months.  When I discuss the results with my GP, I will inquire about seeing a dermatologist. I'm guessing the next step would be tackling this as a skin problem.  Both my breasts are still itchy and I feel like the rash is spreading to the edges of my areolas slowly. However, I like to think I'm getting better! Thank you all for your support!",
