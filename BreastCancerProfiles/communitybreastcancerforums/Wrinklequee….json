She pulled up my report and could not find any wording in the report to worry about. She did not see the word \"atypical\" either, she said. She thinks the issue w/ wording is referring to what to do next. I am leaning towards a lumpectomy to just get it out of there so I don't go through all of this every 6 months, and stress as I am a HUGE worrier! She gave me a list of surgeons they work with to call for a consult. I'm thinking of calling next week and setting up the consultation. The mass was only 5mm, so I wonder if they will think that is too small to do anything with? I think your plan of the lumpectomy plus the special type of radiation sounds like a great way for you to go. :) I can feel your power, determination, and sense of peace down deep when I read your posts. :) I'm so glad I heard back from you. :) One thing I feel bad about is getting a dx of benign, while other new friends on this site did not get a similar dx. I find it hard to celebrate while others are having to walk a very different path. I wish everyone could hear those same words; benign. gypsyjo, thanks again for your reply, it gave me a smile! :) Wrinklequeen, P.S: Here's hugs & hopes, good wishes & prayers to everyone still waiting for their diagnosis, and also to everyone who is no longer waiting to hear. My thoughts and my heart are with all of you. All that is within all of us will help others summon the drive, determination, and sheer spirit that will carry you through this. Hundreds and hundreds of prayers are spoken, mumbled, or shouted every day for our new friends we have found here - and hopefully we can gain some strength from the prayers and well wishes from others on our part. Hugs & love to all of you...today, tomorrow, and always. :)",

I asked if I could see the report, and the Nurse said they didn't have it yet, but that was what the Breast Diagnostic Center said. She went on to say that the results said it was benign, and not cancer. So...what does this really mean? Anyone else ever heard this wording from a Nurse sharing the results before? I'm not sure if I should be guardedly happy, or just plain old HAPPY? :) Love & Hugs, Wrinklequeen",

      "Content": "Mar 7, 2015 08:49PM - edited Mar 7, 2015 09:22PM by Wrinklequeen ballet12, I'll hear from the Physicians Assistant, who the results go to, this week (hopefully) when her nurse calls me once she reviews my report. The nurse said it looks like the extra wording might have to do with what to do next - have a lumpectomy or watch and wait were options that were brought up. The nurse at the Breast Diagnostic Center, where the ultrasound & core biopsy were done, said I might want to get a consult w/ a breast surgeon to see what he thinks. When I asked if I should wait to hear from the Physicians Assistant she said no, thinking the appt would probably be a while out. She also said those Drs would have access to my report, so I didn't have to have the report in hand when I went for a consult. I have met with this Surgeon before, and I do trust his judgement. She wasn't surprised that I might just want to go ahead and get a lumpectomy so I don't continue to worry about it. (I thought a lumpectomy and an excisional biopsy are called the same thing, that's why I referred to it as an ex. biopsy.) I guess I figured when they take it out they'll biopsy it, I would think. ( I had a lumpectomy 20 years ago that turned out to be benign in the other breast.) I know I'll worry about it every 6 months before the mammo and ultrasounds that will be scheduled. Thanks for your response. It gave me something to think about. I guess I won't know everything until I see a copy of the report, or hear everything that is on the report. I looked online at the BD Center, but it's not posted yet. I'll wait to hear what the report says, and then see what the Physicians Assistant and the Surgeon both have to say about what the next step should be. Thanks again for sharing. As a newbie, my experience and wisdom is very limited. :) Hugs & Prayers to All, Wrinklequeen",
