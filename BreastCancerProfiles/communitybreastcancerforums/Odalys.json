I truly believe that the prayers & well wishes do work. Deb is doing a little better. We are spending quality time together. So it isn't all bad. She is tough. She is starting to have opinions on things, like IF we are going for another walk and where to. Normally, I would lose these arguments. Now she is just protesting. A very good sign! She also is eating well, laughs at me & gives kisses. She now knows my name and can identify our girls by their pictures (they are out of town). She is now using sentences again. So she is making improvement. We are all going to get through this stuff. We just have to keep the faith. Thanks for your support. John",

Posted in: Connecting With Others Who Have a Similar Diagnosis + Recurrence and Metastatic Disease, Created: Oct 23, 2008 02:15 am Alaska Deb Update Hi all- My side effects are very slowly getting better. I still communicate for shit....I will be talking along and the next word I want to say is just gone....a hole in the middle of my brain instead of a recipe I've made a hundred times. I have kept some little notes by my chair saying what I couldn't do at all last week that is easy enough to do this week, even though it is still full of mistakes. Tiny baby steps are really hard to measure when you see every stinking step of the progress. I was glad to see everyones notes. I was going to say something in person, but I am just too damn tired to do it tonight. I don't have to be anywhere in the morning, so maybe in the morning I will get a chance to come here and finish up.... Bugs and Fishes Deb",

I hope this helps.  Best of luck on your lumpectomy.  Hope all goes well.   ",
