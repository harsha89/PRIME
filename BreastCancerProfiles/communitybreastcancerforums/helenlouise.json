She gave me referrals and did an breast exam 08/12/17. On the 27/12/17 I find a lump :(. I was really surprised DR did not find the lump because she found my first (that I struggled to find even when I knew it was there!!). So used the referral early to get mammogram and ultrasound completed. I knew I would next see GP for referral for biopsies. Scheduled for core biopsy of 12mm lump adjacent to scar from lumpectomies (2013) and fine needle aspiration for suspicious axilla node, which has become palpable since the scans. I don't know if it is psychosomatic but my arm is sore on occasion and tingly. My breast has been increasingly sore since the initial surgeries. I have thought over the last few months my arthritis is really giving me hell in both my back and hips but now I am worried about bone metastases. If both biopsies are positive for cancer cells, would the normal path be to do scan/s (CT, PET or MRI) to check for cancer elsewhere in my body before mastectomy? Can I ask for additional tests before mastectomy? Having had radiation already, it won't be an option again on this breast. I realise no one here can really predict the answer to these questions but would be interested to hear from any one who had breast and lymph nodes positive from scans and what happened next. 2013 DCIS treatment lumpectomy x2 plus radiation. 2018 new IDC treatment Neo adjuvant chemotherapy.

Scans all clear with the exception of lesions in liver that are not suspected as cancer. I agree the lung nodules are something else. The FEC-D regime is a heavy dose of chemo. My oncologist told me we are going to hit this hard and breast care nurse said the same - using the big gun! I think the comment about not going straight to FEC-D means if your wife had mestateses further afield e.g. in lung the diagnosis would be stage IV then treatment becomes palliative. Aggressive chemo would not be be the best choice first up. My stage is 2b with lymph node involvement triple negative. My tumour is small but because of triple neg and the node the chosen regime is FEC-D. It appears FEC-D is not a commonly used regime in the USA... Re lung nods is aquestion for your next consult just so you are clear. I have found myself with many follow up questions and keep a book to write then down. PS. Yesterday day one I felt YUK, headache and waves of naesea, slept on and off with several periods of wakefulness but this morning so far slight heache but that's it. Mind you I haven't gotten out of bed yet! Wishing your wife and you good luck on FEC-D. Love to hear how it goes.... Helen.",

Anyway it took radiography with a needle to get the seroma depleted so the radiation was still accurate. Not to mention the pressure of the fluid buildup. If you are uncomfortable make sure they take the fluid out asap. Recently I have have developed skin Mets that required a surgical biopsy for confirmation of cancer typeand from that procedure the wound has not healed completely because my body is reacting and exuding fluid. If they seal the wound I will get another seroma. So caught between seroma and healing wound I desperately want to heal.
