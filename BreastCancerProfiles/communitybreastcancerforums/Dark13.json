Has any body have this the of initial result....what does it mean.? My mom had one of her breasts removed not sure if it was breast cancer or if she found a lump and had it remove as a precautionary measure. I was young at the time and can't remember the details...She did live a long full life. I am anxious and like you I feel like it has spread to my vagina cause its itching like hell..I don't have any pain in the lump or fluid discharge from nipples etc I am worried about health care as in my country it is not always the best. I am not even sure how I feel about telling people (friend/family) about my feeling or what I am going through. Any hoo thanks for all the comments here glad to know I am not alone. Looking forward to your comments.",

What did help was I placed a hot water bottle wrapped in a towel on my stomach and curled into the fetal position. It only happened the one day. The next day I felt so exhausted I couldnt go to work. I hope you are feeling better today. Warm hug for you. Tomorrow is the start of AC#4 and because I know that the taste buds are going into hiding I over did it today ate too much junk. Now i'm laying in bad feeling guilty and over stuffed. Is there anybody who have had a mastectomy and not done reconstruction??? I want to know how is your scar healing. I am stll tight /stiff in the chest wall area dafter 4mths and I do exercise my arm. I do not have any lymphodema, don't feel any cording but I do feel some tingling in my upper arm area. Not sure if my bra is too tight. Not sure if I should massage the area....any thoughts on this will be appreciated. @Laminder-I too am not to sure when to the call the Onc but I make sure and tell my hubby my SE so if anythi g happens at least he can explain if i'm out of it. So if the bad feeling persist call don't hesitate after all its new to us and pls tell someone how you feel as a back up. @sswp, Daniz, Kayakmom, Laura how you doing?

I am so fatigued by 3:00pm that i am literally dragging to get to the transport terminal. This week the tiredness combined with the heat caused a blackout thank God i didn't fall to the ground 2 ladies in the bus line managed to catch and put me to sit down. It was surreal one minute I was standing next minute I was sinking. Anyway no injuries thank God. Well I have gained 10lbs since starting Taxol so I figure its a 1lb per treatment so I have 3 more to put on. My ONC nurse said that as soon as I stop the steriods the weight will drop off. Hope she is right. Right now I feel like HULK all the weight are in my arms and shoulders most of my tops/blouses are tight and I refuse to buy anything new so I have been wearing the same clothes to work I just refer to them now as my uniforms. I still have rads so I am looking forward to hear from you ladies who have started rads what to expect. Frankly I can't wait to finish with it all...at the end I will be going to New York with my girlfriends, then a Caribbean cruise with the hubby just to show my gratitude and appreciation for all his support. He is really taking good care of me. I could not have made it this far were it not for my faith in God, and my family. Hopefully we get a family trip to Mexico next year. Lots of financial shimmieing to make it all happen. But one thing this experience has thought me is not to wait, u wanna do something just do it cause u could be dead in the morning.

Lol I am 50yrs old and BC Tripple Negative, left side mastectomy. I have had 2 rounds of AC chemo so far. 2 more to go then 12 weeks of Taxol. Here is an update on my treatment so far. 13 December 2017 Chemotheraphy Begins - 4cycles (1 every 14 days) medicine received to take at home Nexium, Kyril, Dexamethasone, Zarzio (5injections) 1st Round of Chemo I got up exercised and went to the Clinic. Met with the patient advisor after speaking with her and voicing my fears I was definitely calmer as she explained everything. Met with the doctor who explained everything again took my vitals and then it was off to the Chemo Chair. The Chemo nurse seemed to be very experienced and was very clear in identifying everything that she was administering.The experience was not as bad as I expected in terms of pain and adverse reaction to the medicine. It's day 2 and we'll see how it goes today. Again day 2 was not as bad as I expected. I felt nauseous but did not throw up in that regard the meds worked fine. I had to go back to the clinic to be shown how to inject myself, another aspect of the treatment. Thank God hubby was there cause I can't inject myself. He did it for the 5 days and it was tolerable. Day 3 I got my meds screwed up and I forgot to take a pill ooooh the pain was excruciating. Day 4 was a horrible day too but I managed to go thru that in a daze. I was nauseous and feeling the need to vomit all day but I didn't. Had some trouble sleeping though. Day 5 started to feel a lil better all medicine done so its time to get the blood counts back up was able to eat normally. Day 6 thru 14 was feeling more energetic except for day 8/-9 I think a wave of tiredness hit me whew just had to rest completely other than that I was fine. I exercised every other day throughout the cycle. Noticed that my hair started falling out ever so slightly going to cut it even shorter. I don't stress over the hair I have had my hair short for years right now its full of peroxide caused i decided to be a blonde its already weak so this falling out is only inevitable. I wear wigs all the time so thats not new to me either. Waiting to see if i'll loose my eyelashes and brows now that is going to be epic. Lessons learned 1. Pray all the time. 1a. Don't forget to take your pills on time 2. Drink lots of water in the 1st 5 days to flush that chemo liquid out and help your kidneys 3. Exercise as much as you can 4. Try to eat more vegetables and fruit. Drink lots of fruit and vegetable smoothes orr punches as you can.(beet, pumpkin, carrots, kale, cucumbers, lettuce, apple, pawpaw, water melon etc) 5. Drinking milk based drinks is really working for me. Water not so much been drinking grape gatorade. Really struggling with what to eat any help here will be appreciated. 29th Dec 2017 -2nd Round Chemo Must do a CBC blood test before every round of Chemo. I got up exercised and went to the Clinic. Got my needle inserted into my port and its off to the chemo chair. Everything ran smoothly. This day its not to bad you feel a bit out of sorts cause after all something foreign is in your body but generally I am are able to go about the days business as usual. Guess its the steroids. Today I felt a bid tired after the process. Day 2 was not bad made sure to take all my meds on time. Day 3/4 is usually my rough days will let you know how that went in my next post. My salivary glands are working overtime reminds me of when I was pregnant urghhhhh. Stay strong. We can do this. I am strong because you all are strong. Your comments, responses and encouragement gives me the strength to get thru this. God + You are a winning team. Thank you. Hugs & kisses. Dark13 ",

Drinking tons of water have improved my skin somewhat in the face area but my feet are dry as chips and peeling the soles turned black they look horrendous. I am not icing just moisturing and soaking them weekly. The upside is there is no nausea, no metal mouth and I can eat basically anything. I try to exercise 5/6 times a week for 1/2hr I have found that this has helped with my general well being. My hair has started growing back and its completely gray I don't know what happened to the black either way I am going with the flow. I had my hair platinum b4 so its no biggie i'm a free spirit when it comes to hair I switch it up all the time. Eyebrows still sparse but the pencil works.lol. I have not gained any weight even though I feel like i'm eating more my appetite is insatiable. Well ladies the light at the end of the tunnel is getting closer.

I have completed my chemo and radiation my doctor told me to go live my life don't worry or take on too much as stress is not good for me. I have to return in Dec to do some tests which starts the new baseline for monitoring going foward. Everything has healed up nicely. My skin is finally returning to it's colour, my fingernails have grown out but the toenails is taking it's time still dark and looking a mess. My eyelashes and brows have grown back. My hair is growing but i've decided to maintain it in a short style so its good. The neuropathy in my feet is still there but not as bad as before so I'm working with it. Got some compression socks which seems to help. How long does it take for the radiation site to heal up? My radiation has been completed about 3mths and the area still feel hot to me. Has anybody experience this? Maybe its in my head....sigh Right now I am exercising and trying to eat right, organic foods are costly. I have not juiced in awhile and i'm missing it but it's hard to keep up. It seems like everyday there is something on social media with these food manufactures and syntethic stuff in foods that are killing people slowly you have to be so careful. I am also on the hunt for a real strapless bra with pockets for a breast form. Not those Coobie uniboob tube top type bras. I tried them and its a big no for me. I really want to be able to wear my strapless and off shoulder clothing again. Can anybody recommend a strapless bra? Anyway have a great week folks.

When you think it about so any people do not make it but God has chosen to let me live so I have decided to live each day without reservation. B4 diagnosis I use to always worry about how my family would cope if something drastic were to happen. I got sick, I had surgery, lost all my hair etc and you know what, I saw they coped very well. Yes they were worried but everybody stepped up and took up responsibilities. Everything got done.What I learnt was that they would cope because life goes on. If I am not around life goes on. They have to continue to be... So now I try not to worry about stuff I just do/fix what I could and just let the rest be. My whole perspective on what is important has changed. I still have neuropathy in my feet but hell I love high heel pumps...the neuropathy hurts and wearing the heel hurts....anyhow I swing it is pain so if on a given day I feel to wear heels I do it (lol) I just bear my pain and keep it moving. When I get home I just soak, rub, & elevate. I try not to let thoughts of recurrence enter my mind space. I try not to entertain negative people, or those who always have a remedy or cure for me to try. Even tough there intentions might be good. I try to eat right as best as I could some days I feel for chocolate and ice cream and I have it. Everything in moderation. In my mind, I am completely healed and I live to reflect that. I truly believe that God is still in the miracle working business and he has healed my completely. I claim it and give him thanks everyday. That's how I cope, its the only way I know how to cope.

Well I have been enjoying the break between my last AC and the start of my 1st of 12 Taxol ....it seem like an eternity but I cycle at a time as per usual. I had 3weeks of bliss feeling normal rocking my bald head and jus chilling out at the house. #4 AC overall was not bad for me at all I did not get metal mouth, I did not get that constant feeling of wanting to vomit without it actually happening, did not get the headaches, no wring pain in my stomach, did not feel like my lady parts wanted to fall out. The worsevpart was taking the injection everyday...urghhhh!!!! What I did get was an enormous appetite I was hungry and thirsty all the damn time. Before I could not stand the taste of water now I have been chugging down about 4-6 400ml btls a day since each bottle represent a glass I am trying to get to 10btls per day but its a struggle. I did feel tired tho' and my skin got very, very dry and flaky 3 of my fingernail beds turned black. In prep for the Taxol I went on a 'WeeklyTaxol Thread' and the amount of SEs that are mentioned have me in a state of dread. I had to come here to get some strength and encouragement. Reading all those posts have messed with my mind. Right now I am trying to get back to my centre and focus repeating my mantra: ....1 cycle at a time.....I can do this.....I rebuke all SE in the matchless name of Jesus.....I claim my healing in Jesus name Amen.... Danzi, mjb, Ejean,Hariry ...hope by now you all are feeling plenty better. Swewing, Diveslikeagirl...thanks for the list and website I really wish my ONC had told me about the B6 etc I would having been taking it already sometimes these doctors really raises my ire. Swewing, GenevaC...hope you gals are feeling better seems u 2 are the 1st out the gates on the Taxol track I wish we could get a list of all the symptoms and the possible treatments. Keep us posted. Ejean...I have changed my lifestyle a lot since my diagnosis this is what I have maintained... I was never a snacker so I do not snack in between meals. I have recently stopped drinking milk again (I started drinking milk after many years during AC because it was the only thing that I could have kept down during the metal mouth days not sure whats going to happen during Taxol), I drink a lot of green tea and I basically eat meat once a week. I eat lots of eggs and peas. I exercise every other day whether feeling good or bad. On the good days for 30mins. On my bad days during chemo I did it for 15mins on the days that I had the strength. The new stuff...started eating lots of fruits, nuts and veges (spinach, dasheen bush, cassava, sweet potatoes, plantains, cucumbers, watercress, tomatoes, carrots, watermelon, pawpaw, pineapples, almond nuts, chickpeas, coconut water etc.) I live in the Caribbean so basically whatever is in season, its readily available. I have started juicing mainly beets, carrot and pumpkins and drink this about 3days a week. I still cannot tolerate limes or ginger. Started drinking lots of grape gatorade (one of my subs for water on the bad days) I have cut back on my sugar intake not too much sweets (e.g.cakes, ice cream, chocolate) I do have an occasional pastry. I am trying to cut back on the white rice and breads, trying to drink more water....but its a struggle. I plan to incorporate more natural or herb related items after treatment is finished as I truly belive you are what you eat. I also read that soursop/graviola is good for persons with BC so I am going to incorporate this after the treatment is finished as it can affect the effectiveness of some chemo drugs and there are some side effects. I think you all should look into this as there have been some studies done regarding this. My weakness is I like my drinks juices etc to be sweet so finding an appropriate sweetner has been a challenge I am currently using Agave. (Any other suggestions will be appreciated) I was going to switch to honey but read in the Taxol thread that this is a no no with Taxol so I will make the switch after treatment. I find that knowing what to eat is a struggle damn I can only eat and drink so much veges I get fed up of it...the endless salads etc soooo boring....I feel like i'm eating grass all the time...lol..... but its about my life so i'm pushing thru I guess that's why its called a life style change...lol Stay strong my lovelies.....\"the race is not for the swiftest but for those who endure to the end\"....We Can Do This......1 Cycle at a time.....

I have no vomitting, no nausea, there are times like the day after when I go to the bathroom to poop but its not like diarreah. There are times when my mouth tingle but there no metal taste like the chemo. There is some tiredness but not like the chemo meaning I am not dragging about...and I am eating like ah damn horse.üòä Danzi- the key is to take your premeds 'as prescribed' don't miss it, and don't mix it up...Try not to freak out. By now you should be feeling pretty good due to the 3wks break. Here are the positives - The Taxol infusion time for me is shorter than the chemo.l I find that I am very hungry. I can basically eat anything and not feel bad..that damn premed steroid...I dread putting on weight. Just today I made a conscious decision not to eat anything after 6:00pm hope that don't screw up my blood count. Right now i'm a slim 145lbs at the rate i'm going by Taxol #12 i'm going to be a heffer üòä. So far there has been no neuropathy. Thank God...Once you are feeling well try to keep active and hydrated. At the moment I can tolerate water but I am still drinking my gatorade..The negatives are a slight fever, hot/cold flashes (not sure if i'm going into menopause with this oneüòØ) flatulence and peeing more than usual. It has been manageable. YOU CAN DO THIS THE WORST i.e CHEMO IS OVER...YOU DID IT, THAT PART IS DONE. YOU CAN CONQUER TAXOL TOO...one step at a time. Please let us know how you ard doing after the 1st infusion. Mjb-sorry you have to join the Taxol wagon but if its going to serve you best in the long run hop onboard cause together we going to get thru this. Hariry-During chemo my thumb nails on both hands and my index on my right hand turned black at the cuticles or nail bed. I did not put anything on it just left it alone it is slowly clearing up not sure if it has to grow out or if its just going to fade away. But looking at it I think its getting lighter. My tongue on the sides also got black but that has cleared up. Under my feet also got black not the toenails though (isn't that strange) anyways i'm not doing anything special just keeping the skin moisturized as the chemo really dried my skin out ...managing with vitamin E oil. (Note: All this was during the chemo phase). After chemo I felt the same way like I just had enough totally fed up of it all so I understand. I like the idea of rewarding yourself with something...I love to shop so i think i'm going to windowshop who know I just might find a bargain. Think of this stage as the \"bad cells buster stage\" just picture Taxol duking it out with all those bad cells and busting their ass ...eradicating it out of your body. This goes for you too Hariry. YOU CAN DO THIS THE WORST i.e CHEMO IS OVER...YOU DID IT, THAT PART IS DONE. YOU CAN CONQUER TAXOL TOO...one step at a time. Please let us know how you ard doing after the 1st infusion. Gigi-Girl, I was in full DoraMilaje swag...bald baddie‚ò∫ Please let us know how you are doing after the 1st infusion. GenevaC-I bought a breast form online \"Braza Classic Foam Breast Form - S2015\" so maybe you could check Amazon. I also bought some stuffing and using the bra inserts plus a stocking I made a fake boob to stick in my sports bra works pretty darn good too.üòä I akso went to a specialized bra fitting place and got fitted turns out the best fit for me is a 36A...note I bought the Braza 34B before I had the professional fitting. I use them both. Pinotgirl- Pls find out from your doc if Vitamin B12 and l-glutamine will help u with the pain. Once you are feeling well try to keep active and hydrated. One step at a time.. Diveslikeagirl-Chemo#5 was tough for me, praying that it's not hard on you girl, just know thst the group is here just come on here and let it all out. Remember to take your meds don't miss them, take them on time...I lapsed with that and it was no fun..drink as much as you can and finally try to get some cat naps during the day.

I hope that warm weather is finally coming in wherever you are. It seems like everyone is coping inspite of what the treatments throw at us. It has been a while, I missed you gals but you all have been in my prayers. I have finally finished chemo and is now on a 3 week break before starting rads but the cumulative effect of the 12wks of Taxol has been a bitch. I have been plagued with dizziness, extreme fatigue, headaches, a persistent dry cough that is just not going away and of course neuropathy of the feet. I collapased twice once in public and once at home thank God both times I didn't hit my head or had any major cuts or bruises. I have since had an MRI to see if anything went up to the brain (because of the migrane type headaches) the results came back negative, they also checked my heart can't remember what that was for but the reesults came back negative so that was good and today I am going to xray my chest (because of the cough). Just like that my skin started itching too, its so annoying. I have been sapping it with rubbing alcohol and that helps for a while. Some days I just feel like screaming cause i'm so tired of the treatments, travelling to and fro from the medical centre, the tiredness all the tests. But then I remember my children and I want to see them turn into adults and well........Almost went off there. Overall, I am feeling Ok not 100% but good enough to get thru daily life. My hair is growing back out the texture has changed and some parts look pretty sparse but hey there is gel. üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ I just either gel it in place or wear a wig and keep it moving. My husband says I look like SmeegelüëΩfrom Lord of the Rings and we both crack up, gals I wish I had a pic so I can get a chuckle out of you too. I am in pre-prep mode for radiation. The good news is i'm getting 3wks instead of 5wks. Seems like Aquaphor is the cream to get the nurses here are recommending Cetaphil had anybody used the two creams and can say which one they found to be better. I have also gained some weight 10lbs total and a lot of my clothes are tight as hell especially in the arm area seems the weight went straight to my shoulders/arms and waistline...My nurse told me that it's the steroids and now that chemo is finished and i'm not using the steriod I should get back to my normal size...seems like a pipe dream to me....weight loss aint ever been that easy üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Daniz - I can only imagine the emotions you are going thru now but don't give up. You have come too far to turn back now. One day at a time, one diagnosis at a time. It can be so overwhelming. Don't regret your choices at the time you made a decision based on the info you had and now you have to do the same thing. Do what is right for you, what you feel is right in your gut. I am a praying person so I have to tell you to continue to trust and keep the faith. You are in my prayers. So as per usual my lovelies keep those chins up. We've come a long way we've been thru chemo and we are still here, some have been thru or going thru rads and still here...yes we have aches and pains, we have changes in treatments and diagnosis but by God's grace and mercy we are still here. We are not giving up this fight. The battle isn't over, God is still in the healing business, I pray that he guide our health care doctors and nurses to make the right call and for us to make the right choices. One day at at time. This race is not for the swiftest but for those who endure to the end. Stay strong, Eat even tough the the food is tasteless, Exercise if you have the energy and Rest even if you're not tired.

As usual I am sending warm hugs from the Caribbean it's so cold where you all are whilst i'm here lapping up all this beautiful sunshine. Wish I could send you all some in a bottle. Well I had my 3rd chemo cycle this week and day 4 is my trouble day last night was bad I felt like my stomach was wringing out of my body, my vagina and anus felt like it was falling out üò© don't know what caused that I was afraid to eat or drink as I didn't want to vomit. Thank God I have a hot water bottle placed that on my tummy and groaned and writhed for about an 1hr then the pain subsided. Didn't bother to go to work today just stayed at home a laid in bed. Had some back pain too, I was wondering if its the injection for the WBC that is causing it? Noticed to that my eyes have been watering a lot seems like I am always crying. My mouth is very spitty and white urghhhh. But I have been using Baking Soda so no sores. I am loving all the wigs you gals look gr8. I shaved my head, the bald head is not bad my children have been calling me 'cue ball' üòÄand my husband thinks I look really cute without hair he keeps saying I look sexy but I guess he just wants to give me a boost. I am just happy that my head has an ok shapeüòÉ I have not been wearing any mask but I am very mindful of ppl coughing or sniffling around me. I always have a scarf to cover my nose and mouth. I have been treating each chemo session as the first thats the only way I can get thru the cycle. Your posts have been keeping me ahead of the wave, sane and positive.

For my friends whose wigs are tight get them adjusted and wear a stocking cap b4 placing your wig on your head. I usually give my head a little massage with some shea oil first. Hope this helps. @Daniz-I too sometimes get feelings of negativity but I tell myself it can be so much worse then I imagine an infant having to go thru this process and suddenly I feel like a whimp for whining. Then I say a prayer to my God and ask him to hold my hand because I can't do this without him and I feel so much better. I want you to try it the next time you feel negative. You are beautiful and wonderfully made my dear. My mouth did get white too but it was not thrush what I did was brush with Arm & Hammer Baking Soda that helped a lot. Yep water was horrible in round#2 I drank gatorade or lipton tea with milk, vanilla ice cream and also had pureed vegetable soup on the bad days. When I could I tried some smoothies beet root, or pumkin and carrot were my favorites, had lots of watermelon. Also had a lot of mint/giner/cherry fIavored candy around. I figured out that eveytime I felt nauseous to pop something in my mouth surprisingly I haven't gained any weight. Must be the Caribbean heat....i'm not giving that CHEMO GETS NO CREDIT for my svelte figure...(lol) @Diveslikeagirl-To my friend who loves to snorkel (mind you I can't swim a stroke and live on an island surrounded by water my house is literally minutes away from the beach..lol) you must check out our sister island Tobago and tell me what you think. I'm from Trinidad and Tobago.. I know the journey isn't finish I still have Taxol and Radiation to go. But every hurdle we overcome is reason enough to take a bow, a high five, a hug, a thumbs up. Pretty soon all of us gonna get shirts that says KICKED KHEMO TO THE KURB....so I am looking forward to when we all can look back on this time and know that we have been made stronger each one propping up the other. A few months ago I was a wreck scared out of wits but every advice, every SE explained, every emotion, every list from you ladies have help me immensely. Help to keep me sane, slowed my frantic panics, made me realize that I am not alone others b4 me have done this or is doing this!!, is beating this!! and is a living testimony. I want to be that too. So lets go ladies slow and steady, stay the course... 1 CYCLE AT A TIME.... LET US CLOSE THE DOOR ON CHEMO...KICK KHEMO OUT..üí™ Can't leave without giving my warm Caribbean hugs. Dark13",

No nausea, no metal mouth, no stomach wringing out, no private part feeling like it want to drop out of my body. What I did have tho was some severe headaches, tiredness and sleeplessness. To my surprise I was extremely hungry and thirsty. So I have been devouring everything in my path still can't do anything too sweet, salty or spicy. I will be starting taxol soon maybe next week. Right now its the Carnival season in my country so everybody is partying and frolicing. I just wanna say ladies this journey is not easy it is stressful (tears, anger, pain, doubt, fear and so much more). I too think about reoccurence but the mind is a powerful thing I cannot give energy to negative thoughts. Therefore that thought has to become a distant/faded one. I am only thinking about healing, strength and living to see my 100th birthday. My prayer every night is for chemo to kill the bad cells and for God to protect and rejuvenate the good cells. I am claiming victory, i'm going to be on the winning side because as a believer of the living God I believe in his power. I have kinda mapped out the way forward for me after all the medical treatments are done. I would love to know what some of you all plans are. That is my strategy I am termed tripple negative survivor for the rest of my existence on this earth. As far as i understand they really do not know what triggers the tripple negative cancer genes and there is no specific treatment. (If I am wrong lls let me know) I firmly believe that it is stress/worry. So my plan is to finish up the treatments taking it 1 cycle at a time, then radiation (1 cycle at a time). After the treatment I am going to find out if there is any test they can do to tell me that the cancer is in remission if there is no test then I am going to check the health of each of my major organs individually. Then I am going to eat healthy, exercise and enjoy the rest of my days on plant earth until my father up in heaven is ready for me. We can only change what is in our power to change. WE HAVE THE POWER TO STARVE THE CANCER CELLS AFTER TREATMENT BY EATING HEALTHY (GREENS, FRUIT& VEGETABLES, HERBs & SPICES, WATER ETC), GETTING RID OF TOXINS, TRY TO MAKE THE BODY ACID FREE. IT WILL MEAN GIVING UP CERTAIN COMFORT FOODS BUT THAT'S A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR OUR LIFE. I want to encourage each of you stay strong. We can do this. We can beat this. Just take it 1 cycle at a time. Slow and steady. Stay the course. Focus on the light at the end of the tunnel, which is our lives. No giving up. When you're feeling down come on here and talk or cry it out either way we got you. I have found comfort and strength in this space. Good Night. Warm hugs from the Caribbean as always. Dark13.",

Lol Here is an update on my treatment so far. Started chemo -13 December 2017 Chemotheraphy Begins 4cycles (1 every 14 days) medicine received to take at home Nexium, Kyril, Dexamethasone, Zarzio (5injections) 1st Round of Chemo I got up exercised and went to the Clinic. Met with the patient advisor after speaking with her and voicing my fears I was definitely calmer as she explained everything. Met with the doctor who explained everything again took my vitals and then it was off to the Chemo Chair. The Chemo nurse seemed to be very experienced and was very clear in identifying everything that she was administering.The experience was not as bad as I expected in terms of pain and adverse reaction to the medicine. It's day 2 and we'll see how it goes today. Again day 2 was not as bad as I expected. I felt nauseous but did not throw up in that regard the meds worked fine. I had to go back to the clinic to be shown how to inject myself. A nother aspect of the treatment. Thank God hubby was there cause I can't inject myself. He did it for the 5 days and it was tolerable. Day 3 I got my meds screwed up and I forgot to take a pill ooooh the pain was excruciating. Day 4 was a horrible day too but I managed to go thru that in a daze. I was nauseous and feeling the need to vomit all day but I didn't. Had some trouble sleeping though. Day 5 started to feel a lil better all medicine done so its time to get the blood counts back up was able to eat normally. Day 6 thru 14 was feeling more energetic except for day 8/-9 I think a wave of tiredness hit me whew just had to rest completely other than that I was fine. I exercised every other day throughout the cycle. Noticed that my hair started falling out ever so slightly going to cut it even shorter. I don't stress over the hair I have had my hair short for years right now its full of peroxide caused i deceided to be a blonde its already weak so this falling out is only inevitable. I wear wigs all the time so thats not new to me either. Waiting to see if i'll loose my eyelashes and brows now that is going to be epic. Lessons learned 1. Pray all the time. 1a. Don't forget to take your pills on time 2. Drink lots of water in the 1st 5 days to flush that chemo liquid out and help your kidneys 3. Exercise as much as you can 4. Try to eat more vegetables and fruit. Drink lots of fruit and vegetable smoothes orr punches as you can.(beet, pumpkin, carrots, kale, cucumbers, lettuce, apple, pawpaw, water melon etc) 5. For some reason milk work really good for my stomach. I can't stand water so i've been drinking grape gatorade SideNote: After feeling so bad on days 3 and 4 I really decided in my mind that I wanted to stop chemo went and spoke to my Doctor once again he explained why its necessary. So i'm still in the game. I CAN DO THIS!!!! I have decided to treat each round as if its the 1st. 29th Dec 2017 -2nd Round Chemo Must do a CBC blood test before every round of Chemo. I got up exercised and went to the Clinic. Got my needle inserted into my port and its off to the chemo chair. Everything ran smoothly. This day its not to bad you feel a bit out of sorts cause after all something foreign is in your body but generally I am able to go about the days business as usual. Today I felt a bit tired after the process. Day 2 not bad this time I made sure to take my pills on time and to eat small amounts of fruit and yogurt throughout the day. Day 3&4 is usaully my tough days so ill let you know how that went in my next post. Thank you all ladies for your repsonses, your encouragement, your good and not so good news it all helps. There are not enough words to express my gratitude to all of you. WE CAN DO THIS. STAY STRONG. I AM STRONG BECAUSE YOU ALL ARE STRONG. Hugs and kisses.",

I had my Taxol#1 and it was not bad at all so far no side effects, but then this is just day 2 after the actual treatment still enjoying the bliss of being drugged up. I also suspect that the effects will be cumulative as the treatment advances after all its 12rounds so I am going to keep you all posted. I asked my ONC about the icing of the hands and feet to prevent neuropathy but was told they don't advocate that because then the medicine will not go to those areas. My nurse recommeded 'Neuronbine Forte' for neurpothay. I also heard about 'l-glutamine' for neuropathy. Have anybody heard about these drugs? I have to read up on it some more. I also asked about taking B6 and B12 vitamins and I was told its fine so i'm going to start taking it anything to shore up/strengthen this body. Is anybody else taking vitamins? Daniz/Hariry - keep courage girls I believe the worst is over with the AC that was a biotch but its behind you now. We are starting fresh 1 cycle at a time counting down Taxol. I am not going back to that weekly Taxol thread its like fear factor and I aint got time for that I am all about giving out positive vibes. How I get thru....There is power in your word and it stars with the mind... when I wake up in the morning I say..\"I rebuke all SE in the matchless name of Jesus\"...say it out loud and claim it. Everyday I have to reset my mind so that the doubt and fear don't overtake me. I hope this helps you.

I hope that warm weather is finally coming in wherever you are. It seems like everyone is coping inspite of what the treatments throw at us. It has been a while, I missed you gals but you all have been in my prayers. I have finally finished chemo and is now on a 3 week break before starting rads but the cumulative effect of the 12wks of Taxol has been a bitch. I have been plagued with dizziness, extreme fatigue, headaches, a persistent dry cough that is just not going away and of course neuropathy of the feet. I collapased twice once in public and once at home thank God both times I didn't hit my head or had any major cuts or bruises. I have since had an MRI to see if anything went up to the brain (because of the migrane type headaches) the results came back negative, they also checked my heart can't remember what that was for but the reesults came back negative so that was good and today I am going to xray my chest (because of the cough). Just like that my skin started itching too, its so annoying. I have been sapping it with rubbing alcohol and that helps for a while. Other than the tiredness I am feeling Ok not 100% but good enough to get thru daily life. My hair is growing back out the texture has changed and some parts look pretty sparse but hey there is gel. üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ I just either gel it in place or wear a wig and keep it moving. My husband says I look like Smeegel from Lord of the Rings and we both crack up, gals I wish I had a pic so I can get a chuckle out of you too. I am in pre-prep mode for radiation. The good news is i'm getting 3wks instead of 5wks. Seems like Aquaphor is the cream to get the nurses here are recommending Cetaphil had anybody used the two creams and can say which one they found to be better. I have also gained some weight 10lbs total and a lot of my clothes are tight as hell especially in the arm area seems the weight went straight to my shoulders/arms and waistline...My nurse told me that it's the steroids and now that chemo is finished and i'm not using the steriod I should get back to my normal size...seems like a pipe dream to me....weight loss aint ever been that easy üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ So as per usual my lovelies keep those chins up. We've come a long way we've been thru chemo and we are still here,some have been thru or going thru rads and still here...yes we have aches and pains but by God's grace and mercy we are still here. We are not giving up this fight. The battle isn't over but we are closer to the light at the end if the tunnel. One day at at time. We are kicking this to this curb. Have a great week. I rebuke all side effects in the name of Jesus. Dark13",

I have completed my chemo and radiation my doctor told me to go live my life don't worry or take on too much as stress is not good for me. I have to return in Dec to do some tests which starts the new baseline for monitoring going foward. Yes health care is ridiculously expensive, no strike that, cancer care is ridiculously expensive. I thank God everyday that my job has an excellent health plan most of my bills were 98-100% covered so I did not have to utilize the public health care system in my country. Right now I am exercising and trying to eat right but that too is expensive, organic foods are costly. I have not juiced in awhile and im missing it but its hard to keep up. It seems like everyday there is something on social media with these food manufactures and syntethic stuff in foods that are killing people slowly you have to be so careful. I am also on the hunt for a real strapless bra with pockets for a breast form. Not those Coobie uniboob tube top type bras. I tried them and its a big no for me. I really want to be able go wear my strapless and off shoulder clothing again. Can anybody recommend a strapless bra? How long does it take for the radiation site to heal up? My radiation has been completed about 3mths and the area still feel hot to me. Bas anybody experience this? Anyway have a great week folks.

I also noticed that my hands has started trembling/shaking no tingling yet thank God not sure what that is about. My doctor told me I need to try and get as much sleep as possible but i'm struggling. Drinking tons of water have improved my skin somewhat in the face area but my feet are dry as chips and peeling the soles turned black they look horrendous. I am not icing just moisturing and soaking them weekly. The upside is there is no nausea, no metal mouth and I can eat basically anything. I try to exercise 5/6 times a week for 1/2hr I have found that this has helped with my general well being. My hair has started growing back and its completely gray I don't know what happened to the black either way I am going with the flow. I had my hair platinum b4 so its no biggie i'm a free spirit when it comes to hair I switch it up all the time. Eyebrows still sparse but the pencil works.lol. I have not gained any weight even though I feel like i'm eating more my appetite is insatiable. Update-I am feeling some symptoms of neuropathy today I couldn't feel my toes it felt so strange. Lol.. and the tiredness I tried sweeping my porch and after that I was tuckered out took me a full 3hrs to regain my strength I just had to lie down.. Another strange thing my hair on my head is growi g back but I wiped my face and ny brows were gone....what a riot I couldn't stop laughing. Well ladies the light at the end of the tunnel is getting closer. The journey still has Some ways to go but we are almost there.

To my surprise I was extremely hungry and thirsty. So I have been devouring everything in my path still can't do anything too sweet, salty or spicy. I will be starting taxol soon maybe next week. I just wanna say ladies this journey is not easy it is stressful (tears, anger, pain, doubt, fear and so much more). I too think about reoccurence but the mind is a powerful thing I cannot give energy to negative thoughts. Therefore that thought has to become a distant/faded one. I am only thinking about healing, strength and living to see my 100th birthday. My prayer every night is for chemo to kill the bad cells and for God to protect and rejuvenate the good cells. I am claiming victory, i'm going to be on the winning side because as a believer of the living God I believe in his power. I want to encourage each of you stay strong. We can do this. We can beat this. Just take it 1 cycle at a time. Slow and steady. Stay the course. Focus on the light at the end of the tunnel, which is our lives. No giving up. When you're feeling down come on here and talk or cry it out either way we got you. I have found comfort and strength in this space. Good Night. Warm hugs from the Caribbean as always. Dark13.",

How do I use the washroom etc? How do I even get clothes on since i won't be able to lift my hands. I am envisioning lots of pain if any one can shed some light re after the surgery what to expect. Findings Chest- dense breast parenchyma is seen. There are 2 closely located lobulated masses in the upper inner aspect of the left breast measuring 1.2 x 2.5cm in diameter. These are separate from the undelying pectoral muscle and do not involve the overlyingskin. Several sub centimeter morphologically - normal right and left auxillary lymph nodes are seen. The right breast is unreamarkable. The nipple areolar complexes are normal. The hilar and mediastinal structures are normal on this non-contrast study. Thanks Dark13",
