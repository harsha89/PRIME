In 2001 I had a recurrance and had radiation - over an implant.  Still kept on keeping on as no one told me not to \"lift........\"  In 2003 I developed full blown upper right quadrant LE.  20 PT sessions per year (per my insurance) 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006/compression garments/self massage and I am still right back where I started.  My point is I don't believe the weight lifting will help everyone maybe just a very few.  And as we all know we all get different treatment from diagnosis of BC on.  In one of the media articles a Dr was quoted as saying LE is less likely to happen with the advances in ways to do surgery.  Yes, my daughter in DC called me to ask me if I had seen the article and \"mom this will really help you!\"   She forgets that I did not simply have 1 surgical procedure but 4 in the same area.  As for \"controlled\" LE I too would sure like to know what that is and how you get it!!!!!!!

The bone that comes around from your back and meets your collarbone at the shoulder are impinged where they come together. First course of treatment was to have the bone at the connection shaved, but no surgery for us mets people. Steroid injection then done. WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY NOW. No needle sticks in L E. The doctor is not always right. He said it would be ok, but Cellulitis came along and put me in the hospital for 4 days. Maybe you should be checked for something further in that shoulder.Ihad the pain for about 6 months, but thought it went with the \"territory\" Never dreamed it could be impinged.  I shared the Cellulitis art only to emphsize our need to be careful with LE.",

Do home massage and wear the bandaging and tribute sleeve. When the advice is given that loosing weight helps - I can tell you that is right. I need to lose the 20 pounds I have put on. I had a right nephrectomy due to kidney cancer in July 2007 and my arm sort of took a back seat. I am trying to be disciplined again about taking care of it. But, I have come to the conclusion, that I will never see an arm the size of my left one again. So am trying to just focus on \"maintaining\" where I am.

But since this was a recurrance I had already had an implant following the original mastectomy. The radiologist said at the beginning the rads that my implant may not make it thru the rads. And sure enough the implant was fried. I had to have it removed so this was the 4th surgery in the same place - mod rad mastectomy, expander, implant, remove implant.

Incidentally, I have since learned that what was thought to be urinary tract infections is simply my body at age 68 and having been on Femara for 7 years - thus I am absolutely wiped out of estrogen. I had a pap test a year ago even though I have had a hysterectomy the gynocologist said I needed to have one. It came back questionable. The Gyn said I will have questionable pap tests the rest of my life due to lack of estrogen and will probably always have urine tests that show urinary tract infection, even though I don't actually have one. I actually felt relieved at that as my urine tests kept coming back positive for infection even though I had no symptoms or anything. One part of the test was negative and one part positive so at first it was thought I had a lot of urinary tract infections. Susan B.",
