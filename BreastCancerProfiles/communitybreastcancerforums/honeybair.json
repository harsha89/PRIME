I have one and am glad that I do.  If you get the drug adramycin wihout a port, it can harden/scar your veins forever so they cannot be used to do any procedures as needed.  If you need to receive Herceptin assuming you are HER2 positive, you will be using that port for up to one year.  If you have to be hospitalized, the port is easily accessed by medical staff and you will not have to suffer the pain of having your hands or veins used.  The surgery to implant one is about a half hour.  I know that you are in pain from your surgery and drains, so I do understand that you have enough pain to suffer through.   The port is the most comfortable method for having your drugs infused, that is to say pain-free.  My scar is ugly from the port surgery, but I need to use Vitamin E oil on the scar tissue. Like you, I have the tight area on my chest and under my arm .  I saw a physical therapist yesterday and she told me to gently rub my chest area as well as my arm on the back side. Our nerves have been disturbed by our surgery and are kind of behaving erratically according to her and that is why gentle massage is good.  I constantly rub my chest and put Aquaphor cream on it and I am noticing a marked improvement.  I am sure you still have some areas of numbness as well.  Since I had no recontruction I don't have to use pain meds but I still cannot sleep in my bed but instead in my power recliner.  I am still too raw from the surgery to be comfortable lying down. Hope my experience with my port will be of some comfort to you.  The majority of the patients where I received my infusions had ports.",

As far as being able to go to work, I don't know how anyone undergoing the harsh chemo that you are on right now could possibly go to work. These chemicals are brutal and there is no way to describe how bad you feel while on them. Plus your immune system is compromised and you have to be extra vigilant to avoid everything out there. Those steroids are preventing you from sleeping. After each chemo session, I was awake at 3 am until bed time the next night. My very brilliant and wonderful radiation oncologist has told me to take Benedryl, two 25 mg tablets, as sleeping medication. She says it is safe and very effective. I have had and am still having sleep problems particularly since starting radiation. For all of you undergoing chemo now, my heart and prayers are with you. We all get side effects, some of us more than others, and we are all different in how our bodies react. I could not eat much while on chemo and everything smelled terrible to me. My taste has returned and I enjoy food again. I have drastically changed what I eat and how it is prepared in hopes of remaining cancer free. Sorry you and Wren are having such a hard time. My thoughts are with both of you.",

You are suffering from anxiety about the unknown as I did before my port placement and before my chemo began. Anxiety may be too gentle of a word to use. Downright fear is what I felt and it proved worse than the actual chemo experience for me. Still, I won't try to kid you. Chemo will make you feel really bad and tired, but it is doable. Also, remember, each person who undergoes it will have different side effects, and no one will get all of what they tell you is possible to develop. I was vigilant about drinking lots of ice water and rinsing often with my baking soda-salt combo to avoid sores in my mouth. The chemo war is tough on the body, the spirit and the mind. I still see my chemo nurses every three weeks because I receive Herceptin through that much dreaded port. But they were wonderful, competent, and caring and I look forward to seeing them now. Your skin will become dry, most likely and will remain that way after chemo, so I advise using lots of Aquaphor on your hands and body. My previously oily hair and complexion are no more. That oily skin has kept me wrinkle-free, so I do miss that benefit. Hope my words will be of comfort to you and i wish you well.",

Being queasy and not hungry is just a part of the misery of this entire chemo journey for most people. I have been where you are. The one thing you can hold on to is to remember that this misery will pass and that you are strong enough to endure it. Coming here for support helped me through many a miserable day.",

I relied on the power of prayer, both my own and that of many, many others.  I was also encouraged by gifts, flowers, food, cards, letters,e-mails and phone calls from friends.  But my real rock through all this was and still is my devoted, loving husband.  Without him, I could not have made it as well as I have.  I have two adult daughters and my older one became a new mom in March, so she could not come very often, but she has always stayed in constant contact.  My younger daughter is more distant emotionally, but did come for  a visit Mother's Day weekend and this past week-end after my surgery.  My older daughter came and stayed for two weeks after my recent surgery and was a tremendous  help plus I got joy out of being around my little granddaughter which cheered my spirits. I have remained upbeat and positive throughout this ordeal once I got the crying over early in the game in January. I am grateful to still be here and hoping for many years of disease-free survival. There are so many smart ladies who post on these forums.  There is a wealth of knowledge and experience that I have drawn from which have helped me.  Wishing you all the best in your treatments.",

I have forgotten the exact ratio. There is also a mouthwash called Biotene that many people on the chemo forums used. I just stuck with the baking soda/salt mixture and never got sores in my mouth. Thrush was never a problem either. I did not catch a cold or get any other illnesses last winter. To safeguard my health I always wore a medical mask in public, and always used gel after touching anything in public. Most people probably would not go to the extremes that I did to stay well, but I did not eat in restaurants. We ordered take-out. I also gave up going to church and all outside social activities. I did not want to be hospitalized or forced to skip my chemo. My family doctor's nurse advised me to always wear a mask when visiting that office because as we all know, upper respiratory illnesses are much worse during cold weather. I just accepted the fact that my life would have to change for the duration of chemo so that I could get restored back to good health. I have rosacea, and while on chemo it cleared completely without having to use my meds for it. That was a very pleasant unexpected side effect. Aquaphor is used only on my hands each night before I go to bed. For my body I use Eucerin intense repair lotion unscented. You will find that your sense of smell will become altered and you will detest the smell of many foods and almost any other item with fragrance. At least that was my experience.

I ache all the time but not enough to chase me to the relief drugs.  I just cannot sleep lying down in my bed, which makes it worse.  I am just grateful for my really comfortable lazy  boy recliner which I sleep in most of time now. I do hope you find relief in managing your pain.",

If you are in pain at your surgical site, then my guess would be pain syndrome. You learn more about everything pertaining to this disease, treatments and side effects than any doctor is going to admit. Their major concern was saving our lives, no matter what we have to live with each day. I do hope you can find relief in some way from your suffering.",

I am two years post surgery and have found that I too am experiencing more pain but thankfully my bra and prosthesis seem to help me to feel less discomfort. What we are experiencing, in my opinion, is nerve damage and disturbance. My DH rubs my back and massages my scar area each night which I have found to bring much needed relief. Still, sleeping through the night because of enough pain to disturb me but not enough to seek drugs is slowly driving me bonkers. I am seriously considering getting message each week.",
