My left hand is more severe than my right. My hands will go numb during the night and the next morning my fingers will be sore for about 4 hours or so. Not sure what's going on??

I don't have any lumps or redness. The pain only happens when I lay on my left side. The longer I lay on my side the morr intense the pain gets.
