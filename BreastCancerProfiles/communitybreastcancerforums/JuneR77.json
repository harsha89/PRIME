I will have my biopsy on March 3, with the results 48 hr. later. I'm planning for the worst.  One remaining question  is why it might not be possible for me to have  radiation instead of the mastectomy. I know that I have dense breast tissue and have been told that after radiation it becomes more difficult to pick up any other cancers.",
