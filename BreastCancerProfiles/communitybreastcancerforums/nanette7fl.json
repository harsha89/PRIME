Mine wasn't and I had very sore ribs for about 3 days. You'll be laying face down with your arms stretched forward (like laying on your belly while reaching for the headboard) . Your forehead has a support but your face is looking in a clear bin that has a small mirror in it. It really isn't too long 20-30 minutes. It does get hot to don't panic...they really need to place a small fan in there Good luck! Let us know how you did",

My surgeon placed it right below my right collar bone and I have 2 incisions. The one for the port and a small incision in my neck. Because I'm allergic to certain adhesives my surgeon applied Durabond skin glue. (Itold my husband and my daughter after surgery I felt like the bride of Frankenstein because of how the glue makes everything look.)The sites are uncomfortable especially when I want to go to sleep. THAT has been an interesting ordeal in itself. I guess I always took my pillows for granted and have had to get rather creative about finding that 'perfect' spot to put my head and neck as I sleep semi on my right side and belly. I am now learning to be a side sleeper lol I did find a small rectangular pillow that is cloud soft from when my MIL was in hospice. I place that on my neck between surgical scars? and it does help cushion my neck from feeling like I'm crushing my neck against the port. I also learned that vacuuming the house now falls under 'heavy duty' and I'm going to have to get my daughter or one of the grandkids to do that for me as it wore me out some but mostly made me really uncomfortable when I wanted to go to sleep. As it was mentioned the whole mess is a little annoying and I do feel some pulling if I turn my head 'just' so. But it's part of the adventure so far for me so I'm just chalking this one up to a new learning experience. Anyhow I do hope you are well and that your chemo goes well. Sending you (((hugs))) for your journey. ( I start my chemo Dec 4th and am really nervous about it.)",

I found some rather nice ideas for washable ones in Japan & China online and I'm in the progress of making a pattern for them. My Psychiatrist thought that was a great idea as I have literally TONS of fabric to choose from and I'm thinking of making some subtle and some on the loud side Dr A suggested that the masks should be 'fun' and I totally agree 8) With my first batch I'm going to donate about 30 of them to my Cancer Center and also to the Cancer Center at my local hospital. They'll all come with a lovely little tag stating the cost of future ones ($2.00/ea to cover some basic supplies I'll run out of eventually) Sweetoylve.... I agree with your Dr's about the anti-nausea meds. I was bull headed the 1st week and eventually learned that in order for me to eat I have to take a pill (I start with the Zofran or the O\" pill)and then IF I need something within 1-2 hrs post eating I take the Compazine or the \"P\" pill. This way I'm not suffering and waiting for the nausea to subside so I can feel better. Also since I started doing it this way I'm in a much better 'mood' when DH comes in a night from work and I don't complain about being nauseated.... He worries ENOUGH as it is LillianGish.... I totally agree with your attitude...... I love being optimistic and I think it really helps a lot!! So I went for my 3rd weekly infusion today and when my lovely nurse asked me 'How are you feeling?' I was pretty honest with her and told her that I've either got bone pain or muscle pain and i DON'T like it one little bit. She looked so sad and sorry and said it's probably the Taxol acting on me. Later on as we were finishing up I said 'Well I guess it's about time for my hair to start falling out and she said 'Honey you're on a low dose of taxol that's why you come weekly. Normally it's the 'girls' who come every 3 weeks who experience the going bald issue. Are you experiencing anything that would make you think you're going to lose your hair? I told her yes. I showered this morning and in the car on the way over I was picking at my hair trying to get it to 'stand' up some and I had about 3-6 hairs in my hand every time....then I showed her.Odd how that didn't start until the shower. Do you all agree with tmy nurse's opinion? I told her about some of you and she was surprised. I reminded her of how long my hair was before chemo and how I had it cut the weekend before I started. I used to have hairs all over the house and it was common then for me to have to unload my hair brush then....since the short cut I've NOT see ANY hairs coming out especially when doing my hair with the mousse and curling iron. So YES I have reason to be concerned 8( Any how I need to go take my night meds and brush up my hair while I still can. I have a thought...I'm going to the salon to the nice young lady who did my 'transformation' haircut. We had discussed 'that' time and I told her she'd know it was time to take it all off when I showed up with NAIR in my hand.... I remember her laughing and the shop owner, who I've known for over 15 years and she said the NAIR was the best way because of what it does to the ends of the hair shaft and could prevent issues later....Like I said just a thought Love and ((( hugs))) to you all. We ARE BEAUTIFUL because beauty comes from the inside!!  ",

DH was so worried. Sorry you slept through Christmas Becky- I agree the effects are cumulative. I just started week 4 yesterday and now 24 hrs later I'm so much more tired than I was during the past 3. The Benadryl does kick you right in the butt!!! I can't seem to sit still any more during treatment. My lower body just gets really antsy and makes sitting near impossible. So I learned something from my MO yesterday. I tried to explain to him that where the biopsy markers are in lefty some times it feels like someone has the buttons for a dogs shock collar & they're using it on me. He got this funny look on his face and said..\"there's a school of thought that says feelings like that are the cancer cells being killed off!\" Wow!! Hadn't thought of it like that but the next time I get that zappy feeling in lefty I'm going to yell \"Die Cancer Die\" lol Any who I took a shower yesterday morning and hair is coming out in gobs! Stuck to my hands and was all over the shower floor. . I was praying it would all just go down the darned drain. THEN wh32n I get I out Igrab my towel and start towel drying my hair just like every time ONLY this time it looked like someone used my towel on my dog!! I was so shocked!! Ive lost 1/4 of my hair so far... getting dressed is so much fun and thank goodness DH is home for a few days because he's on hair removal duty with the back of my shirts. He laughed so hard yesterday after my shower because he said I had more hair on my back than he does 8( Today being outside where it's windy I feel like an old dandelion that has turned to seed as I see white hair blowing by. My 7 yo granddaughter yells to her 3 yo little sister and says \"Look Nams hair is blowing away!\" Followed by giggles and then \"does it hurt Nams??\" So I figure at the rate it's coming out I'll be totally hairless well before next weekend. Not too sure how I feel about it but I KNOW there's not enough hairspray or crazy glue to keep it all in place at this point... thank goodness I have a lovely wig and a bunch of headwraps and scarves that people donated to me. I'll be putting all those scarf videos I've been watching to good use soon. Anyhow love and hugs to you all.

My granddaughters aren't here this week so I've been going around with nothing on my bean during the day and its been so freeing! (My 7 year old grand doesn't like my baldness but her 3 year old sister is more accepting) Does anyone have issues sleeping in a cap/hat? At times I find it most annoying...too hot ...half off half on.... or not on at all and my head is freezing!! I've tried light ones but they're not warm enough and the light skull caps by morning are the ones not on my head or I wake up sweating. Well the weather here in NE Florida has been so weird this Year!! 1st it's been the wettest one on 25 years. It's also been one of the warmest. After Christmas we broke 2 high temp records! Now the red maples are budding and leafing out and the pine trees and pollinating with their green pollen dust lightly coating anything outside. THIS doesn't normally happen until late February! My allergies are acting up big time! So I'm on day 2 of week 7 and today's not a bad day. The runs are starting and I was out with DH earlier and am learning chemo brain is in effect. I either can't remember what I was saying or just get lost having a conversation. Funny but sad since we were at his denture fitting appointment and I didn't like how his teeth weren't gapping correctly and all I could say was overbite. Luckily the dentist knew what I was trying to say and said he'd get it fixed by next week Sigh... I think I can deal with hairloss better than havin word loss.",

Red swollen eyes and nose... no energy...I feel like I've been through a war. When I left I mentally felt better as I was able to talk with my nurse about how I feel. I see MO next week and I'm to let him know also. She said something about MO cutting back my dosages of T&P for the last 3 weekly infusions. I'm doing this as neo and at this point couldn't see me doing this after surgery! If I feel like this I can only imagine how much worse I would feel then... mentally trying to recover from MX and then this mess probably would have broken me! Prayers to you and hope you feel a little better. ~Nanette",

I know I'll be on sometime for the next 5 years but he never said what. Lillian, taxol has cumulative side effects and nearing the end I'm tired more and more. I can't vacuum anymore because it leaves me gasping for air. So I have to get DD to do it for me. From what I understand Taxotere and taxol have similar side effects. Angie yes it is nice to have an ear outside of the house and well meaning friends. I can dump on my shrink and let her get me riled up to get it all out! Here's to hanging in there the best we can. Yes to others we are \"fine\" but in here we can really Express how we really are... tired..sore...sore noses and eyes...tension headaches from the stress of what we're going through...and our fears. I know this is one journey that no matter what decision I make it will be the best one regardless. Hugs to everyone ((((hugs))))",

I see PS for 1 week post surgical check up on Wednesday and hopefully the drains will come out!! And maybe start therapy as my left arm hurts and is limited in range of movement. On brighter side DH let me out to do and supervise some of my long neglected spring yard work . Felt so nice to at least try to some trimming and applying weed killer... .but now I'm dealing with the fact that it was hot out and now both legs and left arm are swollen 😥 so even 2 hrs of light yard work got me.

He was concerned because I'm standing there with the shower door open massive amount of hair on my hands and I could barely get out the words that \"it's falling out by gobs! My hair my beautiful hair!\" Poor guy who's trying not to cry with me is speechless and he just holds my soaking wet body while I cry. I lost over 1/2 of my hair tonight!! I sort of have the hair line of my balding son! As soon as I got into the shower and I let the water run on my head I noticed my hair/scalp was hurting. I can't explain it any better than that. It was like a headache on my scalp!! As I proceeded to shampoo I knew something was wrong and I looked down at my hands and then shower floor there is soooooo much hair!! He helped me dry off because my back felt odd which he said was full of hair. I wrapped my head in a towel and left it alone for a bit. After a while I gently unwrapped the towel and there more hair in gobs just sticking to the towel... handfuls and more tears! \"DH Please come outside for a minute\" and he helps brush off my nightie and all he can say is oh my God! DH said he is upset it's coming out so fast now too.(I think he knows THIS is going to be a toughie!) I honestly didn't know how frightening it would be once it really started coming out!! I thought I was prepared but really I don't think there's a way to prepare for losing our hair! So in the morning I'll gather up my hats and scarves and give them all a good washing. Does anyone know it fabric softener will irritate your scalp? Wishing you all a good night and a better tomorrow.,Love and ((hugs)) to you all",

Taxol stinks and I just did week 7 on Thursday and this is the 2nd weekend I have a swollen face!! I don't even look like me I look in mirror and i see this big moon face looking back at me. I also hate this weight you game lose 4 pounds to gain it back next week..getting me down 8( I'm tired of having this breathing thing from the chemo and having to use a nebulizer now for breathing treatments....shortness of breath... bites and takes your energy!! So DH dragged me out of the house so he could go look at our neighbor ladies car..it's not running. I told him i really don't want to do especially after how sick i just was. I told him it's really made me leary of being around people for fear of getting sick. Well long and behold this womans adult son comes home from work and he's SO SICK! He apologized for coughing and said he'd go back in the house and I said \"no honey I'm going home any ways. I have to be careful around others because I'm on chemo and I'm tired today.\" Omg I thought he was going to pass out. I mean come on I have a chemo cap on.... he said \"oh my I'm so sorry I don't want you to get sick from me but there's a sinus infection going around at work...\" well his attitude was good. Omg rotavirus now sinus infection coming?? Please NO!! Enough!! I want my immune system back!! I hardly ever got sick! So this,is day 3 and I'm so tired. I guess I used up all my energy the previous 2 days cleaning. Oh I'm having a hard time with my house and the dirt!! I like my house neat and it's not now ... another reason to hate this chemo!! Yiu think DH or DD would at least vacuum the floor one in a while! Sorry but I'm just bummed. I know they have told us the effects of taxol are cumulative but omg of I'm this tired what are the next 5 trwatmentsgping to do?? Put me into my bed? I'm sorry to be such a downer... hopefully tomorrow will be a better day. I hate being down but my glass is still 1/2 full!",

Lack of energy is another...different from being tired... and I have chemo brain and now fully understand my 7 yr old granddaughter whi has add/adhd.... I have concentration issues most of the time.

It's coming back! I finished Taxol 2 weeks ago and I had my 1st Herceptin only this past Friday. I had a reaction.... severe nausea BOOM! it came out of nowhere...we had to stop. They gave me some Ketryl?? for the nausea and ir went away. I was 15 min done of the 30 min. The dosage went from the 2 mg/kg to 6 mg/kg so the nurse decided that the rest of my treatments will be 1 hour instead of 30 min. Anyhow glad to be done with Taxol!! Seems to be working it's way out of my body. I have weird bumps showing up like acne on my face ...arms ..neck....trunk and my right hip. Not a rash just lone red bumps that like mad for 24-36 hours and then they go away. I'm telling you it's weird! ",

I did develop Beau's lines but didn't know those could be precursors to nail lose! I'm in tears and just showed my husband 3-4 of the nails that will probably come off. I did find 2 interesting links here in the forum, even though they're really old, but they are helpful and informative.  https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/72/topics/667760 https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/69/topics/709416?page=2#post_5211170 I also think I have hand and foot syndrome as I had a weird spot on the side of my right heel and dh said it looked like my skin was peeling away. He asked if I'd done anything to my foot and I told him NO it was itchy a few days ago. Here's a link for this wonderful side effect http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/side-effects/handfoot-syndrome.aspx come to find out that even though I'm done with Taxol.... it just seems to be the chemical that keeps on giving, and giving and giving!!! I wish the oncologist had mentioned the nail loss or the foot thing as possible side effects. Maybe mentally I would have been more prepared that I'm falling apart  ",

I just a letter in the mail from BC/BS and it states exactly how much they are willing to pay for up to 18 weeks (luckily I'm only getting 12 weekly treatments). It also stated how much Herceptin and Taxol the Dr's office is to administer to me weekly. Amazing how documented all of this is. I was considering the fasting but since I go weekly DH &I discussed it and that only lets me eat 3 days a cycle and that won't work. We're too worried that with me being a type 2 non-insulin diabetic (4 years now) & my immunity will go down the drain. But for those of you who can do the fast because your cycle is different I'm praying for you. As far as my SE's go so far this week is good. The day of treatment leaves me exhausted but the 2nd & 3rd days were pretty good. Diarrhea 'threatens' but never follows through to the point that I need the Imodium.... yet. We've been helping my SIL & her daughter & granddaughters move into a new house for the past 5 weeks and yesterday was the BIG day of clean-out. Since I used to own a small housekeeping business so I got to do the deep clean and believe me it's all caught up to me this morning. I guess at almost 56 I'm getting to the point where chasing dust bunnies with a broom & dust pan & a floor vac followed up by mopping ALL those rooms (4 bedrooms, Den, Loft, Dining Room, Living room & Kitchen) and then 2 large bathrooms is more than I should have attempted on my 2nd week of treatment and all in 1 day. Oh did I mention it had stairs??? So lesson learned because TODAY when we go back down there I'm staying at the new house ON the couch with my poor tooties UP!! OMG I'm so very sore and DH told me IF I dare lift anything other than my purse with my O &P pills in it and my books he's going to personally escort me to the couch lol. I do have to say thought DH is being really helpful and surprises me daily. The 1st week he was befuddled as to my SE but I think he's on that learning curve too. This week he's been more helpful (8 I'm glad my family (DH, my 3 children and the 2 youngest grandchildren) to include my SIL and her family are genuinely concerned, over-whelmed and compassionate about this nasty diagnosis. The diagnosis that happens to 'other' people who we don't really know that well......you know what I mean..... My dear Dad (he's 78 3/4) is having a hard time with this though. My mom was diagnosed earlier this summer with Dementia and his heart is broken. He's NOT ready to be a caregiver and is so saddened to have Mom lose so much of 'who' she was 1 year ago. They've been married for 21 years and Dementia like BC was NEVER in the cards......so we thought. Seems though ladies a lot of our 'testings' during treatment are the same. I get a weekly CBC to make sure I can have my treatments. I see my oncologist every 3rd week. HE (the oncologist) on my visit with him this past week let me 'know' that I'm not 'doing' things the 'normal' way. HE said it is traditional to have mastectomy 1st then chemo then reconstruction. But you want reconstruction at your mastectomy so I had to devise a different plan. I looked at him and said, \"You all told me I COULD CHOOSE how I wanted to do treatment! Who wants to have 2 breast surgeries?? I feel it's in MY best interest to have ONLY 1 SURGERY!!\" Truth be told he HATES smoking and I'm working on quitting so I can have the reconstruction at the time of my mastectomies (I've decided to have the one killing me taken off and her sister as well.) Heck God gave them to me as a matched pair so BC isn't going to change that fact. I'll just have better FIRMER non-drooping boobies by next summer!! Anyhow sorry for rambling. But it sure is great to talk to other women who are going through what I'm going through and know that y'all \"get\" it. Have a great Sunday. I've gotta go get dressed as SIL#2 is taking us all out to Red Lobster for our annual Christmas Dinner!! I'll eat something yummy just not all of it because the poor tummy can't handle 'full' meals any more (thank you chemo )8 )",

She was crying because the knows I love my hair. Believe me in 20+ years she's seen some hair styles on me... some wacky perms with longish hair that made me look like a Lion when it was humid (when is it NOT humid in Florida!)....long and down to my waist...short and high maintenance ones...and everything in between including a head full of french braids. While we had coffee to regroup Linda asked me \"When did my little sister become so wise?\" Sharon had told her yesterday \"Linda, it's an honor to be asked to do this (removing my hair).\". Neither of us had thought about it that way. With tears in her eyes Linda asked me why we were doing this since I still had about 40% of my hair left and I told her this \"for 3 days I've been walking around feeling some place between Pigpen from Charlie Brown and a Sasquatch!! Every thing has my hair on it clothes, bedding, floors, my couch.... I've had enough of the scalp headaches and I'm tired of Taxol and the Cancer taking things away from me so this is my way of fighting back. The only way at this moment besides treatment to fight the cancer is for me to get good and mad and try and take control of something!!\" We had a good cry AGAIN about my hair before we started taking it off and then the removal began. We got out my beautician scissors and my husbands beard trimmer  Some how it was oddly liberating to take off the remainder of my hair. The Nair did pretty good too except for the spots on my head where there were still some patches of my original color, brownish black and those hairs were tough!! (the rest of my head was a lovely grayish white) I finished it off in the shower with a new razor. When DH came home I had on a scarf and had it tied up nicely. He looked at me and said \"You really did it!!\" He was beaming and proud of me. He really surprised me and had me take off the scarf and said he loved my bald head with a BIG smile. It was so nice seeing that reaction from him because I KNOW how much he loved my hair. So onward we go. Not blindly into the night but together fighting and not letting Cancer or treatments get us down!!",

Just recharges the batteries and gives hope that all will be well soon enough. Good luck with the Rads..will be keeping you in prayer. Angie your energy will come back. Its amazing how much better it is each day I get further and further from that last chemo... but the Herceptin has it's own few days of challenges but nothing as bad as Taxol!! Note to all those who are going on with Herceptin treatments...My MO forgot to tell me that Herceptin starts 1 week after chemo. The office had to call me and let me know about it and set u p my appt. The normal time for that dose (because its larger) is 30-90 minutes. I had severe nausea that occurred instantly about 15 min through the 30 min and we had to stop to treat me with ketril(sp?) for the nausea... and then restart at a slower dosage rate. Don't be afraid to speak up if something isn't going right. My time will be 1 hr for the next year. I saw my breast surgeon yesterday and I'm to see the plastic surgeon this Thursday about the bilateral mastectomy. Even though it is my left breast that is trying to kill me I've decided that I won't put rightie through all the suffering leftie has been through so hence the bilateral. She had agreed that I'm a good candidate for skin sparing surgery 8) so that was very good news. She's going to help get rid of 2 of the bad scars from the tape allergy and incorporate those into the new scars. I will have a T on leftie and a - on rightie. If PS agrees I'll get expanders at same surgery. So here's to a new chapter in my walk AGAINST breast cancer!!",

I'm Vit D deficient (and have been for the past 3 Yrs) and I take vit D3 3000IU daily and I make sure to consume some sort of dairy daily. Going outside, which isn't recommended on Taxol, for 15-20 min a day gives you about 1000IU of Vit D, which is activated by Vit A that we get in the sunlight. You get vit D from foods, sunlight and suppliments. Calcium and Vit D3 are important to each other and also our health. \"Calcium and vitamin D work together to protect your bones\u2014calcium helps build and maintain bones, while vitamin D helps your body effectively absorb calcium. So even if you're taking in enough calcium, it could be going to waste if you're deficient in vitamin D.\" (( https://www.endocrineweb.com/conditions/osteoporos... )) You don't have to take Calcium supplements but if you do, you don't need to take them at the same time you take your D3.

I too got a pre-cocktail of Benadryl, Dexmethasone and pepsid for anticipated nausea etc. I started at 1pm and was finished with both the Taxol (got that one 1st) and then Herceptin. The nursed did push the Herceptin some in the last 30 minutes because they close up shop at 5pm but it was fine. I felt really tired that night when we got home but I think it was stress let down and because I was SOOOO very bored being 'tied down' to a recliner for 5 hrs was not my idea of fun. I did have to get up and do some stretches because I have 3 crushed discs and 1 slipped disc in my S1-L3 (lumbar) and my sciatica was being naughty and painful. Yesterday was a good day nausea was at a 3 today the runs tried to start but stopped without meds....the nausea is playing games with me today fluctuating between a 5-6 and I did take some of the Zofran and it helped some. Looking back I'm really grateful for the Benadryl and Dexmethasone because I had a horrid case of hives from the Betadine washing from my port insertion. Thanks to the added meds my rash is now G-O-N-E and I just realized this earlier tonight when I realized I hadn't itched at all today I do have a question for any of you (or the Lurkers).... has anyone started having leg pains?? I know my pains from my back and how it affects my legs but this is different. Trying to go to sleep my knees and hips and ankles are really achy. Also my shoulders hurt/ache. Could this be SE from the Taxol or the Herceptin? Anyhow I'm glad those of us who have started are doing well. Prayers to all of you and of course to those who'll be starting up treatment soon.",

I had a moon face too but didn't realize how bad it was until recently with losing 14 pounds. Sorry you're having bad food cravings but sometimes there are things missing in our diets... maybe your body is craving grease lol As for side effects of the meds the GOOD news is once your done with treatment things will start to go away. For me the insomnia is much better as it is now something that's not a daily thing but a sometimes thing. The aches and pains for the most part are also better there are some that like to remind me of what I've been through....for me right now is the lymphedema post surgery. It's a constant battle and seems the revision surgery only made it worse Like you I SO WANT TO FEEL NORMAL and feel COMFORTABLE in my body again! It really stinks what cancer treatments are doing to us!! I hope my darling is that you bounce back soon... there's a Golf club with your name on it and several balls labeled cancer that you really need to knock the crap out of!!",

Grabbing ice cubes... water hotter warmer than warm hurts... I accidentally quicked my thumb nail the other day and it was more painful than I recall. Only the pads/from 1st joint to end of digits of my fingers and thumb are still numbish but I never expected temperature intolerance. Anyone else notice this?? Well today was my day to get out. DH works in another county and we had to gi to his job to pick up new FMLA paperwork to get filled out. Then he drove me around to various places he also works at (He's a Corrections Officer for the State & works road crews). Them we went to the Farm stand came home with lots of fresh veggies!!",
