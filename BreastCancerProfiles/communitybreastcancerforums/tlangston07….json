I am an Insurance Agent but am now on disability. I was dx Jan 16, 2012 at 1:22pm..Yep the exact time my life changed as I knew it with mets to liver right off. I lost my husband of 20 years on 12-12-12 and he was my rock and my everyhing. I did not think I could do this without him but I am. I am just fighting 2 battles now. I had chemo and then right mx in June. I had 28 rounds of rads and was off chemo from June until November when scans showed lung mets. So now on more chemo. I have 1 daughter with 3 kids and 2 of those I have raised since they were 3 and 4. They are now 20 and 21. Her other son is 7. I also have a stepdaughter that we lost in March of 2010 and she left us with 1 grandaughter who is 8. My grandchildren are my life..they have stepped up and are helping me. I have wonderful friends who help when I need them. I try and cherish everyday. I plan on taking a trip to see my family and friends in Texas when this round of chemo is over. I am not done yet as my journey has just begun. I am so glad to have found this site and all of ya'll. I love learning more about everyone. Great Idea! Hugs! Terry",

Well the Brain Rads are worse than any chemo I have done. I had to go to the hospital yesterday for fluids and the ER DR was great. He did a CT Scan on my lungs to make sure of no clots. When he got the results back he said I know your Onc said you had progression in the liver and lungs but your lungs are clear and look great to me.  What a Miracle!!

Then she comes over and puts her hand on my head and starts praying.  Well I had just had a shot of morphine and when she started doing this I thought about the movies also and how she might be a compassionate nurse and put the pillow over my head and put me out of my misery..lol..I had know idea what she was saying as I was watching the pillow..
