I had no help or support last time. I requested to go for the CT then, and he ordered the test. Came back as 'not suspicious' and found 2 more deep in my chest wall. Contacted my new onc at Penn about having the biopsy now and he said to wait. I also believe there is a mistake in the report. My pet peeve--records always wrong. The lump is just above my collarbone and I cn feel the edges. The report said it was .7 cm by .6 cm. No way! It must be 7 x 6 cm. Going back to the PCP Friday. Would you push for the biopsy? If it's back, I won't do anything, but I want to know so I can work on my Bucket List for as long as I can. My parents were in medicine and I have been a patient of someone's from the day I was born. My parents had chronic conditions, I worked in post-grad medical ed for 10+ years, done the caregiver route. So, I'm no dummy when it comes to medicine.  Log in to post a reply",

It's not funny, but I have had overly enthusiastic doctors diagnose me with rare things since I was 23, and not diagnose what I had. The best one was when I was 23--Marfan's Syndrome, because I was very underweight and had long arms and legs. Lincoln had it. I was the wrong gender and if I had it, I would have been dead by now because it is a cardiac issue. He was so excited and got out a measuring tape and was measuring the lengths of my arms and legs. He didn't send me anywhere or follow up. The 4 hour Glucose Toleranece Test was compromised but he diagnosed me as diabetic and put me on a 1200 calorie a day diet! I was a very brittle hypoglycemic back then. Diabetic (3rd gen) now. Then, I went to the major medical center for the Army in Europe. Couldn't get in to see the one harried endo, just a nurse. Came back to the US a year later and not long after was diagnosed by a research endo at the medical school where I was working. It was adrenal. Three breast surgeries in my 20s and yearly mammo's since 30. Then, Adirondack medicine came along ...... and finished off my career, my financial future and my life.  ",
