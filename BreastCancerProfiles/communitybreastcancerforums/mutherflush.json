I had long strands cut off and it looks like a mans haircut. It is now growing again. My main SE with Halaven is fatigue. It hits me like a hammer on day three and I spend the whole day in bed. I get stronger each day after that and by day 8 I'm ok. Ready for next shot. The week off allows me to get me bloodwork back to normal. I've had my first scan but don't get results until 17th Feb so don't know what's happening yet. I wish you good luck with treatment and hope it kicks the big \"C\" into touch. X Helen",

I will get scan after 4th cycle to see if its working. I have had no real se's apart from feeling tired and a little nausea for two days after treatment. In fact compared to Xeloda it seems a doddle.
