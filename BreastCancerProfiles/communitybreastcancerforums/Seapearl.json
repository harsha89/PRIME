    "Content": "Seapearl wrote: had a mammogram last Friday-results read as \"dense asymmetry middle lateral right breast and separate partially visualized lobulated dense mass in the extreme posterior medial right breast\". The recommendation is a diagnostic right mammogram and ultrasound. Should I be worried? Also said breast tissue was dense-51-75%-I'm just freaking out. I'm severely anemic-waiting to get my hemoglobin over 10 to have a hysterectomy and now this. If anyone has any information-would appreciate it!Â  Log in to post a reply",
