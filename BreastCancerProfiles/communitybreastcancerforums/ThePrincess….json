After 4 rounds of AC, I cannot feel mine at all (was 2 cm and I am the one that found it). GOOD LUCK!",

BUT it's quick, and I don't think it's all at once for the whole brow. Mine got thin - and left enough to know where to fill in with brow powder and a brow pencil easily.",

My brain will kick in and remind me, hey you CAN stop whenever you want, you don't HAVE to do this. I don't want to think like that, so when 49 more days seems like too much, I say, well, I feel good enough to make it through today right? No problem making it through today? and that calms me right back down. So whoever wrote that, THANK YOU. Now that running totally sucks the joy right out of me now ( I could run 4 miles in a row, at a pace of 9:30 /min FOUR WEEKS AGO and now I am very lucky to make 1 whole mile at a slower pace) I say, well, I can't run 4 miles, but can i get to the next mailbox?

Because I had a reaction last time, 20mg of decadron, benedryl, and pepid ac as premeds. I have another fever so they did FOUR bottles of blood to culture (including one from fluid sitting in top of port to check there - one was also in arm vein). Also got a chest xray just in case as I also have a slight cough. WHAT A LONG DAY! I hope everyone else that went today has better luck!!",

The nurse said my number was a good number for a day 7 number and didn't warrant any extra precautions - I would definitely be asking more questions about that, esp if you are around animals so much? (We have no pets and no toddlers - youngest is 8). They even approved me to goto 2 of the kid birthday-party places on day 5 and 6. It would be interesting to see a spreadsheet of numbers and days (I would love to do more tests on days 8, 9 and 10 of my numbers and see what they are - did anyone get tests on those days post AC treatment??)

Then it was sort of like a not-quite-bad sunburn? You could def. see the outline of where they were hitting w/the beams. I continued to run daily until the end of week 5 and started again a week after finishing (the jog bra was too irritating to my skin) - at this point, it's all faded and you can't tell. I only used regular Aveeno daily moisturizing lotion (gets a good score in the EWG safety database) and calendula lotion. As for the tattoos - they wanted to put one in the center of my chest that I would see with every V neck shirt I own - after talking w/the tech, she was able to do it in a different MUCH lower spot - you don't have to have it in the center of your chest if you don't want to!!! Good luck - you ladies will do great! Feel free to pm me if you have more specific questions!",
