I exercise regularly and lead a busy but enjoyable life. During my last chemo cycle, I experienced severe joint and muscle pain. The pain came on very suddenly, lasted a couple of days, and then disappeared suddenly. I also have developed tinitis, which I have had non-stop since the first pain episode. My MO ran a full set of blood tests and it turns out that my CRP is, to use his words, through the roof. He quickly referred my to a rheumatoid arthritis specialist. They both agreed that the chemo is causing me to experience severe rheumatoid arthritis, although it is odd that I am experiencing this after being on this chemo for so long. Has anyone else had this type of SE? If so, please share your experience. Thanks! Dx 6/5/2009, Right, <1cm, Stage IV, metastasized to bone/lungs/other, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

After 3.5 years of varios chemos, it seems my lung mets are too stubborn to go away.  They have remained stable for over a year now.  The are described as tiny mm nodes and ground glass in the upper right lobe and lower left lobe.  I am wondering if I could be a candidate for radiation therapy and will ask my onc when I see him in 6 weeks.  Do any of you have any comments or experience with this?  Thanks!

I have always been a little on-the-fence about Oprah, not really knowing what to think when I find her a little too \"preachy\".  Well, I am no longer on the fence about this woman.  I LOVE her! She talked a bit about having cancer.  Basically, she said:  You have cancer, you are in chemotherapy.  But cancer does NOT define you.  It is NOT who you are.  You are here.  You are a positive energy with so much to give to the universe.  Use your positive energy.  Give to the universe.  What you give, you will get back. Enjoy the moment. Live. My son sat there with his arms around me, crying.  I had tears pouring down my face.  It was like she knew me.  Like she had looked into my heart and seen what was there.  She managed to put into words the way I, and many of us on this board, have been trying to live since this terrible diagnosis. After hearing Oprah speak, I will never be the same. Dx 6/5/2009, Right, <1cm, Stage IV, metastasized to bone/lungs/other, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

So I am really nervous... On the other hand, I now have a very fatty liver from all the chemo and my spleen is starting to swell, so I know my body is sending me signs that I should take a break. Can you please share your eperience with me?  How long was your break?  Did you have progression/regression/stability during it?  How long into your break did you start to feel normal (whatever that is!!!!)?
