Thanks again, everyone! ",

      "Content": "knowclu wrote: Hi all.  This is my first post on breastcancer.org.  My mother, who is 63 now, was diagnosed with TNBC in 2010.  Since June 2011 she has had lung and brain mets.  In AUG 2011 she had whole brain radiation, but has declined more chemotherapy.  Before brain radiation she had a long treatment of Xeloda and Ixempra, before that Taxotere and before that something else, which I can't remember the name of any more.  She had been laid off from her job a year or so before being diagnosed with cancer, and has no medical insurance, so we don't really have a treatment 'team'; just an oncologist.  Since brain radiation and giving up her home of 30 years, my mother's appetite has become non-existent.  She is in pain.  She says her kidney hurts, and she has the 'dry heaves' a lot.  We have visited the oncologist twice during this period of not eating and kidney pain. 2 rounds of antibiotics were prescribed, and her condition is no better.  When I finally got a chance to talk to the onc. on the phone, she was pretty much like \"I don't think she has a kidney infection.\"  I asked about admitting her to the hospital to get her some intravenous fluids to help her feel better.  The onc thought it would only help for a few days and wasn't really for it.  In the mean time, my mother still insists she has a kidney infection and her urine is orange. ( I know she's dehydrated.)  I was taken aback by the oncologist's 'hands off\" attitude.  Maybe since my mother has declined more chemo the oncologist counts herself out now.  I'm going to take my mom to the ER to get her some fluids and possibly another urine test today.  Has anyone else had this experience of feeling like you're not getting enough guidance, and don't know what to do next?  This situation is not helped by the fact that my mother is not really proactive about things.  Her original cancer was visible and she was in pain before she sought medical help initially. Thanks for listening (reading).  Log in to post a reply",

Thanks for being here, everyone.",
