      "Content": "Lynn0208 wrote: I am 32 years old and found a lump in my right breast on Sunday.  I called the doctor monday morning and she saw me that day.  She said that since I have no family history of breast cancer and since I'm young, she doesn't think it's cancer.  I am scheduled for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound next Thursday (9/3).  The thing that worries me is that I keep reading that it's a better sign if it moves and this doesn't.  It feels uncomfortable, and hurts when you press on it.  I do not have any children and have never been pregnant.  I had been taking birth control pills for 10 years, and I stopped in June.  My periods were always irregular prior to the pill and this seems to be continuing as well now.  I have also been under a ton of stress the past 3 months b/c my grandfather was very ill and actually just passed away last week.  I would appreciate any thoughts, thanks!
