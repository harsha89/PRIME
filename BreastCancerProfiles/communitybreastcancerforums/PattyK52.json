My MRI saw several spots so I quickly decided I wanted a mastectomy. I had the mastectomy, which honestly to me wasn't horrible. I went back to work a week later. When they got the pathology back afterwards, they found no cancer, it was all taken out with the biopsy! I am just saying, I think when you start worrying you feel all kinds of symptoms that are most likely nothing. I would wait on telling anyone.",
