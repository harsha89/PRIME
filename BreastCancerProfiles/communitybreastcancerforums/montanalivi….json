I finished chemo in June of 2016, finished Herceptin in Feb. 2017. Had a cat scan in March on lungs. they found left lung with 2 3MM spots and 1 6mm, right lung with 2 3mm spots. Just had a follow up scan showed left lung 3 3mm and 1 7mm and right 5 3-4mm spots. But the Radiologist states unchanged in appearance and suggest follow up in 12 months. Does this sound right? how can it be unchanged with the 6mm now 7mm and 4 more spots found.",
