For infusion 3, I still had some mild hives pop up here and there, but nowhere near as severe as the first time. I am now 15 days out from infusion #4, and have had no skin issues at all-not 1 hive, no rashes, nothing. Everyone is different, so I\u2019m not sure our issues are exactly the same, but I had the same severe itchiness on my palms after infusion 2 that you described,and was also worried about a more severe reaction later. I think the dose reduction was the key for me.",

Started as spots that looked like weird mosquito bites, but quickly spread to palm sized swelling under left arm, then inner thighs, then right arm, stomach, shoulders, wrists, inside elbows. I'm so glad you posted because I was just wondering whether the itchy palms might be neurological. That didn't start until Friday. I think I might try L-glutamine & see if that helps. When you mentioned you had the start of neuropathy, did it resolve after you stopped chemo?",

I\u2019m only 3 days post, but thought the fatigue throughout the radiation was better than I expected. I usually had a big hit in the PM every day, but I worked all through it (desk job). However, I was off today, and went back to bed and slept until noon, so maybe I\u2019ve been in denial about the fatigue, LOL. I was going to take Arimidex right after rads as well, but my MO changed his mind and told me to wait until after the holidays to start, so he\u2019d have a better idea if I had symptoms, what was causing them.",

I think it\u2019s my own fault-the first 2 weeks I wasn\u2019t slathering that far up because they weren\u2019t radiating my nodes. When it started to get red, I asked one of the RTs if that was from the scatter field. She said no, your breast tissue goes over that far, so that area was getting a direct hit during the whole breast fractions. DUH! I should have known that! Anyway, it hurts a bit-especially if I reach up with that arm, but it\u2019s not terrible. I think I would have gotten away with just varying shades of pink if I had been hitting that area with my various lotions. The RO warned me today that it may still get worse for 7-10 days, but overall he liked the look of everything. How\u2019s everyone else doing? PebblesV-wasn\u2019t today your last boost as well?

I just started the boosts today. Kinda scary. There\u2019s an attachment to the machine that goes very close to my chest, and it\u2019s aimed straight down instead of at an angle like the whole breast treatments were. My tumor bed is right at the edge of my breast, kind of in my cleavage area. So 1)closer to my heart, even though it\u2019s right breast, and 2) how the heck are they not going to zap the crap out of my lung? My RT said it\u2019s electron instead of photon, and \u201cvery superficial\u201d compared to the whole breast treatments. What little I\u2019ve read about electron vs photon bursts wasn\u2019t comforting, but frankly the reading material was over my head. When I had previously brought up the possibility of lung damage, my RO said that there was roughly a 2% chance of that, vs a 30% chance of local recurrence if I refused rads. So, looking on the good side, I have very minimal skin issues (just light red-no breaks, itching or pain), and have only now gotten some fatigue, but still able to go to work and get stuff done at home. And only 4 more to go",
