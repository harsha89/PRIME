So I get my Mammogram in February and my MRI in August. I believe an MRI will not pick up Microcalcifications , but it is very sensitive and will pick up other small suspicious areas more than a Mammogram. I have to be honest, I get terrified every time I have to have a check up. I was diagnosed four years ago and still get freaked out. Good luck to you all. Cellist",

My oncologist doesn't do the CEA but does the CA-15 and my numbers always vary a couple of points. It's scary when numbers change , I don't like it either. I too had IDC, Stage 1 in 2007. Good luck to you!",

This year the doctor saw an area in the iliac area. there is no flow or or any abnormal flow. he thinks it's a lymph node. They want me to do it again in 2 months. My fear is that this could be breast cancer mets. Five years ago I was diagnosed stage 1, 0 nodes, radiation and arimadex. Has anyone encountered this with there breast cancer?

Tomorrow I see my medical oncologist and of course will get her take on my ultrasound. I too worry extensively when something shows up on a test. I hope your cat scan comes out clean . They are just being super careful because of our cancer history. iThe radiologist also found a sliver of fluid on my endometrium cavity and I too am post menopausal . It's to my understanding that if there is abnormal flow to the area, they are concerned about malignancy. Anyway, good luck with your cat scan results. I know how you feel with the waiting!
