I began to experience severe pain. After some norco use, I began using 25mcg fentanyl patches, with norco for breakthrough. This works quite well. I also use mmj at night and I sleep much better.  My onc has suggested that we could perhaps back off the pain meds, but I don't see how. I'm still experiencing breakthrough pain. He keeps saying the rads should have taken away the pain, but in talking to the rad onc he said only about 70% find pain relief from the rads.  My pain management specialist encourages the use of mmj. I was thrilled. Especially, since the paperwork I had to sign, forbade the use of all \"illegal\" substances and listed marijuana with the usual suspects. On the 3rd visit with her I brought up mmj. She reassured me that it was fine with her and said the paperwork thing was just her way of finding out who the drug chasers are.  Kudra, I find it appalling that any onc's office would say they are reluctant to prescribe pain meds when you are in pain! Mets to the spine/bone can be some of the most painful according to my research.   I have also heard that with all the paperwork and the DEA looking over the doc's shoulders, many docs are reluctant to prescribe serious narcotics. They prefer to send the patients to PM specialists, but for immediate need they should be willing to see you through with what you need until you get in to the PM doc. It seems near impossible to see a specialist these days without a 6 to 8 week wait. You need pain relief now! Good luck to you!",
