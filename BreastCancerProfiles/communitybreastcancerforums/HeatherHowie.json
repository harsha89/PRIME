    "Content": "HeatherHowie wrote: About a month or so ago I noticed that I was swollen in one arm pit area. There is no pain, and no distinctive \"lump\" to feel. But when my arms are raised above my head- I notice the difference. Went to my OBGYN last Friday and he seems to think it is \"fatty tissue\" due to losing 30 pounds, BUT is sending me for a mammo and U/S today- at my request. My mother is a Breast Cancer Survivor, and my sister is battling Breast Cancer right now- which has Spread to her bones and tail bone. I did do the BRAC test back in March-which came back negative??? I am totally confused and unsure about this being \"fatty issue\".  Does anyone else know anything about this??? Log in to post a reply",
