      "Content": "MommyB wrote: Hello all! I\u2019m new and just looking for some possible causes of my symptoms other than BC. A little background on me, I\u2019m a 31yo mother of 3 currently nursing my 6mo. Uneventful nursing up until the beginning of this month. I started on the 3rd with what I assumed to be a plugged duct. I did the usual home treatments for a week with no relief of pain, nipple swelling and some engorgement. After a week I contacted the np at my ob office fearing I\u2019d developed or was on the way to Developing mastitis. When I went on 8/9 she said oh yeah definitely mastitis despite my lack of fever and general unwell/flu like symptoms that typically accompany mastitis. Wrote me for 10 days of keflex 500mg twice a day (pcn allergy)and wanted me back in a week. 8/17 I'm still swollen painful and now have peau d' orange on my left breast with palpable skin thickness. The ob looks at it and says he wants to send me for an ultrasound to rule out abscess and they would refer me out to the surgical oncology group in town to be seen sometime the following week. I'm an RN and have access to physicians and after speaking with a few and showing pictures I was told after working this past weekend I needed to be seen ASAP. I called Monday morning to see if my referral had been sent and if I could get in for an U/S that day. I was promptly told no and they would have to review my referral and contact me with an appointment. Well that didn't sit right with me and long story short after a few phone calls I was able to get in for an ultrasound yesterday. No abscess or masses were noted however the radiologist noted thickening of the skin on the ultrasound and the orange peel appearance of my breast and recommended a punch biopsy which I will be having tomorrow. Obviously I'm desperately trying not to fall down the google rabbit hole and understand why my patients and family members fear the worst especially in the ICU setting. At this point I've been trying to find any possible explanation for this, from a dermatological/ trauma from massage or even infectioninflammatory process that could cause these symptoms. Anyone have a similar presentation or experience? I'm still notably swollen tender itchy slightly red and orange peel skin. This has all escalated in a matter of weeks.

Lately he\u2019s not been wanting to nurse as much on that side because im swollen. I pump and nurse. He does get some formula too. I just wish I had a clue as to what besides mastitis could cause these symptoms in a nursing mom?",

My primary care doc is a bulldog and she got me in quickly after I got the run around! The dermatology route might be possible. We also have a few IBLCs at the hospital I work at and could ask them what they think. I feel like I really should have advocated for myself better! Had it been a patient of mine I would have probably pushed for the biopsy for them! I'm getting a little push back about not weaning from my hubby since the doc recommended it but I think it's just him being worried. I'm wondering if maybe I caught an abscess forming early but there's not enough redness for me to think that. I'm really tempted to try some clindamycin I have at home but then I worry about thrush! I'm gonna keep a close eye on it and if it's not improving I'm going to go back. As for the radiologist I'm not sure, it's a Breast care center run by my hospital but I'd still have to have the oncologist to get the path report. My mom is also an RN and had a class this morning. I told her to go and now she's mad she did instead of coming with me. She would have insisted on the biopsy. The good news is something like 70-80% of biopsies are negative so I've read anyway. I was diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension while I was pregnant which is pretty rare so I'm hoping my rare disease quota has been filled! Lol",

Looking back I should have pushed for the biopsy, if it's not bad I don't see why I should have to wean my baby or have a mammogram. He didn't offer a single other possible explanation",
