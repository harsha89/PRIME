I would choose synthetic over natural hair because it's way easier to care for and i've heard this from others to.  The MOST important thing is to get the right fit- one that suits her head. I had two, the 1st one was my natural colour and I ended up hating it and not wanting to wear it because is always bangled in my eyes. Wig # 2 was really comfortable and I would sugest getting one with bangs, it make it more wearable and if your going to go with a long style it's the best I think. At the wig store you can buy a foam heads and wig pins (the pins are REALLY important) with these you can easilly put your \"hair\" into buns and braids and this is the BEST way I found to make it look natural.      ",

Talking to secrataries is the WORST and in my oppinion they are the most likly to kill you in the hospial. Ask for your oncologists email- as her patient you have the right to it & doctors prefer it. THIS WAS THE BEST THING I EVER DID> I can't get ahold of my doctors and secretaries can be useless but he checks his email like 50 times a day, mine responds even on a friday night at 10pm. If he's worried then he will get you in WAY faster than any nurce can. Ask for an email. This is a very difficult time, I found waiting for treatment to start the worst part. Hugs! ",
