She said the PET showed new cancer activity in my lymph nodes at the base of my neck and in the sternum in my chest.

This should be in some handbook for oncologists. My other doctor called me at home until he got me, even if it was late at night, he even called me on holidays.",

This past February a male judge at the EEOC in D.C., threw my case out and it is now on appeal.  My attorney's are now representing me pro bono after $70K+ in legal fees.  When I think about work and what these evil people put me through, I get so angry.  I don't know what support from my employer means, I know it could have made a difference to me at a critical time. I found out last week the cancer is now in my liver.  I'm still working too.  Discrimination against those of us with cancer is the silent war you don't hear too much about.  I don't have a husband at home to support me nor has it been financially feasible to throw in the towel and walk away.  I still need to pay my mortgage and have health benefits. If you press forward legally, don't look back.  Sometimes it isn't about winning but letting people know you're not down for the count....  Sorry for my rantings, yes some of us still have to work.",

I didn't mean to hurt my Mom but don't understand, if I had a daughter, it wouldn't matter who it was, I would put them in their place if they hurt someone I loved whether they did it intentionally or not.  A simple card that says I'm thinking about you would mean more than someone's missionl of prosletyzing me.  I think I'm on the same team, even though I haven't warmed a pew in a while.",
