And I wish someone would take down that article about how only 20% survive after five years!! I cannot believe you mentioned that site, because it is the same site that had me all upset a few years ago. If there was one thing that depressed me after my dx, it was what I read from that exact site. And it reminds me of the story of the antioxidants, research has been shown where they benefit health, but then this one researcher mentions that too many antioxidants could be bad for someone's health, and everyone goes nuts, starts to believe that maybe antioxidants are not the thing. When I started chemo, the little nurse printed that very article, and showing me this because she knew I was big on natural medicine. Great day, all these thousand of articles on the benefits of antioxidants, and all it takes is one person to say something bad about them. Ok, back to my point, there are lots of successes out there, that site is probably the worst thing you could have read. Well it certainly was for me, that 20 percent stuck in my mind for years. And what is it based on, women from 50 to 90? I might be willing to believe that if 50% of that study group were over 85! You hang in there, and get that dumb article out of your mind, it is foolishness. ",
