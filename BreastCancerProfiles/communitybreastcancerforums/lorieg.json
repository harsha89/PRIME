So, after a short month or so break from Ixempra (while still on Herceptin and Tykerb) my once stable pleural effusions came roaring back. I had been on Ixempra with stability for about 6 months when it was recommended I take a break. Prior to this I maintained stability with no progression on Xeloda and Tykerb for over a year. The Xeloda was stopped while I was NED and within two months the effusions became apparent. Basically when I am on chemo I seem to stay stable, but as soon as I go off things flare back up again. Fine, I can deal with chemo for the rest of my life. HERE IS MY QUESTION........anyone with thoughts/experiences/etc, please chime in. Do I go back on one of the chemos that seemed to keep me stable even though within 1-2 months of stopping them I get worse OR do I try a new chemo? I have never had visible progression while on chemo. My MDA onc said in the past I failed the chemo because I recurred within 8 weeks of stopping it. My local onc thinks go back to what seemed to get and keep me stable. Thoughts? THANK YOU!!!!

Anyway, this is the part of the process I was dreading the most and so far it has been smooth sailing.  My surgeon was extremely pleased with what she saw in surgery, but the 3-4 day wait for the path report is going to be tough. Just wanted  to offer encouragement to others as I know I was a bit nervous about this process.  Because I have IBC I can not even consider reconstruction for a few years, but the chest is not nearly as ugly as I was picturing it.  I told my BS that if I was alive in a few years then I would consider seein  a plastic surgeon! Good luck to everyone next week and let me know if you have any questions!  Hugs, Lori",

      "Content": "lorieg wrote: Hi all, So, I had my 6th thoracentesis today. Give me some lidocaine and a french catheter, and I think I can tap myself at home now :-)   I asked the very nice radiologist what my lungs looked like on yesterday's scans. He took me to his office and reviewed the scans in detail as I was going to wait to see my oncologist on friday for chemo and results. We know I have bilateral metastatic pleural effusions that continue to form, but I also have ill-defined changes in my lungs that they have presumed, since the development of the pleural mets, are evidence of lymphangitic spread. In addition, my CT six weeks ago showed enlarged hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. My CT chest/abd/pelvis from yesterday showed no lymphadenopathy in the chest (which is an improvement). The radiologist also said that the changes he sees in the lung parenchyma look very much like pneumonitis and fibrosis and NOT like lymphangitic mets (which, if true is good). Also the rest of my organs and bones appear normal. So, basically we are mostly just dealing with these stubborn pleural effusions that continue to re-form and are very large. Based on this I think I would call things stable-mildly improved. I see my onc on Friday and will see what he has to say. Continue Ixempra/Herceptin? Consider something else? I would guess continue with the course of treatment based on the scans. One other thing.....I have nodules on my chest that, although have not been biopsied are most definitely skin mets. These are pretty much stable, not better not worse.

My biggest issue for the last 2 years have been my lungs.....mostly pleural effusions but now likely lymphangitic mets which are almost universally fatal in a short time. I saw my second onc (IBC) specialist about 2 weeks ago and actually had an improved chest CT. He seemed quite happy. A few days after getting home though I started breathing worse. Now I am really bad. Things seem to worsen after my weekly taxol infusion. Anyone had this problem with Taxol? I am grasping at straws here as this is most likely just aggressive mets, but I thought I would check. Thanks!

Anyway, I realize that scans would help me with this answer and this is a not very scientific poll, but I was wondering if those of you with bone mets can decribe what your symptoms were like, if you had any??  I have been having very odd back pain in my thoracic spine in a few spots.  I am 33 and have never had back pain other than a few minor sprains here and there and this definitely does not feel like a muscle issue.  The pain does not keep me up or really bother me at night, and it is not even significant enough to bother taking tylenol/ibuprofen, but it does persist when the other bone pain from the chemo has subsided.  I have had 4 rounds of A/C and am through two rounds of Taxol/Herceptin.  It started at least a month ago but was so intermittent I didn't think much of it at first.  I do have a 10 month old daughter  (and 4 year old son) so carrying them around may be part of this issue (I hope!).  I did discuss this with my onc who said we could get an MRI but he thought it was unlikely that I have bone mets since my bone scan was clean prior to treatment.  He also said that at this point we would still just finish the taxol/herceptin and so treatment now would not change although obviously it would change future treatment.  I decided to hold on the MRI and live in my little dream world where I do not have major organ mets yet, but this pain is nagging and annoying *mentally*. Just also wanted to say that I frequent this forum a lot b/c in my heart/head I do believe I am stage IV, and you ladies are an inspiration!  Thanks so much!      Lori, age 33, dx IBC Stage IV 8/09, Grade 3, ER+/PR-/Her2+, married with a 4 year old son and a 1 year old daughter Dx 8/21/2009, IBC, 6cm+, Stage IV, Grade 3, 0/25 nodes, mets, ER+/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

Once you are tired of the surgical bra (I wore one for 5 days to keep the swelling down, but it was really irritating my skin) try the night time nursing bras.  I breastfed my babies in the last few years so still have several.  Those of you who do not have any they can be bought at babiesrus or target.  They are nice and soft and comfortable. I do not have to keep my incisions covered but feel better with a dressing in place.  I have been using maxi pads to cover up the incision.  The stickiness on the back keeps it in place against the bra without any annoying tape needed, Good luck to all the ladies this week!

I feel like it is the skin more than the ribs though....the skin is sore.  I am hoping it is damage from rads or scar tissue from surgery.  I had it on the left for a while too which made me feel better, but the pain on the left has long since gone away.",
