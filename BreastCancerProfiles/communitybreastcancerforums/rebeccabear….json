I'm really concerned about the thryoid thing. Anybody watch Dr Oz? The concern over mammos and even dental xrays exposed the sensitive thyroid to cancer?  I showed my Rad Onc Friday where my chest and all the way up the sides of my neck are pink and warm after just the 2nd treatment. (this is waaay out the the field of treatment for my left breast only) He says radiation \"scatters\" over the skin, but I have heard from women who developed Thryoid Cancer after RAD and I'm concerned. He's putting a device on my neck tomorrow to register the RAD and also double checking my alignments. Anybody had any experience with any of this? And I'm so glad to have found you all! thanks. Not sure how to post this: Diagnosis 2/18/11,IDC, <1cm, Stage1, Grade2, 0/2 Nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2-",
