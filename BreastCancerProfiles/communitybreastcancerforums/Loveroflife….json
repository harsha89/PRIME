Even though there is no report of significant drug-drug interactions between Zoloft and Faslodex, we can't be certain that Zoloft doesn't cause changes in your liver which in turn may affect how your body metabolizes Faslodex.

As I mentioned earlier, what if Zoloft along with how your body metabolizes drugs affect the break down of Faslodex. Both drugs are highly protein bound. Could Zoloft cause displacement of Faslodex thereby causing the latter drug less effective (shorter duration of action of Faslodex) ? I don't know...just hoping and thinking out loud. There isn't enough study out there.",

There is also a Pin Cushion protea that is just as lovely. Rosevalley, just want to hug you for reaching out to the new lady with an autistic child. Who else knows what she is going through, but you and those who have walked in similar shoes? If our suffering equips us to help others, then it's not wasted. Jesus did say that in this world we will face trials and challenges. Suffering is a promise of life. \"I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.\" John 16:33. It would be nice if no one suffers though. I guess we will have to wait.",

Grateful to hear that your walk is a bit better because of the ladies here. We are grateful for you too. Loneliness is not good for our sanity. Sometimes I wonder if the purpose of trials and challenges is to remind us to not be too comfortable with this temporary life on earth and to look forward to heaven where I believe there will be no more pain or suffering.

Fighting cancer seems like finding the right chess move to defeat a shrewd and powerful enemy. Was hoping that the Faslodex was a move that would knock down the enemy for awhile. May tomorrow's dose help control your n/v and fluid output. So glad to hear your weather is pleasant. It is hot here in the valley. High in the 100 today. It will reach 106 both Friday and Saturday. Feel bad for those who have to make a living outdoors in this inferno. Would love to be at Green Lake (Austria), especially this week with the heat wave we are having here. ",

I would be very sad if she could not come to me with her burden. It's very loving of you not wanting to worry your mom, but burden should not be carried alone. It's great that you pay attention to what's going on with your body. Before I forget...certain medicines can cause changes in your breasts. Your breasts can change in relate to your cycles also ; so don't worry too much. Please do keep us posted. Thuy",
