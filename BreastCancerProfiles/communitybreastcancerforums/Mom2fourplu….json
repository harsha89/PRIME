I have thought about PTSD and there is probably a little truth to that. I mean let's face it. Cancer comes out of nowhere and you are sent on a wild ride for months. One appointment after the next. One procedure after the next. I went into mission mode in the beginning. I was just on a mission to do everything and get it done fast. Then the dust settles and I was a little lost. I felt shell shocked. So can I see PTSD as a culprit possibly. But honestly I don't believe that's the main issue. I just feel drained. My brain won't work and my muscles ache. I get out of breath if I'm up too long and if I am standing for more then 15 min I feel like I ran a marathon. This feels a lot like I did when I was severally anemic. I did go to the Dr and he thinks the tamoxifen has done this and even though I've been off of it for 3 weeks that this is just what I'm left with and that this may be my new norm.

Both my BS and my PS seem confused by my pain level. One part of it is that I can't take pain meds so I have done this without anything. A big part of the pain is a burning especially in the middle of my chest. I feel more like a burn patient then a surgical patient. It's also underneath both breast. Is this nerve pain? Anyone know if it will get better? And will the fills for the TE make the pain worse? Thanks for the help",

In fact both of my surgeons said they've never seen this. That's not very reassuring. What is a ten unit? I do use Aleve. It works ok but not great on the nerve pain and it can upset my stomach so I need to be careful.",

The world o medicine is insane. You need a PHD yourself to figure out who does what and who to see for what. I think life was better when you had a town Dr that knew the whole family and came to your house. I guess I watch Little House on the Prarie too much.  4boys, I'm sorry your not having fun either. I feel like most of the other women are doing better then me. They seem to be sleeping in their beds and doing the fills pretty easy and moving on to the next step. I'm still sleeping in a chair and have this burning feeling. Not sure why I'm having more issues and like you said the surgeons seem baffled. But I think it's sad but true that the surgeons job is done and no longer care. This has definitely been a learning experience for sure.",
