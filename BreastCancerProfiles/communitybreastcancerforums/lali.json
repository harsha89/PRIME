      "Content": "lali wrote: I had Neo adjuvant chemo before a mastectomy and have just had a mastectomy. I am waiting for the pathology report - They think they got clean margins but see 2 nodes with cancer cells and are recommending more chemo - details not known yet. I had DD AC and Taxol 4 each. WHile I am glad that they are able to see how the neo adjuvant chemo has worked, I am disappointed that all that chemo has not cleaned the body completely. Initially they thought my tumor was resistant but now they feel it had not reduced much in size but mostly necrotic tissue is left. So the chemo has kinda worked but not completely. Anyone here who had neo adjuvant have more chemo later. I had posted under triple negative but thought I will get more response here. Log in to post a reply",

I am really tender in the chest area and even have a bone edge of the rib cage in the area which seems to have become more prominent. I had it checked out and it is all ok.  I am uncomfortable even wearing a leaisure bra - feel much better with it off. But since I had a single mast. I am unable to go out without a bra (looks odd). ANy advice to feel more comfortable and any tips on the bra situation. Thanks Lali   Log in to post a reply",

It is inter mammary node and not intra mammary as those were taken out with the mastectomy. Will keep you posted on how this goes. Also can you comment on how serious this issue is? Does it mean doom and gloom? Lali  ",

I had had 12 rads. I had neo adnjuvant chemo, surgery and adjuvant chemo as well before rads. Now they want to give me Xeloda that makes the skin more sensitive to rads and continue rads. I also got a PET scan. All is well with the PET except they see a swollen inter mammary node which cannot be removed surgically. They dont know for sure it is cancerous. They might try a boost of Rads on it. It is in the field of rads. Anyone have any knowledge/experience with inter mammary nodes. Dont know if I shd be happy that the PET is otherwise clean or worry abt this. Lali  Log in to post a reply",

AlsoI would not believe the measurements from any tests other than surgery - so maybe your tumor was not quite 5 cm. In my case, my MRI readings were quite wrong after chemo - it reported multiple nodules etc. which was very scary but after the surgery, there was only one node and it was mostly necrotic tissue.  Lali  ",

Right after the surgery, there was a small bump. The doc said that it was a suture perhaps and said we will keep an eye on it. It should have been removed then. According to Susan Love's book, 80 % of folks with chest wall recurrence go on to get Mets. That is a huge percentage. I am going to fight to be in the 20 % with God's help. I must.
