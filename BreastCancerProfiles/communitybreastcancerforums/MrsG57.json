It would have never been found had it not been for a second opinion.  I dont understand how she knew it was fat necrosis within minutes of looking at it.. my only hang up was the lump they marked was not the lump my ob and I found it was many inches to the left.. thank u for replying I guess I have to wait for thursday to see the breast surgeon and see.",

But is it possible for a radiologist not a tech can give that diagnosis. ..because im currently excited with my current diagnosis and after googling fat necrosis im hesitant... ive seen stories of women being tild its fat necrosis and biopsy said cancer. ..should I worry still?",
