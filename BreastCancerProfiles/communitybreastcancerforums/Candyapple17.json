    "Content": "Candyapple17 wrote: I had a suspicious finding on my routine mammo in Jan. Went back in Feb for another mammo and a sono in Feb and then radiologist requested a contrast enhanced mammo. In March I had a core needle biospsy. My PCP told me it was pre-cancerous cells on a mass smaller than 1cm and that I would need a lumpectomy just to get it out. I had that done on 4/11/17. I truly thought it was just pre-cancer cells and that I would be fine because I am very healthy and feel fine. On 4/19/17 - during the post op appt I was told by my BS that I had Stage 2A IDC (ER/PR +, HER-) (2CM mass with positive margins). To say I'm in shock is an understatement. Since then I have met with 2 oncologists and have been assigned a nurse navigator. I had a breast MRI on Friday and am waiting on genetic testing results which should be in early this week. I am scared but strong and I know I can handle this but the waiting is the hard part. I just want to have a plan. I know I need to have a Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy to determine if it's spread to the Lymph Nodes but MO indicated she wanted results of MRI and genetics before proceeding. Sigh.. Today is Mother's Day and my 9 year old son gave me a handwritten card (he has no clue yet of what's going on with me- am waiting to know the plan before I talk with him). In the card he thanked me for caring for him, for buying him a fish and thanked me for our couch (random!). At the end of the card, he wrote, \"I will always remember you.\" Now in my mind I know this is just a 9 year old being a 9 year old but reading this freaked me out and the tears are flowing.... I am so thankful for this site and the amazing woman who are sharing their stories. You have given me hope and education. Thank you!
