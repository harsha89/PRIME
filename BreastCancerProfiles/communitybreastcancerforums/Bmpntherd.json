I was diagnosed with Stage 2a (size) IDC in october and down the rabbit hole I went. I started my 4 rounds of T/C on January 2nd. Thanks to this site, I was prepared for the side effects- fatigue, muscle aches, bone/joint pain primarily. Now 8 days later I've been hit by a side effect I just wasn't prepared for- loss of taste. Prior to this, I would consider myself a foodie- loved to cook, go out and enjoy red wine. NOW- everything tastes like cardboard. I got my favorite sandwich the other day and had to have another person try it- I thought it was bad. Wine- FORGET IT. Tastes like battery acid. Not even going to give it a try- I don't want to ruin this experience for the future. ?how have you all coped with this? ?how long will this last - for the next 3 months of chemo? ?how long after chemo ends? Thank god eating is NOT all about taste for me - so I'm going with the healthy frequent small meal plan and weight is stable. I'm grateful for having caught this cancer when I did (picked up on annual mammogram after 2 normal physical exams and a normal US 2 weeks prior to mammogram). I'm grateful for only needing CHEMO LITE. I have a friend battling stage IV and this experience has given me a glimpse into her courage- 24 hours of bone pain left me behaving like a big baby. BUT any thoughts would be appreciated.

I left work on Friday with my hair and will return monday wigged out. I've gone head cover crazy- hats, beanies, wigs. I have short curly hair and never had a chance to experience diverse styles- I'm using this opportunity to try a bunch of styles, including long hair. My big conundrum was what to wear swimming and I think i've found a solution that I want to share- NAMMU hats!! Stylish, UV protective, visor, cute ties! just wanted to pass this along! I have no financial ties to the company by the way,",

Also I experienced constipation NOT diarrhea. I am managing this with daily colace and intermittent senekot at this point. Luckily no sinus symptoms with the cytoxan. Feel better.",

I just started T/C January 2nd and have had a number of SE all VERY manageable. Reading peoples stories on this site really helped me prepare. Fear is reasonable but you will get through this. I was told that SEs were very similar cycle to cycle so hope this is true. Remembering that each person is different - this was my experience. The steroids PUMPED ME UP! So day 1-3 I was somewhat tired but very functional- went to the gym, had a little shortness of breath but not bad. Day 3-4 were the worst in that I had increased muscle aches and fatigue- needed naps and a little (a very little) percocet and did well. I went to work and got through the day OK. day5 - good. Had a little hip pain on day 6- responded to ibuprofen. Now day 9- feeling good, cleaning the house and doing laundry! Overall, YES chemo kicks your butt BUT it is manageable. I heard about using claritin with neulasta through this site and started claritin the day of my injection and for 7 days after. Did well. Feel free to message and you are NOT alone!",
