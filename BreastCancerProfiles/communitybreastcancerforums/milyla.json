I have been trying to get someone to take me seriously for eight years. It all started with pain in my breast. It would not go away, I could not even stand for it to be touched to do an exam. I was put on vitamin E and also had to forgo caffeine. This did not help, they sent me for a mammogram and I was told I had very dense breast tissue but that was all. So I went seven more years suffering, then last year I noticed a mass forming along my ribcage just under my breast. It hurt as well. I once again went to the dr and was told yet again you are to young to have breast cancer, I was 38 years old. I had another mammo due to family history and they did not see anything yet again. Now another year later and this mass seems to have enlarged and I now have little bumps like a rash or chicken skin along my breast. Also I have a hard ridge under my breast and three hard lumps. I also have pain when I lift my right arm. I am worried I will be yet again brushed off, yet at the same time I don't know if maybe I am being paranoid about it all. Has anyone else experienced anything like this. I do not know what to do. Oops I meant brushed off for the headline. :) Log in to post a reply",
