I feel like after this one I\u2019ve lost the most amount of hair. I do still have some left but other people i have spoken to have said they didn\u2019t lose much hair but I am losing sooo much. Did anyone else have this? Does the hair grow back at all while I\u2019m having treatment. At this rate of hair loss, I\u2019m pretty sure I won\u2019t have any hair left by the 8th treatment. Can anyone offer advice or have similar situations? My doctor swears she\u2019s never had a patient lose all of their hair on CMF but I\u2019m beginning to think I may Be her first.  ",
