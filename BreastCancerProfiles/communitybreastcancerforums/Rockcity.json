I too used the olympics as something to get excited about while waiting to feel better and distract me from cancer. Hope the rest of your chemo is easy sailing from here. ",

I have had 3 cycles of Taxotere, carboplatin and Herceptin. My MO would like me to add Perjeta to my remaining 3 treatments and for the rest of the year with Herceptin. Diarrhea is a very common side effect. For you ladies who are on Perjeta, do you have problems with diarrhea? Is it manageable? How long does it last? Is it continual? Anyone not have diarrhea? I have my 4th infusion Tuesday and need to decide. I hate adding another infusion, but I want to do what I can to go after this cancer. ",

It makes such a big difference. Mahteacher- for bone pain from the Neulesta shot, try regular Claritin once a day and Tylenol or Motrin if needed. It seems to help most people on this site. I\u2019m not on your chemo regimine, but a week of fatigue sounds normal. Call your MO if you are concerned. They can give you some advice or determine if they want to see you. Hope you feel better soon",
