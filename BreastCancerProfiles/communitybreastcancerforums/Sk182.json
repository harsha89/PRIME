    "Content": "Sk182 wrote: Pagets*** not sure how to change the topic line A couple of years ago I had an IBC scare, and now I'm psyching myself out with a Pagets scare. I got pregnant in August and miscarried after 6 weeks, and now I believe I'm pregnant again, but won't know for another week or so. I had the same scabbing a couple months ago, but no active discharge.My breasts have been starting to hurt and ache, but my left one has felt especially odd. I noticed a tiny scab on my nipple, kinda yellow in color and not on the other nipple. Of course I Dr. Googled it and now I'm afraid of Pagets. There's no extra redness or scaling of the skin, but I'm afraid of this crusting I found. Anyone deal with the same issue and have it not end up being Pagets? Log in to post a reply",
