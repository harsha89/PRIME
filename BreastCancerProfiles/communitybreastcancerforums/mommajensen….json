I was discharged from the hospital the next day with 4 drains (2 per side). On Tuesday 8 days after surgery the surgeon removed the lower drains on each side. The left side did not hurt I just felt a tug. The right side on the other hand hurt and burned as it was being removed. I am suppose to call my output in next week. So far my remaining two drains are still having 40 - 50 output daily. Today I notice a funky smell when I drain them. Is this normal? I am not in a rush for the drains to be removed if they are doing their job and I am scarred about the pain during the removal process. Is there anything I can do to lessen the pain when they are going to be removed? My surgeon said it will hurt.",
