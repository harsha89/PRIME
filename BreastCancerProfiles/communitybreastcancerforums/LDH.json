She was out of town but another doctor in the practice was able to see me. He felt the lump and made an appointment to have a mammogram and ultrasound. Fortunately, I was able to be seen within two days of seeing the internist. When I had the mammogram and ultrasound, the tech said that she didn't see anything that caused concern, she passed the films on to the radioligist who said the same and I was sent on my way. This was not my first mammo.So the radioligist ordered films from my first mammo which was 3 1/2 years ago. When I had my second child 3 1/2 years ago, while breast feeding in the hospital, I passed blood clots in my right breast. The lactation consultant said that she had only seen this happen one other time during her 10 years as a consultant. My OB asked me to stop breast feeding and ordered a mammo for 6 weeks post partum. I had the mammo and was told all looked fine. Well, the radioligist received the film from years ago and compared the film to the ones just a couple of weeks ago. My doctor and the internist who saw me received the radioligist's report and called to tell me that there was \"nothing to be overly concerned about\" but wanted me to see a breast surgeon. The call caught me so offguard---not at all what I expected after the \"nothing is showing up on the mammo or US\". When I received the call from my internist, I was at work, my 5 year old was in my office along with 2 co-workers and I just didn't have the chance to put any thoughts together. I am scheduled to see the breast surgeon on Tuesday and have been more anxious with each passing day. Does anyone have any advice, anything similar happen to you, any questions that I should be prepared to ask the surgeon on Tuesday? I am trying to educate myself as much as possible but witout seeing the report myself, I really don't know where to begin. Lisa Log in to post a reply",
