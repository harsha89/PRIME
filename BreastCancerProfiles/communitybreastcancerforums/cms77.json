Now onto rads. I agree, it's good to have all us share out experiences and learn from each other. Looking forward to hearing from others starting rads this month and those that have already been through it.  Christine ",

Also got 2 of my 4 drains removed, so I feel like progress is being made. Only have 100cc in each TE, so the plan is to start expanding me next week.  I seem to be rambling, but I'm very pleased with my outcome so far. Pain is almost gone, really just a little sore from time to time, so I've been using Mortrin for the past 2 days. On antibiotics 4x day.  Been having issues with nausea, so have been taking Compazine leftover from chemo which really helps and  Ativan for sleeping at night. Thinking of Terri, CJ, and Vikki today.  I know you will all do wonderful and heal quickly. Continued healing to the rest! {{{hugs}}} Christine ",

And hoping for very little pain as well, but everyone is different. Christine",

The chemo I had before surgery really did it's job on me. My pathology came back showing no tumor at all in my right breast so the chemo wiped that out completely, and 4 of the 18 lymph nodes showed signs of cancer.  Prior to chemo, it was thought that a dozen or more nodes had cancer.  This is all good news for me going forward with the rest of my life.  I am still having radiation since the tumor was resting on the wall of my chest, and just to make sure all cancer cells have been eliminated, radiation is highly suggested.  Then after radiation, I too will have hormon therapy. MDG:  Welcome and know that even though chemo sucks, you will survive it.  I understand how scared you must be. I was very stressed about it as well and all the decisions you have to make. It's a long processes getting better.  Christine",

Have never watched so much tv in my life  Surgeons were both very happy with the surgery, said I did great, and are very happy with the way my skin and incisions look.  Will be seeing PS sometime this coming week, hoping to get rid of at least two of these drains. Will get another fill in my TE's; only have about 100 cc in there now. Each day is better than the last. My advice is to take things one day at a time and to roll with whatever comes your way because you can deal with it and things will get better.  This is doable. Christine ",
