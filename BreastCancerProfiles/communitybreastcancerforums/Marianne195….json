So I continue on with gel in my remaining hair looking quite \"edgy\".  Not ready to go out in public without my wig though.  I've never been one to be the center of attention and I'm not starting now.  Hope everyone is doing well today. Take care. Marianne",

Best wishes to all of you and I'll check back next week after chemo. Marianne",
