As many of you probably already know from another post of mine, my mother had her lumpectomy this past tuesday May 19th.  She is currently on bed rest for the next 7 days until we see her surgical team/oncologist and any one else involved in this process, on the 29th.   Any ideas on what she may like us to do for her, entertainment wise....i mean, she's already sick of just lying in bed all day and wants to get up and about.  of course i \"forbid\" her to lol!  i know what she will enjoy (watching movies, maybe a few books to read, puzzle books etc) but was there n e thing that you may have done, or someone did for you (or even looking back something u wish was done) that you can suggest i do for her to make the time pass or just lift her spirits when she seems to get down?? Thanks!!! xoxo! Log in to post a reply",
