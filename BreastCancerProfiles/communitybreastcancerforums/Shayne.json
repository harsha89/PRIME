My Onc said not to get to paranoid about food etc - but its what I can control....so i feel better not eating gluten, dairy, and limiting organic meats and alcohol...no coffee.....I feel better than I have in months and  so glad to be on the other side of this nightmare - and youll be there too, v v soon!  The waiting is hard, believe me, we all know.....distraction, family, girlfriends...exercise, pets.....funny movies, xanax - all were lifesavers during this time for me......Reach out - people in your life want to be there for you - they feel as helpless as you do in this.....  Sending lots of love and compassion your way today - ",

Its been a year since mine and looking back, I would have chose the same treatment.",

I wasnt scared, until the woman setting up my appt mentioned the microcalcifications - now Im super worried, trying to stay off the internet.   She said they MIGHT have to do a sterotactic biopsy on the calcifications, but wont know until they see my films.  My films were SUPPOSE to be Fed X to them Monday, but are being shipped today bc someone forgot!  They usually do not make appts without seeing and having the films first, but my friend who had BC a couple years ago and went to this Breast Center, made some calls for me and got me in.   I have a lot of support - but my husband is out of town and I feel very alone with this.  My sisters both live 2 states away but I have been talking to them on the phone.  Im trying to stay positive, but fear is overtaking me every 15 min or so.  Making the appt yesterday made it so real - i thought I would feel relieved, but Im not.  I have read a lot of posts on how easy the biopsy is.  Im a huge baby when it comes to needles and anything medical.  Im a v healthy person, exercise 5 x a week, have never had anything major happen to me besides having my gall bladder removed 20 years ago.  Looking for someone to talk me off the ledge - Im so scared and worried - even tho I know how useless these emotions are.  I feel like Im trying to hold it together and Im barely able to do it.  thanks for any replies and words of hope!

I wasnt scared, until the woman setting up my appt mentioned the microcalcifications - now Im super worried, trying to stay off the internet.   She said they MIGHT have to do a sterotactic biopsy on the calcifications, but wont know until they see my films.  My films were SUPPOSE to be Fed X to them Monday, but are being shipped today bc someone forgot!  They usually do not make appts without seeing and having the films first, but my friend who had BC a couple years ago and went to this Breast Center, made some calls for me and got me in.   I have a lot of support - but my husband is out of town and I feel very alone with this.  My sisters both live 2 states away but I have been talking to them on the phone.  Im trying to stay positive, but fear is overtaking me every 15 min or so.  Making the appt yesterday made it so real - i thought I would feel relieved, but Im not.  I have read a lot of posts on how easy the biopsy is.  Im a huge baby when it comes to needles and anything medical.  Im a v healthy person, exercise 5 x a week, have never had anything major happen to me besides having my gall bladder removed 20 years ago.  Looking for someone to talk me off the ledge - Im so scared and worried - even tho I know how useless these emotions are.  I feel like Im trying to hold it together and Im barely able to do it.  thanks for any replies and words of hope!

      "Content": "Aug 8, 2012 07:39PM - edited Aug 8, 2012 07:43PM by Shayne I got a pack of 3 cotton sports bras and basically wore them 24/7 after surgery and after rads.  Found them at Walmart for 10 bucks. Got them a size bigger for comfort, but really, didnt need to do that in hindsight.  I had one front closure sports bra - but it wasnt v comfortable and only used it after rads.  I needed something I could sleep in, and i cant sleep in a regular bra.  Find them totally uncomfortable even during the day.  Now im back to my camies and light bras.  Tho I still wear the sports bras under my stretchy workout wear just for added support when jumping around at gym or cycling. ",

When is your surgery?  Mine is May 25th.....and i wish it were sooner......Somehow im not worried about the surgery - its the radiation and the 5 yr meds - but that information will be coming soon after my appt. I know ill get thru this......on my best days i believe that.....and can even see how this has been a blessing.  But on my worst, well, you know where i go - youve all been there...... ",

HOpe it goes smoothly for you.  I know after I meet with RO, ill feel better - or at least have the info to make a decision that will make me feel better.......feel like time is going in slow motion right now......and not in a good way.  Peace all!",
