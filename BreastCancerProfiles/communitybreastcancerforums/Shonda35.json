I had clinical breast exam done yesterday and have to wait for a mammogram and I am scared silly. I hope yours are hormones and nothing else. I will pray for you cause I know its scary. {{{{HUGS}}}}",

It does hurt so I guess thats a good thing!",

I had a breast reduction done 5 yrs ago and lost feeling in sides of my breast and had burning sensation pain in my left breast for about a year, thought I was finally getting some feeling coming back, my cousin was diagnosed with bc from a painful little knot that she found. Her dr told her bc doesnt hurt so she wasnt worried and nobody went with her to dr and it was bc. Her diagnosis made me realize I havent done breast exam myself and that maybe this burning throbbing pain I might need to so that night in bath I thought I would....looking down at my boobs I noticed my left breast the nipple was kinda inverted so I grabbed it to pull it out and had small discharge that was greenish, kinda worried me since I havent breast fed in 8 yrs but still didnt think much of it noticed I couldnt finish breast exam cause burning pain kinda like ripping sensation was too much in my left boobie. this past few months my left breast has grown over cup size bigger than right one and its so noticable to look at them and feels kinda engorged and uncomfortable. I am self employed so I dont have insurance so I saw ad in paper for free mobile mammogram coming to town and called them, they made me appointment for clinical breast exam which was this morning and as I just found this weekend and the dr today found I have a peanut size hard knot on my breast kinda towards under arm which he says is suspious and wants diagnostic mamogram done. Now since I dont have insurance I have to wait a little over month for an appointment. Waiting is horrrible and I have searched the internet which in turn has given me mixed signals....yes I have some worrisome symptoms (change in breast size, nipple discharge, inverted nipple and lump) but they could be anything but most say bc doesnt hurt which would be comforting but since my cousins did I dont know if she was exception to that rule. The internet along with my throbbing boobie pain has gotten me depressed which is silly I know but none the less and having to wait a month or more to find out doesnt help. I want to know before you were diagnosed if you had pain or throbbing sensation as a symptom. I just need temporary peace of mind until I can get actual testing to get peace of mind. thank you for reading my story and taking time to help Log in to post a reply",

I want to see my oldest son walk across the stage next May, I want see grandkids and my youngest son now 6 turn 18 to see what kind of man he turns out to be, if my worries turn to reality...I will not go down without a fight but its made me realize that we are not guaranteed a tomorrow....ever...I never thought \"bc\" would be in my lifes immediate catagory  and I know have a new respect not just sympathy for you diagnosed ladies, its a hard reality and it isnt fair at all. I will be glad to know either way..waiting is so nerve-racking...and glad to know that if I need it I now have a place where friends know and really understand the struggle.",
