If I decide to not be in the study, I would get Taxol and Carboplatin. I do want to have a chance to be offered a drug that may be more specific, and to help researchers develop more personalized treatment options, so that is a plus. However, I would lose the opportunity to have Carboplatin, which has shown to have higher rates of complete pathological response when added. Has anyone been in ispy2 trial? What would you do?

It is my understanding that I can withdrawl at any time, or if I am not responding, have my treatment changed, though I don't know how that would affect the study results. I will first go through the screening phase, which includes a biopsy and mri that will match me with the drug, so I don't know what the drug is, but I will be given that information and all of the side effects at that time and decide if I want to continue. It is phase II, so the drug has already been tested in humans. kayb- You are correct, they were very clear about being able to withdrawl at any time. There have been 45 women enrolled before me, but not all received the same drug. My only concern is that I will miss out on Carboplatin as a first line treatment. They will be monitoring me very closely with mris, but I worry about losing that time. Maybe I need another discussion with my MO to address this concern. My gut is saying go aggressive as possible.  ",

I have met with an oncologist and surgeon in my home town who are giving me the option of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy to do lumpectomy, or to do a mastectomy. I am in the process of seeking a second opinion at MD Anderson in Houston and originally they told me I have lumpectomy option, now after reviewing my rads, they think that I have calcifications (even though MRI was clear) that would take lumpectomy off the table. I am still unsure if I will seek my treatment here, or go back to hometown. Does anyone here have any experience with surgeons/oncologists at MD Anderson? Would my chemo treatment be any different? Any advantages, disadvantages. Also, has anyone done neo-adjuvant to shrink a tumor for lumpectomy? I am mostly seeing mastectomies after neo-adjuvant, so just curious. I know each case has its unique features, but I would appreciate hearing about anyone's experience with this hospital. Thanks.

I cut it to my about my ears before treatment. It started coming out in my fingers, hair brush, and shower around week 3 or 4 (I did weekly dose) in larger clumps. Around week 7 it looked like what I call Beetlejuice hair, thin halo strands, but bald for all intents and purposes. I didn't cut it only because I wanted to wear hats for the summer and its cheaper than buying a halo, and feels much cooler. Its going to fall out anyway in 4 weeks when I begin AC. Hope that gives you an idea.",

I saw my oncologist today and she commented that my hair is holding up well, lol. I wanted to show her the bags. She wrote a prescription for a wig, just in case my insurance will pay for it. I don't have any headcoverings yet, except for a baseball cap since I thought Taxol was supposed to be easier on hair. Wrong. Where did you find the scarf? There is a site called cure diva that has tons of cute headcoverings, they are kind of expensive, but I think if you buy $125, they will take off $25. They also sent me a coupon for 20%. But I will have to wait until my next paycheck, hope my hair will hold out til then, lol!",

I had no problems with nausea, and some neuropathy in my finger tips and toes towards the end. My blood counts stayed a little below, but still close to normal. I am a week out, so I'm not sure how long it will take to return to normal, but it should. Also some bothersome body aches towards the end. But nothing too bad.
