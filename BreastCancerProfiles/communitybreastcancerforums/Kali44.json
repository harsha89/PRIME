Good luck getting your MBA... u r awesome experience thx for the heads up re: Miaderm. I cannot wait to get started and done with this chapter and on to recon.....I am happy ingredients to stuff my bra before I can get a prosthesis as I was told by a fitter that you have to be 6 weeks out after surgery before u an fitted because of the swelling and I am ready.... Mariangel43 the problem is exactly that there aren't many of these machines but I think doctors should let patients know because may even someone is a able to fly to the area where there is an available machine. That's why it is so good that we can all find different boards to share information. I am also going to ask for protection for my thyroid. So much we do not know.... Dargonsnake ty for your input. It only co fir s my de ision as to the fact that this treatment is probably best for me.  Thx all....wishing you all a good night",

At first was a bit disappointed however, I am typically of the belief though that everything happens as it should, of course, after trying/doing whatever you can and when I spoke to my rad Onc she said, because I am flat chested with no TE or anything, the photon therapy might have been more harsh on my skin so, hopefully it does not get too bad. I get started on 25 rads from Aug 9th. Set up is on Aug 8th. So I had my sim yesterday and boy no one warned me how painful those darn tatts would be I am fine with admitting that it was unbearable, for me, and I even cried.... Anyway, I think I am still traumatized by that part of the experience but it is over now and I am moving onward and upward. I can say this after having two red sangria drinks with hubby",

I told her I really want to move on from all the treatments and as I mentioned above... I am tired of all the reading and decision making with so many possible side effects with everything. She said to think about it some more and if I changed my mind by the time I see her for simulation I could do the proton rads. Anyway, I had a little chat with myself and felt I owed it to myself and my family to make sure I had done the research and also that I cannot afford to get tired. Only breaks are ok. So, I have been reading up on it and it seems to be a good option for me... I think lol with that said I thank you very much for sharing ur experience with proton therapy and now leaning more towards doing it instead of photon due to the fact that my bc is on my left side and therefore it is closer to my heart. Thanks again and I wish you all the best and if u belong to a group please let me know as I would love to hear about your progress and others as u go along and I can also share mine with you and others too",

My hair had been growing in nicely and I was pretty happy in the beginning but I feel that once I started anastrozole things quickly went downhill for me. After all, it didn't take very long for my hair to quickly start thinning in the front and sides üòØ I have other side effects from anastrozole but for now I can deal with them, takes a lot for us women to give in to anything quickly üòä The hair loss however, is killing me. I started biotin recently and hopeful but I want to throw everything at this and to be prepared in case it doesn't help. I recently saw an ad for keranique and wondered if anyone ER+ was cleared to try any of these hair regrowth treatments besides Rogaine. When did you truly see an improved difference after using hair regrowth product and how long before you saw a diff. We are going on vacation later this year and I want to feel comfortable swimming and not worrying so much about my scalp showing üòî Thank you for any help. Help please üò£",
