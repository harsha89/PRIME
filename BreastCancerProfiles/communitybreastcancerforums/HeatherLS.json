I ran several miles on a regular basis while in radiation. Granted, I was so tired at night - pretty much fell asleep at 8pm every night, but there wasnt the sick feeling that comes with chemo. Good luck with your decision <3",

Drives me nuts! :) Everytime I see my onc I ask for scans and everytime he says \"not yet. You will probably be able to talk me into them by your 2 yr post appt.\" Ugh. Strange since I only had 1 node taken and it was positive, we chose not to take more nodes and go straight into chemo. We know that chemo didnt work (1 small tumor I had pre chemo grew bigger during chemo). Its a little unsettling!",
