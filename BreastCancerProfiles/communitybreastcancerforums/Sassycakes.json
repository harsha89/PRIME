A month later, i told my pcp that i had felt a lump in my left breast, so he sent me for an ultrasound on the left breast. Report said benign intramammary lymph node...no follow up. So today, i had my 6 month follow up on the right breast and was able to speak with the radiologist. He recommended a biopsy on my lump(right breast) and asked me about my left breast. Since no follow up was requested....i told him its still the same. He basically told me to go back to my pcp and tell him i want another US on the left breast so he can order a fna. I dont understand why he wants this now when they put no follow up needed on the report. Ive been having swelling off and on for 6 months now, itching, and a dull pain only in my right breast/arm. No issues with the left other than the lymph node thats always enlarged. Any thoughts on whether or not i should do the fna? Log in to post a reply",
