I have something in my breast that feels quite big but I can't say it's a lump but just some tissue, rubbery like, moves easily, kinda squishy like but I don't have it on the other side. I'm 33, no history and had a perfectly clear breast MRI just under 2 years ago for another issue. But I'm scared this is thickening and was reading up on it. Log in to post a reply",

Is it like the skin would be thick, like the rind of an orange or grapefruit, like that? I feel something that feels like a pancake sorta, it's movable and soft like, feels like my other breast tissue, honestly, it's just bigger and more pronounced and I can't tell where it's edges are all the way around. Half of it I can though. I was just at my GYN office a month ago for my check up and she said everything felt Normal. I suffer from major health anxiety and have had 3 mammograms, 2 ultrasounds and breast MRI abd countless breast exams by my GYN and a breast surgeon within the last 2 years, all clear, and I'm 33 with no history. So I'm trying not to run to my Dr if I can qvoud it as I'm trying to work on my anxiety. Last year I was there for 4 different breast exams. Ugh! Sorry I'm completely rambling. Lol",

I found a indentation on my right breast, its vertical and linear. It shows up when I lift my arm up. I had a mammogram, ultrasound, breast MRI all clear in April 2016. I had a repeat mammogram in July 2016, still clear, ultrasound November 2016, clear. Its been 19 months since I noticed it and it hasn't changed so Dr. concluded its just stretched skin from having my kids/ breastfeeding.",

Anyway, went and saw my OBGYN this morning, so she came in and we talked a couple minutes about life in general, how she cut her hair and l liked it. She noticed my anxiety right away and made a comment \"you have anxiety but I love ya!\" lol! I explained what I felt, how it half way went away during my period and then I told her about the flashlight thing. She dismissed the flashlight thing immediately and said that is not a true test and to never do that again. She said immediately she wasn't worried about what I was explaining because it was squishy and it partially went away.... She then did an exam and felt both breasts pretty well. Then I pointed out what I was feeling and she said I have are fibrocystic changes and she said its something I'm going to have to get use to. She said that it was a cyst and it left behind a scar tissue (which is probably what I'm seeing on flashlight, although she didn't suggest that). She said when I feel something like I feel, I need to give it 3 cycles before worrying. She said if after 3 cycles it hasn't gone down then come in. She was a little surprised that it being so big that it didn't hurt but other than that she wasn't concerned. She told me not to even chase it, that its nothing.... Then we talked about my anxiety, quite a bit. I told her I wanted help with it and I couldn't deal with it anymore. She agreed to help me. She gave me an herbal anxiety med to try. She told me how to take it and other patients that have taken it before and loved it. Its called \"Bliss\" antistress forumla. She said if I like it, then I'm welcome to have more. That was pretty much it, overall it was a great visit and another confirmation on how much I love my Dr.",

I can move it easily and it's soft so I wasn't completely alarmed over it considering I'm 33, no history, had a clear breast MRI, mammogram/ultrasound and my breast are not dense, less than 2 years ago. I had all those tests for an unrelated area that cane back as nothing. Well last night I ran across something how you can shine an L.E.D light through your breast and if an area shows up as a shadow or dark spot it could mean something that needs to be checked out. Well my curious mind decided to try it and the area I feel showed up dark. I read that a cyst will show through, which is what I was thinking I was feeling. Ugh! I already suffer from health anxiety so this did nothing but terrify me! So needless to say I'm seeing my gynecologist next Wednesday to see if she will send me for mammogram and ultrasound. I'm terrified! Log in to post a reply",

I thought it sounded ridiculous too but as I further read up I found case studies that made it seem legit at the same time. Regardless, I'm going to trust my Dr and what she decides is best. I keep hoping my clear MRI in April 2016 is still meaningful. Especially since this thing is is like two finger widths in size but painless and that's what concerns me.",
