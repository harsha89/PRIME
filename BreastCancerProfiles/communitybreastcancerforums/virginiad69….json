To be reading that other people are experiencing or have experienced what I am going through right now!!! I finished radiation in early December 2012 and NOW, 6 months after, I can hardly breathe and am experiencing chest pain/tightness. I also had ALL the symptoms that most of you describe, building up slowly, starting back in January, about one month after the end of radiation: tight throat, constant swallowing, mucus buildup in my nose and throat, now have a stiff throat/neck and can't breathe at the same time as I talk, eat, or drink. Absolutely terrifying!!! The rad doc REFUSES to admit it could be caused by \"his\" treatment, but I just saw a specialist in Europe who says this is a COMMON rad side effect!!!! Especially if you happen to be a thin woman, like I am. Will this EVER get better??? I used to run, cycle, swim... now i can barely WALK! It is truly terrifying. The turmeric post gives me some hope. And also knowing that I am not alone. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for all posting like this! May try to join a forum, as it could be helpful to share with others about this.",

Which I still am having: tight, sore throat, swallowing constantly (mucus/fluid buildup in the oesophagus perhaps?) The ENT also diagnosed GERD but medication doesn't seem to work.Â Does anyone know if these symptoms ever get BETTER over time??? so scary.",
