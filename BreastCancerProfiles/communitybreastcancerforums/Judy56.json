I have done a lot of research on vaccines and this is the only one that can be widely used.  I was treated at Dana Farber and the majority of vaccines rely on boosting the indiviudal's  immune system.   Dr. Tuohy's vaccine stops a chemical reaction that BC cells need to reproduce.  I have been in contact with his office and I am trying to help.  My sisters and I are working together and we call ourselves sisters4prevention.  Google us!  I'd love to hear from you.  I have a lot of info on the progress. ",
