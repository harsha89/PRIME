The strange thingis noone has done any bloodwork on me since this has all gone down.  I thought that was quite odd the cheapest test available and noone ordered one.  I know I will be getting me fair share of bloodwork now, but I just pray they don't find something else. Is anyone taking anxiety medicine or anit-depressents?  Or am I just becoming a \"pillhead\"? ",

On a side note I got my hair chopped off tonight about 8 inches to be exact.  Inverted short bob.  My stylist got the razor out to make the straight edge in the back which was bizzare.  I've never had my hair this short since I was a child.  But, thought why not do something I would never do under normal circumstances.  Took five years to grow it and all of 30 minutes to hack it off..it was kind of liberating and sad all at the same time.  Blessings and Hugs to all.",

Ann..do tell about the semi - permanent wig.  I'm very interested...how does it stay on? Lisa..Didn't bet the biotine, but I'm going to. I agree..nothing is really appealing to me in the food arena either.  Cheese and crackers is about it.  I had a steak salad last night and it was ok..I just don't want to hate all my favorites.  Mary..thanks for the encouragement it's always nice to have someone chime in that we will get through all this and by next year be back to \"normal\"!  Feeling ok today...still pretty tired and achy, but better than yesterday..I do have terrible red marks where the tapes was for my IV.  Doesn't hurt just looks terrible...",

Rachel..thanks for the direction on how to take the Nuelasta that was going to be my question to you all.  Since I will have to take it now as well. Does anyone do it the same day as chemo or is it always the next day? Robin..I'm anxious to see how it works for you too so please keep us posted!  And I have felt fatigued the entire time..go figure! Hope everyone is well..",

I don't know the answer to your first question.  They gave me two anti neausea meds and they seem to work just fine.  I don't beleive any of us actually experienced much neausea. 2.  weight..again i think we all are a bit different.  I have not gained any weight and probably lost a little, however after my little stay in the hospital i did put on a couple pounds, but i think it was all the fluid they pumped in me.  I have had taste issues so nothing tastes very good to me.  although this week that seems to have passed.  I'm due for my second treatment next week. 3.  Personal choice.  I chose to purchase a couple..figured I would mix it up and I live in PA and thought II need a little bit of something to keep my head warm although I also bought hats.  They do have halo's you can purchase so it looks like you have hair coming out of your hat.  kinda of a nice hybrid approach.  I too have a five year old son and thought he might be freaked out, but I think we underestimate our children and what they can handle and/or care about.  At the end of the day I really think I am more concerned how he feels than he actually feels (if that makes sense). Good Luck to you Josie.  Sounds like you have a good attitude going in.  That's half the battle. ",

Jampus..Welcome to the group..I went all out with the changing of the hair..cut it very short...got a long wig a different color than my normal..I figured everyone that knows me knows what I'm going through and if I had to lose my hair I was going to have fun with it..I agree with Lisa it seems pretty quick to chemo.  I waited 7 weeks after my lumpectomy before I started..and was glad I did. Ann..Sorry to hear about the rash..did anything help?  A couple people suggested talc powder or maybe even gold bond powder might releive it..cool it off at least..

Wave...so glad you reached out to your friend..that is such a touching story..I do find myself very emotional and I now tell my entire family and DH family I love them and thank them..they were never very verbal about this and It's definately catching on..We hug more and appreciate each other more..and it is a much better way to be!  I agree I can't even think of chocolate doesn't sound good and I tried a piece and spit it out..It was terrible and I love love love dark chocolate..that's the last time I'm trying it until after this is all over! Lisa...I'm so happy to hear you are doing so well with round 2. It's encouraging and I agree I need to get my butt out there exercising, but living in PA it's going to be awhile before we see 60..so I have to just deal with the cold, I've just not been inspired or felt well enough to do so.  So what did I decide to do but we are going to adopt a greyhound..that will make me get out and walk.  Not sure when we will get one, but we are looking forward to it..I've always wanted one and my husband is not a fan of how they look...but I threw out the BC card..I know so wrong, but you know sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do..I think he/she will be great for our family and I will have to get my butt out there and walk!! I'm so excited it's been four years since we had a pet..after my cat..I had a hard time with that one and then my son being so young I wanted him to be a little older so he can participate in taking care of the dog!!  Talk about spinning plates...what am I thinking doing this while going through chemo, but I'm hoping it will be a great distraction for all of us!!!

Back to campbells chicken noodle soup and scrambled eggs..but it's something..yogurt doesn't taste very good either..just gotta wait it out and towards the middle end of next week I will turn around..This one just made me so incredibly tired...Anyone else feel the same way with tx 2?",

Wild...yes we live very close.  We should meet somewhere sometime!!  Have you done any support groups or anything in Cranberry?  I hear there is a pretty good one at the UPMC in Cranberry.  I think they meet the 1st and 3rd  thursday each month (i beleive).  I know there's also one in Butler that meets the 1st Tuesday each month. I've talked to a few folks, just wasn't feeling up to it right after my treatment...and to hear they get worse each one?   Good grief..I'm not sure I can take worse body aches than I had. I will definately be getting myself a little pain pill from the doctor...Advil didn't even touch it.  I had a left over viocdin from my surgery that I split and that did help a bit.  Kimby...Good for you with the side effects!  I hope it's continuing to be smooth for you! ckk...please keep us posted on what you learn about the food!!! I with Ann I'm game to try anything that might make me feel better!  And good luck on the cold caps..I considered it, but thought with my luck I would do all the work and my hair would still fall out!  And my hair isn't all that nice anyway.  I'm kinda anxious to see what color it really is...most likely grey! Lisa...So very happy to hear no more FEVER!!! Yaahooo! And glad you're feeling better..that's very encouraging!  Thanks for the hugs! Ann...glad your feeling good!!

I'm just finishing up Cipro so I'm going to have to check the side effect information on that one.  Hopefully it will be out of my system before I have to start my steriods on Monday.  Happy Holidays to all, in case I don't have a chance to hop on!!!

Ann...I totally agree about thinking it's everywhere.  I feel the same way and I like the idea of an Oncology Psyciatrist.   Very interesting and I think I will look into it as well.  My issue is not only each ache and pain, but the doom and gloom it's going to get me and metastize somewhere else..I just don't feel the chemo is taking my recurrence rate low enough.  from 15% to 11%..I don't know still seems high to me. Please keep us posted how you do with the Claritan I'm so damn afraid of that shot I can't even tell you.  I was so sore just from the Taxatore that I can't hardly imagine additional bone pain on top of it!  I'm with Lisa..we must move on and it's no way to live in constant worry.  But, it's tough sometimes. Ckk..Good to hear all went well. I'm not familar with that med..sorry I can't help. That makes me feel better you opted for a MO closer than going into the city.  I just have this fear of being in a smaller town going to a MO hear rather than some of the best in the Country, but I figure once you have the elixer should be able to be delivered anywhere although the new place does it a bit differently.  I hope that works for me!  Ugh! Wave..I hear ya I want me old life back too..the only thing that get's me through is knowing that maybe from my experience I can help someone else...which I already have...many of my coworkers, friends and facebook friends have gotten their overdue mammograms...But, I get it I still think about the days before the call that changed my life.. Michelle..welcome aboard the train nobody wants to ride, but I would ride anywhere with the ladies here.  They are all wonderful and amazing woman as I'm sure you are as well.  Sounds like you have a great attitude and as we all say that's half the battle.  It's a great place to vent and know that all of us understand what your feeling. I agree you feel so alone when you're surrounded by so much support. They all want to help in some way, but sometimes I struggle with how they can help when I don't know what I need, but my family and friends are amazing.  Glad you're here and please keep us posted and check in with us.  We all do really care!!! Happy Holidays to All!  I've got a five year old climbing the walls Dec. 25 can't get here soon enough!!! But, I wouldn't change a thing I'm loving watching the excitement in his eyes!!!!",

Thanks Gracie..the vein they used for 2 tx is still brown where they put the needle and up my arm..my nurse did tell me the veins will come back in time..that's refreshing seeing I'm running out on the only side they can use!  I'm glad your tastebuds came back faster this time..I've lost about 10 pounds since diagnosis and was liking the fact I was losing a little, but I typically gain back what I lose on my bad weeks..I ate pretty well this weekend and today in preperation for no tastebuds tomorrow or tomorrow night.. xoxo Heather",

So for me (at least so far) I thinkk #3 has been a bit easier..Now tomorrow marks 7 days out since infusion, when I say easier let me qualify it..easier as far as my taste doesn't seem to be as terrible as it was (i can drink water and coffee doesn't taste so bad) and some of the other SE's so far haven't showed up (specifically..explosive diareahha (yea..that was awful)) I did drink more water this time and seemed to be more thirsty..so I went with it and I do think it helped..Now the fatigue, well that wasn't really easier...I tried my hardest yesterday to get out and try and do a little shoveling..I did very little and well had my breakdown (I'm not used to being a weakling or have such little stamina, but I couldn't do it) I did a little put my head on the shovel to rest said a little prayer to keep me going, but started getting dizzy, etc.  Now, fortunatley my next door neighbors have four boys (10 and up) (mind you we don't know our neighbors well at all..they are a little snooty around here or at least that's what I thought) anyway one of the boys came over and asked if I needed help (i was only trying to do one side of the driveway)..and of course I said..YES!  I told him I would give him some $$$ for helping..well I paid him $40.00 I know that seems like a lot, but seriously no amount of money would have been too much!  I just handed him the money..he had no idea how much..He did my entire driveway..and came back to the door later to tell me I paid him too much..he couldn't take all of it!  Now, that is one good kid..kudos to the parents!  I told him please please keep it and maybe he and his brothers could go do something fun or buy something to share whatever!!  Keep in mind I know my neighbors have no idea what we are going through over here..We just don't talk to anyone or see anyone..So that is my uplifting story for the day!!! Lisa...almost done sweetie!!!!! Mine will be Feb 6th..seriously just want to get done.. We're getting there ladies... Hugs to all xoxoxo Heather",

Great idea riding your bike!  Just make sure you're up for it! I'm sure you will, but I wonder what happens when you're riding and get a hot flash?  I seriously think I would melt! Momof3..great hair story..and your sons reaction just cracked me up!  Wave..you made me laugh thanks!  I feel the same way! And I'm with the others!  The Bahamas would be fantastic!!! Josie..I had the same issue with my DH..But, I didn't tell him what I needed either..but sometimes it takes more effort to explain it than to just do it..I would like some hair too.. Gracie..Hope you feel better soon. Bailey..glad the pup is settling in..sorry for dealing with Alpha dog syndrome right now..hopefully that becomes clear quickly! I too need to get some new pans soon..I have Emeril Wear which is made by Al Clad, but it's non stick..guess I gotta consider stainless..I almost bought his stainless collection on HSN.. ckk..sorry you had such an issue with your RO..that just sucks. I'm still fighting fatigue as well although this week has been a bit better. Ann.  hope your mom is doing well and I'm sure that will help her immensely..I hope your primary can give your eyes some relief..please keep us posted..And I hope you start feeling less stressed. I had three radiation treatments this week..so far not too bad, but tonight I've got a little tingling/pain going on...weird..my RO nurses say it takes about two weeks for things to start breaking down (skin irritation, etc.) yippee...As for deodorant I've been using Body Luminosity I got it from Etzy.com..It's working much better for me than the Arm and Hammer Essentials or whatever it is..and they have some very nice scents..I got the ok from my RO that I could use it during Radiation..It's a vegan product out of California.  No aluminums no parabens..all natural ingredients.. Hope you all have a good nights rest..I will be sweating for sure tonight..It's currently 50 degrees in Western PA at 12:12 am!  Crazy winter!",

You do get achy afterwards, but not horrible.  I wish all of you luck and the 2011 December sisters are a great resource.  If you have any questions I would be more than happy to help  if I can.  If I can't I am certain one of the December 2011 sisters can.  God Bless All of You!

Rachel...glad to hear you're doing so well and  were able to participate in your rehearsal and meat and great!  Good job I'm day 12 and still can hardly get off my couch.  Supposively this is should be my I feel 100% week. I'm anxious to see if that's the case.  I really do hope they can adjust my dose or something (although they pretty much put the hammer down on that suggestion).  I guess the only answer is neaulasta.  Ugh.  I sure hope I don't have any issues with if.  I'm not going to even look up the side effects.  Maybe if I don't know I won't get any!  And I hope all is alright with me getting me next one..I don't want to extend this process if I don't have to! Have a Happy Sunday! xoxoxo",

Glad to hear you all seem to be doing well and we are all working through this crap at whatever pace we can handle.  These hot flashes are too much and I find myself not wearing the damn hot itchy wig.  And my skin is so darn itchy from rads..i have a pretty good rash going and they gave me aquaphor..it doesn't help much. My RO said my skin near the scars looks fine..so i get to keep on going.. As for the group therapy..i've gone a few times, but struggle a bit with them..I'm all about letting everyone get an opportunity to talk, but some folks don't feel the same way and will take up a majority of the time not letting others speak..makes me sad.  My cousin (stage 4) felt that support groups were not for her and she did quite well.  For her she just didn't want to continue to talk about it after dealing with treatment, doctors, etc.  But we all are different.  I apologize for not addressing each of you individually..I know I'm being so damn rude, but the fatigue is getting to me today..weekend catching up to me!  But know I'm thinking of all of you and adore each and every one of you!!!  Heather",

I need to get my plan in place.  I would like to get this moving so I'm not doing chemo the week before Christmas.  I have a five year old little boy and this is the first year he is just over the moon about Christmas and I want to feel good enough to enjoy it with him.  But it's coming so fast I'm not sure they will be able to get me going in time!

I had a similar experience, but at the pharmacy and the tech had just gone through breast cancer appx. 9 months prior she gave me her home number and her husbands cell number in case my husband wanted to call and talk to him..And she looked great..  So glad your designer was with you for \"the call\".  I was on the road with one of our sales reps when I got the call..fortunately out of 15 different sales people it could have been with it was the one that is like a brother to me and I've known for 10 years..he had a long 3 hour drive home with me, but he kept me sane and was able to get a chuckle or two out of me..Again so thankful for those small blessings! Love all you ladies..and so glad we have each other.. Heather",

Tomorrow the nuelasta shot..yikes, but they prescribed my vicoden to use for pain..my plan is to take one before I go along with the clairtin and try and nip it in the bud..I notice under Betsy's toolbox...she took the claritin the day of and five days after I believe... Thanks for the prayers, positive energy, and hugs from all of you...means so much to me and I hope I can keep myself out of the hospital this time. Ckk..i hear you on the taste issues..i didn't have a metal taste, but nothing tasted very good except for as others mentioned campbells chicken noodle soup..i think it was the sodium that helped..and popsicles tasted good to me. Wave..Sending hugs to you..It's not a fun ride, but it will come to an end eventually..My cousin had breast cancer 6 years ago (stage IV) and she said her first treatment was the worst and the remaining 7 she did where not that bad,  she went every week for something but the tough one (she did A/C) was every three weeks, that was the one that was the toughest for her...She did some sort of chemo for an entire year (she was HER2 + that was why).  .  So I look at what she endured and figure I can get throug 4..Are you taking any anxiety medication or anything.  I take celexa once a day which really does help keep the depression/anxiety at bay..Once I get through this I will get off of it..I also take a Xanax at night to help me sleep and keep dreams away..I think now I can probably go without it, and did for awhile until I was hit with having to do chemo and I got worked up and my mind wouldn't stop.  It definately helps. I hope your appointment went well today and they can give you some relief..getting up and moving does help, but it's getting the energy to even start..I don't do a whole lot, but do try and get up and walk a bit..it really does make you feel better to get the fresh air at least. I'm saying a big prayer for you as I do for all of us..keep us posted please. Lisa..thanks for your postive attitude and prayers..Your posts always lift me up..Thank you Thank you..It sounds as if you're doing quite well after the second infusion..That does give me encouragement.  The new place seemed fine..didn't meet with the doctor she was on vacation, but I met her plenty while in the hospital..Hugs to you my friend. Josie...I had the exact same feeling in my mouth..It was awful and it's starting to feel all dry the first day this time..I hated that feeling..It did go away by day 10/12 while I was in the hospital and then I got the dreaded huge mouth sores..so they gave me a couple mouth swishes for it..one was magic swizzle..which really numbs everything and makes it feel so much better for awhile..especially if you have a sore throat you can swollow some of it.. BJMRN..sorry you had to head to the emergency room, but I'm so glad you didn't get admitted..that was not a fun experience..my mouth was a mess too..I hope it starts feeling better for you..sounds like it is already in a short time..by the third week I felt really good..even after my hospital stay..The hair thing didn't bother me either after I had it cut short..not such a big deal..I actually went out for lunch today with no wig, just my fleece hat, I didn't want to wear the wig in while getting my chemo..it just gets too uncomfortable sometimes and well all the people there are in for the same thing!  Then headed to Panera after my appt for lunch with the hat..nobody stared at me..and if they did who cares! Ann..I'm so glad to hear your doing well..It's encouraging and you sold me on the claritin for sure!  I can't even imagine doing the taxotere every 2 weeks..I know it wouldn't take as long, but geez you need that third week to feel \"normalish\".  And I can't agree more with your closing statement..Many have done this before and more and made it through..and so will we!!! Bailey..good luck to you on Thursday..1/2 way there!!  My insurance didn't pay anything towards a wig.  Boo..they didn't even know what a cranial prosthesis was..Oh well I paid out of pocket..and it was worth every penny. I hope all are on the upswing with your SE's I'm sure I will be were you are next week, but really hoping not this time!!! Thank you all for being here and your support.  I think and talk about all of you daily..You are all great..and we will have to think of a place to meet once this is all over! ",

Heather...Way to go girl!!!! You did it!!! You're DONE!!!! Yippee!  I saw the crystal..do you have to wet it?  I thought that was what it said and I thought it would be messy and I would have it everywhere..I'm kinda clutzy!  The edible arrangement is a good idea..although I really don't feel like I've connected with the place I'm going I think mainly because I didn't start there, but I will find something to take to them!  I hope your se's stay away and your adrenaline helps to keep them away!  Next week at this time I will be on the other side too!  Last one is Monday!  Hope you all have a great night! xoxo Heather",

But I must say it is so darn itchy and hot with the hot flashes!  I so wanted to take it off last night!  Have a wonderful evening and a good night of sleep!",

Kellogs..I decided I wanted to do a test with my legs and arm pits and didn't shave them for awhile so I could see what was going to happen..here is the result...my leg hair I've lost some, but not all and my armpits nothing..I do have some stubble on my head although I do see some spots with nothing, but mostly the stubble is hanging around after two infusions..third one scheduled for Monday..Yippee.  I too have three wigs..two I bought and one someone gave me that didn't wear it..I too would like another but I already have quite a bit of $ invested and it is only temporary..the one is blonde and curly and I haven't worn it yet..it makes me look washed out, but I'm thinking once treatment is done and I get a little of my color back and such I'll give it a shot.  The one I wear mostly I think I'm going to have cut a little shorter (inverted bob) in a few weeks just to shake it up!  I do have to say getting ready is much faster and I kinda like it!!! Instead of an hour I'm done in 20 min!!! Whata..after my first infusion two days later..Aunt Flo showed up...nothing like adding insult to injury..after my second treatment however..i had some sorry to be gross...\"brown ick\" for a day and that was it.. Hi Rachel..headcoverings.com has some nice hats..I got a few I wasn't too thirleed with, but most of them I was (specifically the soft baseball hat).  I struggle with the turbans..they are just not my favorite look for me, but I bought quite a few knit hats at Target that I wear quite often and love..being winter I wear them to the store around the house, etc.  they are comfy and great!  Hope you all have a great day!
