Breathing problems , so inhalers , diarrhoea , aches in joints , weight gain , little sleep , totally depressed , horrendous hot flashes every one hour without medication ( two hours with ) night sweats  , incontinence and soreness ........you all know what I mean , really bad . I´ve been prescribed letrozole from five different laboratories , sometimes the same one for a couple of months , then from a different lab. \" from Barcelona , one from Madrid , and two from two different labs in France, Then two months ago i was given Femara ,. Within 10 days I could feel the difference in me . My breathing was easier , bloating was gone flushes and sweats were still there but more managable . The biggest difference was in how I felt mentally , I feel like me again !! Yes , there are still problems , but they are more bearable . My feet are dreadfully swollen and my ankles and fingers , but i can put up with that better . has anybody else found this to be the case or is it just me . I cannot believe this is a co-incidence .   Log in to post a reply",
