I was really hoping for local anesthesia but my GP feels the mass is in a location which may present some challenges. It seems to be just between the end of the breast tail and a rib, very close to my chest wall. Surgeon will call me in the morning and I should be in the OR before the end of next week.The mass was noted on ultrasound but was difficult to assess for some reason. This means it was present before biopsy and unrelated to the procedure. I am 2 weeks post biopsy and my incision - all 5 mm of it - has formed a shallow ulcer the size and shape of a pencil eraser plus a lovely red halo. I told the radiologist that I am a very poor healer and would prefer at least some glue or butterfly sutures. He didn't listen and now I have an infection.",

There is palpable thickening in the ULQ confirmed by clinical exam.  One of the clusters ( 2cm FN) is palpable.  I have had intermittent unilateral secretions from the left nipple, onset 6 weeks prior.  I had some flaking after I got out of the shower so just rubbed it off with the towel. Looked down a few minutes later and there was a bead of blood.  I didn't think much of it and just wiped it off, figuring it was external, from the skin (if that makes sense).  It was coming from a single duct at the 1:30 position.  It has been very scant over the last 6 weeks, usually clear. I just found out that I can't go to Mt.St.Joseph's because I do not meet the requirements for their pilot.  Apparently they only accept patients who have positive findings on clinical exam but have yet to undergo further imaging other than a screening mammo.  I have already had an ultrasound followed immediately by a diagnostic mammogram, then more views with spot compression.  I am hoping to be able to go to NRGH in Nanaimo as they have an MRI unit and stereotactic core biposy machine in their facility. I am a single mom with two children.  My son is profoundly disabled and medically fragile.  His Dad is very involved and supportive - we are great co-parents.  I am the sole parent to my daughter and her father is pretty  much out of the picture. ",

He changed the machine settings in order to turn on what I think was something that checks for blood flow, vascularity, etc connected to that area.  There was a larger, short, oval shaped red spot adjacent to whatever he was looking at, then below it at 5 o'clock were a few blue dots.    He finished, told me to hang tight while he showed the images to the radiologist.  He said something about the rad wanting to look at things himself sometimes but he thought it would be fine.  Nope.  Radiologist came back with the tech to take a look.  Radiologist says ''We aren't seeing too much of significance but ...\"  then he stopped himself and said ''I would really like you to have a mammogram. \" Well, d'uh, thats what I thought was going to happen.    Off I go down the hall to the mammogram machines.  She takes 2 shots of each breast.  Same thing, I need to show the radiologist but you should be good to go. Comes back 15 minutes later and says \" I need to take some more views of your left breast \" but go ahead and get dressed after.  2 more shots and off she goes again to the radiologist.  Comes back AGAIN and says \"I need two more \".  Each time she came back she took views from different angles.   She comes back for the last time and tells me to get dressed and I can go.  I was then told the report would likely be ready that evening or tomorrow morning and to make an appointment to go over things with my GP.   A couple questions ... Isn't a mammogram usually done before the U/S ? Coming back so many times and taking different views must mean that there is an area of concern, correct ?   A garden variety cyst does not usually have a blood supply, right ?   The area of ''concern'' looked like two triangular mountain peaks right beside eachother. I guess this means angular margins and the blue/red spots from the doppler mean there is some blood supply going to whatever they are looking at ? Thanks for your input. ",

She told me this morning that because our community does not have a f/t radiologist, mammography reports usually take 7-10 days. Mine being available in less than 24 hrs would be unusual according to her. Trying not to read too much into things but its hard :s. What has me concerned is the number of spot compression views the tech took of my left breast. That and the fact that the radiologist kept sending her back in to take more shots. Thanks for confirming the meaning of FN Jadineva. All the best to you as you wait for your results.",
