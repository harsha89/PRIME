I do not have a date for my surgery, yet.  I'm having the genetic test done on Thursday and I will be making an appt. to consult with a PS, so I probably won't have a date for a few weeks.  I hate the waiting game.  I'll be thinking of you mybodymydecision on the 27th...glad you can get through Christmas before having your surgery.  That was my kids' concern...they wanted me well for Christmas.  Keep us updated on how things go! ",
