      "Content": "Oct 17, 2015 09:03AM Sandina wrote: I had a lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy (negative) three weeks and two days ago. Breast incision healing well, but within a week my sentinel node incision site started developing a painless serom that by this morning had grown to the size of a tangerine. A couple of weeks ago the BC surgical nurse said to let it resorb over time, because aspirating it could cause infection. Two days ago I had my first RO consult--RO examined it and said it looked okay and I should fully remove the steri-strips, which I did; and I could resume wearing my favorite underwire bras. (I am a 38I, so soft bras give no support). Early this afternoon as I leaned closer to my bathroom vanity mirror, I felt something warm and wet. At first I thought I'd inadvertently turned on the hot water, but my top (and favorite bra) quickly got soaked. I heard squirting/gushing/sucking sounds and to my horror saw I was literally dripping blood & lymph. After getting the runaround from the hospital operator (who claimed there were no nurses available, even in the Breast Center), I made her call the center with a Priority message, and I finally reached the BC surgical nurse (my surgeon was in the OR), who had me slap a dressing on it and come in. She recommended I just keep it covered and let it drain, but I was afraid of infection, so she called in the other surgeon, who sutured it. I have to keep it clean and dry and change the dressing every day (expressing a little fluid if possible). I get seen again next week--day after my initial RO simulation session; sutures have to stay in a week or two before I start radiation. Fortunately, I'm only getting external accelerated partial breast radiation, so the sentinel node site won't be irradiated, just the tumor cavity with appears fine. From all these horror stories, I don't have a good feeling about this--and I have major antibiotic allergies.",
