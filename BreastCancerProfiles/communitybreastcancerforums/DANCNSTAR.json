I found this forum while web searching to see if others have or are experiencing the same issue.  My breast bone/sterum is swollen and at first I was told I had a cancer recurrence; very scary!  After X-rays and MRI, it was confirmed to be costochrondritis.  I also get out of breath with chest heaviness. I even went for physical therapy which did help some. It's a very disconcerning condition and seems to act up when my lymphodema is bothering me.  I never had a problem during radiation, however, I am small boned. I have a follow-up appt. with my family doctor in a few days to keep it checked. Any information we can all share is vital and helpful.  I'm just wondering if it's all that rare?",
