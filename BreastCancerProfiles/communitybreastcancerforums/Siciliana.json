Other than wanting to take an occasional short nap, and going to bed a little earlier, I really haven't felt much fatigue. I have tried to eat a lot of protein and lots of leafy greens, and drinking more water. Maybe that helped.",

I usually respond \"Good.\" and change the subject or find an excuse to leave. I even hate it when my own mother asks me, \"So how are you, REALLY? Have you lost weight?\" Maybe I just like to pretend that I don't have this disease and when people ask me about it, I have to think about it again. Sometimes I just would like to go a day without thinking about breast cancer.",
