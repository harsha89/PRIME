I think I'm happy to shrink my tumors but just trying to adjust to all the changes.  The good news is she said she is almost positive it's not in my lymph nodes and all my scans were clear, thank god.  So no surgery on Oct. 11...  I am wondering though what's going on with my tumor marker blood test...  the results are back, but my Onc. didn't want to discuss it with me until she gets the results back of some more ca blood tests she just sent away today... hmmmmm...  I'm thinking something showed up in my blood and that's also another reason they want to do the chemo right away... to kill off anything that may be present in my blood.  At least that's what I'm guessing... does anyone else know?  So welcome to our newest members!  I guess I am not an October surgery gal anymore... ",

      "Content": "Sep 26, 2012 11:53AM - edited Sep 26, 2012 12:05PM by Leigh22 Hi Chrissera, SimplyAudre and chickenlady!  I was starting to think I was the only one!  It looks like all of your surgeries are coming up before mine.... two of you on the same day!  I know your surgeries are going to go just fine.  Chrissera - I, too, am ER+/PR+,HER2+.  I just got diagnosed Aug. 28 so this is still so new to me.  I am so happy to have others to help get through this... never really been too sick before and now this!  I actually bought tickets the day before my diagnosis to meet my husband up in Boston for 3 days (military)... I thought I'd have to cancel but it turns out the doctors want me to go and have a good time with my family... I'll get back two days before the surgery... not so excited about the trip anymore, just want to get this surgery over with... anyway, I'll be heading up to your neck of the woods! SimplyAudre - I am also getting TE placement but I'm not sure if they are doing the latissimus dorsi reconstruction right then because I might get radiation later, they just don't know, and that would mess up the new tissue.  Chickenlady - I know, I am also counting down the days.  I've been on the site that tells you of the things you should buy for the hospital and for home... I went to Kohl's today and bought a flannel nightgown that buttons up the front, two zippered hoodies and soft stretchy pull-on pants.  Also got some more pillows for my bed.  Still have things on my list to get but still have time.  So good to hear from you all. ",

I'm just curious because I have a lot of cancer in my breasts, HER2+; two tumors in each one and they are around 2 cm. each or so.  Since one tumor is close to the center of my chest and doesn't have much tissue around it, and the bs said she'll have to scrape some of the muscle below it and remove the skin above it;....  so I'm wondering why they aren't doing chemo first to shrink them so they could remove them easier and may prevent the need for radiation.  Welcome!  I'll add you to our growing list of October gals above!",

They told me at my bs office that if the tumors shrink to nothing, they may do a lumpectomy for the areas where the tumors used to be... I don't think I will do that.  I am positive I still want the BMX, especially since I have two tumors in each breast and am triple positive... the cancer is more aggressive.  I know I'm not getting surgery in October anymore, but would like to keep up with all of you to encourage and support you through all of this.  I wish you all the best of luck with your surgeries and will be staying on here to see how you are doing.  Maybe I can let you know how the chemo is going to be if you haven't had it yet.  This is going to be a crazy ride, but life throws all kinds of things our way... we just have to keep going and stay strong and positive. ",

I can't wait... I have so many questions. ",

I had thought that after 6 rounds of chemo and a bilateral mastectomy that I wouldn't need rads. Oh well. He said its because my clear margin was not wide enough... I think it was .9 mm, one sentinal node had a tiny amount of cancer cells, and he would have liked to see more than 7 axillary nodes taken...(I had one sentinal Node positive out of seven..... He wanted to have at least ten nodes taken out.). I go for the initial appointment May 9th and start getting rads the following week. He said he's going to do my left chest wall and a small part of the left axillary nodes, but not by or above my collarbone. I'm glad I found this thread...

This is the weirdest breast cancer I think they've ever seen!  On the right side, it's 2 tumors, 1.2 & 1.3 cm each, grade 2, ER+, PR+, HER2-. Any other mastectomy ladies needing rads?  I'm worried because in my left arm, they did a SNB and one node tested positive with a scant amount of cancer cells, and then they did an Axillary LNB and took out 7 nodes and all were negative and my bs told me the radiation will dramatically increase my chances of getting lymphedemia in my left arm... :o(  My margins were clear and I had no vascular invasion in my breasts. I have a strong feeling the RO is going to recommend the rads.  I'm a bit scared.  Should i be this scared?!?!  If all 7 of my axillary nodes were negative, will they still have to radiate them or can they just radiate the breast?  I have so many questions for the RO.  I have TE's in now but my PS isn't sure he'll do implants if I get rads.  I also wonder now that I'm a stage 1 in my right breast and a stage 2a in my left breast, if the RO will have to radiate both sides or just the stage 2 side?  I don't know much about radiation as you can see!  I know I'm jumping the gun before I even see the RO, but I've seen ladies with pathologies better than mine who are getting rads. I just had no idea that you could still need rads after mastectomy; I thought the chemo and surgery would do the trick... guess I might be wrong.  Thank you for any help you can give me!!!  Leigh ",

I know once I talk to my RO I will be able to make up my mind.... I just hope he says I don't need it so I won't have to make the decision. Are you still in chemo... I looked at the date you started and thought you might not be done. If my RO tells me it will lower my recurrence risk by as much as yours, I'm pretty sure I'll do it. I don't want this coming back and will do whatever it takes to not go through this again. My ps is great as well. He mostly only does reconstruction. He does a small amount of cosmetic, though. He's very cautious and said if implants don't work, there's lots of options for me. He said he can even take some fat from my tummy and put it under my pec muscle where the implant would go and then could do a lat. flap procedure. He said I didn't have enough fat on my tummy for a tummy flap procedure, and said I was too slim (I love him for saying that!) but I'm 52 years old so I know I've got a few extra pounds on me. He's just waiting to see if I need rads and if so, the reconstruction will wait.",

If so, she has always said she really doesn't think I'm going to need radiation because she always felt it wasn't in my lymph nodes just by a \"hands-on\" clinical checkup. I actually haven't seen her yet since the surgery and pathology report that showed a little cancer cells in my left sentinal node only. I see her next week for my every 3 week herceptin infusion so I'll get her opinion then. Thanks also for helping me to calm down and get my mind back to healing. It's like 77 degrees here today and I just walked 1/2 mile with my DH and my DS. Very nice. And Bookwoman -- thanks for sharing info about your friend. That gives me hope! Leigh",

I had to look twice at your avatar cause I thought it was me!!! My hair is exactly like that right now, same length and color! So happy it's growing back. After reading on here about ladies who have gotten lymphedemia even when only one node was taken, I am not taking any chances. I guess I'm being a little over cautious... At my ps office today, I asked if the nurse would take my blood pressure on my leg... She looked at me like I was crazy.... Or maybe it was the gorilla hair that has managed to show up on my legs out of nowhere... :o). Anyway, the leg option didn't work. My husband said they need to lie me down for it to work. Well, I go to the RO for the first time this Thursday so I can find out if he recommends rads or not. I've been doing a lot of reading, especially that European study about radiation after mastectomy. Now it's weird but part of me wants the RO to recommend rads... I know I'm in the grey area, one positive sent node, 4cm tumor (shrunk to 2.5 cm after chemo), HER2+,... I just am afraid of some stray cells lurking that I don't want to leave behind. The plusses I have are age 52, clear margins, no LVI involvement, grade 1 tumor. Okay, enough of me worrying about it...just need to see what he decides on Thursday... I hope you all are having a great week and are getting through all of this... (((HUGS)))",

I was also diagnosed about 6 months ago.  I feel like I'm coming out of the fog of chemo and am beginning to feel myself more and more each day, but I'm forcing myself to start thinking about the surgery.... it's just looming out there and I am both anxious to get it over with and scared at the same time.  I have two tumors in each breast which I'm told is rare but my onco. told me at the last visit that she couldn't clinically feel them anymore so that made me a little relieved.  I'm happy you started this thread, Kap!  I'm looking forward to us supporting each other through this.

I've already gained quite a bit of weight during the chemo; I'm trying to lose some before the surgery. ",

I feel like I should be getting prepared but I think I'm in denial right now! LOL).   I asked my oncol. today, as I was there getting my tri-weekly dose of Herceptin, and she said not to worry about it at all and that the cancer will not start growing or spreading... I think I asked her the same question 3 weeks ago and she just thinks I am worrying too much!  But I'd like to know from all of you ladies what you think about my oncol. starting me on Femara today... 5 weeks before surgery.  I always thought people started taking anti-hormone meds AFTER surgery.  She told me that she'd rather do it now, since I had so much time before my surgery, so if there were side-effects, she would know it's from the Femara and not from the surgery medications.  So I'm going to take it tonight...  I am happy I get to take an aramotase inhibitor from the start, since I'm 52 and she's pretty sure I'm post-menapausal, rather than Tamoxifen.  So now that I will be on the anti-hormone pill AND Herceptin, I'm not as worried about the long spell without chemo before my surgery.   I am worried about the Femara side-effects, though... I'm having hot flashes now but hear that they will get a lot worse.  Oh well, I'll deal with it as it comes! I've been reading everyone's posts... I'm so sorry we are all having to go through this but so happy for the \"company\" and support.  I'll be keeping everyone in my prayers as we all go through our surgeries.  :o) Brenda",

My chemo was taxotere, carboplatin, and herceptin, 6 rounds. I had trouble with dry mouth and some mouth sores/ulcers. Biotene mouth rinse from Walmart helped me so much. It would stop the pain almost immediately and the sores would be gone in a day or so. I bought Biotene gum, toothpaste, and a mouth spray. I also began getting neuropathy in the tips of my fingers and told my onc. So she lowered the dosage of carboplatin. I drank as much cold water as I could each day to help flush the toxins out. Good luck... You'll get through it before you know it. For me, it was not as bad as I though it would be. (((HUGS)))",

I'm still feeling burning and some pain and discomfort in my underarm on the left side where I had the SNB and the Axillary biopsy.  Geesh, thought I'd feel better by now.  At least they took out the last two drains last week... I had a STRONG dislike for them!!!  I'm trying to cope with the news that I might still have to have radiation.  :o(  Will find out this Thursday... I will handle whatever comes, and if they say I really need it, then I'll probably do it...  They say I'm in the \"grey\" area.  On my left side one Sentinal lymph node was positive with only a microscopic tiny amout of cancer in it, so they did an axillary LNB and it was all clear, so I'm 1 out of 8 nodes positive... the doctors were very happy about that.  I have 2 tumors in each breast so I'm a bit \"rare\" they tell me...  There's no cancer in my right nodes so I'm happy for that.  So I'm a stage 1 in my right breast and a stage 2a in my left breast...  also the pathology said my margins were clear.  They also said my chemo before the surgery was very successful but it didn't kill all the cancer, just shrunk the tumors a lot.  I thought all this time that I had two small tumors in my left breast but the pathology said it was actually one tumor, so it was probably around 4 cm... the chemo reduced it to 2.5 cm. I have a bad feeling I'll need the radiation.  I was just hoping that I was about done with all of this except for the reconstruction.  That's something else that got post-poned.  The ps only put in tissue-expanders because of the node positive because of the possibility of radiation and did not do the latissimus dorsi operation.  My bs said that if I get radiation, I'll have a high chance of getting lymphedia in my left arm...  the thought of that makes me scared.  My ps said radiation might make me not able to get implants.  Okay, enough about me!!!  It makes me realize that this is such a long road with ups and downs and I have to expect the unexpected and just make the right decisions and keep going!!!  Thank you all for helping me with all of your inspiring posts... I haven't been posting but I've been reading them in my recliner chair downstairs in the den that has become my home!... and thank you Maureen for being so passionate about all of the March sisters!!!  For those of you going forward onto chemo... it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  Everyone is so different... my personal experience was I didn't get sick or throw up or anything.  I was actually at how many \"good\" days I had as opposed to bad... and the bad wasn't too bad at all.  It will pass and pass faster than you think.  I can't believe I started my chemo Oct. 2012, two months after diagnosis and finished Jan. 23rd...  Good luck to all of you!!!
