It's not so much about the procedure itself but the psychological effect it may have on me after of not having a real breast (no sensation and all). It can be devastating...

Some of you may have read this already, but here's an interesting article in reaction to Jolie's news: http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/reacting-to-angelina-jolies-breast-cancer-news/?ref=angelinajolie keetmom, your 3 month check-up is a milestone worth noting.

Though it's very personal, I thought it will help in the healing process (as we are healing physically and psychologically). I wrote this letter an hour before my surgery (April 23, 2013) and sent it my friend. I'm not a writer so please forgive any grammatical error this piece may have. Goodbye, My Girl (A Letter to My Right Boob) \"Them girls (my boobs)\", as I referred to you guys ever since I met Billy (my husband). You have been a wonderful part of my body. I am crying inside because I know I will have to let go of you, Ms. Righty, this very morning. I know too that after today things will never be the same for me. I will miss you dearly. They will replace you with a breast or tissue expander and I'd have to live with it for several months. Of course later on again, replace you with silicone. I remember you were the first one, Ms. Righty, my baby latched on to when I first fed him on the night of Dec. 2, 2008. I can still picture him with his little chinky eyes open and the cutest mouth I've ever seen, just big enough to suck on your nipple. I will always be grateful to you for that memory... it is truly a gift. Of course the never ending nursing sessions we had together with both of you producing delicious milk for the next 11 to 12 months were just as wonderful. I cherish those moments when I could truly study my baby carefully, then he'd look at me adoringly and smile constantly too. Oh that smile that could make the world beautiful and colorful. A smile that could melt a mommy's heart and makes the day worthwhile even when she's so tired for many sleepless nights. My experience as a mom is made whole and I owe them to you, girls. I remember both of you being pinkish when I was in my twenties. I was always proud of you. I just thought both of you girls are the right size for me... Your firmness are just perfect. More so when I got pregnant at age 40, both of you were supple and I could never have been prouder of you. Though that changed after I gave birth, the nipples turned darker, I still think you guys look gorgeous. You never gave me problems until I felt a lump on you, Ms. Righty, sometime in August 2012. Things happened fast after that, but I never blamed you. I'm so sad because you became a victim of this crazy cells who couldn't control themselves. You definitely don't deserve this kind of treatment. Ever since the diagnosis you've been checked and poked with needles. First the biopsy, then the sentinel lymph nodes dissection, and now this. I thought it'll end fair and square with us. I'd like to keep you forever until I die, my precious girl. But circumstances say you gotta go, otherwise these crazy cells will take over the good cells, spread and get worst. I know I'll never forget this day that I have to bid you farewell. I feel terrible for this day... and hoped it would never have come, but in a few hours... surreal as it is... this is really going to happen... Goodbye my sweet girl, goodbye Ms. Righty! How ironical, the part of your body that gives nourishment to your baby can also be your worst enemy.",
