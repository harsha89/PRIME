So, well, I thought I knew what to expect, bc I did a lot of research, and used a surgeon who had done other surgeries for me, so I had some idea about his incisions and staple-use and all. But I am certainly dealing with more than I expected in the number of staples and the overall appearance. Not pretty. But what I really don't understand is these \"dog ears\" on the ends under my arms. I have to go back to my surgeon for a follow-up, and I have been crying over these, and I just don't know what to say to him. He had help, another surgeon doing the opposite side, but I know my surgeon is very detail-oriented and has high standards, so I trusted he would work with someone to create some kind of symmetry. But these things are not both the same size--one indents, and one doesn't. And one shows from under my shirt. I am reading online about how some people get these revised, and boy, I just feel sick about having to submit to more cutting. I had a PS do my first work the first go-round, and I have had several other surgeries since, for other medical reasons (hence my familiarity with this surgeon). It feels like enough is enough. Has anyone had dog ears revised successfully? Who did it, the same surgeon, or a plastic surgeon? Thanks all. Log in to post a reply",

I can't believe they really have to leave something sticking out like that the first time, but I guess I don't understand everything about surgery. I saw my surgeon the other day, and he said after time for healing, if they are still bothering me, we will get a plastic surgeon to fix them. It will probably be the same one who did my initial surgeries some years back, when I first had cancer and tried to save them with a double reduction/partial mastectomy. Long story, but basically I would have to go back and tell him the news that his work is gone. Well, he would probably be the best one for the revisions, and I pray it would be cake compared to this bi-lat. Thanks again! ~J",
