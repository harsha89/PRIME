      "Content": "withm wrote: Has anyone flown with a lymphedema pump? I have no problem bringing it in the car when I travel but have not been on an airplane since developing LE Do you recommend putting it in checked baggage or carry on? The pump itself is heavy, and the sleeve rolled up tight is about as big as the pump. Even getting it up into the overhead compartment would be difficult for me (but do-able). But if it were lost inside a checked bag, unlikely as it may be, it would be very difficult, not to mention expensive, to replace. Would insurance even cover a second pump just two years later? I don't imagine one could rent or borrow one in Detroit? Any advice or comments welcome. Log in to post a reply",
