My SE's this time have been overwhelming, terrible constipation and stomach cramps, then switching to explosive D, along with being able to sleep only in small spurts. I am considering asking MO to discontinue the TC and proceed to Herceptin-only stage. The 6-week TCH is, I guess, pretty standard, but I have read on BCO about ladies doing TCHx4, or Taxol, or just Herceptin from the get-go. I realize that either way, the future course if uncertain. When I go in tomorrow for bloodwork, i will leave a note for MO, and hope to sort a revised plan.",

I don't feel any better physically, and still lying on the couch and not eating. But psychologically, I feel lighter. Of course, I will be back there every 3 weeks anyway for my Herceptin ... hopefully that will go as easily as I am expecting. Another vote here for clementines and popsicles.",
