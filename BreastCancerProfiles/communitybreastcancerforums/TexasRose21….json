PT has worked wonders for me.  I asked PT a few weeks before my surgery.  She said that I was not scheduled since I was not considered high risk (whatever that means).  She said she would send a referrel if I would like.  I said yes. Bottom line is--- you might want to ask your doc for a referral. I met with PT 3 days before my surgery & she gave me exercises to do (inclding walking) for the first week & an appointment for 1 week after surgery. I am currently walking for 1-hour 3x per day.    She gave me additonal exercises to do thru 6 weeks post op.  At that time I can resume my normal exercise routine.  My right arm (non-AND) has full range of motion already.  My left arm (AND) is another story.  Although I have some motion, I still cannot raise my arm directly over my head.  I am hoping that I will have full range of motion at the 6-week post-op point.  If I do not have full range of motion at that time I will revisit with the PT.  Love & Hugs---",

I have stage II non-agressive carcinoma's (2 separate, same breast) with ductal & lobular characteristics.  The wierd part, is that I had 6 out of 10 positive nodes.  They wondered I was getting annual screening mammograms, the answer to that is \"yes\".  Because of the lymph node involvement, the MO said that if I did not do any treatment I have a 50% chance of recurrence (Yikes!!).  The MO said that both Chemo & RADS are non-negotiable since that would bring my chance of recurrence down to about 20%.  Of course, I signed up for both. I was thinking that 20% chance of recurrence  is a good thing since the general population has a 16% of breast cancer.  But reading this discussion board it seems that the average chance of recurrence is much lower (7% - 10%).  I am finding my situation really scary.  As usual, I do not neatly fit into a \"box\".

My juice included carrots, celery, cucumber, cabbage, beets & apple. Only a very small amount of cabbage & beet is required- the rest is an experiment based on your taste.  I usually used a whole apple (peeled & cored). Poured into a chilled glass with fresh frozen berries.  Before I go back to my juicing, I am going to do addtional research to ensure that beet juice is ok for BC recurrence.  Happy juicing! If you have a Jamba Juice conveniently located, I highly recommend their shot of wheat grass-  just the shot; not mixed with any other juice.  They juice from fresh wheat grass trays they have delivered to the stores at regular intervals. If you want to grow it yourself for juicing you can but beware that you have to purchase a special type juicer.
