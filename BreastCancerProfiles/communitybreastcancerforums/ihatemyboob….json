I understand the pros and cons but I really don't want one. I tried to put my foot down but it must be little or invisible because I got shot down, big time. I've heard nothing but \" you've got great veins,\" and \"wow, what a gusher,\" so I was really hoping to avoid the port but yet I'm scheduled Monday for placement. Any advice? Also my chemo regimen is 4 doses of Adriamycin and Cytoxan every other week and then 4 doses of Taxol every other week. Anyone else do this? I'm also part of a clinical trial which will add some other medicine normally given to her2+ cancers despite my her2- status. At my appointment she said that they're \"throwing the book at me\" because of my age. Lol, sounds great :) happy birthday to me.",
