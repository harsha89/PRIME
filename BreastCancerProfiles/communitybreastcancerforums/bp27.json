    "Content": "bp27 wrote: Hi all, I am 24 years old and I found a lump in my right breast about a week ago. I noticed it during my period because my breast felt tender, and I thought it may be a cyst, but it doesn't seem to have gotten any smaller since my period ended on Sunday. It is definitely not hard, but fairly firm, and about an inch across and feels sort of deep and flat, to the right of the nipple. I am super worried about it and would really like to get it checked out, but I have not seen the doctor in a few years and feel very nervous calling to set up the appointment because I have social anxiety and I'm also afraid of not being taken seriously because of my age. I was wondering if I should be very concerned, or if anyone has suggestions of what to say when I call to make the appointment? Log in to post a reply",
