I began to feel my breast and discovered a hard lump/area underneath the red spot.I also discoverd a swollen lymphnode under my right armpit. I tried to forget about what I had found and get some sleep. When I woke up the next morning the red patch was still there, as was the lump and pain/discomfort. I decided to make an appointment with a Dr. at a nearby clinic. When I went in the Dr looked at me for a few minutes and told me that I had a bacterial infection. She put me on antibiotics and told me she wanted to see me again in a week. That's it...  I have no fever. I am not/ have not been pregnant (and therefore have not nursed a child.) I have no flu like symptoms (often accompanied with mastitis?)  Today it feels like the lump has spread to the outer area of my breast. The red patch looks the same. I know that I need to wait at least 48 hours for the antibiotics to kick in, but I am scared. I don't know how I would get this infection? My nipples are not cracked, dry. Can anyone out there offer any insight, or comfort. Is there something else that I should be doing?  Thank you, Log in to post a reply",
