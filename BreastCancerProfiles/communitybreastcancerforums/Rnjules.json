I was fortunate enough to get both of my drains out on day 8, as I was having an allergic reaction to them and broke out all over in hives! My MD filled me to 400cc at the initial surgery. Yesterday I went for my first fill, he placed an additional 125cc in each side yesterday. It did not hurt at all when he was doing the fill, but, 30 minutes later and currently, I am at level 7 out of 10 pain again. My PS wants me to stop taking the percocet, I have cut down, but this is not possible for me yet. I also got an RX for Valium and for Flexiril, which does help a little. Be encouraged though, I actually see that my PS created a pretty nice set of foobs, which will only improve. All the negative stuff on these boards scarred me as well, although I love the ladies. I am just praying that the pain will improve, as they want me back to work in two weeks, and being an RN, I do not even see this as a possibility, not with this pain.",

I am still, day 16, having significant pain on my right underarm, not on the left. My dear PS, who is now on vacation, put in a Kaiser referral for me to see a Pain Management MD, of course, Kaiser called and said that was stupid as this is not chronic pain, but pain from surgery. My PS sees no reason why I am in pain....I now have an appointment tomorrow with another PS in his group.",

The pain to the drain sites is a burning sabbing pain all of the time. My pain is complicated by the fact that I have this autoimmune thing that when any foreign object, like a bra, touches my skin, I break out in hives, which equlas pain plus itching all of the time. my husband says that the actual insertion sites look great, no reddness, I have no fever. I had to remove the surgical bra becuase I can not stand the compression of the drain sites. They put in 400 ml each side, so why are there so many dents and lumps in the breasts?",

I am a Hospice RN and deal with people with pain every day. Nothing could have prepared me for the pain that I am still in. From day one after Mastectomy, I experienced Neuropathic Pain ( Nerve Pain). After Exchange...it was still there, now, eight months, it is still there. I still am taking 2.5 mg of valium at night along with Soma. By the end of the work day, I feel as if my Implants weigh 500 pounds, also, itching, shooting, and burning pain, moew on one side than the other. After Nipple Recon, 3 weeks ago, was treated with massive doses of antibiotics due to red and swollen right breast, infection cleared, now I have a bilateral breast rash that is most likely yeast...is it ever going to end? My PS through Kaiser is saying that it is \"time\" that I am off off all meds, that it has been, quote, long enough! Do you all feel that I should contact my BS? Any ideas, suggestions would be appreciated.",
