I really like your profile name.  In reading the posts already, I am really inspired by the positive attitudes and support that are on this board. I will take a look at the link to the risk calculator. It is somewhat of a new idea to me that I am high risk, but I seem to keep adding things to my risk profile so I had better just acknowledge that is what I am and deal with it.   I may also try to get back to a major U.S. metropolitan area from overseas in light of all this, since I do not have access to a breast care center over here like I did back at home. Thank you very much for the support.",

She is still alive today but suffered a lot.  I am now almost 42 and have had three biopsies and three fibroadenomas. I am thinking that I fall into the high risk category, at least partly. Someone from the other forum said I should come to this one instead. My question is, does anyone here either have an opinion on whether it is wise to discontinue birth control pills if one is, in fact, \"high risk?\"  I stopped using Seasonale when I first went overseas with the military and could not get it for a while. Now, I have the option of taking it again, and I am just wondering if it could somehow cause things like fibroadenomas and/or breast cancer in the long term. I have taken birth control pills with just a couple of years' break for nearly 20 years. I prefer it because I have less difficulty and fewer symptoms with fewer periods.  Or, in the alternative, do you know where I should look online at references to help make a decision?  Thank you very much and please let me know if this is not a question to be asking here.  I really am starting to think about it after just having the last two core biopsies, even though these came back benign. I do feel that, at some point, I'll get breast cancer like my Mom did, so I want to try to do whatever the most \"healthy\" things are, if I can.  Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "KARW41 wrote: I am about to leave the country for two years to go to a place with lesser quality health care. I am trying to see if insurance will cover an MRI before I go, and if I should get BRCA genetic testing. My Mom had breast cancer twice and three generations of maternal female relatives died of cancer, unsure of exact type. I have dense breasts. I have had one vacuum-assisted biopsy several years ago and removal of a fibroadenoma associated with that. Then, a year ago, I had a series of several biopsies on what they said was five fibroadenomas, which I am not sure about. Then, now, in the other breast, the screening mammogram found \"something\" but the subsequent diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound saw \"nothing.\" They keep saying come back every 6 months. I started getting mammograms at age 37 and am 43 now, and am totally fed up with these mammograms every six months that basically say nothing except ambiguous findings. I know I \"should\" be grateful to get the mammograms at all but they seem totally inadequate for dense breast tissue. Is it wrong to at least ask for an MRI and see if I can get the BRCA test done?? I think that gene test is a requirement to get the MRI covered. It was really difficult to even get past the people who answer the phone at the doctor's office, who did not seem to understand at all what I was trying to ask for and why. Log in to post a reply",
