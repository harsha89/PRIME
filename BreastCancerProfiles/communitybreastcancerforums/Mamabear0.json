There was some good news hidden in there. It said although they did not find evidence that Vitamin D prevents cancer, \"it appeared to reduce cancer deaths \u2013 although not cancer diagnoses \u2013 by 25 percent.\" So a 25% reduction in cancer deaths? I will take that!",

We told her we want to involve MDA, and she is very supportive. We may do surgery in Shreveport, then medical oncology at MDA, or MDA may just take over. I have my first appointment there and all new scans next week. I just have some questions! Everyone I know who has gone there, it has been A LONG wait from first appointment to an surgery or treatment. Is that always true? I am 32 with a grade 3 cancer (still waiting on all the other info, but my bet is triple negative) I have three little ones (4,2, and 1) and need to be here for them! I just want to fight this, and soon! Can you share your experiences?  Also, it sounds like I can possibly go there,many get the actual chemo closer to me? Sorry, I am brand new at this.",

I don't agree that it is a just a crapshoot. I can do everything I can to survive, and if it doesn't work, then I can't say I didn't try! I, too, want more children. I may take a break from Exemestane at the 5 year mark to try, I may change my mind. But I like that it is on the table. I try to take it one day at a time, and cancer has really made me do this! I wake up, and thank God for today, since today I don't have cancer. Who knows about tomorrow - but I don't need to worry about that! My husband and I are also getting our foster care license. We can help parent others who's Mamas aren't so lucky, and maybe adopt that way. PM me if you ever want someone to talk to! It is so important not to feel alone in this!!",

I take those because my lymphocyte count is on the lower side after treatment. I did notice a boost in my counts after taking them for a few months! Most of the supplements I take are based on Dr. Block's Life Over Cancer book.",
