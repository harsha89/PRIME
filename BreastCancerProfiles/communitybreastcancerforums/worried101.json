I'm trying not to worry but was alarmed to have the Radiologist (MD), tell me that the images look highly suspicious of a breast cancer.  He informed me that it would appear more likely to be cancer than not and also said he would be surprised if it weren't.  I'm guessing that he wouldn't say that if he weren't confident but I'm certainly hoping he's prepared me for the worst and that I will face significant relief once the biopsy is done and the results come in.  That said, I can't really shake what he said and know that he wouldn't have been as direct with me if there weren't some cause for concern.    The results indicate that there is a solid, vascule, hypo irregular mass in my left breast.  I have a copy of the images and the area in question does look concerning based on what I have seen online.  It does not look well defined, more like road kill.  It's not round and there is no border around it.  It measures 2.09 cm transversely but is closer to 1.50 cm in some areas.  He said this was better news, that it's small.  Is this small?     My axillary lymph nodes also appear to be irregular with slightly thickened cortex on the ultrasound.  I assume this has the potential to mean lymph node involvement.  Is it bad if the axillary lymph nodes are involved?  From what I've read, the sentinel lymph nodes are normally first involved.  I'm a little worried about the lymph node irregularities.    Does anybody know what I can expect for treatment if this is cancer with axillary lymph node involvement?  Chemo?  Masectomy?  Also, are there any breast conditions which might mimmic cancer on an ultrasound and mammo?  If the axillary lymph nodes are involved, would it still be an option to conserve my breast?   I know there are a lot of variables but I'm also sure that folks on here have had similar experiences that would offer me some insight.   I'm supposed to have a biopsy this week or next and I guess I just want to prepare myself mentally for a diagnosis based on how direct the Radiologist was with me about these images.  I feel like the more informed I am, the better I will be able to manage this. I am 35 years old and my husband has had two serious heart attacks despite taking very good care of himself so I am quite worried about how we will manage this, as the sole provider in my family.   Neither one of us has any significant risk factors for heart disease or cancer, aside from stress.  I can't help but feel there is a strong correlation between illness and stress.   I know people will feel inclined to tell me not to worry and I know that worrying isn't good.  What I am really looking for is information so that I can worry less by becoming more educated, knowing potential treatment options, and to feel less frightened by a potential diagnosis.  I would appreciate hearing your stories and treatment experiences that might enlighten and empower me.   Thank you for your help!   Log in to post a reply",
