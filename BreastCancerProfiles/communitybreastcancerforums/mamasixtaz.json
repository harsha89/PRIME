But you don't and say \"I'm fine, how are you?\"  No one wants to really know how you feel.  As soon as you say \" I have breast cancer\" it is a shock to everyone and then they don't know what to say.  I try to keep up a brave front at work and home for my family but at night it all comes crashing down.  It takes its toll on you, making me so tired yet still unable to sleep.  I wake up early unable to go back to sleep, which makes it so hard to keep up brave front. My good friend helps we work thru it by calling and texting frequently.  I feel better after talking to her.  Understand what you are going thru...hang in there.",

Budget cuts, short staffing, limited office visits hinder the staff but do not make them so they can't show they care about you and your needs.  You are the pilot in this ship and you can guide it where it needs to go.  Stay in control of it and make them work for you.  Sometimes it takes more than one appt to get what you need but be persistant.  I learned this with my PS.  I was really upset after my first consultation that he only offered me LD flap reconstruction.  After researching this I was scared to death to go through so much surgery.  I called to talk to him and he was just so busy, so I made another appt to discuss this again.  I came prepared with all my questions and fears.  When I made the appt I asked for a longer appt time as I knew it could last past the normal 15 min slot. I made it at the end of the day.  We talked for about 45 min and he answered all my questions and understood how I was feeling.  He reassured me much more that everything would be ok, but it was in my court to decide what I wanted to do.  I felt soooo much better and empowered after that visit.  Made all the difference in the course of my care. I hope your lumpectomy and SNB goes well for you dispite the care you have (not) recieved. Wishing our first sugery sisters for September the very best...We will be thinking of you tomorrow as you put this surgery behind you.  Get some rest (LOL) if you can and take it easy after your surgery.  Please let us know how you are doing when you feel up to it.   September 3 -hobbesla4 (lumpectomy) DawnCT (lumpectomy) Sandymomof3(lumpectomy/SNB) Carrie61(UMX &SNB/reconTE) Fiddledeedee (Lumpectomy/SNB) Nicole21366 (mastectomy) September 4 Dennilynne-(lumpectomy/SNB)",

Take it one day at a time.  Feeling for you as I battled necrosis and incisional infections too but the antibiotics worked to save the TEs and the LD flaps healed as well.  My scars look awful but hope he can correct them at exchange. Summergal-BC does affect the whole family, it is as scarey for them as they feel so helpless.  Good coping is to get away from it all for awhile, so giving DH a break will pay off for you tomorrow.  Therapy does help as I have one at the hospital that was my \"coach\" for my management class.  She has been so great to listen and help me through it all.  My DH is disabled and has so many problems of his own he just is in denial that I have anything going on.  He has had so much of the attention for his issues (stroke, dialysis, diabetes) he just doesn't know how to react.  I quit trying to include him in the office visits after he asked the bs \"what did she do to get this?\"  My bs asked me if I had a therapist as she worried about depression after surgery.  I told her I had a coach to get me through.   BellaFriday-to have you here, sorry you need to be here!  I will add you to our surgery list.  What a double whammy with a hyst.  I had an endometrial biopsy and will be headed that direction next, yet can wait for now.  GYN wants to give my poor body some time to recover from this first.  I worry about it all the same.  On Tamoxifen which increases the chance for uterine cancer, so want to get it out too.  If bleeding gets worse she will do it sooner.  I do not know much about the nipple sharing surgeries but check out the reconstruction threads, there may be some who do.  I did not have the choice as with LD flap all is taken out plus one of my masses was close to the left nipple.  I will do either nipple recon or tattoos, will have to wait 6 months after exchange, so plenty of time to decide. Denise4603-I am so sorry your hospital stay was so bad. Glad you are doing well.  I am a nurse and realized how much I knew ahead of the nurses what needed to be done.  I was in the hospital 4 days and it was tooo long!  I begged to go home on day 3 but PS wasn't letting me go any earlier due to the LD flap recon.  (front and back incisions and 6 drains)  I was so glad to get home and in my recliner...took me 5 weeks to make it to my bed!  (OMG feeling the PTSD setting in!) KeeB-Hang in there and get rid of the cold first, no need to be sick going into surgery.  Coughing and sneezing would hurt so bad afterward it would not be worth it.  I sneezed my first post op day and thought I would die.  Later I choked on sip of water and it killed me to cough, wanted to just not breathe! LOL! BiG((HUGS)))  for you while you recover.   tuffenough-So glad all turned out so well for you.  I can't imagine going through a wedding after all this!  When my daughter got married I was so exhausted afterward, you are amazing.  Hope you can rest up for returning to work, it is hard to get back into it at first, take it easy.

My story:  I am 54 yrs old mom of 4 with the youngest starting highschool this year!  My DH is disabled, had a stroke 7 yrs ago and in end stage renal failure, on home hemodialysis.  I work full time as an L&D nurse.  Never imagined this could ever happen to me.  My cancer was dx by routine mamo, multiple biopies, lumpectomy x2 unable to get good margins and DCIS along with papillary carcinoma.  BS said too much cancer to get with the lumpectomy, lead me to bmx.  I decided bmx due to micocalcification changes in the right side, not wanting to end up going through this again.  PS decided latissimus dorsi + TEs was the best option for reconstruction.  This was not in my plan as well!  8hrs later and back and front incisions and 6 drains!  But here I am 5 months out a few set backs with incisional infections and slow fills (total 800cc each)  and I am ready to get this finished with 800cc silicone implants! Hope this helps and does not scare you but if I can do it so can all of you.  I am back working full time since May 5th in a busy L&D unit.  It is hard trying to keep up with everything, I get so tired, exhausted but glad to be able to work and take care of my family and each day does get a little easier. Sorry so long...sending you all many anti-anxiety ((HUGS!!))",

They are a great way to conserve the breast you have.  I went through lumpectomy first just to see if we could conserve the breast.  There is nothing like your own body parts.  Nothing replaces them unless you really have to.  No one would consider cutting off a hand or foot without considering it would save your life.  But breast cancer is still not understood to the point that surgery is still the option used first.  After my double lumpectomies my BS was confident that she got good margins on both, but the pathology came back with one with good margins and one not, and that  included DCIS/LCIS.  I still wouldn't have changed anything.  At least I knew that the breast needed to go to prevent any cancer spread.  I decided bmx only to make them match as I had large boobs, and my BFF said, why would you want to have one perky new boob and one 54yr saggy boob!  Plus, I had some microcalcifications on MRI, making me suspect more might be there.  Sure enough the pathology on my right side after mx was ALH/LCIS making it also high risk so I'm glad I did it at the same time. This was my personal decsion making process as we all need to evaluate what we can from good sources like BC.org as well as our personal feelings/emotions.  I would have loved to have kept my real boobs and had careful screenings but, that was not a choice in my case. What a journey and rollercoaster ride it has been since last December when I heard those words \" you have breast cancer\".  The anxiety and anticipation is the worst part, just hang on and grab support wherever you can.",

Adding an implant is not the same as replacing what we had.  No one wants this bc but here we are and we make the best choices based on the information we have available.  In the end we have to trust our instincts and our care providers to take the cancer out and make us still feel good about our body.  I was in your place in March.  It seems like such a long time ago now.  I had no idea what to expect, who to trust and if I would be able to support and take care of my family.  It was a dark time but I made it through it and so will you.  BMX with TEs does take time.  You need time to heal and make the area ready for the implants.  It depends on the PS on how soon they will do the exchange after the last fill.  But slow and steady wins the race and it will pass quickly (some days good, some days bad)  I understand and feel for you tonight so hang in there tomorrow will be here soon, and a day closer to the end of the journey!

I didn't go back. I talked to BS and PS about possible LE in my underarm and trunk area and both really downplayed it saying I was such a low risk for LE and my arm would swell up if it was LE. Very hard to convince doctors who think they know about it. I have thought about going outside my insurance and check out some private PT/LE specialists in my area. I also know many of the nurses in my insurance who can help me find out who may be available within my plan. I am sure I can get my PS to refer me to one if I do the homework!

My right side seems back to normal post exchange, but I have some fluid that just hasn't moved since exchange on my left side (cancer/SN side). After bmx, I had my drains 4 weeks then weekly had seroma removed from my back for another 3 weeks post drain removal. So, not too concerned about the extra fluid build up, but it is uncomfortable, especially without a sport bra. Have an appt Friday to see LE specialist, help with moving the fluid out on that left side. I was surprised at how much this surgery has wiped me out! I had less general anesthesia this time but was sent home the same day,(last time 8hrs surgery, 4 days in hospital) which I thought would be better. But, I had less help around and was so sick from the pain meds I just didn't bounce back as fast as I thought I would. I did seem to feel like I had been run over by a truck and beat up with a baseball bat! My arms were sore and hard to move again as well. But, after the first few days things started to feel better, quicker than my bmx surgery. Most people do really well after exchange surgery and return to \"normal\". But if you check out the Exchange thread, there are those who have trouble with healing, final results, etc just like bmx recoveries are not all the same. Some have more surgery for revisions, exchange is not always the final surgery. I am hoping it is MY last surgery!",

I have only a week left off before heading back to work. 6 weeks can go so quickly! I am doing better each day post exchange. The foobs are healing nicely and my swelling is pretty much gone in the breast. Still some underarm boob, but LE specialist is working wonders in moving the fluid out with exercises and massage. I did go shopping looking for new bras, as the sports bras are so worn out since I have been wearing them since bmx, with expansion thru now. I loved my bali revolution sport bras as they had some definition and wide sides for my underarm boob support. But, I am about ready to get sized by a professional, (Nordstroms) and buy something nice for work. Be interesting to see what size I am now. Plus with the weight loss have needed to buy some clothes, dropped 3 sizes in jeans! Still continuing to loose, may be from the Tamoxifen. Try to get outside everyday and walk, averaging about 1-2 miles. The fall weather has been extraordinary! Hoping all of your surgeries are healing well, and the fills will move along quickly, the exchange to squishies is the easiest so far. I think about all of you often and read the posts when I can.

DawnCT and Hobbesla4- I agree the wire insertion was the worst for me during the lumpectomy.  I too had 2 wires inserted but did have them stop and add more anesthestic/local.  It made it much more tolerable.  Had to resquish the breast but it was worth it.  Does seem like a vice holding it down tight.  Then it's the adjustments to the wires they have to make while it  is being squished!  I remember there was a pink beany bear with the pink ribbon symbol on a shelf across from the machine where I was looking.  I wanted to rip that bear's head off by the time I was done!  (I'm not a pink ribbon fan, just can't deal with that yet!) Then they covered the wires with syringes and I had to go up a public elevator to the surgery center!  Not a pretty sight!  I also had the SNB isotopes injected which wasn't pleasant either, a big needlestick in an area that is the most sensitive on your body (the nipple area). I think the surgery was the easier part, but who knows at least you get to sleep through that! LOL!  Glad you are done, hope the wait on results isn't too long.  Rest up and take it easy, you still had surgery so take time to recover. I too had an endometrial biopsy in the GYN office today, ouch some cramping but better now.  Needed this as a baseline to monitor for uterine cancer which is a risk with Tamoxifen. It is just another part of this journey.  Will get the results just as in about 7 days.  I know it will probably be benign (no hx) but I never thought I'd have bc either(no hx).  Many gentle virtual ((HUGS)) to all. Good luck tomorrow, Dennilynne, we will be thinking of you!  Get some rest as much as you can, the anticipation is the worst! ",

Wishing you well, hang in there one day at a time. BellaFriday-everyone is different on pain meds needed post op, but you need them for at least 3 + days. Take stoolsoftners 2X a day and milk of mag too if needed. Fiber bars help too. Move things down to lower cabinets, no reaching. You feel like \"T-Rex\" short arms move close to your body. I also had LDFlap recon so had back incisons as well, you should do fine with umx, and TE. Each surgeon uses different bras,etc. Mine used nothing but dressings, no surgical bras or anything for a month. Use only sport bras now, helps support my underarm boob, swelling left from tunneling of LD muscle, check with your PS what they use. Front button tops help to get dressed too, jacket with inside pockets to hold your drains is good too. Music, DVDS, and pillows to prop your arms( I like the small travel pillows from Walmart, only $3!

I did get used to it some but never was able to sleep other than on my back. It was very tiring and I did take the muscle relaxers especially at night. It is all worth it after exchange. So, hang in there, the implants are sooo much better, I can sleep on my side, finally! You will have that tightness and \"iron bra\" feeling till they are exchanged. Mine is still there some even since the exchange, but it is so much less. When you go for the fill be sure and tell PS how uncomfortable you are and start slow. Ask how much he plans to fill you to and how much each fill will be. You drive the amount of fills, take it easy as many PSs start at 100ccs and it is reallly too much. As uncomfortable you are be sure and take meds before you go in for the fill and routinely after. Get muscle relaxers, they do help.",

I used fleece jackets and they had inside pockets to hold my 6 drains! Was just too drugged to pin and unpin them from anything. Hope you can find something to help, plus take it easy, a wedding is so tiring be careful to not overdue it. Sienna-wow I can't imagine doing PT 10 days post op! I too had LD flap but with TEs. My PS wouldn't let me till 6 weeks out. Take it slow, the swelling and tightness will go away, but healing is the main thing for now. I am 6 months out and still find PT is uncomfortable. I am going back after exchange, but will see LE specialist first, evaluate fluid in underarm and back. Just need to make sure I am doing the \"right\" exercise. cjc/batrice-underarm boob is what still bothers me the most. (I am 6 months out) I blamed the LD flap surgery but it must be related to mx as well. My right side has gone down but still swells some. My left(cancer side) is still the worst. I have had seroma drained from my back post mx but PS won't take off any more. Take it easy and let things heal and the fluid will not build up as much and the swelling/pain will go down. BellaF-Yea, drains out! Slow and steady wins the race! (slow fills weekly) TEs are just not comfortable but it does become more tolerable over time. My BFF was always there for me when I was so uncomfortable from the fills. One day she said, well it's like puberty all over again, growing new boobs! She was so right, along with all the emotional ups and downs, it was a return to puberty!LOL I was never so happy to sign the paperwork for sending those TEs to the incinerator! Don't become too attached they are only place holders the squishy side is sooo much better!",

My swelling comes and goes a little, some days are really bad others not as much.(Depends on how much I end up doing) Will see LE specialist next week so hope they can help. Otherwise, all looks and feels good. Incisions this time healed so much better. Increasing my activity slowly. Need to start building up endurance to return to work soon. Meanwhile, spend my time knitting, reading, cooking and enjoying the mountains as it has been so beautiful with all the leaves changing. I am glad I have this time of year off, and I am able to enjoy it! Hope all of you can find some peace during this recovery period. Many ((HUGS)) to all my surgery sisters!",

I know what you are feeling, having started with the lumpectomy x2, next the bmx with reconstruction and now my exchange surgery is September 25th!  Can't wait for it to be done, hopefully will be my last surgery for awhile.  Still, no matter how much surgery  you have the anxiety kicks in and it's good to have a group going through it to write to about it.  It is going to be a much easier surgery than my last 8 hr surgery (bmx with latissimus dorsi recon) but I think I have ptsd as I really dread the idea of having those incisions opened up again and dealing with the pain and drains-ugh!

Hang in there we will make it through it together! Summergal-Glad it is behind you.  The needle loc was the worst for me as well, they used lidocaine but it burned so much it really didn't help.  The isotopes were the worst for me for the SNB, could they inject a more sensitive area? I found the scope patch made it so much better post anesthesia for the nausea.  Had it for the lumpectomy and the bmx, saved me from being too sick.  I think that is what I dread the most with surgery again, but will get through it once again with my trusty patch!  Wishing you a speedy recovery and clear margins! StacieRae-so sorry the wait is causing you so much pain and anxiety.  It really is the worst part of the what if mind games we play.  Once the surgery is over you can focus on the recovery.  Feeling your pain and wishing you peace of mind a few minutes of the day until it is over.  Hope the anesthesia works well for you and you can sleep peacefully through the surgery. It should help you maintain good pain relief as well as it gradually wears off and you can keep the pain meds coming ahead of the pain.  I had LD flap recon with the bmx and it was 8 hrs of general anesthesia and I did wake up in some pain but I was able to catch up with the Morphine drip PCA.  Worked very well till I could eat and drink and take pills.   daffyc-I am 6months out and still feel sooo tired and fatigued. I have thought about starting a thread called \"fatigue\"! I have gained back more strength and endurance as the days roll by.  I am a busy person, as you may have read at the beginning of this thread, but do not have the same stamina I had before bc.  I think with all the tests, surgeries, anesthesia let alone the stress of the bc rollercoaster, our bodies take a beating and will take a long time to come back to \"normal\".  My BFF and coworker is my biggest support, her husband had a big thoracic surgery and he said it took him a year to feel \"normal\" again.  So, time will heal we must be patient as each day will make us stronger. SchoolC-Sorry I got the date wrong, will amend the list.  Wow, Tuesday will be here before you know it!  I have read about the body casting, I thought the pictures by the PS were bad enough!  Mine were so large it would have taken a lot of plaster, not sure how that would have been.  But still miss the darn things anyway.  TEs are very hard and uncomfortable, just not a part of me, hope the implants will \"grow\" on me.  My BFF was always saying \" you're going through puberty again!  While I was getting my TEs filled up and \"growing\" new foobs! LOL.  (I know weird sense of humor, but we are nurses what can you expect!) Sounds like the pampering is going well, hang in there you will make it through. KeeB- Sounds like you have made the decision and are ready to go.  But the darn wait and wait some more! We are all with you here and your date is coming.  Getting it behind you and on to recovery, hope your sore throat is better and you can have surgery as planned. ",

My MO was so good at explaining that yes there is still breast tissue there and with routine exams by our Drs we can be watched for any recurrance. I know I worry some about it but know I have done what I can, the rest is in God's hands. I take my Tamoxifen each day and hope with all the hot flashes/night sweats that it is doing its job to keep cancer away. SiennaS-welcome to our forum, glad you posted with us. I feel your pain as it is such a similar story to mine. I too was dx with left side IDC but MRI showed more areas of concern. Double lumpectomy done and not clear margins lead me down the path of bmx, LD flap recon. Did you get implants immediately? I wasn't able to do immediate implants but did TEs and LD flap. If you were able to get it all done, great! You will not need to have additional surgery for the implants! I had 6 drains but know each surgeon is different. Hope you are feeling better soon, and get those drains out too. Katlebbie-Thanks for your prayers and concern. The swelling goes down some during the night then comes right back by the end of the day. I am going to call BS nurse for referral for LE specialist on Monday. It can't hurt to try some massage and exercises to get this to move the fluid out and \"drain\" better.",

With these expanders I just don't bother!  One of the good things about this surgery as I don't really need them-no saggy boobs, just foobs of steel!  I have my lumpectomy that is a frown on the upper part of my new foob!  I had one near the nipple at 3:00 and it was removed at mx. My PS  hates where my BS did the lumpectomy scar! Nicole-AAAAHHH! what a relief getting out those drains!  You didn't need them very long thank goodness.  I had mine 3 weeks x 6 drains! Thought they would never come out. I agree, pamper yourself!  Take one day at a time that's the best we can do. SchoolC-Pamper away!  We deserve it!  Lord knows we need it as we go through this journey.  Massages, pedis, all are great.  My daughters did pedis for me prior to surgery.  Knew I couldn't have nail polish for my fingernails, but my toes were great!  All the nurses loved my toes in preop, as well during my hospital stay.  When I couldn't wash my hair due to drains and etc, my daughter made appt at the salon for them to wash my hair, they were so good not to lean me back too far and it felt so good to have them massage my head.  It's the little things that make things differance.",

Great to hear from you!  You are doing great, so good to have this behind you, now rest and heal!  No heroes here, take pain meds, it will get better.    StacieRae-Marvelous that the epidural worked so well for you!  Never would have guessed it as an option for mx.  Don't overdo it, take it easy, getting the drains out is a pinch then ...AHHHH  so good!!! sandra-I agree the sleeping is the worst, learned last surgery to medicate to get through the couple of weeks before surgery.  It all hits you most at night when you can't turn off your brain. I will be medicating this week for sure as mine is only 4 more days to go, yikes! Moonflwr-welcome friend! You have to be the most amazing person to have endured so much.  I will have the dreaded drains again, as I had sooo much drainage and seroma after my bmx/LD recon.  PS won't take any chances so will put them in regardless, we can always pull them out early if not draining, but he's right we will need them. I also worry about infection, my incisions were infected last time and we had tissue necrosis.  I was a dripping mess, incisions, drains all were leaking.  Multiple antibiotics took care of it finally and excision of the necrosis, made the scars wider but PS will \"fix incisions\" at exchange.  I just hope no infections, drains will be ok. Hope your TE is doing well hope you can rest and heal as well.   Well, I have cooked and cleaned and have work scheduled until I have surgery, so no time to worry, (till night time), but I am ready to go and get this done.  Hope my surgery sisters are able to rest and heal this weekend.",

My TEs and flap were saved but it was touch and go for a couple of weeks till healing finally won out.  This is why when people tell us about fevers, reddness, drainage, those of us who have been there know to act fast.  It is what I think saved my TE and LD flap.  These are complications of surgery and most do not experience them, but it is good to know and be aware of your own body and what you are seeing and feeling.  It is better to overreact than be sorry later. Hope you can make it through the next couple of days knowing it will all be over soon, you will do fine and be in recovery mode soon. sandra-Even after the exchange surgery my ribs and sternum really hurt afterward.  Not as bad as BMX but was more painful than I expected.  I asked PS if he used a baseball bat to beat my chest up, he paused and thought a bit and said no he decided to leave it at home! I guess it is all the muscle manipulation in taking out the TEs and putting in the implants.  He did do ''quite a bit of pocket work\" he said.  I have some bruising as well but not too much this time.  Still lots of swelling and underarm boob.  Hope all goes down soon.  It does take the body time to heal, some of us more than others...more of that waiting that I really really hate!  Ready to get on with my life after cancer, it is sooo close.",

Pain meds--narcotics yuk!  I had to take them last time and also this time, but they just make me sick, literally!  Was so glad to get off of them and on to motrin and tylenol.  Alternating every 3 hrs works well for me and decreases the pukes!  Beatrice-T-REX!  The only way to describe it! With exchange it returns to a degree, only a shorter time.  That surprised me, never thought it would be back after exchange.  Keep those pillows handy!  Glad you are on the recovery train! My swelling on the lefty continues, saw my PS yesterday and he admits I probably need a drain. Seroma returns! No aspiration near gel implants!  So, if not getting better we may need to return to surgery and  put in a drain.  My incisions look soo good, don't want to disturb them again, let alone, anesthesia, pain and more puking!  He gave me the choice now or wait a week and see if the swelling goes down on its own.  Sports bras help compress them enough to relieve the pressure.  The squishies are sooo much better even with the seroma pressure I think I can wait it out.  My underarm is like a roll of pillsbury cookie dough, so proping up my arms when I sit for comfort as well.  Feels like more fluid is building up in by back as well, but PS didn't really feel any, as he could remove it back there, just not near the breast area.  Just never ends!  Otherwise each day is getting better, just no energy, or appetite.  Will take it one day at a time!  Thinking of everyone and hope the recoveries are going well for all!

Still having swelling in the left, sports bra helps not as painful during the day, notice it more at night. Probably doing too much too, as I am feeling better and better. Hard not to try and get some things done around the house before the snow flies. Our weather has been great (70s) can't stay inside with it like this! Decorating for Halloween, it is so much fun with all the kids in the neighborhood, even though mine are 14-29! Glad for the good news on all of your results and advancing surgery dates. I will see LE specialist next week, takes awhile to get in but hope they can help move some of this fluid out. Otherwise I love my new squishies.(almost 2 weeks!) I feel for you who are going through the TE torture. I hated mine so much but once the fills are done you do learn to tolerate them, so hang in there it will get better. Take the pain meds and be good to yourself, this time will pass and your exchange will be here. My implants are 800cc Mentor high profile plus gels. It is hard to say what size I will be as they still need to settle or \" drop and fluff\". In the exchange forum, discussions on how they change over the next 3-6 months is another process. Now my left is swollen and the right is pretty normal now, so I think I will be a small D, which is good with me. They look very natural not hard like the TEs that were sticking up to my colarbone! Now they are where they should be maybe a little flatter in clothes. I have lost almost 50lbs in the last 6 months (which I had to loose) so my clothes hang on me anyway! I told my family to get me clothes for Christmas! By then I will know the size and be fitted for some new bras! I am happy with the results so far. Thinking of all who have had surgery and the struggles and anxiety you face. I have been there and understand. Still have my good days and bad but hopefully more good days ahead.

I think you need to tell the PS what you need to do for your job so you know how much time is needed. Plus, personally, I was off 8 weeks with bmx/LD flap surgery last March. Returned to work full time 12 hr shifts, and it about killed me! I was never so tired, and by 10 hrs was just so sore. So, this time I asked for the full 6 weeks off, I am not going to do that again. I am almost 3 weeks out and doing great. Tylenol, Motrin keeping me comfortable, just light housework, running errands, etc. If I had a desk job, I could see going to work, but not my physical job. Just the swelling underarm is causing me discomfort, some spasms occasionally, when I have overdone it a bit. Not anything like the ones with the TEs.",

Developed an infection, 4 wks out.  Felt lousy over the weekend called the on call doc who wouldn't go with antibiotics over the phone but would order narcotics if I needed them?? Convienced him on antibiotics and to see my PS asap in the week..Tuesday got an appt and got the incisional drainage with removal of some scabbing and necrotic tissue. Boy, it was smelly!  TMI, sorry..back to dressings and antibiotics! Seroma build up in my back removed as well 250cc this time.  After all that I was wiped out!  Today is better, incisions are looking better,still some drainage and burning but healing better. Will see PS and ONC next week.  I'm with you Maureen, dreading the doc visits as they seem to be bad news.  Just another bump on my rollercoaster. Hope I can go back to work in a few weeks, depends on how soon I can get healed and have enough energy to work a 12 hr shift.  Thinking of all the March sisters and hope all are healing and recovering well. ",

Pretty crampy today with more back ache, due to LD stretching. We were originally surgery sisters our surgeries very close together and here we are coming closer to the end. I too think about recurrance but the chances are very low for us, which should help us but  who thought we would get it to begin with? Need to have faith we have done what we can to prevent this from occuring and move on to focus on life ahead.  I work in L&D and enjoy the new life brought in every day which I played a part in which gives me the hope I need.

Summer is coming really want to start to enjoy it, feel like I've missed so much of this year already with this cancer stuff.  Hope all are feeling well tonight!",

But I had more fluid build up and need removal by aspiration just in my back (Latissimus dorsi recon).  Moral is to keep those drains even though I hated them as well.  I loved my recliner but it was old and worn out.  Added pillows and could tip off of my back slightly to make it more comfortable even with back incisions.  It would get ache some but after moving in the morning I felt better.  Just made it to my bed at 6 weeks out.  Still not comfortable with the TEs.  Getting poked and prodded all night.  I don't know about acupuncture but alternatives are always a choice, be sure to let your PS know what you plan to do. You are not alone in all the pain and feelings this is the forum to let loose, no apologizing, we have all been there.   Where did you have surgery?  I live in Parker outside of Denver, but work AT St Josephs downtown.  Hope you get to feeling better soon.  Once the drains are out all seems so much better!  Hope you are enjoying our nice weather.  Sending you healing (((HUGS!!))) ",

I really hate these TEs, don't know how anyone gets use to them. It always is burning, tingling. Someone said on the TE thread it was like wearing brushes under the skin, I agree! Yes, they are a healthy size for big gal, smaller than the original girls but ride higher! Just never can forget they are there and how they got there.
