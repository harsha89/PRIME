When I had the Ultrasound and the doctor who performed it said I needed the biopsy done, she said it didn't hurt. She didn't really describe the process. Today at work, a friend told me her experience. I didn't realize I would be on my stomach with my boob hanging down & the doctor working underneath. Then she talked about the horrible pain and someone having to hold her back down and I got a little freaked. All I could think of is saying no to the procedure, but I know I really need to do it. I can honestly say I usually don't stress about most things and can handle needles enough to donate blood 4 times a year. The idea of a needle near my nipple though makes me want to bury my head in the sand. My breast has hurt for a couple weeks now (fairly intense pain) which caused me to call my GYN and schedule an appointment. Neither her nor I felt ant lump, I just had this pain that lasted well after my period ended. I do have BC in my family so in the back of my mind was concerned. I was flabbergasted when they found something and scheduled the biopsy. I was so dazed I couldn't even come up with questions at that point to ask the doctor who did my ultrasound. Now, I'm worried about the waiting, now the darn needle (thanks for putting the size in perspective) and the results, the doc who did the ultrasound said I would feel okay to go to work after having the biopsy. Would you say that is true? I feel so scared but don't want to worry my husband with my worries. Thanks again for your quick response. I felt so overwhelmed when I placed my original post",

You will be in my thoughts and prayers today.  Thanks Cowgirl13, I certainly feel less anxious after reading everyone's words of encouragement,  Thanks Moderator! I found this very helpful and will be sure to let everyone know",
