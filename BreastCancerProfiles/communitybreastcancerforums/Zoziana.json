Question that hopefully Barred Owl or someone else could help me with. Background: Had double BMX (family history) ; tumor 1.9 cm, ER+ , PR+, HER2 negative, based on IHC, which was 1+. An OncoDX test was ordered by my MO. Having read about the HER2 different tests on this overall site (which my medical HMO plan referred us to in our orientation :), I requested a FISH retest, though I was told that the HER2 was checked again in the Onco test (but until reading this thread I didn't know about the way HER2 was tested, possible false negatives, etc.)...I wasn't exactly discouraged, but had I not asked, the FISH would not have been done in my case. Quest: 1: I am strongly HER2 positive on the FISH. My Onco isn't back yet. But, am I correct in my conclusion that now that I am so HER2+ with the best test for determining such status, the Onco really should not impact my treatment plan at all? And that standard chemo, followed by Herceptin, or maybe simultaneously with it, and then later, an AI , is what is most likely to be recommended? Quest 2: Given HER2+ status, are there standard scans that are done to see if their are mets? I had an abdominal CT for GI issues the week of my original biopsy, and I did have \"hypodensities too small to characterize\" in the liver. I am aware that such things, in a breast cancer patient, are only mets about 5% of the time (I know there is a liver mets thread). My quest. is should I advocate for other scans to check for mets? If so, which? In my HMO, one needs to be informed to get the top standard of care. They are very good if you are....but....I had to ask for that FISH. So I'd like to know what would be recommended. Maybe they will recommend scans-I just don't know, but want to be prepared for the onco appt. Thank you all in advance for being here! ",

The first negative HER2 IHC test was from the initial biopsy sample; the positive FISH was from the surgery. Of no real importance now, the MO said my ONCO did come back low, though I didn't ask what it was (just forgot; it was a 5:30 pm Friday phone call and I was driving...). In any event she said for her, the FISH trumped everything in my case and the ONCO didn't matter, so I was glad to hear that, as it seems the standard and reasonable opinion. 2. What drugs the MO is tentatively recommending. I have a full appointment Wed. April 20 and may learn more. MO wants chemo and Herceptin to start week of April 25 (6 weeks out from my BMX.) At this point, last Friday, the MO said she would be recommending chemo (a taxane) along with Herceptin for 12 weeks, then continuing Herceptin for the next 9 months, followed by AI for 5 years . My impression was that the only question she was thinking about might be whether to add an additional chemo agent along with the ones I mentioned. I did mention Perjeta--just threw it out there--but she didn't say anything particular. She is consulting with colleagues (within her oncology division in our HMO) to see what the consensus is for my treatment. Having read the materials you linked (thank you!) and others, I personally would not be comfortable forgoing either chemo or Herceptin. That's a given for me. I do want to know more about adding Perjeta. It seems to me that, as you pointed out, I am in a small subset of women now--particularly as my HER+ status hasn't been known for 2 months and I am now post-BMX. It seems perhaps that I would have had Perjeta right off the bat if they had known about the HER 2 status earlier, but I just don't know (and maybe no one does) if it would be helpful know. If the evidence is equivocal or lacking, but it can't hurt (low risk) to add Perjeta, I would do it. 3, Update regarding scans. The MO said she would rescan the liver in a few months, but a whole body PET scan wouldn't be indicated now. I'm not entirely comfortable with that, unless the treatment I would receive would be the same either way. I will need to ask her that question. The way I look at it, if nothing showed up anywhere else (like bones or brain or lungs) that would indicate any possible mets, then I am comfortable (probably) waiting another 3 months for another/different liver scan. But that isn't based on anything scientific I have read, and I will need science to get such scans I think (I'm in a very large HMO system) and, frankly, for me to know if it is warranted, as a PET scan isn't of course without some risk.
