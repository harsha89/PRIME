      "Content": "Momof6littles wrote: Background: there is a sizable hard area (about 3 cm x 5 cm) in the upper outer quadrant of my left breast. I have noticed it for about 2 years or so. It doesn't change with my cycle and it is different than when I first noticed it. But it's not a lump and no doctor has ever found it in a breast exam, so I didn't think anything of it. Not until I started to read about LCIS and lobular cancer. The surgeon at u of c (second opinion appointment)noticed it right away, didn't write it off and said we need to see how imaging correlates to this region. I have also started having bloody nipple discharge in that breast. This is the same breast the LCIS was found in. The surgeon from u of c just called. None of my imaging shows anything suspicious. BUT, it also doesn't explain the hard area. There is nothing that says it's good or bad. It's not reflected in the imaging. There is also nothing that explains the discharge, good or bad. It may be related to the biopsy, but there is no sign of a hematoma in the MRI. So, a follow up appointment is recommended in three months to check everything out again before a long term plan should be put into place. I really wish they would do an ultrasound of the area now instead of waiting. I'm nervous about this area. It has gone from wide and flat to more rounded/rope like. Can cancer really not show up on an MRI? Has anyone had an MRI NOT explain a large hard area? Should I wait three months? Advice please!

      "Content": "Momof6littles wrote: I have LCIS, a very lengthy family history on both sides of my family that I can trace back 3-4 generations (breast, ovarian, uterine,pancreatic, prostate). I have a distant cousin with PALB2 and CHEK2 mutations (male with prostate and DCIS). I cared for my mother when she was dying from breast cancer. I was married only one year, just had my first child. It was very emotional and intense. She had \"precancerous\" spots in her early 40's, IDC at 45, died at 56. A year after my mom died, I cared for my dad as he died from pancreatic cancer. It was very quick. He was burried on their 30th wedding anniversary. I had a toddler and was 8 months pregnant. Needless to say, all of this comes flooding back with my current diagnosis. Now here I am, 41 with LCIS, 6 children (ranging in age from 12 down 1 year old). On Monday I have my MRI. I have very dense breasts and I'm lucky they found the LCIS. I am trying to prepare myself mentally for the finding if something invasive. Maybe they won't this time. But I feel like a walking time bomb. My question is about treatment. If they find something invasive, I am just so afraid that they will miss something, not treat aggressively, and I will turn up with a metastasis. Has anyone had that happen? Am I being irrational? Has anyone had aggressive chemo even with a small tumor because of family history? I still have a lot if information to wait for (MRI, genetic testing), so I don't know what the future holds. And I'm filling a paper with questions for the oncologist. Any guidance would be helpful.

A week or two after surgery, I fell asleep on my left side and awoke with terrible pains in my shoulder blade and neck. It sort of got better, but not really. I feel a pulling down behind my shoulder blade, that goes up into my neck. It effects my ribs. I have thought it was a slipping rib (a rib keeps feeling not quite right, and I would try to click it into place). Unfortunately I pressed the rib too hard and actually fractured it. So my rib hurt, my shoulder keeps bothering me and it almost seems like it's getting worse (lots of clicking and popping of the shoulder blade and stiffness, difficult to rotate backwards). I'm just wondering if anyone experienced a slipping rib sensation with the Frozen shoulder. Did it affect your neck too? I'm going to see my surgeon for a six month follow up, but so far my regular docs keep dismissing my concerns.

I recently Hurt my rib and have been having shoulder pain (I assumed due to surgery). My surgeon ordered a ct before he would send me for pt for the shoulder just to be sure the rib wasn't fractured. But it is a fracture. He says the scan does not indicate mets, but he doesn't think it's a break that would have happened under normal circumstances. He was going to forward the images to my oncologist and see if he thought we should look further. I got the call yesterday that my oncologist wants to see me. My appointment is Tuesday and I'm very worried. I know that mets are not possible with LCIS, but there is the possibility they missed something invasive.

Darn that thick area and bloody discharge that does not show up on any imaging!) double mastectomy scheduled for May 25th. I'm not doing reconstruction. 2/3 of the women on both sides of my family have had BC, mastectomies with no reconstruction. So going flat is not really strange in my book. Wondering about how bad the scar looks over time. My mom's back in the early 90's was pretty bad. The surgeon said over time, they can go back an neaten it up if I want. Kind of curious if anyone has done that. Or over time if things smooth out? And what happens when you exercise your chest muscles? Sorry if that seems like a silly weird question. Just trying to imagine how things will turn out. Not that I'm really concerned about a cosmetic outcome. I consider it a battle scar. Just trying picture it all. Thanks!

I have just been diagnosed with (LCIS - you know, \"not really cancer\") but have a significant history on both sides of the family: My mother died of pre-menopausal breast cancer, her brother has had Hodgkin's lymphoma, her mother (my grandmother) had uterine and bilateral breast cancer (one being triple resistant to hormone therapies), my grandmother's brother died from pancreatic cancer, another died from Hodgkin's lymphoma, grandma's aunt died of breast cancer. A second cousin who is male had breast cancer. On my father's side, my father had bladder cancer at 40, died of pancreatic cancer, his sister had ovarian cancer and bilateral breast cancer, his other sister died of breast cancer, and his youngest sister died of an aggressive cancer that found in her liver but wasn't exactly identified (but is now suspected to be ovarian cancer, but who really knows), two of my cousins just were treated at 50 for breast cancer. Two of my grandmother's sisters died of unknown cancers that were found metastasized to the liver (this was in the 1920's), but I wouldn't be surprised if they were breast or ovarian. My mother's entire family comes from one town in Slovakia, the emigrated to the US together and intermarried. So there's a limited gene pool on that side. I still am awaiting an MRI to see if there is anything else, and will go for genetic consult for testing April 4th I'm just sick right now, trying to decide what to do. I want to do a double mastectomy (even though LCIS is not really cancer). But what if the tests comeback negative for mutations do you just follow the family trail of cancer and make a decision without a positive? Advice? Thoughts? Stories to share?

I have a large area of thickened breast tissue that has been getting larger in the left breast over several years. LCIS was just diagnosed in that breast. I have just over the past week had bloody discharge from that nipple. I never thought anything of the thickening until I started reading about lobular cancer. Completely unrelated, recent bronchitis brought on costochondritis. The pain has been bad. I was only taking Motrin twice a day and my doctor said it wasn't enough to reduce the inflammation. So I'm taking 600mg every 4 hours for 2 days, then dropping it down to 400mg. It has really worked and the pain and tenderness is finally abating. Now, on day two of taking the NSAIDs the breast thickness has really gone down. Not disappeared, but I'm shocked at the results. My husband, who has noticed the thickening too said its like my breast shrank. I know there are recent studied about NSAIDs and breast cancer risk reduction. Anyone know of anything else? What could be going on? I have been really worried about this area and now I'm flabbergasted.
