The test that I am referring to is the OncoDX that is given to ER positive patients.The outcomes were essentially identical rather these individuals had received chemotherapy or not. This is indeed a landmark study for people who will not receive any benefit from chemotherapy regimens. Think of the people who could be spared long term collateral effects such as neuropathy, permanent hair loss, chemo brain etc. for no gain! Love to see real progress in the treatment of this horrid disease that actually protects people from well intentioned \"over treatment\"",

Cristi - I hope you are doing well, and want to share that Ihave just experienced the same. I was diagnosed in February with Stage 2B IDC with a 4.5 cm tumor and 2 known nodes involved per MRI imaging. I immediately started neoadjuvant chemo with 6 rounds of TAC. We noticed a significant difference in the tumor clinically after the first dose. After the third treatment, ultrasound showed that the largest node had returned to normal size, and the tumor had reduced to ~ 2cm, so the regimen continued. We continued to feel a difference in the tumor (softer) throughout the remainder of the course. However, the main node did seem to be increasing in size again. Post chemo MRI on June 15 did show activity in the tumor area and known nodes, but that the tumor had shrunk to 1.5 cm. I underwent BMX on July 9 & we expected the path report to show some residual disease. However, we were shocked & devastated to get the results that the tumor area was MUCH larger than originally thought, extensive disease remained, and of the 21 nodes that were removed, 15 were positive for cancer. We're in a much more serious situation than originally thought, and have certainly had our low points this week. My oncologist is doing a lot more tests on my tumor and starting me on a new chemo regimen as soon as I can get my drains out. We're scared, but optimistic that there are still many treatment options. Next hurdle to get through will be the PET scan...hoping & praying comes back clean. Meow13 - thank you for sharing the story of the person you know who is celebrating her 8 year cancerversary. Certainly gives those of us in this situation some hope!",

I honestly think the more I read through posts on here, that the likelihood of getting a new cancer in the contralateral breast is WAY underestimated. I think some of these studies need to be reevaluated to reflect that. I was diagnosed with a much more aggressive tumor that was nearly triple negative (10% progesterone receptors) that was very close to my chest wall....scary! And I was feeling like it was a slim possibility until it was diagnosed. What a shocker.",

I'm really fatigued today; not sure if from the chemo, the filgastrim shots, or the thoracentesis I had yesterday (or the combination of it all). I'm still pretty sore from the thoracentesis, but I can breathe so much better. They removed 1.5 liters of fluid! And that is not even all of it. I plan on resting as much as I can this weekend, and getting my wigs cleaned. Gonna need them again soon. Nice weekend to you all.",

I've been battling triple negative cancer since February 2015 (diagnosed at 39), and literally have been in some kind of a treatment since then. The cancer had moved to the nodes on the contra lateral side this spring, and I just finished radiation for that. Then had a CT/PET scan this week and was given the devastating news yesterday that it has now engulfed all of my lymph nodes on both sides of my chest from my neck to my groin. Also have skin mets. So, Now am officially stage IV. I also have a significant amount of malignant pleural effusion in my left lung with 60% of my lung filled with fluid, and I'm in a great deal of pain. No masses in any organs, but was informed that this is now a significant threat to my life. I wish I could have started chemo yesterday, but I am starting Tuesday. I also know there are a lot of clinical trials for triple negative metastatic patients, so there are options. Still very scary now knowing my mortality as been given a violent shove into serious in my face. I've got a lot of reading to do on the earlier pages on this thread to see what info might help me, but wanted to introduce myself since I'll be on this board a lot I'm sure,and because you all are always so supportive and helpful. Hate that any of us have to be on such a board, but I know that there is so much love and support here, and that I'm in a good place. Hugs to you all.",

Right now, my treatment plan is adriamycin/navelbine once per week for three weeks, then I get an off week. The plan is for 6 cycles of this regimen then have another scan to see how it is working. After that, it's all up in the air. My doctor is looking for relevant trials as am I. I'm searching clinicaltrials.gov for triple negative mets trials, and there are a lot. I encourage others to do the same. There can be so many variations between each one of our tumors, so it's also a good idea to have your path reports handy while you are looking. And there's nothing saying you can't get on another trial after you've finished one, as long as you meet the timelines in the inclusion/exclusion criteria. So, for all of us, don't ever give up hope. Texas was right when she said TN is not curable, but it is still possible to reach NED. Boy, would I love to hear and see that my report. And Texas you are such a positive inspiration. Thank you. Congratulations to you on your long lived NED! Enjoy your retirement and time with your hubby. That certainly is a dream of mine to make it to those days! I'm still hopeful that day will come for me. That one trial that could turn out to be the magic bullet could be in the making. Hang in there ladies; we've got more fighting to do, but all that we've been through has just made us stronger!!! I go for a thoracentesis tomorrow to drain fluid that has accumulated in the pleural space of my left lung. Looking forward to relief from that! Hugs to you all!",
