I was 31 and planning a wedding (which is now indefinitely postponed) when I found out I had IDC, grade 2 also in October. I think the place where you are right now is the absolute scariest part. In the beginning, you don't feel like you know anything yet and that's what makes it scary. It WILL get better. I too was terrified of surgery. I never had it before, and since finding out about breast cancer, I've had 4 surgeries. I had a bilateral mastectomy with tissue expanders placed in November. To say that I was scared was an understatement. But they really take care of you when you undergo such a big procedure. It was painful when I woke up. The tissue expanders are very uncomfortable, and I remember thinking that the pain would never go away. However, by about five weeks out, I no longer even noticed them. I was back to sleeping on my sides by then too. While it is uncomfortable and painful at times, it DOES get better. I actually think the worst part was the drains. I could not wait to get them out, but they are very important. My fiance helped me wash my hair and shower, but he only had to help me for one day. I got my hair washed after leaving the hospital at a hairdresser, then the following day he helped me. I bought a lanyard and safety pinned my drains to that while I showered. I immediately started arm exercises and was able to raise my arms enough to wash my hair if I had my head down. Make sure that anything you need is low (food from cupboards, lotions) so that you don't have to raise your arms up. Get something to prop you up in bed. I read that recliners are your best friend after surgery. I would've loved to have one because your chest feels like it's going to cave in when you lay on your back. However, I didn't have a recliner, so I bought a pillow (http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/heml...) so that I could sleep sitting up for a while. Take your pain killers. They give them to you for a reason. I do not like to rely on pills, and I lived on them for about 4-5 days. After that, I slowly started weening myself off, as long as I felt like I could handle it. Wear easy clothes. I lived in a robe and my amoena camisole for the first week. (http://www.metromedicalonline.com/amoena2860.html#...) The camisole was a life saver. I'll post a picture in a sec. After the first week, I lived in my camisole and button up shirts. There was no way I was lifting my arms to go in an over the head shirt. Finally relax. Watch movies and destress. The first 3 days, I was hardly awake because of drugs and I couldn't be happier that I slept those days off. Take care of yourself. It is all doable. Nothing is ever as bad as you expect and even when you feel it is, it gets better!",

Then, to take it off (it has lasted up to 3 weeks for me!), I use Blink Gel Remover . I leave it on for a few minutes, and then they come right off. If they don't come off right away, I just leave it on a little longer. Putting them on and taking them off definitely takes some practice and getting used to, but I like that I don't have to wear makeup when I do it. And it's also nice for an occasion where I have to dress up.",

Some people gain weight, some people lose weight, and some people do not notice any change in weight. I have read that most people who gain weight, seem to gain it from steroids and it goes away soon after chemo is over. For me personally, I had steady weight gain of about a pound or two a week. I realized it was from steroids and since I heard that it was mostly water weight, I just made slight changes to what I ate. The only thing I did was cut back on salt and really paid attention to whether I was eating because I was bored or hungry. That's it. After that change, I slowly started to go back to my normal weight. It's scary to start chemo, but try to relax and take it one day at a time. You'll get through it and you'll be happy that you're doing everything you can to prevent a recurrence. You've got a big support system here. Good luck!!",
