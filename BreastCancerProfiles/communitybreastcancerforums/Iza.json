During my bad week I would be very tired and pretty much useless -- I didn't go to work and I didn't do any cooking or housework either. Fortunately my family and friends helped out big time with all of that. On my good weeks I would go to work, if not the whole day, and I would be able to do some housework, but I didn't really feel like doing much. These are times to accept all the help that you can get. Also, I did not feel like eating regular food. On the days right after chemo I would survive on broth and toast. Just eat what feels good for you. And I had a very hard time with water -- everyone was saying how important it was for me to drink water and be hydrated, but my body was just repulsed by water. It was not a matter of taste -- it was the texture of water! I just could not stand it. But other fluids such as broth came in better, so that's what I did. My onc nurse said it didn't really matter what kind of fluids I had as long as I got them in, so just be easy on yourself. I also found that sparkling water worked better for me than regular water. I became a Perrier girl over chemo and I still am :-) Just take it easy, be gentle with yourself, baby yourself and let others baby you too. Hugs, Iza ",

Just now you are experiencing the confusion we have always gone through in the first few days as you just stepped into a scary world that probably was entirely unknown to you just a few days ago. First off, many, many women live long, healthy lives after a breast cancer diagnosis. Second, there are many different approaches to breast cancer treatment. Your priority now, along with being supportive to your mother, is to find her a competent medical team. Maybe she already has one! But don't hesitate to obtain second or third opinions, even if it is only to confirm what her current doctor says. Things are rarely always black or always white when it comes to breast cancer. For example, whether your mother needs chemo or not; or radiation. She will certainly need surgery, but it may be a mastectomy or just a lumpectomy depending on many things. And sometimes the order of treatments (first surgery, then chemo, or the other way round) may be an important consideration. What I am trying to say is, these are confusing times, but you need to find the time to research all the options before any decisions are made. We all feel a sense of urgency at the beginning and want things to happen as soon as possible, but the fact is that medically speaking there is nothing wrong with postponing any decisions for a few weeks, and that may give you the opportunity to make a better decision. So, don't jump into any particular course of treatment, research your options, figure out what team of doctors you and your mother trust the most, and take it one day at a time. You will find a lot of information on these boards and on breastcancer.com and other similar websites. There are also some excellent books -- for example, Dr. Susan Love's book on breast cancer is a classic and full of the kind of information that you need right now. For most of us, finding out that we had breast cancer led to a tough year of treatments, but we came out on the other end and now we are back to our normal lives. A big hug,",

But then sometimes a lump is more than a lump and it is in fact cancer. There is no way of telling without a biopsy. So, here is a typical sequence of events: A woman finds a lump, goes to her primary care physician, the doctor orders a mammogram. At the time of the mammogram, they often perform a sonogram too. These tests will give the radiologist a fairly good idea of whether the lump is harmless (a cyst, for example) or suspicious. However, the only way to know for certain is to perform a biopsy. So, following the mammogram a biopsy is typically ordered. Results come back in a couple of days, and at that point at least you find out the most important piece of information: is it benign, or is it cancer? If it is benign, the doctor will probably want to take it out anyway, and even if the doctor does not think it is necessary, it is widely agreed on these boards that \"the only good lump is the one in a jar,\" so most women here will recommend to have it surgically removed. This is called a lumpectomy. If the lump turns out to be cancer, there is a lot of important information that needs to be obtained, understood, and processed in a matter of a few weeks. For example, the characteristics of the tumor (grade, hormone receptors, her-2 positive or negative. This information will come from the same biopsy that gave the diagnosis, but it will take longer (they use the same tissue for further testing and they may send it to other labs). In the meanwhile, you (your mother) would be referred to a surgeon and/or an oncologist, in no particular order (but you would want to see both, and even better if they are a team, as is the case in breast centers). They would order full-body scans to find out if other parts of the body are affected. Eventually the doctors will make a recommendation for treatment. Treatment always involves surgery (a lumpectomy or a mastectomy). Depending on the particulars of each case, chemo and/or radiation may also be recommended. Whatever they tell you, it is always a good idea to have a second opinion, just to be sure. And do not feel pressured to make any decisions quickly. Everything, including cancer, can wait a few weeks. I really hope your mom receives good news. But if she doesn't, please know that she can do it. All of us have been in her shoes. Hugs,",

If taking a particular food, or staying away from other foods, really made a difference in survival, all of the women on these boards would be embracing that strategy. Of course, it makes sense for everyone (cancer or not) to follow a healthy diet of natural foods that are not highly processed, as part of a healthy lifestyle (limited exposure to chemicals, lots of fresh air, physical activity, good sleep, low stress levels). Some raw foods are wonderful, but many others are best digested and assimilated cooked. The truth is that, as long as you eat sensibly, what you eat is neither going to kill you nor is it going to keep you alive. A substantial diet change is not going to cure your mother, and it can certainly make her life more miserable, so I wouldn't go there. I would try to steer her toward natural foods, but I would not suggest cutting off any food group, such as sugars. Sugar, particularly refined ones, are not a very healthy food and should be taken in moderation, but, for someone who is used to them, giving them up can be hard. Let your mother have her sweets (in moderation) if this makes her happy. This will give her quality of life and, again, frankly, it is not going to make a difference in how long she lives. ",
