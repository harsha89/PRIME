I believe you will be fine. My radiologist said that the only reason they do chemo first is because it is the hardest. They never said it had to be done in a certain time frame. He said I could do chemo after radiology. Which I might do because there's more freedom to leave town. Radiology is everyday M-F for 6 weeks. Ladies, what is your opinion of that?",

He said, \"Who ordered this test?\". My surgeon, a woman, who was wonderful and always did everything to help me, ordered it. Although, if I hadn't had it, I would not in this dilemma, but it is good to have choices. I would not do chemo, if I had had no lymphatic involvement. The oncologist said, he has always advised chemo for cancer that involves the nodes, but he would be OK with my choice of no chemo. Before I spoke to him I assumed that would be his course, my score of 19 appeared on the graph as not responding to chemo at all. So I was shocked when he didn't recommend what the test showed in my mind. I emailed him that night with my decision, no chemo. I saw the radiologist this week and when I told him I wasn't doing chemo, his resident burst out with, \"that's scary!\" the attending doc said, \"Oh no, we never use the S word with patients.\". Poor girl she was devastated, but it made me stop and think about what I was doing. I asked the doctor what he thought about the Oncotype test and he felt it should never have been printed. Only 367 women were tested in my group, doctors don't change years of successful procedures unless thousands of women have been documented. I emailed him that night and said no chemo for me.",
