I was supposed to do six but my onkologist advised me to stop at 4 due to the fact that i was having a hard time on it and that the last 2 would carry too much toxicity for little benefit. Any one of you out there had the same experience. I will continue with herceptin for the next year.  i had a double mastectomy as i had DCIS in my right breast and DCIS plus an invasive component in the left breast.  would love to hear if any of you had similar circumstance and how you feel.",
