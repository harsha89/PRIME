LOL  Someone to just to give me the little push that I needed.  From then on my attitide changed.  That is the key to getting through.  POSITIVE ATTITUDE!!!!   I am sorry that you have to go through this!  But that that does not kill us makes us stronger!  You will make it through this!  Chemo is not as bad as it has been in the past.  I had 16 rounds of chemo and have to have Herceptin(hormonal therapy) for a year.  Then follow with 5 years of tamoxifen due to the fact that mine was estrogen positive and HER2 positive.  No journey is the same but you are in the right place for support. Hugs & Blessings to you!! ",
