The people who post there routinely have blockages and seem to know a lot about them. I know that bc mets are different from cc mets but the blockages they experience seem very similar to what you are going through.  I'm sure they could answer any questions you may have. They are very friendly and don't seem to mind questions. Many are Stage IV themselves. They probably can give you the name of some colon specialists in your area as well. Once again, I hope you don't mind my intrusion but I'm hoping this information may help you in some way, Good luck and God bless, Banjokatt",

I once stopped taking Xanax without the taper and thought I was going to die -- had the shakes, lightheadedness, vomiting, just about ever se possible. If you can't get hold of your doc, take one half the dose and it should help. Once again, sorry for intruding, but I know how hellish it is to stop cold turkey! Banjokatt (caregiver} ",
