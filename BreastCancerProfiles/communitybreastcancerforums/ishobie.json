I was dx'd in April of 2010, lost my beloved 14 yr old dog, the same week and have been on auto pilot since. I just finished my 4th treatment of TCH, which I have had very bad side effects from. I am usually home in bed for 10 days despite all the meds I am getting. Anyway I went for a session with the psychologist on their staff yesterday. She was very good, very kind, very compassionate. As soon as I got into the office with her I burst into tears. We talked about my dog passing, the grief over her, my surgery, the anger I have felt about losing her and getting cancer.  I never realized how much emotion has been bottled up in side of me these past 4 -5 months. Sadness, anger, fear, all of that came pouring out. I fetl so much better talking to somebody who understood and where I felt I could cry like a baby ~~~ I plan on going back every couple of weeks for the remainder of my treatments.  If anyone feels like I did and do, I really think counseling is a great idea. It won't make these feelings go away, but at least I am not walking around today, at least, all tense and sad. Isabel 4/2010 DCIS, IDC 0.7 CM, HER2+ 0/6 negative Log in to post a reply",

I wish i had the nerve to wear it like this, i am so sick of wigs.  I started using this treatment for thinning hair by phyto and i think it has helped a lot.  I started it as soon as i saw some hair growing, which happened about 4 weeks after chemo stopped. It really will help to feel normal again when my hair is longer and blonde.Does that sound vain? I hope not.....I had such a horrible time with chemo and finally I feel physically better.  My oncologist said you can never tell how long it will take for hair to grow back, Im assuming close to a year. happy holidays everyone isabel",

My oncologist said i have less than a 5% chance of recurrence since I did all this treatment and those are damm good odds. Chemo is rough believe me, but I am glad I did it.

It wasn't easy but if it takes away even a bit of a chance of recurrence, it was worth it. You really can't know for sure what is going on there until the surgery and the final pathology report. He is probably just preparing you for the \"might' of what may be.

It is scary and overwhelming. But just know that you can get through it.  One step at a time, one hurdle a day.  When you know more about the plan of treatment, you ask questions, get second opinions. I got opinions from two oncologists before I proceeded. These boards are so helpful, especially during the anxiety ridden times. Even when you just feel lonely and lousy from treatments, it is so helpful. You are in my thoughts and prayers, keep us posted Isabel",
