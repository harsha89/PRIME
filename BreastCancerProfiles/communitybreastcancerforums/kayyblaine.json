    "Content": "kayyblaine wrote: I was diagnosed with breast cancer in March of this year. I had a successful lumpectomy and have had several follow up appointments. I am allegable for the prevention pill and now must decide on radiation, chemo, and just the general treatment. My doctor has now noticed a spot in my liver, and we still don't know if it's cancerous. He was already avid about chemotherapy, but is even more so now, even though we don't know the results! Also my oncotyping number is a 52, which has made him even more uneasy. I'm just not sure who to trust and what to do.Â  My mother-in-law is an avid believer in natural medicine and believes if I do radiation or chemotherapy, I will only develop further tumors from these treatments and die anyhow...need advice and help - what do you think is best?
