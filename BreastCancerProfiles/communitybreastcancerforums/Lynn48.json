Whine away (though I really don't think it's whining). I don't think I could handle all that with as much aplomb as you do. God bless you and congrats to your girls on their ribbons. Lynn",

The one thing I am NOT surprised at is the number of people praying for you. You have always been, and I am sure you will continue to be, an inspiration for us with your wonderful upbeat attitude, and the love you give so freely to everyone. We love you Deb. I am saying big prayers that it is \"only\" an infection. {{{{{{{{{{{{DEB}}}}}}}}}}}}} Lynn ",
