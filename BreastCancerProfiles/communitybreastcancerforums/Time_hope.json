    "Content": "Time_hope wrote: Hi everyone, I am feeling a little lost right now. I noticed a lump in my breast a couple of weeks ago. I saw my doctor on Monday and he said it is about 2cm and movable, but that he didn't feel any lymph nodes. I had an ultrasound today and had the results within a couple of hours. The receptionist said it was a fibroadenoma, but they had scheduled a mammogram for the beginning of April to be sure. I guess I am confused because I thought an ultrasound was the best way to check for a fibroadenoma. If they think it is that, what will they be looking for in a mammogram? My doctor really didn't explain the process to me so I am not really sure what to expect and am feeling a little worried now that they want me to have a mammogram. Log in to post a reply",
