My right breast is the problem child and after my lumpectomy it went from being the slightly smaller sister to the new big sister. My RO & surgeon both kept saying that would change and in the last 4 days it has done exactly that. Now it's pretty much back to where it's always been in the family order. ...just in time for the rads to change it even more. :|",

I held up my list and told her there were a few items I needed but I was mainly trying to narrow down my suggested healing creams. She looked a little puzzled so I quietly said I was looking for something to help with radiation SE's and I unconsciously sort of lightly tapped my right breast. Her eyes widened and she said, I'll be right back. Then she spun around and bustled off. I thought to myself, well, that was odd. A couple minutes later she appeared back next to me with several samples of various creams & ointments including Aquaphor, CeraVe, etc. She dumped them in my basket, touched my shoulder and with tears in her eyes she said, \"Please, would it be OK if I prayed for you?\" That was so unexpected and I was totally caught off guard. After a 10 second conversation. A complete stranger, in the middle of Walgreen's, crying for me. Asking permission to pray for me. Next thing I know, we're BOTH standing there crying in the middle of Walgreen's. That sweet woman will be forever in my heart. I guess I needed a cry and a reminder that the world isn't such a harsh place after all.",

That was such a weird panic attack yesterday and at the time, I felt it came out of nowhere but as several of you pointed out, there were legitimate reasons for it. When my husband got home last night, as soon as he walked in the door, I lifted my shirt and said, tell me if I'm imagining something going on here. (Nothing like coming home & being flashed in the kitchen.) :) He took one look at me and said, \"Ohhh, that looks like it hurts!\" I was sooo red & swollen and tender after my very 1st treatment. I couldn't imagine getting 19 more on top of that. I went to bed feeling very depressed & sore & thinking I'd have to go thru the same ordeal today. Oddly enough, I woke up this morning feeling not the least bit apprehensive. I checked my skin and I was back to my pre-rad condition. No redness and no swelling. When I went in this morning, I said hello to all the techs & nurses, talked to a couple other patients, walked into the treatment room and climbed right up on the table without a 2nd thought. Everything truly was easy-peasy and was over before I knew it. I told my team about my whole ordeal yesterday and they were very understanding. They told me I shouldn't try to get thru anything like that on my own and that they've seen all that & more, multiple times. They're more than happy to stop and give me a break anytime and to do whatever it takes to make me comfortable. Thursdays are the day I meet with my RO so I told him about the burning, redness, swelling, etc. He said, \"and when you woke up this morning it was gone, right?\" I told him yes, that's right. He said he sees that happen occasionally on the first 1 or 2 sessions and it's considered more of a \"skin reaction\" than what would normally fall into the \"radiation burn\" category. After that first reaction, the skin will calm down (which it has) until the real se's start up. I can expect the \"for real\" se's to start once I get closer to the the halfway point. What did I learn today? 1. I have to stop squashing things down and just feel what I feel. 2. Sharing is a good thing. 3. I'm not any more unusual than all those who have gone before me. If anyone on here has a reaction on their very first session remember, sometimes it just happens. Thank you all again for the support and especially thank you to all who share your stories. It helps immensely and you all have my heartfelt wishes for better days ahead for all.",

Maybe I'll print out some kind of calendar for the fridge so I can have a visual of my progress and stay positive. As I was leaving there today, I heard lots of cheering in the hallway. When I rounded the corner there was a woman there surrounded by several of the techs and I got to see her ring the bell. That was a great visual and gives me something to look forward to. Right before I left today, my tech handed me a big yellow card to place on the dash of my car. It allows me to park in the close-up, reserved area for cancer patients. This probably sounds strange but until that very moment, I had never thought of myself that way. Somehow, my brain was perfectly fine rationalizing that I use to have a cancerous tumor that was removed. I never thought of myself as \"a cancer patient\". Weird. 😉  ",

Like everyone else here, from the moment I received my diagnosis, everything became a whirlwind of appointments, tests, surgery, treatments, new experiences, etc. You don't really getmuch absorption time to contemplate how it affects your life. I think I'll always have trouble thinking of myself as a \"cancer patient\". They found a cancerous tumor in me that was removed so technically, I guess I HAD cancer. In the grand scheme of my life though, this part of it has been just a small blip of time. Now, I'm doing rads to prevent a recurrence. In my mind, I'm still not a cancer patient. Maybe it's my subconscious trying to ease me into reality or my psyche trying to re-write the story. For me, I know part of it is that when I see others in the oncology waiting room I don't feel (for lack of a better word here) \"worthy\" to say I'm a cancer patient. Some of those people are true heroes. Even on these forums, I see bravery here every day. You are warriors, all!",

I've been staying so positive thru all of this and have been wanting to get these rads started and over with. I expected the session to go fairly smoothly but I think I had some weird panic attack or something. I was chit chatting with my techs and all was fine. Then the 4 of them finished up with me, walked out and there I was in that machine from outer space. It was freezing in the room and even though I had warm blankets, I couldn't stop shivering. Then my neck knotted up into a ball of pain. They had told me to just lay still, don't wiggle and to breathe normally but suddenly, I couldn't remember how I normally breathe. In fact, I could barely breathe at all and I felt like I had lock-jaw. Then my arms didn't like how they were positioned up above my head. My neck kept right on killing me and then I started to get a cramp in my foot. I tried to stretch out my toes but they had put a giant rubber band around my shoes so I couldn't move my feet at all! That's when my claustrophobia kicked in!!! In my head I was frantically trying to talk myself off the ledge when I suddenly had a ridiculous amount of nasal drip. Took me forever to remember how to breathe and swallow at the same time and then I realized my right arm was completely numb. I tried counting while breathing but I kept screwing up even that. Right when I was about to call out to them that I needed a break, the 4 techs came sashaying back in all cheery and smiley faced and I don't know why I did this but...I pretended it was all easy-peasy, no problem at all. Geesh! I'm so hoping tomorrow will be better. Other than hating \"Spaceship Isotope\", I've been good up to now. And it's just a table for God's sake. Why can't I just lay there like a normal person? I have never had anything like that happen before and I certainly don't want a repeat tomorrow. So now, can anyone tell me if it's normal to burn on your very first session? I've been pre-moisturizing for the last week, extra hydrating, etc. I used Miaderm before I left the hospital but I thought I felt hot all the way home. I convinced myself I was just imagining it and still rattled from my weird episode. However, I'm obviously red now and my nipple is really red and swollen. I thought I'd be able to get thru at least a couple of treatments before this started. How am I going to make it thru 19 more sessions? Ugghhh...",

Let The Healing Begin! I'm so looking forward to that and keeping my eye on the prize. Radiation seems to be the gift that keeps on giving. Lots of odd little symptoms that just keep you guessing and slightly off kilter. I'm just starting to see signs of the dreaded rash creeping up my collar bone. The zingers, zips, zaps, zigs & zags like to surprise me at the most inopportune times. Today I was reaching for a gallon of milk in the Safeway when one of those crazy zingers totally caught me off guard. I almost dropped the milk and I made a little squeak. The guy next to me looked at me like I was crazy. Shoulder pains, weird arm sensations, numb areas that somehow manage to hurt or itch and, whatever other little trick my body decides to play on me. For a couple of days now, my sternum has been very painful. I asked my RO and he said the rads can inflame the joints where your ribs connect to the sternum. Today I have an oblong, fluid filled, very swollen area over my sternum. I looked in the mirror and just thought, hmmm, that one's interesting. Just another one of those little items that no one tells you about. I think they don't tell us these thing because there's just too many of them to cover and everyone gets a completely different grab bag of tricks to deal with. It's probably easier for them to deal with each of our concerns when/if they show up. All these odd happenings are still better than cancer and they're only temporary. Can't wait to see what little trick I'll be surprised with when I wake up tomorrow morning. :) Good night everyone and Stay Strong!",

I was hoping that would go away over the weekend. And now I have one of those little balloons in my armpit above my nodes scar. That makes me think that both might be lymph node related. Today, I've added cortisone to my routine to help with my growing rash. At first, I was just carrying a tube of Miaderm in my purse. Then I graduated to a little ditty bag to carry multiple lotions and some cleansing cloths (to remove all those lotions before rads). Then I switched to one a little larger so I could fit a piece of fleece material that I fashioned into a little snap-on protector thingy that I can put on when I'm feeling extra tender. At this rate, by the time this is all done, I'll be hauling an entire duffle bag around with me. Sigh...",

I always take a protein bar and my water bottle to my appointments. Even if I don't feel like it, I eat that on my way home and it helps. By the time I was halfway thru treatment, I felt the fatigue pretty badly. One day I fell asleep on the couch at 5:30 pm and didn't wake up until 11 hours later. My energy is good before noon and drops off rapidly after. Taking short breaks throughout the day did not help me. It doesn't matter how many breaks I take early in the day, the afternoons still get to me and by the time I'm done with dinner, I'm done for the day. I have noticed this past week that my skin is much worse but I think the fatigue has let up slightly. Most evenings now I can make it all the way to 8:00 before I start nodding off. :) It's not so much the sleepiness that's the problem for me, it's the complete exhaustion/ deep fatigue that comes on suddenly and feels so debilitating at times. I try to walk as much as I can but some days, it's just not happening. At 10:00 am I can feel great and have ambitious plans for the day. Then at 3:00 pm, I can barely climb the stairs. Fortunately for me, I'm in real estate so I have some leeway with making my own schedule and juggling my appointments. Everyone is different so it's probably impossible to plan for how you will be affected. Maybe best to try and give employers a heads-up of what may happen and then play it by ear. Another issue for me with working is that I cannot wear a bra at all and I have no work clothes that don't hurt. There's not many flannel or fleece things I can get away with wearing for work. Check out all the tips on this site and try whatever you're comfortable with. You'll find your own rhythm and what works best for you. Remember, there will probably be some days when nothing works at all and that's ok. That's when you'll know it's time to pamper yourself a little more. :) ",
