I read somewhere that migraines and a history of motion sickness predicts this with chemo; maybe that explains it. I've been better over the last 5-6 days, but since yesterday have been vaguely nauseated again.

And I'm very tired. Not sleepy-tired, fatigued-tired. For example, I unpacked a box of toys and scratching posts for my cats yesterday, put them together, and HAD to sit down for an hour. I was just exhausted. However, I'm on different types of meds (including Herceptin) from most people apparently, and the doses are high, according to my onc. Most people seem to have very little nausea. So please don't let this discourage you. I'm clearly an outlier.",

He seemed to think it was a reasonable plan. They also said, while on the phone with me, that they've discovered my anemia is caused by kidney disease. Apparently I have stage 3 kidney disease, but there's not much they can do about this because one of the major treatments is not possible when one has breast cancer. Bummer!

That it felt like a drain or something that might have somehow been left behind in March when I had the implants put in. He said he'd call my surgeon and call me back. Well, she said it's definitely not something felt over from surgery. So they are trying to set up an ultrasound for me next week. I honestly wasn't worried about it being a reoccurence until now. It feels like a horizontal mass, really kind of like a drain... but really rubbery. Nothing like it on the other side.

Apparently chemo does NOT agree with me, to the point that I literally could not keep anything down. My doctor prescribed a rub-in kind of phenergan, since I couldn't keep the pills down, but even that had little benefit. As a result, I've lost a little more than 10 lbs already. When I saw onc. on Thursday, I was in severe pain from bone pain and also neurological pain from a previous cancer kicking up again. He loaded me up with IV pain meds, vitamins, and fluids before I left his office. Doc also prescribed anti-nausea patches, but they haven't arrived yet. He also kindly and gently suggested marijuana. If I followed him (and I was REALLY sick while I was listening to him), there needs to be a 1 to 1 ratio in the THC to CBD in the substance, and he thought inhaled consumption might help the most. Unfortunately, it's not legal at all in my state, but one of my kids, bless her, is happily trying to arrange for some to arrive at my house via a friend. After I left his office Thursday, I stopped at the pharmacy to pick up the pain meds. Standing there, I started to have severe chest pain. I broke my sternum in a car accident 10 years ago, and the doctor then warned me that it would never completely repair itself. Anyway, it felt like the TE was rubbing on the edge of my sternum, so that when I moved, it caught on my cartiledge. But the people in the pharmacy were so freaked out by my pain they called an ambulance. They confirmed I wasn't having a heart attack, and I went home to throw up some more. Honestly, this has been a horrid week. Afterwards I wondered if it were a panic attack, but if I moved just the right way I could get that pain in my chest to stop. So I'm thinking it was TE-related. Regardless, it was one weirdness to be dealt with. So....I've done nothing but see the onc, throw up, and lay around the house for the last week and a half. Since I live alone, that means 11 days without human contact. Friends and my adult kids were calling, but I was just too nauseated to talk over the phone. Has anyone else had to deal with really severe nausea? Any suggestions for managing it? I was taking a phenergan every 4-6 hours and it just didn't touch the nausea. Here's hoping the patches come in and help, and that I can get some relief with MJ. Hoping all of you are doing better than I am, and I have to say your haircuts are adorable!!!",

I'm scheduled to go back to work on 1/7, and as a professor, I have a course starting about a week after that. I've been off work since last summer, and I'm scared to pieces about whether I'm really going to be able to do this. But then I'm on Day 6 and everything always seems to be bad then. Question: For those of you who have completed AC, when did you start to feel normal? Teaching statistics is surprisingly physical, and doing it with my usual enthusiasm is hard to picture. I can tell I've been lucky not to have many of the SE y'all have had. No nerve pain, surprisingly, though bone pain whupped me. A runny nose for months, to the point that I have cracks in my skin. I've lost 20 lbs since Sept. because of the nausea and had fatigue. But this is routine stuff for the most part, right? I'm also on TCHP, and my onc told me only about 25% of his patients can work through it, and only then if they have a lot of support from their boss. I'm worrying about where things go from here. I'll be continued on Herceptin and Perjeta after I finish AC on 12/19, and I don't know what the SEs are of just those 2 drugs, since they are combined with the chemo now. I'm on them until Sept. I, too, can tell that I'm now looking like a cancer patient...The weight loss is making my skin fold together, and it's pitifully dry. I just look about 10 years older now, and that makes me worry about going back to work and dealing with colleagues' reactions. But all things considered, I'm lucky. My adult kids will be home a bit for Christmas. I don't care when or if I get decorations up...I can enjoy a quiet Christmas focused on recovering and rebuilding and just enjoying their company. I love having these young adult offspring...watching them set up their adult lives and begin their careers is really exciting, without any of the Sturm and Drang of college and high school. It's nice to be looking forward to something again!  ",

You and I have several things in common, including being single and raising a boy (only one, in my case, but he has been a handful!). So even from a distance, I think about you and am wishing for the very best for you. My onc also used a tumor board to determine my treatment. I've always been impressed by the collective expertise of groups like this. And I'm glad that the cancer cells are currently dead as door-nails. Please keep us posted, as you can. I'm recovering from the last chemo infusion. My adult kids were home for a couple of days for Christmas and they were unbelievably kind. My son fixed various things while here and carried things up and down stairs like a trooper, while my girl fixed Christmas dinner and even my Santa stocking! Unfortunately, I was hit with chemo vomiting on Christmas Day, but my daughter gamely cleaned it up before I could, something I think is beyond the call of duty for an offspring! They watched movies with me and hung out around the house, spending time with me rather than running off with their friends. I felt incredibly loved and told them that. There's no way, I suppose, to make them really understand how much I appreciated that attention at this time, but I really hope they know how I feel. I'm awfully lucky to have such terrific offspring! I'm scheduled to go back to work in a little over a week and really nervous about it. Nobody from work has seen me since early last fall, and in the interim, I've lost 25 lbs and become hairless, so I don't exactly have my best look these days! I worry about how my colleagues and students will react to the physical changes in my appearance. No to mention the chemo brain. My doctor is telling the university that I won't know whether I have the stamina to teach until I try it, and we are building protections into my return-to-work plan, but still.....I'm pretty wiped out right now, and worried that I'll be too fatigued to manage. But I'm going to make the best effort I can! Hoping you all have a good New Year!",

I've had these symptoms before, but now they're more intense, particularly the back pain. It hurts enough for me to actually take the pain meds he gave me, which do make life more livable, but I don't like the way they make me feel. It makes me think about bone mets, which isn't a pleasant thought. Up until now, I really haven't had diarrhea, but now....I'm afraid to go anywhere, although I have to go teach, of course! I have an appointment with Onc on 1/30, so I'll ask him about these symptoms then. I'm hoping they go away on their own. Have any of you had SEs on these drugs???

It's finally long enough on the sides and back for me to see a little fluff of hair, but on top it's only about 3 mm, making me look like a little old man. And about half of it is stark white, although I only had 4 or 5 white hairs before cancer. The other half is dark, but I can't tell what color it is. And all of it seems to be really curly, much more so than before cancer. In spite of my hair obsession, I finally went topless at work. I was teaching and the classroom was so hot I couldn't stand my hat. So I took it off without realizing it. One of my male students whom I really like said \"I wondered when you would ditch the hats!\" and I just loved him for not treating the subject as taboo, you know? Later, I did the same thing in a faculty meeting. I'm just getting less concerned about what other people think about how I look, especially since, at this rate, it'll be a while before I really have hair again. I'm so glad to hear there are no drains with TE removal. About the surgeon, yeah, the plan is for the same one to do the exchange, but I am a bit concerned about the extent of the complications I've had. I'm thinking I will let her complete the exchange and then see how I heal up. If there are continuing problems with repeated seromas, I'll seek a second opinion then. My brothers are in NOLA, so it wouldn't be difficult to get seen at that hot-shot breast surgery place there. Or Vanderbilt is an option, I suppose...my daughter is in Nashville. I'd want to go somewhere out of town to get a truly independent opinion. JNKK, I share your worries about the future. I guess at my stage in life, I don't have any illusions that things will necessarily go well, and the 30% reoccurrence rate concerns me. I sometimes go down the rabbit hole of reading medical literature on the odds of another episode of cancer... and then I have to pull myself out of that kind of thinking. I lost both of my parents relatively young....my dad at 45, and my mom at 66. So I want to be here a very long time for my kids. Beeline, thanks for asking about HR. After putting me through all those arguments, they finally approved my leave. We just asked for another month of halftime work, because of all the gut problems I've been having.

This is very strange, since I didn't have more than 4-5 white hairs before I was diagnosed. It's really surprising how it comes back in a whole new color. This week I had to go to the plastic surgeon twice and had a bit of difficulty at the onc's office. By Monday my seroma was back (I think that was the 7th one). The plastic surgeon drained it and fussed at me for not coming in sooner. And then the very next morning, I woke up to that breast being swollen, red, hot, and painful. I kept thinking surely I was exaggerating, but by 1:00 I was ready to go to the surgeon's again. She said that the seroma was back and she drained it yet again. This time it really hurt, but she attributed that to her pressing on it the day before. But I've had these removed for months now, and they've never hurt before. She said she was sending a sample off for analysis and prescribed 2 bigtime antibiotics. When I got home I realized that I had a low fever, so I've been taking these antibiotics religiously. Then on Wednesday I had my next infusion of monoclonal antibodies. However, my anemia was the worst it's ever been, so they insisted I get iron infused first. And my potassium is high, which is bad for my heart...and I have another echo next week. So they're trying to figure out what's causing that. Funny how I got through the diagnosis, surgery, and chemo without a bunch unexpected happening, and now I'm really pretty scared. I don't like unexpected things to pop up!

I sense my regimen is a bit different from most of you. I'm getting Perjeta, Herceptin, Taxotera, and Carboplatin. I have 3 kinds of bc: inv. lobular (normal kind), inv. pleomorphic lobular, and inv. ductal. I'm on an AI because the ductal ca is ER+/PR+. But the pleomorphic lobular is HER2+, which (I think) is the reason they are giving me Perjeta and Herceptin. I have no idea why the Taxotera and the Carboplatin. And the plan (if I have it right) is 6 chemo treatments with these 4 magic drugs, and then the Herceptin continues for a full year. And then I switch to another drug for a 2nd year. Have any of you figured out these mysteries? Thanks, Leslie",

I never thought I'd see the day when I would wonder whether I should have MORE treatment-- ha! It's good to know it makes sense that I'm not having radiation since I didn't have lymph node involvement. These days I find myself worrying more about the future and cancer.....whether it could come back, how advanced it could be. It's totally not a helpful line of thinking, but I guess understandable. Not having had a bone scan or anything to rule out that I have mets, I find myself thinking about that more than I'd like to admit. I actually told the chemo nurse that on Wednesday when I went in for my infusion. To my horror, I teared up when I told her about recent mentors/friends dying from cancer. She said that it's very common in her experience that patients worry more as they begin to get close to the finish of treatment. I guess we feel safer in the midst of treatment than when we are \"on our own.\" But aside from those worries, everything seems to be going well. I got my drain out on Monday without any trouble. The surgeon did say that there may be a small seroma forming on the right side, the side that's been healthy so far. But she didn't want to remove it. So I go back in 5 weeks, and then in 6 months. In the meantime she said to call if I thought it was getting worse. And my anemia was a bit better on my bloodwork on Wednesday, so I'm hoping that this strategy of adding iron to my infusions will work. Congrats to Brink on finishing AC!!!! I feel like that is such a major step that we should be able to ring the bell for that alone!!! Piksie, I want you to address your experience as long as you feel comfortable doing so.

In addition, one of my daughter's friends is coming over tonight with that special drug that my doctor thought might help with the nausea. I feel kind of weird, given that I've always been a very law abiding person, but I would do almost anything to get this nausea under control. I have been taking the ativan the doc prescribed, but I don't think it helps the nausea....it just knocks me out, so that I don't feel it. Which is ok, I guess, given that I live alone and am on leave from work right now. But still, I'd rather be conscious and able to stay a bit on top of the laundry and be able to do some food prep. Anyway, here's hoping tomorrow is better with the new meds on board. Y'all seem to be doing better in the nausea department, although I'm surprised about how many of us are losing hair already. Mine is not budging, but I figure it'll fall out after the next treatment on Thursday next week. I have to say, though, everyone looks great with short hair! I've decided to keep my very short pixie after I finish treatment-- I like it that much. Hang in there, warrior women!",

I got my \"special meds\" via my daughter's friends a couple of nights ago. It makes me nervous, because one has NO idea what's really in this substance! They brought a vaping pen and a cartredge of the relevant goods. I haven't used it yet, because my nausea finally went away about 12 days after the chemo, thank God. So I'm saving that stuff, as well as the patches of transdermal phenergan the doctor gave me. I plan to start them both a day or two before I have chemo on Thursday next week. Here's some info on the MJ from my doctor. He said that it would probably control nausea best in the inhaled or \"vaped\" form, because it gets to the brain fastest. He also said there are many variations of MJ, but one with equal parts THC and CBD (I think that was it-- I don't know what this is) would probably work best. Of course, I don't have the ability to be that picky-- here, medical MJ is illegal, so I'm just trying to keep a low profile and use it only as a last resort. At any rate, I'm relieved to know this severe nausea is apparently cyclical, lasting only about 11 days after chemo. On the downside, I discovered today that my hair is falling out (like REALLY-- what did I expect?????!). Somehow, though, it is still surprising! So I called my hairdresser and we made arrangements to quietly shave my head tomorrow. Oh, my! So here's the question: What about wigs? Have you ordered one? From where? What about head coverings? Do you have an outlet for these things that you like? I frankly look like a little old lady in hats, so I need to do the cap thing or a wig. And I have a wedding to go to in October of a boy who is like a son to me! Oh, my! what to wear?! Best wishes to all of you amazing women! ",

It sounds like you are having rough chemo, and I can certainly appreciate that, given that my own experience has been pretty bad. Same kinds of symptoms as you....profound fatigue, severe nausea/vomiting, and just feeling generally ill. I have months of leave time, so I've taken off, and I'm just resting, figuring that the less I go out in the world of germs the better. But I'm single and my kids are grown.

I was working up till the mastectomy, and the other people at work were just so uncomfortable. I started to kind of feel sorry for THEM! Yesterday I went to the grocery store for the first time since chemo started. I thought I'd be fine, but I was exhausted by 45 minutes in the store. Anyway, a lady I've never seen before walked up to me and asked if she could pray for me right there. I was so surprised I said yes. Normally I don't mind -- in fact, I love it if a friend offers to pray for me. But it made me strangely uncomfortable for someone I don't know to pray for me in the middle of the store. Have y'all ever had this happen? The situation made me think about how people perceive cancer patients in general. Many people have told me how brave I am and how strong I must be. That also feels awkward, because all I'm doing is going through a treatment most people would choose under the circumstances. To elevate that experience to the point that it means I'm uniquely strong or brave makes me feel too responsible for my recovery. It comes close to the idea that our strength determines our outcome. But if treatment works and cancer never reoccurs, who knows why we are that fortunate? If I accept that my bravery might make me cancer-free, then does that imply that those who die of cancer were less brave? There are so many variables that determine one's outcome, and I doubt that personal characteristics have much impact. Maybe this is apparent to y'all, but I've been trying to figure out why this compliment about strength feels so uncomfortable to me. Maybe people don't mean that when they say I'm so strong. Maybe they mean that the fact that I'm going through treatment seems to them to be a sign of strength. But I would think that most people when diagnosed with cancer go through most of the prescribed treatment. Or maybe people just want to say something positive. But overwhelmingly people seem to talk about strength and bravery and that seems surprising. I'm sorry for droning on about it. I've been thinking about this for a while and trying to sort out what it means and what's a graceful way to handle these attributions of strength that I don't think I exactly deserve. ",

But of course, they also minimize the risk of an allergic reaction to the drugs we have to take. For that reason, I keep the prescription with me at all times in case one sets in. For what it's worth, I woke up with this terrible nausea the very first morning after chemo. I hope this means that if you don't have it at this point, perhaps you won't. And the nurse prac told me I was on a tremendously large dose of chemo that first time. The second time when they lowered it by 25%, he said it was still a big dose and I haven't been as nauseated. Plus the medicine I was getting was great. Unfortunately I ran out of it yesterday. The pharmacy can't refill it because the insurance won't let it go through, and she told me one patch costs $1500. I guess I'll have to call the doctor's office tomorrow, because I can't afford to buy that out of pocket..",

You are a great group of people, and it always makes me feel better to come here and read your posts. I've been really down and out after this 3rd chemo...just feeling like I have a really bad flu...unable to move from the couch much, and basic self-care seems really hard this time. And continuously soooo nauseated! I had to go see my plastic surgeon yesterday, and something about it just got to me...I started crying and couldn't stop. I HATE crying, but there wasn't exactly anything I could do about it. I'm so DONE with these TE that do not look remotely like real bosoms. One is much larger than the other, and they hang in weird positions that real ones would never have. The scar on the left one hasn't healed...it is knit enough that my tissue is covered, but the scab comes off periodically and then reforms...over and over and over. She says it's because of the chemo, and she's leaving it alone until I finish chemo in January. At least she is having me come in to check it, which is responsible, I guess. I suspect this is all getting to be a bit much...missing the wedding I wanted to go to, the frankenboobs, constant nausea. Most days I can manage, but this week I've just lost control of crying. Sigh. I'm worried about having to take Herceptin and Perjeta for a year. I had thought it would just be the Hereceptin. I looked up the SE of Perjeta, which were so discouraging: hair loss and nausea. I don't think I can take another six months of this. And I've been consulting a bit with my students, and I notice how severely chemo-brain has affected my ability to work. Like some others have said, I've lost whole conversations with no recall at all. I don't see how I can teach effectively next spring if this persists. Of course, it may not persist. It may be fine. I just need to get through this week, so I don't think anymore about the fun I'm missing, and be grateful that I have such support from people around me. I was really afraid when I was diagnosed b/c I am divorced and all my friends work and have other responsibilities. But my cleaning company, bless them, have stepped up to bring soup, and the church has been there for me, and my blessed adult kids call just when I start feeling blue.

Wanderweg, did you get Herceptin and Perjeta with the Taxotera (different from Taxol, I think) and Carboplatin? I've been on all 4 agents, given in one infusion. So I'll be continuing the Herceptin and Perjeta until Sept. next year. Bah. I'm wondering about my hair. It's about 3 or 4 mm, not much, but when we cut it off, it was with a 2 mm device. So I'm wondering if it's growing. It would make no sense, because I'm still getting chemo. The individual hairs are fragile, like tiny pieces of feathers. BrinkofEternity I know what you mean about people acting like we're dying. Frankly, I look to myself like I'm dying. I've always looked younger than I was, but between the weight loss and the chemo, my skin is suddenly so much more wrinkled, saggy, and dry. I'm putting stuff on it, but it's not helping. I've been off work, so I don't get the reaction there....it's my own brother who seems to treat me like this is the most dreadful thing ever. My friends have actually wondered if he is getting some kind of secondary support from his friends for his online comments about my cancer, and all the postings about breast cancer. He offered to come stay with me after my mastectomy, since I'm single and my kids are barely on their own, but he left after just a few days, pretty much leaving me juiced up on painkillers and really unable to take care of myself. Fortunately, my other brother then stepped in. I don't think I will ever understand what that has been all about, you know? I'm trying to get ready to deal with that again when I go back to work next month. Hang in there, everyone!",

My x then dragged out the divorce process while I was in treatment, eventually forcing me into bankruptcy from the combination of medical and legal bills. A really bad situation. I have managed to interact with the x appropriately over all the years since then, for graduations and other milestones in my now-adult kids' lives, but now I have cancer again. And the idea of being at this wedding, which is in another city where I won't know anyone, is really stressing me out. At the same time, not going, when I really love the couple getting married, is also stressful. In an ideal world, I'd get a date and go anyway, but it's too close to the wedding to get a date now, and I certainly don't feel like dating while going through chemo. The thought of being around x and his new wife while i'm without my breasts and my hair is, well, really painful. I guess if you're going to see an x, it's always best to feel really good about how you look, and I don't at the moment, you know? Can you think of any way to make this workable? I could go only to the wedding and skip the reception, which might be ok, given that I'll be tired anyway. I wish my kids would hang out with me, but despite their best intentions, I think that's unlikely, given that there will be fun to be had. I don't think the wedding is terribly large, so I don't think I could avoid x and wife completely. Any ideas? Thanks!",

And somehow I didn't expect it, so experiencing it is very confusing. Oh, well...I ask myself if it's just me 100 times a day, and y'all help me realize no, it's the chemo. Just ride it out. I have 3 more infusions, but if my mood doesn't improve, this is gonna be really hard. It turns out I've been really anemic, too, so they gave me an infusion of iron last week, and I get another one on Wednesday. It'll take a while for me to feel better, they said. Meanwhile, I'm breathless walking from one room to another. I'm so glad I'm not working now and honestly, that I'm divorced with grown kids. My ex left me the last time I had cancer, so this experience is calling up bad memories (he literally said he didn't sign on for this, which is funny, in light of our vows!). But at least this time I can decide who I choose to be around. Not surprisingly, I guess, I'm choosing not to be around anyone for about 2 weeks after each infusion...I'm so tired and nauseated that I just can't do it. So I have 1 good week every 3 weeks when I can at least have visitors. Meanwhile I read a lot and try to work at home as I can. I'm praying for you all....I think most of you are younger than I am and it makes me mad that this disease should disrupt your childrearing years. Hang in there! ",

My left scar line hasn't healed completely, so I've had to go in and let her see it about every 3 weeks throughout chemo. While she was looking at it a month ago, she filled the left one a bit to get closer to the right one, thinking the scar looked a little better and could handle it. This time I went in and had my 3rd seroma. My 3rd! The first one happened within weeks of my surgery, when a stitch popped and a seroma burst out, all over me, my poor kitties (who were in my bed), the sheets....everything! It would have been funny if I hadn't been so scared! The 2nd seroma was found at the surgeon's visit a month ago, when she last saw me and filled the left again. She had to remove a seroma first. Last week I had been monitoring that side, and when it seemed a little odd, I went back early, because I recognized it was a seroma. I've read about what a seroma is, but I can't find anything in the medical literature on repeated seromas. I'm a little concerned, because I have a relatively young plastic surgeon with only 3 years experience post-residency. She's been easy to work with, but the complications seems to be mounting. I have this scar repeatedly opening on the left, along with seromas on that side, and some really impressive buising and bleeding post-mastectomy. Do y'all know anything about repeated seromas? Just part of life, or should I be concerned?",

I'm so envious of the hair growth...I only have little hairs at most about .75 inch long. I think they're either white or blond...at any rate, they aren't dark enough to cover up a thing. I'm thinking of just ditching the head covers when I go back to work, except when I'm outside because of the cold. It's a little because I think our society pushes us all to cover up (literally) unpleasant things, to only show the easy, successful side of life. And I've known an awful lot of folks in my life who had obvious disabilities. If they can't cover theirs up, why should I? There's some solidarity in deciding just to ditch the hat and be who I am. But I'm not sure I'm really that brave. It always bothers me at first for people to see me without a hat....Until after they have seen me. Then I never put on a hat for their presence again. Here's hoping things go ok at work. I've had a hell of a time just getting through HRs paperwork. They have been incredibly confusing about what forms they want me to fill out, and even when I do submit them, they're mad because I haven't been quick enough. I have explained that I'm not quick at anything because of the side effects of chemo, but they change the subject or start to threaten me with all the bad things that could happen to me if I didn't turn the forms in. Sigh. Yesterday I couldn't remember the name of my much beloved uncle. That's typical for the kind of word loss I'm having...it's really kind of scary. I'm praying my words keep coming to me while I'm working! Hang in there! Fairchild",

Not remembering a week or so was pretty frightening, so if I ever have surgery again I think I'll make sure someone is with me in case I'm that out of it afterwards. But for now, my sore throat/cough is gone and the incisions seem to be healing fine. I have virtually no drainage so I'm thinking she'll take the drains out on Monday when I see her (the surgeon). Afterwards, I have infusions of Perjeta/Herceptin until September, and then change to some other type of drug. and I will be on Femera for some unknown amount of time, but it doesn't bother me. So it feels like I'm coasting slowly toward completion of treatment, in some weird way. It's unreal....like this whole process seems a bit unreal. To have an illness this scary that I can't feel, with symptoms only from the treatment mechanisms...it seems very strange and not very real. I'm sorry-- I'm not exactly articulate today, but I hope you know what I mean. I have questions. Many of y'all are in radiation. I know very little about it. Can you educate me a bit? My surgeon said that because I had chosen to have both breasts removed, radiation was not an option for me. She said they use it to shrink or treat cancers in breast tissue that will remain -- like after lumpectomies. Did I understand that correctly? Are there other circumstances in which radiation would be required? Also-- Are any of you getting further testing done to determine whether you could have mets elsewhere? My insurance denied an early request from my former oncologist for a PET scan. My current oncologist says that's not surprising....they really don't want to pay for testing without symptoms to drive the testing decisions. I did have an MRI of my back just before my BXM because I had severe back pain, but it turned out to be damage from my years of horseback riding. No tumor, thank God. Otherwise, I haven't had testing done. My onc implied we would consider asking for some tests to rule out the possibility of spread, but more recently he's seemed less interested in that. When I asked about it, he ran a couple of tumor marker tests, which are in normal limits, but I really don't know how much those me. He did say if it spread, it would probably go to bones/brain/lungs/liver. This is rather frightening for 2 reasons-- one is that I had primary bone cancer in my 20s, treated successfully back then. The other is that I've lost 4 friends in the last few months to metastactic cancer. So I'm thinking about the possibility more than I should. That's why I'm asking-- have your doctors done any testing to reassure you that nothing is lurking about, waiting to be discovered? Can I rest assured that the blood tests they run every few weeks would pick up liver problems? That basic lung xrays would find a lung met? Surprising how much more I'm worrying now, as I approach the end of treatment. I think those are my main questions for now-- why radiation and when testing for mets is done. I'm trying to read up on these things, too, but right now, trying to pull myself together after surgery, it's difficult for me to process any more reading material about cancer. I suspect I just don't have the concentration at the moment. Ah, well. I'll be better off, I think, when I get back to the office and start doing science again. I have a nice set of data on the use of cigarettes by teens with asthma, which will make a lovely article, so writing it up will certainly hold my attention for a while. I hope you are all doing well! Best, Leslie",

I'm about to have my last chemo infusion on 12/19, and I'm anxious about hair growth. I lost most of mine and then shaved it to 2 mm when it started coming out in handfuls. Since then it has thinned out, so that the tiny hair has been splotchy at best. I'm going to be on Herceptin and Perjeta for the next 9 months, too, and I'm concerned that it'll inhibit hair growth. Over the last couple of weeks the little stubs of hair seem longer, by about 2 more mm and they're curling. Is that even possible while I'm still in chemo? Do you have any idea how long it will take for hair to grow back? I'm really tired of having people look at me like I'm dying! I've been wearing head covers all this time and would love to go bald, but people openly stare when I do that. I should add this: I had pretty curly hair before cancer, and you have to learn to manage it. Eventually I learned to cut the width, so it was taller than it was wide. I also learned to use hair products, lots of them! Very gentle shampoo, lots of conditioner, and stuff to make the curls piece-y. I got a lot better at managing it as I got older. Thank God for hair product! ",

There is a line of products call \"Devacurl\" that's really good...they have everything from shampoo to product to enhance and hold your curl in pieces, so that it doesn't get fluffy and enormous. I know Amazon carries it. Their \"ultra defining curl gel\" is great for keeping the texture of curls from getting out of control. If I'm not careful, my hair becomes a mass of frizzy volume...so NOT my best look! These products help me use the texture to my advantage instead. Plus, I can blot my hair after a shower with a towel, put gel on it while raking my fingers through, and then go to work and let it dry on the way. I never would have thought I could do that, but the gel makes it dry in little natural curls that fall just right. The worst thing to do with curly hair is to mess with it! If I brush it, or finger it during the day, it gets frizzier and frizzier, until it just looks like a mop. I eventually learned that if it got frizzy, I just needed to wet it, put a little more gel on it, and leave it alone! Again, it dries in better shape if I don't touch it. About oil...I don't actually use oil on mine, as I generally have oily skin/hair. But I use a really good conditioner (Devacurl has some!) that moisturizes the hair without weighing it down. You have to make sure whatever products you use don't weigh the hair down so that it strips the curl out, you know? And most gels made for curly hair have lots of moisture built into them. That's why it's best if the products are specifically made for curly hair. Devacurl also has a short book out on dealing with curly hair. It was really helpful to me, because my mother had perfectly straight hair. She had no idea what to do with my curls, so she had me grow it long and tried to brush it....all the things you don't want to do with curls! I eventually figured out from companies like Devacurl what to do with it. BTW, it's usually better to have curly hair cut in layers, so that the curls can spring up more evenly. I've learned that some hairdressers have more experience working with curls, so I ask who is best with curls when I have to change hairdressers. Curly hair is often cut dry, b/c you can see the way it falls better. I hope this is helpful! About a year before my cancer, I got Devacurl's book and figured out what to do with my hair. No longer having to blow dry / straighten / brush / struggle with my hair was life-changing! I hope you grow to like yours, even if the curl turns out to only be temporary! ",

I don't know what's happening, except that my children (young adults) are both going through very stressful situations right now, I'm up for promotion at work and preparing the necessary paperwork, trying to finish before the mastectomies (I started the promotion path before I knew about the cancer), and the situation with my brothers has thrown me. It feels really bad to be unmarried and going through this without a partner. There's nothing I or anyone can do about that, but it's there, in my head. We can't do anything about that. But the things I worry about...can you tell me if maybe they aren't true? Like is it really do-able to go home the day after surgery? How much pain (uncomfortable pain or frankly yelling pain?). When will I feel like taking a bath? When will I feel like cooking? Any information, no matter how small, will be helpful. Right now my imagination is working overtime, and I don't want that!",

      "Content": "Jul 20, 2018 08:51PM Fairchild wrote: Hey, ladies, I need some advice. I'm having bilateral mastectomies on July 26th. ILC on left side and IDC on the right, both small, L 4mm, R 1.6 CM. They found cancer in an intramammary lymph node so mastectomy mandated on the R and I choose it on the L. Planning on TE after the surgery for reconstruction. Will be in hospital 1 night, God willing. My brothers offered to come be with me for a couple of weeks, which has been most welcome, since I'm divorced, 61, and my kids live away from here. But yesterday brothers started sounding like they aren't planning to stay as long as they said. The one who will be with me for surgery is planning on sleeping at my house that night and going some place during the day after surgery, which might interfere with my discharge from hospital. Also, he's only staying a few days, and then brother #2 will arrive for a few days. I'm not sure anymore how long they will be here. They are vague no matter how much I ask them. So I need to know how much can I manage this on my own, if they aren't here very long or very much? My doctor had said to have someone with me for 2 weeks. Is that really needed? When will I be able to cook, lift laundry, work on the computer, make phone calls again? Having my brothers get vague now is pretty upsetting, when I really believed they would step up for me, but they sound scared now, asking if I can arrange a nurse to stay with me. I don't have that kind of money! Any other advice for getting through this? How bad is the pain? So many thanks!",
