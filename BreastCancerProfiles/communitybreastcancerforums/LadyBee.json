      "Content": "LadyBee wrote: Back story: I had an ultrasound for a lump in my breast back in October. The radiologist said it was \"likely a galactocele\" (this diagnosis- if you could even call it that with out pathology- was wrong to me) but they went on to attempt a biopsy the following week. The FNA was unsuccessful and a CNB was never done, though I was told it would be. I was told to come back in 3 months. I got in to my \"referring doctor\" so i could get a second opinion and he put in a referral for me. I found a specialist. This isn't a fun process with the insurance I have through the military, by the way. Update: I saw my new doctor on the 11th who, after my appointment, immediately ordered me an ultrasound at the breast imaging clinic. They did the scan and quickly came back stating I needed a biopsy as soon as possible. The lump had changed/grown/morphed. I asked if they thought it was a galactocele per the original suggestion. She said it was without a doubt NOT a galactocele, or at least not like any she has ever seen, nor is it functioning like one from comparing the ultrasounds. It's going to take 2 weeks for the insurance company to clear me for the core needle biopsy but I'm having it done on the 31st of this month. Just thought I should come back and post an update. I had my biopsy today and the radiologist is fairly certain it's a phyllodes tumor. Since my initial appointment in October, the lump has doubled in size, though still small. It had even changed since my last imaging appointment on the 11th of this month...thus the likelihood of the possible phyllodes diagnosis. We wont know for certain until the path report comes back. I was told this would happen by the 5th of February at the latest. I'm extremely fortunate to have found the breast specialist that I did as well as the fantastic imaging team. With the number of samples taken, I hope they're able to positively identify the sucker so I can plan my next course of action. It's a fibroadenoma! Whew! Log in to post a reply",

It does drive me crazy that a procedure like that needs to be approved now, though (I'm unaware of how things worked before). I think this is a new thing- tricare switched hands. You would think since the doctor was approved, any thing he or his colleagues order, should be approved, too. 2 weeks isn't too long but it's a wait, nonetheless.",

I'm only a spouse, so had I been active duty and regularly seen at flt med, I'm sure it would have been easier. I had to jump through hoops to even find out who my PCM was. Then he referred me out to general surgery. I wasn't too confident with that decision so I had to get in contact with United, with a name of a specialist, and his info in hand and have my referral revised. It did eventually get approved...just in time for what would have been my follow up appointment, anyway. I'm extremely happy with my decision of finding a specialist and making sure I did everything possible to make that an option...without switching to standard. Easier said than done, but just get another appointment with your doc and tell him you'd like a second opinion. I'm really glad I did.",
