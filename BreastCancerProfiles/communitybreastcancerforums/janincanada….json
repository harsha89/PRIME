Go back to work and all will be fine.  Both of them had breast cancer about 5 years ago, but it was a totally different animal.  They were stage I and had lumpectomies with rad.  Totally different from the stage 3 class 3 her2nu + beast that I  was blessed with.  Somehow they think that if I went back to work teaching kids with Learning Disabilities and Behaviour designations I would be fine.  I CAN'T MULTITASK. I'm not ready to be responsible for a gerbil let alone my students.  I'm getting there but it is a slow process.  I think the biggest issue with them is that I don't look sick and I exercise.  Thank heavens for my DH. He turns off the stove when I forget, locks the door, turns off my computer when I walk away etc. and doesn't make a big deal about it. Hugs to all. Rant away when you need to.  It's much better than holding it inside.",

I'm glad you are checking it out.  I know I was very pleased with it.",

You can swim in it too.  I loved it until I had recon.  I even wore it some days instead of my regular prostheses. The women who develped it is a breast cancer survivor and a Dragonboat member. I don't know their website but the company name is Janac Sportswear.",

I love the Amoena Leah? it has lost of lace trim, soft cups, lacy convertible straps and comes with clear ones as well.",

For the last 20 months I have been struggling with digestive issues tests up the ying /yang and the general consensus is that it is out of control irritable bowel syndrome. Never thought of cancer.....just trusted my doctor and specialists. Now I have a pain in my left thigh that is persistant and not related to injury or overexercising. Unexplained actually. I find that I am reaching for my pain meds for the bowel issues to relieve the leg pain. Looking for advice and some sense of how bone mets present. I have lost almost forty pounds over the last 18 months and am often headachy and nauseous. All of this the drs. Say is the IBS. However....IBS does not make your leg hurt. I have been off of work for the last 18 months due to the digestive issues and now am scared of the unknown. Advice please.",
