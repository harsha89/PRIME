DAY 19 What a great way of thinking about the chemo in terms of \"good guy\" and \"bad guy.\" I have been feeling so great the past several days--it is 60 degrees here, and I'm getting ready to go to the grocery store and then go for a long walk. I have been dreading my upcoming treatment on Thursday, so I am going to try to visualize the battle instead. Happy Valentine's Day everyone!",

I have had a challenging time recovering from the first three sessions--it takes a good 7 days or so before I feel \"normal\" and reading everyone's posts is what helps me through it.  My ten year old daughter and I danced along with Amy's happy dance last night  Today I had a massage, and I walked at a brisk pace for 90 minutes with a friend. It's the first time in a long time that I don't notice the TEs!  We are going to make it! Susan ",

It seems like I know all of you because I have been reading your posts the past week, and they have helped me stay positive. I'd like to join your group. I had a lumpectomy 6 weeks ago, and then a BMX 4 weeks ago, and I had my first round of TAC on Jan. 6. 1 of 6 completed--every three weeks. I had the Neulasta shot the day after my treatment. I had a challenging time managing the SE for the first week and am just now feeling like myself again.  I also have several volunteer \"jobs\" that are the busiest during the next three months. I have decided that I will step down and simply be available for consultation and to help out if I feel up to it. This was a difficult decision to make because I get lots of my self-esteem from my work, but I agree with MaryMeg that diet, nutrition, exercise, and REST during the next several months are my priority. Thank you for letting me be a part of this group! It has helped me tremendously this past week. Hope everyone has a good day. If you are having a treatment today, my thoughts are with you. ",

Doing better than last time but still feeling fatigued. I was starting to feel a bit sorry for myself, and I read your post. We are blessed and this will pass. ",

Today I went with a bunch of girlfriends to have pedicures and lunch, and I actually forgot I was in the middle of chemo for three hours--it was wonderful! However, I ordered a salmon salad that in the past would have been fine, but I guess these days with such a sensitive stomach, it wasn't the best choice. I'll have to be more careful in the future.  I love seeing the pictures of those of you who have shaved your heads. You are all so beautiful, and It makes me less anxious about shaving mine in a few days. Moe279 thank you so much for sharing your experience with the first day in public without hair. I am nervous, but your experience makes me one notch braver.  Lastly several of you have motivated me to get on the treadmill tomorrow even for a moderate walk. I know it will make me feel better. I try to catch up on everyone's posts a couple of times a day, and you all are helping me through this--the end of April doesn't seem quite as far away. susanlynn ",
