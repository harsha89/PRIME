Whatever you decide to do its your decision. I was braids 4 and my biopsy came back postive, most arent. Please stay off of google will only scare yourself. The question you have to ask yourself is can you live with the decision of waiting 3 months if it comes back positive? Most breast cancer dosent grow to rapid so if its there would probably be the same results if you wait. No one wants a biopsy if we don't have to but don't let fear of pain be a factor. Mine didn't hurt at all. From what you said you will probably have one anyway so why wait? Get it over with so you can continue on with your life instead of constant worrying. Good results will lift your spirit and if its BC than you will face and beat it like the rest of us. Loosing a parent to cancer hurts no matter how old you are. I'm sure you don't want your family to lose you like you lost your dad. My profession advice is to have the biopsy. No one can tell if its cancer or not by looking and feeling. It's only diagnosed after biopsy so even though the doctor said it looked like cancer dosent mean it is. The doctor that took my tissue didn't think I had BC but I did. Remember it's your body and decision, not an easy one to make. I'm sure you will make the best choice for you. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a negative result if you have it done. Michelle",

It seems seeing a surgeon first is the way most treatment starts after a cancer diagnosis. Since it appears your mom is having a hard time dealing with this and not doing research herself I recommend you ask to see a oncologist first. They will be the ones who determines your moms treatment and are experts in cancer. They will explain the rate your mom cancer grows type ect. They will recommend what type of surgery your mom should have and why plus refer her to a breast surgeon could be the same one she has now or a different one. Have your mom call her primary doctor to send her to a oncologist first. Good luck to you :)",

My fat was removed from my lower back and under arms, no scars. At my post op I learned that I will need 5 more surgeries, not all done at once like I thought. I think he told me that long time ago. It's like the BRAVA procedure women are having without the cones, think that's what they're called. It making my breast larger more round and after more of a real feel. I don't have implants did tram flap, love it! Last radiation was 4/2/13. Will have surgery every 6-8 weeks until they are the way I want. Next surgery 10/18/13. Was the easiest surgery I ever had. Was walking my dogs a mile the same day. No pain just a little sore. I'm not a fan of the number of surgeries, can get implant at anytime but don't want one. I had nipple/skin sparing double MX last October 28, 2012. Didn't have the tightness like your mom. Hope this helps",

Oh I remember how I felt after my first surgery. Went in thinking I was stage zero or one coming out stage 3a with 6/10 nodes positive! My heart broke at the thought of my kids growing up without me. Sad depressed scared looked out the window wondering how many more sun rises or sunsets I would see. So much love and support from family and friends but as you know unless you have experienced it can't understand. So today I can honestly say it gets better with time. I know it doesn't seem like it but once you are done with treatment you think less about dying and just live normally again. No you will never be the person you were before BC you will be stronger having lived through treatment. The fear is always there but one day you will wake up and BC won't be on your mind. This is what I learned. The way we look at things can affect our moods and thought of out come. Yes the more node the worse the prognosis but as many have said just statics. Think of it this way, lymph nodes are there as protectors, to catch the cancer before it goes to an organ so they did their job. Some people have 40 lymph nodes so only having 3, 10, 20 ect still give you many nodes that are cancer free. Chemo, surgery, radiation hormonal therapy all increase the chances that our bodies are cancer free. No one can guarantee that we won't get it again nor can they say we will as with all diseases. You will be on meds for depression, sleep, anxiety ect for a long time if needed and that's ok. I wasn't on any meds except for high cholesterol before than I was on what seem to be 20 or more for all kinds of issues now just on tamoxifen and Effexor for hot flashes. As for as not being cured my MO told me this \"We cure stage 3 all the time\" as far as he's concerned I'm cured until something tells him it's back. He only uses NED for stage 4 patients. No scans unless symptoms just routine bloodwork. It like glass half empty half full. Living life being cured is easier than walking around NED. So it's your outlook on life. I know at this moment that's very dark and scary but there is light at the end of the tunnel and life after treatment. Just be patient with yourself. Uncertainty, the unknown about treatments working or if they got it all, sadness, dispear ect is normal. Some people take months others years but eventually it will be ok. I never thought the day of treatment would end but it did and so will yours! Sorry for the short novel but stage 3 is scary and I want to offer hope to those who are where I wasðŸ˜Š",

You are entitled to feel whatever you feel no need to apologize. You have lots of valid questions that need to be answered by your surgeon not us. It appears that the language they used were medical and unless you work in the field it's confusing. You have to understand the procedure before you sign the consent. The surgeon is the one who should explain not the nurse. Second get a copy of your report. That way you can look up the terms and the reason for there concern. Plus you will see how much tissue was removed and what was said about each one. Third they will do everything for you. No need for you to worry about that. You should get preop instructions in advance and the Anesthesiologist should call you the night before. Once you do these things you should be more comfortable with your decision. Good luck!

The goal is to not feel pain or let it get out of control. I know everyone is afraid of addiction but that only happens when you take it when you don't need it. My pain is about 3-4 but I take one Percocet every 4-6 hours. Itching is another story. It's a sign of healing but so irritating I take beneadryl for that every 4-6 hours depend on how much I'm itching. I see both my BS and PS on Friday.

My post BMX the cancer free breast was clear but they found a very small DCIS in the breast that had 3 tumors. Wouldn't have showed up on any scans but radiation would probably killed it. It's amazing how such a tiny cell was able to survive 5 months of chemo. My right breast was a mess. One IDC with dcis growing inside of it, another one found during surgery that didn't show on any scans now another dcis that wouldn't have shown up without the actual breast tissue under a microscope.

Emend should be taken for 3 days the morning before and 2 mornings after is that what you are doing? Not sure of what other medical issues you have but the correct dose for zofran should be 8mg not 4mg. It was proven in a study that 4mg doesn't help nausea related to chemo. Promethazine is better than zofran and sometimes helps with sleep. Ask why they didn't give you 8 mg of zofran to take. I know you aren't really sleeping because of the steroids you are taking every 8 hours. Get a Rx for something it won't give you 8 hours of sleep but you will get a few hours. No one wants to eat or drink when nauseated no matter how much you are encouraged. They need to change your nausea meds. You can take 2 of the 4mg zofran and you will feel better until you ask why. As an RN I get upset with things like this. I'm not sure the reason they aren't giving you the 3 pills of Emand nor the correct doses to prevent this. Your body needs nutrients and this is ridiculous!",

Sat down explained everything and SE I will experience to the ones I might and of course the ones that could be permanent. It will be 6 in a half long weeks Monday - Friday. Have to go Monday afternoon to get the area marked and tattoos that are permanent, not sure I like that. They stay there in case radiation is needed they will know where I had it before.

I kept my cool and rescheduled for Thursday at 11:30am. I will have to ask my MO for another RO if that's true. How can they not do afternoon treatments when people work and have to go almost 7 weeks like I'm suppose to do. Plus my youngest daughter was on her way to class were she had 2 midterms and as she was leaving the short school bus hit her sent her car through the divder where there are plants grass tress and poles, she landed in the lanes going the opposite direction facing on coming traffic! Thank goodness it wasnt any cars coming and the bus was empty plus she didnt hit a tree. If the special needs kids were on there would have been worse emotionally. Just glad no one was hurt. Of course the car isn't drivable and we have to wait to get it fixed. My oldest is driving my car because she totaled her car a few months ago. The best part is her dad brought her a car and was bring it tomorrow after her changed the registration. But I'm happy everything is moving ahead with treatment and we still will have 2 cars.

She was a RN had a hard time breathing but didn't want to as she always said \"stay home waiting to die\" I saw her a few weeks ago after I was off over a year for my treatment and wanted to cry. I just listened to her talk about her concerns and saw the sadness of her face. Everyone would say she is doing so well and talks about it all the time but unless you have had BC you never see the sadness behind the happy face. I really don't know her exact story because she was diagnosed with stage 4 about a week before I was diagnosed with stage 3. I kept my diagnoses a secret until I went off work. How could I complain or cry when she had just been told she will be lucky to make it 18 months. She did her best to enjoy the time she had and made it to see her only child graduate high school, her greatest worry. She celebrated her birthday last year for a month with parties dinners vacations because she said that would probably be her last one and it was. Only thing I know is she was diagnosed 5 years ago but not sure of stage had mastectomy chemo rads and AL. Last time I talked to her she said she was her2 positive and wish she had both breast removed I remember her having scans every 3 months the last few years always NED. So when she had the one that showed mets lungs,spine, liver and being told would be lucky to live 18 months it was shocking. Anyway thanks for letting me vent my sadness :( Paula Congratulations on finishing and good luck with your scans.",

I knew nothing about pathological complete response but once I did glad I made that choice. Chemo is hard because it changes your appearance and life but its temporary changes. When I got my port and first treatment 3 days later it was so hard emotionally. Losing the hair was one of the hardest parts because that's when you start to look like a cancer patient. Now I rarly wear a wig or hat, never thought that would happen. It will be March 2013 before you know it. Remember this chemo first allows them see the actual breast tissue and examine it under a microscope not through a scan so they will know if all the cancer is dead. A change in treatment does suck but as long as its changed to the right treatment it's ok right? :)",

They told me the same thing when I had my reduction but it did come back in about 6-9 months. Plus women on the boards are saying there sensation is returning too. I will take my chances. I will have to have fat grafting and liposuction to fill the extra space in the pocket later. I forgot to ask if it will be before or after radiation. He said my radiation should be easier since no implant. More importantly he said if I'm not happy with my breast I can always get implants later without needing TE and all covered by insurance. So BC causes me to lose my D cup breast replace with A- B cup, gives me a flatter tummy, liposuction and fat removal from places where I have too much. Always have to look at the bright side. That's a very small price to pay for a longer life. Now just waiting for MRI results to add to the bright side. Hope everyone is doing good.",

Unfortunately what's the first thing people do when they find out? Call or when they see you want to talk and question you about it. They think they are helping not realizing they are upsetting us. I just learned to smile and always be in a rush when in public. I finally made a Facebook page so it's easier to update it when I want to share my treatment. I never express my feelings just treatment because only people on here can understand how I feel. BetNY22- Glad you stopped lurking and posted. Don't think anyone wasn't scared of the pathology report but think of it this way. Once you get it you will start the right treatment to let you live your life cancer free. No matter what treatment you face you will be ok. We are here for you :) I'm so happy everyone is doing wonderful with healing and dealing with your new body image. It truly helps us who have surgeries this week. Goodluck to everyone who surgery is Monday. We are all sending good thoughts your way :)",

They don't work for 2-3 days later that's why you take them everyday. It works by pulling fluid into to colon making it soft enough for you to go. The more you walk and drink the sooner it works.we use them a lot in cardiac because we don't want the patients strain. Do you have formed Diarrah or loose stool? Connie- Yes I almost got a timeout.

My daughter told me how can you next cry? You are loosing a part of you. It normal to mourn them. She was right. We all have new bodies we have to get use to just takes lots if time. I don't think any of us thought about loosing whole or part of our breast before this but we made the choice to live, that was the easy part. The steps to fight is the hard part but when has a fight ever been easy? When our wounds are healed and the fight is won we will think it was worth every tear we cried. We are cancer free! CindyLooWho- Congradulations on not needing to see MO again. I'm sure that was a big relief. Yes I went to the mall and shopped for 2 hours. It was my first outing since surgery. I brought me a really cute mini skirt and blouse ( without trying them on) can you imagine that site if i did? i have 4 drains and abdominal binder wouldn't know where to start. I took a Percocet before and walked slower than normal. I get so upset that doctors don't really give us a chance to sit and think about what we want to do. It's rush rush rush. I went back and forth with what surgery I wanted and could live with. Not that implants are bad and sometimes the only choice but its so emotional. Not one doctor told me all my options I learned about them on my own. I was with another group when diagnosed. The BS was good but both PS just flat out said that flaps were too much work. I remember thinking for who you or me? Having to visit every 2 weeks to get fills for 6 months, waiting for tattoos and whatever else seems harder on me. That's when I changed my medical group. Lots of people don't know you can do that. I still part of the same network but diffentent better group. I had my first appt on a Wednesday and present me to the tumor board in Friday. They listened to me about what I wanted for reconstruction and why. I hate when people say don't make your decision out if fear, are you kidding me? How can I not. I'm thankful I had 5 months to make a final decision. We all picked what was right for us and everyone will have an emotion response to seeing our breast area afterwards. I'm disfigured with deflated breast inside a pocket not a pretty site at all. I didn't cry because I got what I asked for that's the most important thing to remember. We are scared, holes from drain or drains and missing part of our womanhood but grow stronger each day. Next year this time we will be use to our new bodies and graftful that its over.",

What chemo will you be on? I was told my hair would fall out 10 days after my first treatment and it did. I cut it as short as I could so it wouldn't be as depressing, it helped was still sad though. I brought a long and short wig. That's a wig in my picture. Now I rarely wear a wig. Usually a hat when doing errand and bald when taking my daily walk and around the house. Took time but use to it now. My hair started growing back around taxol #5 I think. Some areas no scalp shows the rest is peach fuzz.

Some people experience fevers it's winter and once again food plays a role. WBC will drop everyone does its the bidies reaction to chemo but it depends how low it goes that's important. Your WBCs will increase but chemo will bring it back down. If you get chilly again take your temp and keep Tylenol on hand, helps with headache.Ensure high protein is great when you aren't hungry. I drank one every 2-3 hours no matter what. Your depression.will stay for awhile part of the chemo. It will pass in time especially once you start taxol so much better.AC is hard on some people pills help but food is better. Btw cold skin doesn't mean you don't have a fever. Ask you MO what he considers a fever it varies by doctors some say anything over 100 other it's 101.5 degrees. Michelle",

I'm sorry you are having a hard time understanding what going on with your treatment but we will try to help you. First the meeting your doctor is talking about is probably a tumor board. They present cases to multiple doctors BS, MO RO and PS and discuss the best treatment for you. With mine I had to be there as I was presented. It's great because its like having second third fourth ect opinions. Second it sounds as if your margins weren't clear when they removed the tumor which is usually the reason for another surgery with lumpectomies. Third as far as a little amount of cancer in your nodes it is gray because depending on how much some would say it was negative. So it's up to your team to decide if you need chemo or radiation maybe both depending on your menopausal status. The best advice I can offer is to get a copy of your pathology report. It will be confusing to you at first but this site will help you with the terms. Some of us have been where you are and some exactly where you are. We are hear to help each other get through this together. You aren't alone. Ask us as many questions as you want and we will do our best to answer. :)",

There comes a point in treatment when it becomes real,usually once the port is placed for chemo. I wish I could tell you these feelings will pass in a few days and you will feel better but I can't . This is one of the hardest things to deal with,the anxiety knowing you will soon lose your hair than dealing with the sorrow once its gone. Wigs help but at the end of the day we remove them. So people deal easier by cutting it short or shaving it gives them a since of control. I cut mine short and started wearing a wig a week before my first treatment. I think it help but still cried as the little I had fell out. Once you are past that part you will start to feel better. It the looking like a cancer patient that we fear but that's what we are. As I have said it gets easier with time, not days but weeks or months. I know how sad you are feeling but know one day you will wake up and be ok. I made it and so will you! :)",

So i have been walking around with my abdomen kind of devided in 3. Im so happy it didnt die but i know im going to be in so much pain next week more than last time for sure. I guess its ok i have full range of motion with both arms but having breast pain and abdominal pain is going to suck. Maybe i wont have breast pain since i dont have much feeling in them. I can only hope right?",

What I have learned is that the prognosis for most breast cancers have improved over the years. I was in shock when I read about losing so many in 2 years. I know you will forget most of the questions you have for your MO if you don't write them down. The good thing is the MO will go into detail explaining about your BC, the treatment that's best for you and why plus give you plenty of papers and books to read about the meds and side affects. I remember being hopeful and postive after leaving my MO office. This entire process sucks but we are doing all we can to beat it. Hang in there,this to shall pass :)",

I couldn't walk halfway down the hallway or the restroom that was in my private room with a walker on Monday. I did it Sunday with some pain. My PS gave me extra strength Percocet a muscle relaxer. I refused to take them until around 1am because I was still hurting 2 hours after regular Percocet. It helped so much! I still hurt but able to move around and walk with the walker.My PS says its from been bent over because its the lower back that hurts. I came home Tuesday night. Slept in my recliner, wasn't too bad. My youngest came home from college to be with me. Both kids slept on the couch so I wouldn't be alone or try to do something without help, they know me well. Pain is better and almost standing straight up. Only real pain is getting up too long or sitting down. The pain meds help with that. I have 4 drains again and pain pump to my abdomen. Had 2 pumps one to my breast but pulled them out be accident in hospital. Since I told all my co workers about this surgery had lots of visitors and every last one saw my new boobs. As soon as they asked how I was doing I lifted my gown and said \" I'm good, look at my new breast!\" Thank goodness they were all women :) How is everyone doing with chemo?",

I felt like you guys hate taking so many meds and wanted to just sleep like a normal person, never happened. I was on ambiem 10mg, melatonin 10mg and now restoril ever now and than mostly due to surgery pain. Once I was done with chemo it was much easier to sleep and not addicted to any of them. Remember addiction usually happens when meds are taken when not needed. So swallow your pride take the meds a d get some sleep. You probably won't sleep all night but will get a few hours in. I had 3 of my 4 drains removed today, so happy. I slept in my bed for the first time at a 45 degree angle, abdomen still really tight but I'm feeling much better. You guys have to keep telling yourself this is only temporary because it is. Take the meds you have because once you are done they will take them away. They are there to help your body deal with the changes. Once your done and your body returns to almost as it was before you will forget that you ever needed them :)",

After many years of preaching more than 5 years of tamoxifen offered no benefit now its recommended.

We walk 4 time a day one hour each time. Wish I could show pictures of him and show how much I have changed back to looking like my old self. Maybe one day we will be able to. Since we are all almost done maybe we could figure out a way for us to meet next year sometime. That way more people can come and make payments since most of our incomes have changed.

Oh boy now I don't sleep with a fan and haven't had one hot flash in 3 days! I was prepared to live the next 5-10 years with the SE from tamoxifen but so glad I don't have to. I hate that I'm on more meds but refused to stop taking tamoxifen because of SE. My burns from radiation is getting better. The breast is bigger than the other but can't really tell, haven't worn a bra since my BMX last October. See my PS Monday, hope to get a surgery date. So everyone happy with their breast results? BTW I thought I told you guys my name. It's Michelle guess chemo brain made me forget toðŸ˜œ",

During my research I learned it doesn't matter if you get chemo or surgery first unless its needed to shrink the tumors. It's easier for the surgeon to get clear margins before chemo if having lumpectomy. My right breast has 2 tumors left is clear but still removing both. I cut my hair and brought my wig before I started chemo. My profile picture isn't my hair it's a wig. I don't have grand kids but understand about wanting to look normal. My family and boyfriend didn't want me to wear a wig around them. They would always tell me to take it off I'm still beautiful to them without it :) It took awhile for me to get comfortable around them without it now I don't even think about it. When I take my morning walk my bald head is there for the world to see. Your family loves you with or without hair. It's weird at first but in time no one will notice or care including grand kids after asking a million questions about it.",

It is VERY confusing in the beginning. You are correct diagnosis seem to change at every appt. After your surgery that will stop and the treatment plan will come together.

Welcome to all the new members of our club that none of us wanted to join. maryah930- I think we all had a pity party once or twice and normal. I'm probably one of the few here who has dealt with this for 8 months. I can tell everyone it really does get easier with time and knowledge. BC still enter my mind daily (can't help it since I'm still bald) but the sadness isn't present like it use to be. No more looking out the window and wondering how many more sunsets and sun rises I will see, how will my kids survive without me ect. Now I actually say things like next year, joke all the time as usual, eating normal ect. One thing I do is spend more time with my girls. They have been sleeping with me since i started chemo in last May. Qandyland- I know the shock of hearing node involvement, not easy. No one told me the effects of the nodes being removed before surgery. I had 10 nodes removed and sensation like being at the dentist numb but can feel when touched. Very important that you guys work on your range of motion in the arm that nodes were removed if not will lose full range of motion so the sooner the better. Yes I will hurt a lot but not forever. Stand next to the wall and place your fingers on it, start crawling up the wall like a spider at least 10 times a day. You won't get far in the beginning but will get better. Another one is to have someone lift your arm slowly for you because you will feel resistance,pulling and pain. It took about 2-3 weeks before my range was normal. I don't know how people go back to work in such a short time. I know I'm a wimp I haven't worked since March 29 the day if my first surgery!",

Tomorrow removing breast, so no boobs for 2 weeks, just empty pockets. Cutting and leaving the tissue to use on my stomach in place to see if any die in 2 weeks. If it does will remove it and do tummy tuck and place implants. If it lives will use it for the breast as planned plus tummy tuck. PS said this is better since I'm going smaller the time will allow my skin to shrink. Since I'm have Nipple and skin sparing BMX will look like balloons that need inflating.

The thought of chemo is scarier than the actual treatment right? They encourage you to bring snacks and drinks because it can last 3-4 hours. Also they say if you get chemo on a empty stomach makes you sick. As I said before my only issue was fatigue and appitite only for the first treatment. No issues with either after that. I think it has to do with your health, no medical issues or medications prior to BC. Those who face chemo will be amazed how you handle it. Just remember to take your nausea meds before you are nauseated. The chemo is killing good and bad cells which is why the fatigue and nausea occurs. The body will replace them with healthy ones so important to eat. I drank ensures because it sucks trying to eat when not hungery.",

It's too close to my breast area so they can't use it for IV's or anything so I told them to remove it.

So if you took tylenol and it didnt work when it comes time to take it again just take the vicodin. The max dose is 4 grams a day(24hours) which would be 8 vicodin or 8 extra strenth tylenol or 12 regular tylenol. Hope you feel better soon :)",

They had to flex me in a sitting postion to complete the tummy tuck. Now I know why I was having so much back pain and super tight.

I said Hell No! I love my results and worth the 2 weeks of being uncomfortable. One piece of advise I can give is to ask your PS if you can have a liposuction griddle to wear while you are still swollen after drains and dressings removed. The tight compression feels good and doesn't roll up like the abdominal binder. It's designed to wear 24/7 with hookeye closures and zipper on each side plus hook eye between your legs to use the restroom.",

It seems people are being staged without surgery first. Is this due to scans? It's weird but I didn't have a MRI until after my lumpectomy. Just wondering. iatigger- I will be thinking of you and praying for no surprises. JeniferMiya- Bmx means bilateral mastectomy. With surgeon are you meeting on the 22nd the Plastic surgeon (PS) or Breast surgeon (BS)? They should answer you questions. Some women do go home same day or stay over night depends on your how your surgery goes and insurance. I think drains are the norm but can't be sure. Lots of us are having different reconstruction procedure which is why some stay longer. I'm a single mom with 2 girls and laughter helps them deal with it. Tell your son you will need bras and panties because you will! I hope you aren't holding in your emotions. I know about putting on a happy face for everyone but being so scared. I cried in private for about 2 months, didn't want to upset my girls. One day I lost it and couldn't stop crying. My daughter told me its ok strong people cry too. The 2 of us have lots of time to get info from the rest of the ladies since we are at the end of the month. I'm glad you both found this post :)",

Just because it nothing showing up on scans doesn't mean I can't get it in a different area of the same breast or in the other breast. Once both are removed and examined could find something that the scans missed. There wasn't any reason why I couldn't do lumpectomy before, just don't want to think about going through this again. I figure the least amount of breast tissue the better. Good luck to all the ladies having surgery today. Our thoughts are with you. Congratulations chrisseta! I'm very happy for you!

I was able to get in a chair but wasn't easy. After surgery I couldn't pee even with the Foley catheter in place and my heart rate stayed over 100 but felt fine just sleepy. They did stat labs on me around 1am and the doctor on call can to see me, labs were normal but he ordered them in 6 hours. By the morning my heart rate was in the 120's-130's with increased blood pressure, hgb was 8.2 normal is over 9 so no transfusions. My PS came to see me asked how I was doing I said ok. Than the charge nurse, intensive care charge nurse and 2 floor nurses came rushing in. My heart rate was over 170 blood pressure was dropping and very little output. My PS was shocked felt my abdomen and say we need to get you to surgery stat! The nurses had been checking on me and I know it takes awhile for the bleed to show up. They had just did my bloodwork and my hgb 6.8 critical is anything under 8. Stat 2 units of blood rushed back to surgery within 24 hours. I was done with everything by 10pm Saturday night. Sunday urine output was normal, wasn't as tired and was eating regular diet. My PS came and said he was able to find the bleed as soon as I was opened and that's rare. My drains were putting out clearer drainage Saturday it was all dark red. My heart rate was still over 100 so he kept me an extra day and give 2 more units of blood. I was feeling fine but I was doing ok when I was bleeding so he wanted to be sure. Got home Monday night about 9pm. I cried a little not about missing breast just putting my girls through so much lately. They keep telling me it ok they are happy to take care of me and to stop worrying about them. I can take off my ace wrap at anytime but I like the compression feeling. On pain meds and antibiotics. Have appt with PS and Bs Friday. I'm taking care of myself emptying my 4 drains alone with my girls on stand by. Not allowed to shower yet and sleep in my bed. My Kids help me get comfortable adding and removing pillows positioning me and bringing whatever I need because once in bed takes lots of energy getting up. Glad everyone is doing great. I'm feeling more energetic too. Oh my doctor told me my path came back excellent no cancer anywhere margins were clear. I'm so happy! Hope everyone continues to heal.

The picc line is usually placed in the upper arm and have ports outside the skin. It has a dressing that has to be changed weekly and is sterile. They get infected a lot because its outside the body, dressing comes off ect. Chemo is hard on the veins but some people take that chance.

Glad to hear everyone is moving forward with treatment but sad about the set backs. at least you are all are aware of the sings on lymphodemia to catch it early. I have been lucky so far but once radiation starts that could change. I brought me a short wig and a long one. My daughter told me not to buy to but i thought why not? Can go short and sassy or long and sexy! I have only worn the short one so far, they make you hot and sweaty. I was tols that before i brought them and it was true. Being in chemopause doesnt help plus my chemo was in the summer. Hope now that its cooler i can wear my long one. I paid $750 for the 2 very expendsive but thought not sure how long i will have to wear them and wanted something that looked real. The only issue i had was keeping it on. Once you lose your hair the wig slips and moves. I brought the headband and tape to keep it in place but neither was 100%. The headband was a waste but the tape is ok. I have to use a lot because i sweat it loose but it stays on. One day before i knew about the wig moving i was driving down the street and it just fell off! I was at a red light and was trying to put it back on the best i could. When i got home my daughters looked at me funny and said \"whats wrong with your hair? Its sideways!\" I started laughing and said \" im just glad it didnt fall out the window! :)",

Mental stress is tiring too that's why you aren't sleeping. You are still dealing with the unknown like the rest of us. I still haven't seen my RO yet so not sure what's in store for me. Most mesectomies don't need chemo when they have a complete response like I did but since it was in my nodes I'm not one of them.

He's using the fat under my arms left over from BMX, my lower back and thighs. Sounds like a lot but not much on my back or under arms. It will give me more of an hour glass shape. He doesn't want to use my abdomen because of the tram flap. They remove more than needed because not all of the fat takes trying to prevent another surgery. I told him to take double of what he thinks he needs replace half of it back and throw the rest in the trash! Oh I pray he listens. 2 girls can dream right?ðŸ˜€",

He took fat from my flank area and under my arms but the results aren't what I expected. I found out I need 5 more surgeries every 6-8 weeks to make my breast look more natural and round. I'm sure he told me that in the beginning of this nightmare but I forgot. My next surgery is 10/18/13 at 7am. What I don't know if its because I used muscle for 2 breast or because it has to be done gradually so of some doesn't take he will know sooner. That's why he using it from my flanks, under arms and thighs. I'm basically have that BRAVA procedure without wearing the suction comes/cups. My breast will be larger, rounder and feel more realistic. Plus will have no fat anywhere since its all going to be liposuction out and into my breast. Always have to look on the bright side right?ðŸ˜Š How is everyone doing? Can you believe it's almost October again?",

It sucks right we think losing hair is the only issue dealing with self esteem but weight gain is something we can't hide. You know it's because of the steroids you get during chemo. They increase your appitite and case insomnia. The only tip I can give you is to walk as much and often as you can. Try to change what you are eating and eat every 2 hours. I ate lots of fruit, salad, fat free popcorn, made fruit smoothies, cracker chips through out the day between meals. I not sure weightless will happen but you can prevent gaining more. Hope this helps. BTW I did lose once I started taxol lost the 20 pounds I gained in about 6 weeks.",

I'm not going through a divorce at the moment but have been separated for years. He was going to remove me from his insurance but once I was diagnosed he kept me on. Regardless how we feel about each other I'm the mother of his kids. Like you I was finally in a happy place. I started dating my boyfriend December 2011 and diagnosed in February. He was the first man I have ever brought home to meet my kids and I really liked him. I went back and forth about if I should ask him or allow him to stay. I didn't think it would be fair of me to do either. He told me it was his decision and stayed with me. Very supportive and sweet. He tells me I'm still beautiful and won't allow me to wear a wig around him. Also I have been having yearly mammograms since I was 27 years old and all was clear until the last one. I'm stage 3a and did everything I could to catch it early. So don't beat yourself up about it no guarantee it would change anything. Most importantly don't freak out. It could be so many things beside breast cancer. We are all gear for you either way. You are doing the right thing by having it checked out. I will be thinking if you on Tuesday :)",

You made a life changing decision and not an easy one. You can wear whatever you want to the hospital because you will get a hospital gown. What you really want is to have a button down shirt or something that you won't have to lift your arms to put on. Yes you will have drains but not sure how many will depend on your BS and PS. You will find a way to sleep don't worry about that too much. The amount of hospital time depends on your body reaction to the surgery and insurence. I stayed for 4 days because of a complication but some people are just over night. I can't say much about TE's because I didn't get them but I'm sure someone will answer that for you. Not sure if they have a December surgery discussion yet maybe you can start one if not. I'm part of the October group lot of wonderful women there who have been were you are and November too. We are all in the fight together. You aren't alone :)",

I don't think it's a good idea to start treatment in another country and finish when you get home. Here's why: No one can be diagnosed staged or treated correctly without surgery first because scans don't tell the entire picture. Many of us went into surgery thinking our tumors were smaller with no node involvement but changed after surgery. I went into surgery stage one with no node involvement to stage 3a with 6/10 nodes positive plus 3 tumors. Plus unless you already have a MO you will have to wait for a referral to one. No doctor will treat you from test or scans from another country. You will have to start from scratch with test and scans again. So it doesn't make since to start treatment that you can't continue and the chemo meds could change. I had lumpectomy but my margins were clear. They wanted to go back in to clear them but I chose to do chemo first. I had grade 3 which chemo works best on. I had double MX and a complete response to chemo when they exam my breast in pathology. I know it's scary to walk around knowing you have BC but don't put yourself through extra stress by starting treatment that you can't finish. Good luck to youðŸ˜Š",

Surgery first is standard unless chemo is needed to shrink the tumor. Plus some women have more than one tumor and they don't always have the same er,pr or her2 status. That's why I said scans and test don't always tell the picture. I didn't say never or rarely.",

They gave me a book about this subject maybe your MO has one about it. Everyone's body is different and medical professionals have diffentent opinions too. Of course oral sex is a different question. Never did that during any of my chemo treatments.",
