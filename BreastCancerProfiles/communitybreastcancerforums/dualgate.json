      "Content": "dualgate wrote: Hi everyone, this is my first time on here, I sure hope It will help me.I am 45, I have stage 1 er&pr+ node negative BC. I hade a lumpectomy on Nov. 16th w/3 node removed. All surgery is healed up and Dr wants me to have chemo,(4 rounds) radiation and Tamoxifin. I am waiting on results of Oncotype DX test and have joined a clinical trial.Should get the results today or thursday.I have an appointment for a 2nd opinion at Iowa City hospital and clinic on the 30th. Oh and the tumor was 1.3 cm. What Id like to know is if anyone did the Oncotype DX test and how reliable of a tool is it? I have no problem doing chemo, I just want to make sure the risk is worth it to me. I've informed my oncologist that if I dont agree with the treatment in the study I will back out and they said that is fine, it's my decision, but I really want to help anyway I can to find a cure. I really need to know if the time frame is a problem? I was diagnosised on 11th, lumpectomy on nov.16th. and now Ill be waiting till after the new year to start treatment. Is the 2nd opinion something I should forgo so I can get started? I'm nervous about waiting longer. Please give any advise you can. Thank you so much.

I am so glad I found this site. yes that is the trail I've joined. But as I said before if the Dr. and I dont agree on the route to take for treatment I will be discontinuing the trial. But I will wait for the result and deal with it then. I am so glad to have other women who have been there to talk to!!! It just makes me feel more at ease. Thanks again!!!",

The post I was reading said they got a call from the dr. after they made their last post!!! Wow!! Oncotypre score came back at 13. I dont think that is to bad but the cut off for this study is 11, so Ill have to be radnomized and may end up with chemo, rad,and tamoxifin. Or just rad and tamoxifin. So good news? Hope so, now just relax and enjoy the holidays I guess! happy holidays to all of you!!!",
