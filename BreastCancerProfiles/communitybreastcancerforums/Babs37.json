I could go about my days and continue just about everything i used to do.But I just had a unilateral mastectomy  and node dissection (feb 22). I find that for me, the surgery is harder. Probably because of the node dissection because my arm hurts and after almost 4 weeks and having to see a PT for cording in my armpit, it still hurts to lift my arm and do my exercises even if I see it's getting there. So I have to take pain med (Lyrica) everyday since for the nerve pain in my arm. I can't wait for everything to move the way it did before. Good luck to you.",

So for a couple of days, that week, I took Tylenol for my pain. The following week, for my blood tests before the next chemo, my liver enzymes were up! My onc asked me what I did to get them up like that and the only thing I had done differently that time was to take Tylenol. So he asked me to stop because Tylenol is hard on the liver. So I listen and did not take Tylenol anymore and the next blood test, my enzymes were back to normal. So yes I think that maybe the pain killers may be responsable for your liver enzymes going up. Hope that helps. Good luck with treatments.",

We brought her in for surgery to take the mass out. All went fine but 1 month later she was pain and cried everytime we would touch her so we knew it was back.My parents then decided it was time to end her suffering and had her put to sleep. I understand how you must feel. I remember we all cried. I think for me as a little girl, it was the first time I saw my dad cry too. We get attached to our pets. Like AussieKate said, you'll know when it's time. Hugs. I have a friend who had BC 2 years ago and at the end of her treatments, they found out that her dog had cancer too. It's a little 10 years old shih tzu. Since it was her dog and it was there for her during all her treatments, she didn't have the heart to just put him to sleep. So she decided to try dog chemo (they have the money to try something like that....) Believe it or not, it worked and her dog is alive and well today. Did you know that a dog on chemo doesn't loose his fur? Lucky dogs.....  And by the way, I HATE CANCER TOO!",
