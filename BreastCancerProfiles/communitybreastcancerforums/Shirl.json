Scan.  A tumor was found on my thyroid which was also cancer.  They said they were unrelated and that I just got a double wammy.  The surgery was not to bad and I only stayed over night.  The worse for me was waiting for my TSH level to get low enough for treatment.  Just really tired.  I had a pill and had to keep my distance from people for about a week and not let anyone use my bathroom because of the radioactive.  I have a scar that most people don't even notice. ",
