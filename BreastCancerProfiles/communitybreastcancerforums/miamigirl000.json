I got my results today: path report reads: L breast mass recieved in formalin and consists of a 3.0 x 1.5 x 1.0cmsegment of fibrofatty breast tissue. Diagnosis: Benign breast tissue w/ fibrocystic changes Anyone have any insight on this??? The surgeon just said it was no big deal and that was the extent of my visit (he has been very nonschlant during this entire thing). I did mention that i found a pea sized lump just above the inscision last night and the sight is getting increasingly red, so he said maybe i had some fluid and prescribed antibiotics. My ? is that the FNB showed A-tip cells, does this go along w/ the findings??? Well thank you for everything ladies, i wish you all luck in your journys!

The surgeon called and said that the lump was visible on MRI, after not being seen on mamo/us, and we should take it out based on the fam. history. The small scattered area of \"stuff\" i have he said we unfortunatly have to \"watch and wait\" I will repeat mri in a few months and go from there w/ that area. I am sooooo happy that i will have this out of the way before the holidays!!! Thanks again to all of you who have helped me through this difficult time over the last 6mo w/ both these stupid lumps i have had and will now finally be rid of!!!! Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "miamigirl000 wrote: Hello ladies. I met w/ the surgeon for the lump in my breast. The surgeon said that because of my very strong family history, that the lump should indeed come out. The problem is that because i am lactating, he can not do the lumpectomy because it puts me at risk for problems with my milk moving into the surgical hole and causing problems. So, we will be doing a biopsy on the 20th (needle) and then i will be working on drying up my milk and then in 6wks we will do the lumpectomy. My ? is, that if the lump is comming out regardless of the needle biop. results, do i really need to subject myself to the needle biop also??? this just adds to my stress, bills my insurance, and is another surgical procedure. The surgeon said that the lump will come out even if the biop is neg, so then whats the point? do u think that if it were pos for cancer that they would risk the lumpectomy while i was still lactating? If this is the case, then of course i would do it..... i know i need to call the doc and ask about this....just wanted your thoughts on it. He also mentioned that he thought the lump was one of 3 things.... a lypoma (sp) a fibroma (sp), not sure if this was correct word a cancer that grew fast due to my estrogen from pregnancy anyways, thanks again for all your help! shannon Log in to post a reply",

The report reads as this. \"The breasts are heterogeneously dense which may lower the sensitivity of mammography. Benign appearing calcifications are present. Bilateral breast u/s obtained on the same day was unremarkable. Impression\" No mammographic evidence of malignancy. Routine follow up reocmmended. NOTE: An xray report which is neg. for cancer should not delay biopsy if a dominant or clinically suspicious mass is present. Sone cancers are not identified by xray. Adenosis and fibrocystic disease may obscure an underlying neoplasm.\" WTF....is the \"note\" just to cover their ass? I meet the surgeon, a new one from last time (horrible experience w/ first surgeon), so i guess i will have more info then...any thoughts on this, the calcifications, ect??? There was no mention of the actual lump that is palpable (probally the size of maybe 2cm or so), but very obvious when felt. Thanks in advance!!! shannon Log in to post a reply",
