I am quite happy that when I put my hair back in a small pony tail I look normal. My only concern is that my part is wider than before chemo. I am wondering if this will change. I don't know why there is no new hair in the front of my head, like in the back and sides. I am still shedding about 75-100 strands of hair a day. I think I am unusual in shedding so long. It has stabilized to 75-100, but still wondering where all these long hairs are coming from and how it is possible I still have any left for a small ponytail. I am on Arimidex and maybe that's why I am shedding more than others here. I started taking biotin 5,000 mg. Haven't seen too much of a change.",

I have tried the Nioxin 4 and it made a big difference for me. I didn't have a shedding scalp problem so didn't leave shampoo in for too long. I noticed the shedding was less and my hair just looked a lot fuller. I used the conditioner too but didn't massage it into my scalp. I am feeling a lot better about the hair thinning after using it.",

I am 13 weeks out and still shedding. Hair is so much thinner now but growing in. No one I just meet thinks \"chemo\" when they see me. So it was really worth still worth it for me. I am putting my hair in a small ponytail and using a headband to keep it all in place. Do you guys have other styling suggestions? Wearing it down is really not possible. The hair is right past my shoulders. I have basically four clumps hanging there and curling in on themselves. Can't wait to get it cut into a bob.",
