I believe there were some women in the Weil TM study that progressed on TM and the thought was that microscopic mets not large enough to be visible on PET had already started growing before TM treatment was started. I am not sure if avoiding foods with copper would help. It certainly could not hurt.",

In the experience of the MD I work with, they have not seen a relapse in a stage IV patient after taking tetrathiomolybdate for 3 years. I consider that exceptional. Apparently, the 3 year treatment with tetrathiomolybdate causes microscopic metastatic cells to go dormant. Here are some details: Tetrathiomolybdate chelates (removes) copper from your body. Copper is integral to cancer cells for building a blood supply (angiogenesis) to feed it. If you take away the ability of the cancer cell to grow, it basically starves and cannot grow. It goes dormant, hypothetically. No one knows for sure. You have to be NED to start the treatment. It took me 16 months to get there with Femara, Herceptin, ablation to sternal mets and the primary breast tumor, cleaning up my diet, exercise, herbal supplements, meditation and a few other things. One needs to be followed by an MD or DO as the ceruloplasmin level, white and red blood counts need to be monitored, and you have to have someone to write a prescription for the tetrathiomolybdate. Most unfortunately, a regular MD or oncologist is not going to do this as they are totally ignorant about this type of treatment. Ceruloplasmin measures how well the tetrathiomolybdate is chelating copper out of your body. A ceruloplasmin measurement of 8-12 for three years is the goal. I had some slight anemia which is not unusual. If the anemia becomes too severe or the white blood count falls too low, the dosage of tetrathiomolybdate is adjusted and the blood counts go back up very quickly. I never experienced any difficulty or adverse effects from taking tetrathiomolybdate. It is important to avoid eating foods with high copper content such as shellfish, dark chocolate, and organ meats like liver while on the treatment and post treatment. Other than that, it is an easy treatment that holds much promise and hope. It is also important during and post treatment to avoid \"inflammation.\" The inflammation to avoid is that which is caused by eating sugars, starches, non grass-pastured meats and dairy products, undergoing unnecessary surgery. As a matter of point, right after going off tetrathiomolybdate, I had to have an unavoidable surgery on a torn biceps and torn rotator cuff. Sure enough, 3 months later some mediasteinal lymph nodes lit up on PET. I consulted with a Breast Cancer Immunologist and my other MD and Naturopath who recommend waiting 3 months before getting alarmed and thinking the worst. It was her opinion that the lymph nodes were hyperactivated from the inflammation of the shoulder surgery. By June, my PET was clear. There are a few compounding pharmacies that will provide tetrathiomolybdate with a prescription. It is NOT covered by insurance and costs about $250 per month while on the full dose. Labwork is usually covered by insurance. The Integrative MD is worked with is no longer in practice. He has retired to conduct research for Breast Cancer. The Naturopath I currently work with is Dr. Mark Bricca in Ashland, Oregon. The pharmacy I used to compound the tetrathiomolbdate (T M for short) is The Prescription Center in Wisconsin. You can find both of them with a Google search. If you need a practitioner in your area to prescribe T M and monitor your treatment, I would call the Prescription Center and ask to speak to Wayne Loveland. He fills prescriptions from all over the US and would know who prescribes it. There are other pharmacies that compound TM and you could ask for a reference from them as well I would hope. I will check back from time to time to see if anyone has any questions. With love and best wishes to all of you in your journey, Sherry",
