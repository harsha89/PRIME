I'd look into getting some help with the expenses since you don't have insurance.  Check with the hospital you are using; they probably have income based rates.  Don't let the expense stop you. Yeah, it could be a cyst.  But you've got to take the next step and find out what it is.  Has the doctor suggested any tests?  Whatever they are, do them.  Get an answer so you don't have to worry about it anymore.  Good luck! ",
