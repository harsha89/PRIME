I've had it for a while, have been in denial, and finally went to the doctor. Last week the Surgeon did a biopsy and came up with the diagnosis, that it was caused by radiation from my 2008 lumpectomy and radiation therapy. My husband and I were really worried that it had spread but today got the results and it has not.  The doctors say now I'll get the simple mastectomy without any followup radiation or chemo. JO-5, I'm so sorry I signed up with a user name so similar to yours, I must have read your posts and thought that was a good name! I thought it was unique when I signed up for JQ5. At the beginning of the year I caught four colds in a row plus had a lot of stress with my only daughter's wedding, and ended up seeing the pulmonologist.  As a result I had to start taking medicine just to breathe every day and I found Buteyko breath training on Youtube. It's lucky for me because with that I've been able to get myself healthier with that and serious Macrobiotics. I've been playing around with Macrobiotics for years ever since my Dad was sick with cancer, but was never dedicated before like I am now, that's for sure.  Anyway, that's the plan, work on being healthier, get the Mastectomy, and be thankful.   Speaking of being thankful, we're new to Kelsey Seybold and we just love them. They're so well organized and everyone we have met has been very kind. They're really outstanding.",
