I talked a little bit with my doctor and moved my appointment 2 days forward. I am trying to keep all my focus on the treatment plan so I don't get to think about the worst all the time. I hope the best for you! Get some help to be able to have some quality sleep if you can. Good rest is important! Hugs! Jianchi",
