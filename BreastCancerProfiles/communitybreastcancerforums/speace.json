But there's one glitch in this whole thing. She is having me tested for the BRCA gene. Only because we have no history of cancer in my family, but we don't know about my mom's mothers history because she was adopted. So, if I come back positive for the BRCA GENE she's suggesting I have a double mastectomy because she said I have a 85% chance of getting another breast cancer on e left side or some other cancer. So now we wait the 2 weeks for that result. Ugh",

Right now your going in 100 different directions! I know , I've been there also! First, take a breath and slow down a bit. I've been learning that everything in this process is done in steps! And as much as you may just want to jump into a double mx. Don't be so quick to decide yet. You don't have all your info yet. As much as we want to go right from diagnosis to immediate treatment and then finishing and getting on with our normal lives it just doesn't happen that way. All done in steps. I'm almost done with my radiation and I have to say it's been a breeze! I researched my ass off about radiation treatment and the effects of it. And I can tell you it has come light years from your grandmother's radiation. It's safe, it's pinpoint precise. And custom made for your cancer!!! So don't run from it just yet!. I wish you all the best, please take a deep breath, get some xanax, it works wonders in slowing your mind a bit! And before you know it you will be on that track of treatment and the end will be in sight!! The happy living a good life, not the End of your life!!! Lololol",

Got the call 3 days after surgery that cancer did not spread to any lymph nodes. THANK GOD. My first question is, had anyone experienced numbness and tingling in the area surrounding the removal and is it normal to have this? Second question, I as reading up on sentinal lymph node removal and alot of sites said that you can receive false negative results , I'm so nervous that this is the case and that I probably do have the cancer sells spreading all through the lymph nodes! Just wondering if anyone ever had this and felt that way? The rational side of me thinks that's not the case with me, and that my doctor is very capable and I do trust her and know she most likely wouldn't take any chances and made sure she was thorough with the biopsy. But the irrational side of me takes over and I don't believe that I could actually have dodged a bullet and found this cancer so early that it didnt have time to spread!!! Ugh please, any advise would be great. Dx 3/25/2015, IDC, Right, 1cm, Stage IA, Grade 2, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",
