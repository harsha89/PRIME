This is a safe place, there is no judgement, and is a great source of facts to arm yourself with as the information starts to trickle in. Knowledge is power. Make sure to get copies of your reports, pathology, procedures, surgeries, anything you go through. It is your information and you own it. You sound like the type that will get to know it backwards and forwards. There is an avalanche of information. Before I was dxd with no family history, I knew less than nothing. I had to get up to speed fast. Everyone has a slightly different situation, but you will find people with lots in common as you move from step to step. Sending you support and hugs. Try to \"breathe\" and realize your ability to stay as calm as possible will help you. Clear headedness is essential to decision making that is unfortunately coming your way. Stick close. There will always be someone here",

Undoubtedly, going through all of that has cast an enormously scary pall over your own diagnosis. And yes, you must insist your family support whatever informed decision you make. As you proceed through this dangerous terrain, you will find sometimes the people you expect to support you the most and the best fall short of the ideal- they are scared and less informed than you, but that's no excuse. It just is. You can always find correct info in the articles here on bco and non judge mental support. Stay off Dr. Google. I made the decision you are making a year ago. It was very hard, but I'm happy with what I did. I continued to second guess myself a bit even after, because I felt strongly I wanted it out if my body before year end, so opted quickly for BMX. From everything I've read, (and my doctors told me the same) the morbidity rates for LX + rads (and make sure they do an Oncotype dx test if your biopsy results show ER+ receptors. It should be on your biopsy pathology report) is very close to a BMX with no rads. Every situation and person is different though. I had reasons for not wanting to do rads. But my Oncotype dx was on the high side, so even though my tumor was reasonably small, they got clean margins and there was no node involvement, chemo was recommended, which I did, and I'm now on Tamoxifen for at least 5 years. At the end of the day, the difference is if you do LX you will continue to have mammograms and biopsies, possibly more often than before. But you will have your breasts. One needs to think carefully about that. Yes if you do BMX you can opt for recon, but it's never easy, and you can expect at least a couple more surgeries, and you will most likely lose feeling in the reconstructed breasts which can affect sexual gratification. You could get a new primary tumor, but given current treatment/dx protocols, they say they would catch it early, and you would be presented with some treatment options again. In a BMX scenario, with no recon, like I did, there is no ongoing scanning. They would do manual checkups and follow up on anything suspiscous in the chest or underarm area. Less likelihood of recurrence, less invasive diagnostics, less worry. But not necessarily a longer life. But for some people, they would consider this a better quality of life. It's very personal. Either way your life expectancy, strictly according to the numbers, would be about the same. So you can take some if the fear out of your decision. Wishing you the very best in your decision. Inform yourself the best you can, then follow your gut. ",

Just like with pain meds, its good to stay ahead of it. Dont wait till you are sick. I hadn't found this site when I went through surgery. But just in time, before I started chemo, I found they have a special thread/group for people starting chemo each month. I highly recommend you join your month. If one hasn't been started, you can start one! The ladies in March saved my life. We all shared our ups and downs, our fears, tricks for handling side effects, and laughs. Lurk around in some of these threads and you will see what people are going through. Chemo affects no two people the same. And nobody gets all of the possible side effects. It's like a special little made to order sandwich just for you. In our group we called it the shit sandwich. But between the 30 or more people traveling the road with you, you will get the help and support you need. And sometimes it seems it's the only safe place to come when you to need to rant, sulk, cry, or complain. I wish both of you above all the best. We were all scared but we all got through it.

      "Content": "Mar 30, 2016 06:06PM - edited Mar 30, 2016 06:09PM by Jackbirdie Hi Owens- I am not a doctor, but my dx is somewhat similar to yours. I remember in the beginning there was so much information swirling around. It is scary and unsettling. So here is my two cents. The only person who really should be suggesting or recommending chemo or endocrine therapy/aka anti-hormonals is a medical oncologist. It does seem like there are so many different doctors to see. It is possible that the surgeon, RO, or other doctors could be suggesting the possibility of those treatments just to keep your mind open to the possibility. But the determination of chemo in an ER/PR+, HER- bc, assuming it does turn out to be node negative, would also be impacted by the Oncotype dx test. You can read more about it elsewhere on this site. Essentially, post surgery treatments are designed to maximize against the possibility of recurrence, even though a great deal of the solution is achieved in surgery. In my case I had a 1.5 cm tumor, clean margins and clear nodes. But my Oncotope score was high enough that my MO recommended both chemo and tamoxifen, which he later changed to Arimidex. Cancer has the ability to bypass lymph nodes and enter the bloodstream. There's a lot they don't know. These treatments, however, should not, IMO, be based solely on your age. An Oncotype or a Mammaprint test, or both, should be ordered on your tumor sample immediately after surgery. An MO would order that. Then all factors would be considered, including grade of the tumor, and nodal status. FWIW, in my case, the endocrine/anti-hormonals were estimated-assumed to be twice as effective as chemo. So I might have decided to do just the anti-hormonal and not chemo. My MO recommended it but left it in my hands. My score of 30 was just too high for me to say no to chemo. Therefore, I would use this time now to research more, and find a good MO and get on his or her schedule for as soon as possible after your lumpectomy. I wish you the best of luck. Keep asking questions! It is very healthy to do it, and learning as much as possible will help you make the best decisions for YOU.",

That is TO START to feel better, though others bounce back more quickly. And it could take six months to really feel yourself. I tell you this not to discourage you, but to help normalize what you are feeling. I was really DOWN for weeks after my last, end of June. So two months PFC for me and I'm starting to feel very good. I went back to PT, got evaluated for truncal lymphedema (and yes) and started going to a chair yoga class. But none of that until about 6 weeks out, and deportation complete. All I find is helping, and as I get more energy, I can do more, which in turn gives me more energy. It will happen for you. I hope very soon.",

Although it is a moral victory and will help you mentally to know you are done, please make sure your circle of peeps understand your body is not done, and you still will need plenty of support for awhile. I am just two weeks out from finishing TC X 6 and I feel like unabated and unrelenting shit. Princess- glad to hear that temp has come down a bit. So worrying. Karen- I hadn't read before about your crushing bone pain in 2013. So sorry to hear that. But it helps me a bit to know. The combo of Neulasta and Taxotere has been powerfully painful, debilitating, and relentless. Also mentally helpful to hear about the water retention issue. Hopefully I will drop some of that over the next months. Ksusan- good luck straightening that scan issue out. I do hate it when gatekeepers get big for their britches and are wrong to boot! And Little Blue- I wanted to say something to you but found I wasn't finding the right words, so I delayed. But even without the right words, I wanted to say thanks for reaching \"back to the future\" to March to always be supportive of us, and in particular to me. It took on additional significance and poignance for me when you shared the other day that your not so DH has been absent for you during this time. That must be an awful blow. I am single, (recently finally divorced) so although I don't truly understand what this feels like, I do know that it's been disappointing when any friend or loved one has gone awol. And the more I expected from them, the more disappointing their disappearing act has been. I am very glad you shared, and I'm very sorry. Sending hugs. You have maintained a killer sense of humor and decorum through it all. A true class act. Everybody in the chair or feeling the SEs today, know there are many invisible hands holding yours right now.",

I am feeling almost imperceptibly better daily since I hit rock bottom over the weekend. I am almost 3 weeks PFC and I can see I have a long way to go. The house plans are still on, closing might be delayed a bit because the appraisers are backed up. I'm not stressing too much, using my energy to just keep giving my body what it needs to recover. I have had an outpouring of what seem to be real offers to help with packing, moving, unpacking, moving some of the more important garden plants I don't want to leave behind.....it has been quite overwhelming how many people have stepped forward. And my brother and SIL are coming from Philly Friday for a visit and as they say, \"to help with anything I need, up including organizing for the move\"....yay! After so many people acted strange, withdrew, didn't really want to know, in the beginning of this shit sandwich, it is amazing to me to have the tsunami of offers now. I guess part of it is people don't know what to do or say about cancer. But everyone has moved before, and they KNOW how to do that! I'm grateful. Congratulations to everyone checking off another date at the chemo bar this week, and sending loving mojo to anybody suffering. Been there. I've got your hand. Katy",

I would be concerned as a manager and for the health of the organization, that people are not unduly worried about you, their own workloads, and any imagined upcoming changes those plugged into the rumor mill may be manufacturing. I would ask for his support and I might, if you can do it casually, ask your HR person for input and support in letting everyone know the facts of what are happening now, and what the plan is for re-integrating you into the day to day. I think people sometimes drop the ball and fail to communicate well in these situations. But that is precisely when they need to take a strong hand and speak up to quash the wagging tongues. It is probably to your benefit to \"fake it till you make it\" in the workplace, except for any really close friends you may have. You could say if asked, \"it wasn't nice, but it's over and I'm back\" or something to that effect. I remember before I was dxd I knew next to nothing about BC. I might have wondered about a co-worker's prognosis. Every bit of information always goes through a person's \"how is this going to affect ME\" filter, and even without cancer, there are trouble makers and shit stirrers in every workplace. That's why you shouldn't try to handle this alone. Let management and HR earn their paycheck. This is their job. And it affects them too, not just you.",

Second, anxiety and mental health issues would cripple me if I had to endure the additional level of scans, scrutiny, biopsies (and I was told my breast tissue was dense so likely anything weird would be biopsied) on the remaining breast.

Beyond that, they also offered me long term interest-free terms for the rest. It is well worth talking to them about minimizing visits that \"generate\" office visit billing. I had blood work every week. No doc or PA. Every 3rd week I had an infusion, and saw either, alternating, the doc or PA/oncology nurse. That's just how it was with mine. I felt it was necessary because monitoring trends in your blood work, your weight- which could alter dosage, and managing SEs, all happen during those appointments. I would look around for some help.

It might be the way they have it spelled is not exactly how it appears on the package. So I would \"loosen\" up the search and just put the manufacturer. You will get to see similar products and maybe find the one you are looking for. It does take some time to get familiar, and there is loads of info. If you click on any product it will take you to a more detailed page on that product. I know what you mean about the horse out of the barn. I have kind of come to accept I can't control everything, but I do what I can. Good luck finding something you like.

My understanding, (though I'm not any kind of expert) is that in a SLNB procedure, the purpose is to take the \"sentinel\" node or nodes, which kind of means first, that the tumor drains to. Sometimes you will have just one sentinel node that lights up blue or ticks with the Geiger counter. Other times, there are multiple, equidistant, if you will, nodes that the tumor drains to. They just take the ones that appear to be sentinel. Or if they are really close together like Steph said. It is rare these days that during a SLNB procedure they take axillary nodes. It might make some difference if you had neoadjuvant chemo, and had physically and clinically identified suspiscous nodes beforehand so this is not gospel. It is not uncommon at all to have two sentinel nodes, and I've seen people with three. It sux donkey balls indeed to wait. We are all waiting with you, holding your hand.",

      "Content": "Jul 13, 2015 02:11AM - edited Jul 13, 2015 02:14AM by Jackbirdie Lynn- made some very small improvement over the weekend. Yes I get horrific bone pain. Sometimes it starts in the lower back and stays there a couple of days, meanwhile it gathers force in my legs. Actually it's all over my body pain, but the legs are the worst. I try rubbing my quads and it's actually painful to the touch. This makes very little sense to me, but there it is.. I am weak, short of breath, and walking from the bed to the bathroom hurts. I'm hunched over like a very old woman. The best comparative description is that it's like a \"flare\" that people describe with RA and fibromyalgia. I know I'm getting weaker and weaker, and I'm in a dilemma if I should try to force something out of my body. In the end, I've decided to give my body at least the usual 3 weeks I used to get between infusions to rest and mend a bit more. This pain and weakness was definitely an SE that was cumulative. I didn't really notice it the first round. But from rounds 2-5 it got steadily worse, and 6 has been off the charts. Sorry I don't have better news for those of you behind me on the schedule. Congrats on finishing up this coming Thursday!!! Knowing in your head that you are done should help you in the war between brain and body. About HT, blood tests showed I'm not completely through menopause..so I start Tamoxifen in about 30 days. My MO wanted me to give my body a bit of a break before I jump in to that pool. I'm just hoping I tolerate it with minimal side effects, as it is a key part of my treatment. In fact, he said, twice the benefit I got from chemo in my particular case",

I tripped on a cobblestone and spilled all 37 x 5 ( I can't do the math sorry, chemo brain) on a lady wearing an all white outfit! And they were strawberry margaritas! I'm sure she put a hex on me for that! Finally, at long last, I realize what I did to myself to get breast cancer. A witch!",

Sometimes I just enjoyed reading their synopses. But they cheered me when I finished Kent Haruf's last book. Our Souls At Night I think.

It was almost an entirely psychological reason. For me, I just didn't want to live that way. I had very large and dense breasts, and I felt certain that down the road there would be \"suspiciousnes\" of a nature that would require biopsies ....... And waiting for results.....the dreaded waiting. It is a very individual decision. The ONLY important thing is that you do and get what is right for you. YOU.",

It is difficult to justify altering your lifestyle completely when we know they are guessing, and we all know vegans, non red meat eating, non smoking, non drinking, non sugar eating women that get cancer. Quality of life needs to figure in somehow, but I don't want to die over a chocolate covered almond! Speaking of feeling unsafe, I just gathered up all the free product I was given at LGFB. I Looked everything up on the skin deep website and threw away between half and three quarters. Known carcinogens and endocrine disrupters. Estrogen imitators and morphers. I don't know which way to turn. I've had many skin cancers and a brother that died of melanoma. I looked up the sun screen I've been using, a Neutrogena product, and it's one of the worst on the market, as judged by that website. A big black trash bag full of ??? WTFs out to the can.

      "Content": "Jackbirdie wrote: Hello all! I've been lurking around a bit, listening and learning. This is my first post. Most of my info is in my siggie. I am 57, live alone (except for my wonderful doggie companion). Yesterday was my second onc appt., at which we reviewed many test results. I have spent a lot of time reading over the last two months. I try to stop before I get too freaked out, and I have tried to keep Dr. Google off my medical team.... I have had a very difficult time recovering from surgery, lots of pain. I have as many words for pain now as the Inuit has words for snow. Well...almost. I wore my welcome out at the surgeon asking for pain med refills. I have a terrible scar. I was warned about underarm \"dog ears\" which would not have been visible every time I looked at myself in the mirror. Instead, I have two 1-2\" mounds an inch apart in the middle off my chest. I feel quite like an ogre. I have learned here that if it doesn't improve to my satisfaction, I coukd have it dealt with with ps later. No plans for reconstruction. I don't think I would make a good candidate for another surgery. I started PT but it made it worse at first and then I got bronchitis and violent coughing was brutally painful. I'm starting to feel better finally, and I plan to start PT again next week. I understand my pathology, and believe I understand the numbers. Well enough to understand that there is no safety in them. I am fairly healthy. Other than BC. I was very lucky to find a good MO, who recommend a CT/PET an an Oncotype dx before I even knew I needed one. I stepped up my reading to be able to use his time effectively. Because I prepared myself, I was not doubled over when I got the results. I feel very fortunate that I was not among those who already have mets, via non lymph node travel. That was the good news. The more troubling result was the Oncotype. My score was... Is.... 30. I have come such a long way in understanding what all of this means. But I'd like to share my thinking and ask for others' experiences to help make the chemo decision (which btw, mo suggests TC, no A, due to my age and his general concern about irreversible heart damage with A) followed by Tamoxifen, a dissappointment, since blood tests revealed I'm not completely through menopause. I thought I would be on an AI. Maye the second 5 yrs he says. What a woman! No period for for years, but I'm still a little estrogen factory. ;-( Anyway,, I understand that at the high end of the intermediate onco score, I will only benefit an additional 4-5% by adding the chemo. I have two thoughts. One is I seem to be a wuss. I fear I will not tolerate chemo well, although it's only 5 months. My other, very divergent thought is I wouldn't want to look back later at this one chance to stop it at early stage, and regret I didn't do all I could to fight for myself.. I know there are no guarantees. Sorry this has been so long.

You may be confusing Taxotere with Taxol, which I have read here on bco is 10 times LESS TOXIC (than Taxotere, though dosing would have to be taken into consideration). I am not a doc, or a nitpicker by nature, but CT is most definitely not chemo lite. Cytoxin is also sometimes confused with Carpoplatin, also not as toxic.

There will be information, correct information, caring, and a safe place to vent during each step of your way. I am so sorry. It is very hard to keep yourself together, and I know you want to protect your child. I agree with the others. Stay off Dr. Google. Check out this site's Understanding Your Diagnosis, and How To Read Your Pathology Report. In fact, as soon as you are able, obtain for your own file a copy of your path report. Call the place where the biopsy was done and ask to speak to medical records. Pick it up ASAP. It is your information and you should know it backwards and forwards. If you spend your time in this way, focused on what's in front of you now, you can put a very good list of questions together, and make your time with your doctors much higher quality. Make yourself smart, not scared. I said almost the exact same words the day I heard. My whole world changed in 5 minutes. This site has educated me, comforted me, and found me friends that made the waiting a little easier. And it will get better with a treatment plan in place. Mammograms are not 100% in seeing bc. MRIs are much better. You are on the right track. Learn about tumor's \"grade\" , different from stage, and hormone receptor status, HER status. Start a thread on how much to tell young children and when. You are not alone. Don't worry about \"the stage\" of your bc right now. Your doctors will need more information. Read about (here, on bco) and ask if an Oncotype dx test is appropriate in your situation. I hope I'm not overloading you. But you can direct your concerns in a way that will keep your case moving forward, and establish from the beginning that you intend to be a partner in your treatment. It will empower you. Sending you a bottomless bucket of hugs. Katy",

I don't think all MOs order them as a standard protocol, but the insurance issue may deter them. It's the gold standard for ruling out lesions in bone, liver, and lungs. It's really two tests that get run as one, and together they give way more info than either one on its own. The CT is good at picking up lesions, and the PET is good at picking up abnormal, or comparatively rapid activity of sugar uptake in an area. So the two together might mean something, where a result from just one could lead to a false positive, which you don't need. Anyway, this is a very rough layman's explanation. If I have made a mistake, perhaps someone can expand or correct. Mine was clear, and that gave me some comfort. Also, if in the future I present with symptoms, they will always have this record to compare with. I have been thinking of you. I think you are doing an AMAZING job informing yourself and holding together. This waiting is just the worst. Keep in touch here and if you need to vent, let it rip. We all understand. All of us. Please make sure to ask them what not to eat beforehand. For obvious reasons, sugar should be avoided. They didn't mention this to me, and I did eat some stupid thing like a bear claw. Then I found out I shouldn't have and imagined my scan lighting up the room. It was ok, but good to ask what the beforehand food restrictions are at the place you are getting your scan",

It wasn't easy, but I did it. I had no nausea to speak of, but did lose my hair (and it's growing back nicely) I did have very dry eyes during chemo, especially the first week after an infusion. Drops and gel resolved it I had cataracts already starting that my eye dr thought might take years to need sx, but the chemo appears to have accelerated them. I had one surgery last month (easy Peasy and better than new) and the second one is this Friday. I am not worried at all. I joined the thread from the March chemo group right before I started. I never had such a wonderful group of people who truly understood what I was going through. There are no words for the love and support I have felt here on bco. Naturally, I was terrified of chemo, and in our group we saw firsthand how differently we all reacted. I don't regret doing it. As for chemobrain, I believe it is real. I suffered a bit during treatment, but I am 58 and it may have partly been due to age. I tried to stay engaged on these boards, corresponding with family and friends, old and new. Played Scrabble online. I am an avid reader, and I did notice concentration and finishing a book has been hard post-chemo, but it's improving. I honestly don't feel any permanent impairment. I would frankly have rather lost my hair permanently than even a smidgeon of brain power. But that's just me. It didn't happen. It's a decision only you can make. And it's possible that some side effects may not appear until years to come. I am prepared to deal with that later if it comes. I personally did not think I could live with myself if I didn't do everything I could. As it turns out, I did not tolerate Tamoxifen, and my doctors took me off. Hopefully I will do better with an AI. But it has ocurred to me that if I cannot tolerate HT at all, I will be very glad I had done chemo.

I am just jumping in from the March 2015 group to wish all of you smooth sailing in this next part of your journey. Also, I would like to give you all encouragement that you CAN DO THIS! It's not easy, and everyone's experience will be different. But having each other to lean on, rant to, and rally on will mean all the difference in the world. Please feel free to PM me if ever you need a view to the future, or just an ear. I will be here.. Warm hugs to all, Katy",
