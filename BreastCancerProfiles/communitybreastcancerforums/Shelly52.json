I was doing really well moving on with my life post chemo and oops but now am regressing into my old poor me feelings. I'm feeling teary a lot which is not like me. Wow-- what an impact hair has on us women, huh? I wish it wasn't so. I should be grateful that my health is good not being miserable looking in the mirror. Good info on the bone broth remedy. Are you seeing regrowth? If so. How long did it take to start regrowing? I'm getting the thyroid blood test tomorrow. Likely will rule that out as the culprit but I'm glad to check it. MO said to go off Letrozole for 2 weeks and if it helps, I will switch AIs. Thinking that if I start bone broth AND stop Letrozole, how how will I know which change worked? I'm rubbing essential oil in my scalp at night, too. Suggestions? Thanks for listening.",

For me there was really no choice. It began coming out in clumps. I didn't shave mine until the very end - - because i dreaded it so much. But - - when the obvious time came it was during a shower. I finished my shower, went over to the sink and just started cutting. I have a shaver that I used on my son. As much as I dreaded it, by that time I felt a little relieved to get it over with. I wore cotton hats or my wig from then on. I really did get used to it and even liked how quickly I could get ready in the morning. I really hate that you are having to go through this. It really stinks. No doubt about it. Daniell- you WILL get through it and be amazed how strong you really are. Good thing is that taxol is pretty tolerable. It was for me. Wishing you all the best. Hugs to you. ~ Shelly ",

I ended up wearing my wig to the hospital and then when i changed into the hospital gown, I put on a cotton knit cap. I didn't know if they'd let me wear it or not. They never said a word about it and I wore it throughout. They will put a surgical, shower cap looking thing on when you are in surgery anyway. They just put it over my cap. Hope that helps",

I am getting hair growth but I am experiencing a new loss of eyelashes and brows, too. I read somewhere that this is normal because the lashes all came in at the same time and are on the same \"schedule\" so to speak. They have a natural shed period and many will drop on the same timeframe. After a while the dropped lashes will spread out so that we won't notice when we lose one or two at a time. This makes sense to me also I can see the new ones coming in again. I wish I had magic words for your hair. It sounds like you are doing all the right things. The only thing you didn't mention that I do is to run a soft brush or gentle comb over your scalp periodically. When i do it, it makes my scalp tingle bit. I think it draws blood to the scalp. This may or may not be the case but why not, huh? PS. You aredarling with or without hair. ",

Also the texture changes either from curly to straight or vice versa. It's a crap shoot. My hair stylist confirmed that. She even had a client who was all grey before chemo and her hair came back in her natural color! It stayed that way for about a year and then the gray came back. For me, I had colored my hair before I lost it so who really knows what it looked like? I began coloring it again approx six months PFC.",
