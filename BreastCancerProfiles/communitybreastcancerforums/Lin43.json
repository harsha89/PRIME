She shared other info about diet and supplements for the future--to reduce cancer risk--and I will post that here when I have more time. So sorry some ladies are feeling fatigued already. :-( My biggest complaint is warm, pink, kind of tight feeling skin.

      "Content": "May 30, 2013 12:17AM - edited May 30, 2013 12:45AM by Lin43 A bolus is a plastic/gel sheet that they tape down over your chest to draw the radiation closer to the skin's surface. I get the bolus every day--10 days now--and I have a little redness, heat, and tenderness/itching but so far no blistering. Maybe bolus is something that only ladies who had mastectomies get since we have so little tissue between our skin and ribs? Or maybe it depends on where our tumors were located. My RO would like to continue my daily bolus for all 30 treatments if she can. I am a bit scared about that! No, not a bit scared...a lot scared!!!! But meanwhile, I slather on the emu oil. Go idesim! It does feel good to have 10 down but I know what you mean about the red skin and the bolus fears! My RO is so sweet it will be hard to fight her if my skin starts falling off from this bolus treatment. I kind of wish she was louder and nastier instead of quietly vicious (jk, I think). You and I both started Herceptin the first week in December. We can celebrate the end of that once November is over....and hopefully the end of this beast forever!!! But then again, I'm thinking about doing reconstruction next April...... Heart--I am with you. We have to take the perks wherever we get them. The acupuncture was pretty cool. I think I'll ask for it every infusion day. I get Reiki too but am not sure whether or not it helps. Your comment about being a realist hits home. We are tough and we will make it through this, but there is no sugar coating here. I am looking forward to the day when I don't wake up and go to sleep thinking about treatment and cancer. Arghhhh!!! Only two days left this week. The weekend is coming!  Gentle Hugs Linda 10/30 ",

That was very different from last week when she commented that I was holding up well considering I get daily bolus. It is amazing how fast things can change. I have been so diligent in applying creams/gels but my skin is saying that enough is enough! I look like a lobster. I don't want to worry those of you who are not as far along. My doctor says she expected these problems earlier given my daily bolus...most women get bolus every other day or not at all. It is meant to bring the radiation to the surface of the skin. My RO is happy I made it this far without a radiation holiday. I really hope I can finish the last 8 treatments on time and without skin breakdown. It is marginal in several spots. My RO will re-evaluate next week. Meanwhile, I burn and itch and feel like I have fiberglass stuck in some areas of my skin. This too shall pass. I keep telling myself that!!!! I have Percocet on hand if it gets too bad.  Looking forwad to the weekend! We can do this, right?!?!?! Sending healing thoughts to all.

The wound person said I may feel like celebrating in three weeks or so. That is going to be a BIG celebration!!! Those of you just beginning or mid-way through, don't worry. You may sail through.

Closer to healing with each day that passes. Yes!!! For those of you asking why they continue treatment when the skin is breaking down, my skin didn't cause too much pain until 2/3 of the way through, and the last five were boosts which mostly did not hit any breakdown area. My worst problems with breakdown were three days after the end of full radiation, and I am having further problems with that. One of the radiation techs was away for three days, came back, and was very surprised by what she saw. It can happen quickly, but my RO says the skin has an amazing capacity to heal so I am glad I finished instead of taking a rads vacation. I hope those of you who need it can use the Mepilex. Nothing completely fixes rad skin problems except time to heal--all the ointments and pads and moisturizing etc can help you feel better, though. Oh, and don't forget the narcotics if you need them. Ha! I could have so many Percocet by now if I had that problem cuz my RO asked me yesterday if I needed more but I still have many left from surgery so I said no. Cancer changes the way doctors treat you! Congratulations to those of you who are around the halfway point. It goes fast. Before you know it you will be doing the happy dance! Annie Lane--It would really make my day if your RO says you do not need the boosts. You will be fine either way but wouldn't that be a nice gift?!!! Gentle hugs Linda",

My skin broke down quite severely for a couple of weeks, the last week of full rads and first week after. My nurse blamed the daily bolus treatments for contributing to the skin breakdowns. I had prescriptions and was miserable. :( The good news is that I am healing very fast. For two weeks, emu oil was the only thing I could tolerate. Everything else burned like crazy. My skin was so bad that my RO gave me Percocet for pain but amazingly, the emu oil helped so much that I could see positive changes every day and was able to quit the Percocet. I had a skin check today and my nurse was so pleased with the healing. I started this journey last August, and even though I will continue with weekly Herceptin infusions through November, finishing radiation and finally healing from it has given me some much needed joy and relief. I am waiting until November to ring the bell but feel as though a big weight has been lifted from my life. I hope all of you experience the same joy very soon. You can do it!

      "Content": "Jul 16, 2013 11:08AM - edited Jul 16, 2013 11:08AM by Lin43 My RO said that the bolus brings the radiation to the surface and just below the skin. It fools the machine -- which thinks the bolus is a part of us. I tried to think of it directing the radiation where it is needed, instead of deeper inside me. I don't have much tissue left on my chest after mastectomy so the bolus made sure that that tissue got the most radiation. The side effect is that the bolus tends to increase the skin \"burn\". I developed some color right away but initially it would fade overnight. I developed radiation rash during week three and it progressed from there. It was painful from week five; before that it was quite uncomfortable but bearable with tender care. I couldn't wear a bra from week three onward. I used Percocet at night and prescription ointments day and night, but never before radiation (which was at 8:20AM for me). My skin continued to worsen through week seven and then improvement began quickly. Now I look like I stayed in the sun too long. The tightness is currently my major problem (uncomfortable, like a vise) so I will see the physical therapist again soon.  If you can take some time off work towards the end and immediately after radiation, that would be ideal. I am a teacher so I was lucky to be off work this summer. Since I have a son in his 20's I couldn't really walk around the house topless -- but I did hang out topless, spending a bit of time reading in my chair in my bedroom. My dogs were loyal by my side -- but wondering why mom was such a recluse. I wore loose tops both around the house and out.  Some people take a radiation vacation if their skin gets really bad, and return to it weeks later. I was far enough along that I just wanted to finish if at all possible. I hope none of this advice is necessary for any of you new to rads. But hang in there if it gets bad because it gets better very fast. I did have to tell my friends and family that I did not feel like celebrating the day rads was over. I wanted to feel better first. I think they understood when I compared it to having surgery and celebrating the moment you get out of anesthesia. No one does that! If I had minor skin issues an immediate celebration would have been good. I waited a couple of weeks to celebrate and it was so sweet!  Gentle hugs, Linda 30/30 FInished 6/26",

I have had 5 weeks of physical therapy. My mobility is still limited but the hope is that I can now get my arm up far enough for the simulation and radiation. I bought some emu oil and miaderm after reading posts on an earlier radiation board. I think that there are many products that can help keep our skin in better condition--my RO nurse recommended I start using the products before beginning radiation to give my skin a healthy boost before beginning treatment, and then use products three times/day during radiation. I am so happy to find a wonderful support group but so sad that any of us have to be here! Hugs to all, Linda from AZ",

I have discovered a wonderful cooling pad called Frogg Toggs Chilly Pad and sold on Amazon for $13. I am half done with rads and feel a lot of heat, especially several hours after my treatments and in the evenings. I run water over this \"chilly pad\" and lay it over my chest for relief. My RO says it is fine to use. It doesn't drip and I can even put it under my top while I read or watch TV and only get a little wet. I cut mine to fit over my chest better. It is 33 inches long so could probably be wrapped around a \"girl\" for ladies who haven't had a mastectomy. I think it is meant to go around someone's neck when they are outdoors in the heat or playing sports or running. I am going to order more of them for a trip I am planning to the Western Caribbean and Central America in December. That trip will celebrate my completion of  15 months of treatment and I can't wait to go! I have also been apprehensive about rads but the staff is so warm and understanding and here I am half done, finally knowing in my heart that I can do this. I imagine an angel wrapping her wings around me during the zaps and I sometimes bring my own music to play during my sessions. The only problem is that it can be hard to hold still when a song I really like is playing. Ha! I get bolus every day so some of my skin is a bit red, I am feeling fatigue come on--especially later in the day, and I have about a two inch area of itchy radiation rash, but I made it through chemo and the red devil so I WILL make it through this and so will everyone here! Did any of us realize what warriors we would have to be to fight this beast?!?!  Idesim--After today we are 1/2 way there! Yay-yay-yay-yay!!!! And today is my daughter's 25th birthday. She has been a Godsend throughout my bc: adjusting her work schedule to take me to treatments, buying me a flower every Tuesday when I have my Herceptin infusion, preparing food when I've felt icky etc. My husband works 45 miles away so he cannot always be there! My hope is that everyone has people in their life who step up to the plate. Reach out to local friends and family and to people on this board. We are all in this together.

I also have a lot of tightness. I guess it is normal but uncomfortable. I may need physical therapy again when this is all over. I have had 27 bolus treatments, (intentionally directing the radiation at my skin) out of 30 and my doctor knew from the beginning that I would have skin breakdown. She is actually happy it took until this week to develop in a major way. Most of you newcomers will not have bolus or at least not every day so please do not be afraid, ok? I have found emu oil to be very soothing and my doctor thinks it helped me make it this far without a radiation vacation. She was pretty sure I would need one. Now I am using Medihoney, the emu oil, a special dressing, and a prescription from my RO. Now that my skin is compromised, the usual creams/gels burn like crazy. I learned not to use aloe on my broken skin the hard way. Big OUCH! Heart--I share your pain. It is truly horrible, isn't it? My RO gave me a dressing yesterday in addition to my prescription, and I can also tolerate emu oil and medihoney. I am hoping the medihoney shortens the duration of healing. There have been some good reports that it helps with wound healing. It is awfully sticky, though. Percocet has become my friend, especially at night. Don't you wish we could just fast forward to the time when we will be out of this and healed?! Every time I feel sorry for myself, though, I think of the man I see every day who is getting radiation to his esophagus and has horrible sores in his throat. He just had a feeding tube put in and will get it out after he is healed. His cancer is gone but his throat is a mess! Very painful!  I plan to lay low this weekend. My RO is hoping for some improvement by the end of next week. This darn radiation continues to work even after our last treatment so healing can take some time. We will get there, though, right?!!! Gentle hugs, Linda 27/30 (Idesim 9/10ths done!!!!!)",

Could it be the 118 temperatures and the 6% humidity over the weekend? Maybe.... I had a fluid infusion yesterday,because my blood pressure was low when I went in for my Herceptin infusion. I am also a little anemic but not dangerously so. Not sure whether that is from rads or leftover from chemo or ??? It is hard to sort out what causes what, but it does get better with time.  I hope the Biafene makes you more comfortable and helps to heal you further, Heart. This is some bumpy road!!! Good thing the breakdown areas are healing. Those are so painful! Hang in there everyone. Keep moisturizing and ask for help if you are uncomfortable or in pain. I am still amazed by how easily my center dispenses narcotics. When I had a back issue in the past they guarded it and dished pills out in very small quantities.

They did have some taped marks outside the radiation field that remained. They remarked the rest so many times. Take care of your skin however you need to (my emu oil --which I am still using weeks later because it is making my skin silky soft--would get under their tape but they said to keep using it). They will figure out a way to remark you.  GWTF--Glad they will be dropping the top field. That was my worst area also and I was so happy to begin boosts.  Johnetta--The advice to buy some cheap cotton tops is right on. And wearing a tee shirt under a bra has been a solution for a lot of women as the weeks of radiation go on. I threw everything out and am now thinking about donating my scarves from chemo. I bought some really pretty ones but never want to wear them again of course! :\\ Heart--My goodness, you continue to have to deal with so much! This is such a marathon, isn't it? I am not on Tamoxifen--I was ER/PR negative--but I was Her+ so I am continuing with my weekly Herceptin infusions. I have what my doctor calls \"gel joints\" from the Herceptin...kind of like arthritis...and turmeric helps a bit with that. Also, my integrative oncologist has given turmeric her green light. But in your case I would do the same thing and stay away from the turmeric. One thing I have learned the past year is that this beast and the treatments are very complex--no easy answers. I am returning to physical therapy to deal with tightness and range of motion issues. I really like my PT so I am glad to be going back. I hope you get to a state of equilibrium soon.  Welcome all new-comers! You will make it through rads and heal quickly from skin damage and regain your life.

I initially felt so alone and afraid, but that diminished as I moved into treatment and participated on this board.  It is your time to receive all the love and support the universe has to offer.

I sure hope she is right! I get the bolus plastic-y towel thingy each day to bring radiation closer to the surface of my skin. My RO says she wants to do that the whole time if possible. She also said I can most likely expect red skin because of it. Booooo. She banned swimming and sun exposure. I have a raft that holds me above the water (though I can dangle my feet in) and a huge tree that shades the pool, so I plan to enjoy some summer relaxation that way. Living in Phoenix, being in the water is such a huge part of our summer life.  I made a colorful calendar and am crossing off the days. My daughter gave me a CD this morning--Lullaby renditions of Coldplay songs. We listened on the way to radiation and back and it was very soothing.  I am looking forward to meeting with the integrative medicine oncologist on Tuesday. She had great ideas about supplements etc. to help me through chemo. If I learn of anything to help through radiation, I will post it here. :) They gave me aloe to use on the radiated area. I also have an aloe plant off my patio and it does help when I've burned myself on the oven so we'll see. So far I've felt a little heat and I thought I saw some redness, but when I looked at the nonradiated side I saw some redness there also. It may be the temperatures near 100 doing that! The lilacs sound wonderful, Idesim. I can close my eyes and imagine that smell. My jasmine just finished blooming and I miss the sweet scent.  So glad, and a little jealous, that you only have to do 4 weeks, Melody. That is wonderful news!

Thanks sciencegal for educating us on the nerve pain issues. I have 9 out of 30 treatments done and I am turning red on the top half of my chest--just a little pink below and on my side and underarm area.. I feel heat throughout. I get bolus every time so my RO says my side effects will   probably show up sooner. I try to keep telling myself that this radiation will make sure every last nasty cell is destroyed. But I kind of wish I could hibernate the next two months and come out the other side feeling good and with my skin intact. Sigh....  My emu oil is AEA Certified. I don't think the brand makes a difference. I have Clearly Emu and I like the feel of it on my skin, but I don't really expect it to prevent a \"burn\". I also have all the usual products...aloe, calendula, miaderm, aquafor (at night--what a greasy mess, huh?!) etc. These may help ease the soreness anyway.  Idesim--Tomorrow we will be 1/3 of the way done! Yay!!! I have to say I am disappointed that I already have skin problems, though, and that burning feeling. Now my goal is to keep the side effects from getting too bad. It would be hard to have to break treatment and return.  Heart--Sorry to hear about your pain. I hope the inflammation calms down for you. I am jealous of your center. I go to MD Anderson in AZ and I had acupuncture after my Hereptin infusion today but we don't get any extra goodies for radiation.  Gentle hugs to all, Linda 9/30",

We are over 100 here in AZ and it is bad enough feeling wet given that antiperspirants are banned, but I sure wouldn't want to try to get by with no deodorant at all. That would be inhumane. :/ sciencegal--Radiation also creeps me out more than chemo did, though the red devil was a close second. There is something very creepy about red chemo and red pee....

The nodes drain into successive areas so it is important to know how far the malignancy may have gone when determining radiation. If there is any indication that those nodes up high could have been/or still are positive, then they radiate there. My RO did not radiate that high on me because the indication was that those nodes had never been positive. At least one node further down had been positive before chemo so my underarm is getting hit. It all gets very complicated and it is ok to not always want all the information. It can feel overwhelming. And while there always has to be some trust in our medical team, they do need to answer any questions we have because it is our body so ultimately the treatment decisions are ours. Cricketsandfrogs--I teach flute so I understand your concern for wind. My breathing has held up well through chest radiation, 27/30 done, but my RO said pleurisy can be a complication, usually two or more months in the future.

I wear a camisole or nothing at all (feels best) on top. Bras will not work at this point. Those of you just starting, chances are you will do fine and maybe get pink. My RO said I'd get quite red with the treatment she was doing so I had fair warning. Still, I'd rather this than the chemo. Red Devil was a devil and I still have neuropathy from the Taxotere. Keep slathering on your moisturizer of choice even if you don't yet have any skin damage. You will do fine. It goes very fast! Good to hear PT is helping GoWithTheFlow. I also felt so much better once the cording was worked out. Now I am very tight from the rads. I will see my PT in a week or two. Hard to do all my stretches now that my skin is compromised but I have confidence that it will be fine in the not too distant future. Gentle hugs to all, Linda 27/30",

Shortly thereafter I decided to go \"topless\". I was headed out with my husband and he asked if I was going to get a wig or scarf, and I paused and said \"no\"! He said no wig or scarf? And I said \"no nothing\" and headed out. Bless his heart, he trotted out after me and has never said a word about my hair. Now, four months after chemo, I get compliments from strangers about my hair cut. It is pretty funny cuz it isn't a cut, it's a grow-out! I just smile and say thank you.;-) Hang in there cuz sometime soon you will be able to ditch the wig and feel the freedom. Carolyn--Thank you for your kind words. I hope your pain subsides a bit. My integrative medicine oncologist put me on 1200mg. of Turmeric (with black pepper in it) for my pain. It took about two weeks and then I felt a bit better--much more manageable. My pain is from the Herceptin that I will be infused with through November. It affects some women this way--others not. We are all unique, that is for sure. Soteria--You are onto something with the zinc oxide. My son is doing pharmacy school and the pharmacist he works with also mentioned putting mylanta in aquaphor (my son recommended swishing mylanta and children's liquid benedryl for my chemo mouth sores and it helped!). Another recommendation for the skin is something called Calmoseptine, for after rads is over, though. It is fairly thick, has zinc oxide and menthol (for pain relief) and you don't have to remove it if you aren't doing rads. You may have to ask a pharmacist as some keep it behind the counter but it doesn't need a prescription. I guess it is hard to remove so you just leave it on through showers and such and it heals the skin and wears off on its own. I can't wait until tomorrow is over and I can put whatever I want on my skin! No more worry about \"metals\". Hang in there, Heart. You are armed and ready to combat whatever your skin throws at you now. We will move beyond this! I got a card today from a friend that says,\"Wouldn't it be nice if life were like a DVD...and you could fast forward through crummy times! Hang in there!\" Here's hoping we are all hanging in there just a little bit longer! Gentle hugs to all, Linda 29/30 Idesim and Carolyn!!! One more day of rads for the three of us!",

I finished my boost rads 2 weeks ago and my full chest rads 3 weeks ago. I had a lot of skin breakdown even though I stayed moisturized. I am happy to say that I was released from the rads nurse skin checks a couple of days ago because she is confident that I am now healing well. Biafene and Percocet were my friends the last week and first week after rads. Emu oil was the only non-prescription I could tolerate near the end as the others burned horribly. I am still using emu oil to help with the tightness I have from rads. One day at a time, and even if it gets really bad, it will get better. The heat is lessening though the tightness remains. I will be seeing the physical therapist again to work my chest/shoulder/arm as I did before rads. You can do this and come out the other side knowing that your chance of recurrence is now lower than it was 6 weeks ago. Hang in there! Gentle Hugs to all, Linda 30/30 Finished 6/26",

Won't be long now until many of you join the rads survivors club.  Sharon--I undestand your fear because my RO told me the same thing since I was getting the bolus each time to bring the radiation to the surface of my skin. And maybe it won't get that bad. But know that there is an end to whatever breakdown you have. \"Heart\" and I finished rads a few weeks ago (last week of June) and we both had some serious skin breakdown. It seemed at the time that it would never end, but we are healing very quickly now. Also, you and I made it through Adriamycin, Cytoxin and Taxol...we can make it through rads. Think of it as the last step in the trio of treatment: chemo, surgery, and rads. You are 2/3rds done with the heavy stuff! I think that I cried more during rads than during chemo or surgery...the months of treatment just wear you down. So give yourself permission to feel blue sometimes. These treatments are a marathon. But there is an end, and it is so sweet when you turn the corner and see your skin begin to improve! Really sweet!! I went from crying to laughing with joy pretty fast.  Clyday--My experience was the same as Hearts...continued breakdown for a week and then fast improvement. Hang in there. The end is in sight! My advice for anyone starting out with rads is to immediately speak up about any discomfort/pain you experience and ask for medication to help you. I had prescriptions for my skin and Percocet for the pain--that really helped me sleep at night. As my skin got worse, I could still use emu oil but the other over the counter remedies burned terribly. I went topless or with a very loose top as much as possible at home. Camis under a shirt might work when you have to go out.  I was bandaged like a wounded soldier when I finished rads, with gauze wrapped around me, holding the medicine in place. I just started wearing a bra again a few days ago and it is still a bit uncomfortable, but my skin is now intact and improving each day. And I am still using the emu oil along with other moisturizers.  Would I do rads again knowing that my skin would get this bad...YES! The long term gain is too great not to put up with the short term problems. Hang in there. The time will pass, you will heal, and you will have peace of mind knowing that you did everything you can to decrease the odds of recurrence.

I have been yawning more than usual the past few weeks...like I need more oxygen. Energy is up a bit though not at pre-rad levels. My RO says give it up to three months to feel like pre-rads. As long as I am improving I am feeling ok about it. My integrative medicine oncologist recommended astragalus post-rads so I am taking that for immunity. She also recommends ashwaganda and a serving of broccoli, cauliflower, or arugula daily. And she likes tumeric, flax, kimchi, mushrooms... I love my appointments with her.

I also had clear margins and thought I might get away without doing rads but it was high grade, in my nodes and multifocal so here I am. I get the bolus every day and have had a slight pinkness in some areas but so far it goes away by the next morning. I just finished 3/30 -- one tenth of the way done. I did chemo for six months and am doing Herceptin but somehow the thought of radiation bothers me even more. Perhaps it is because I had what my oncologist said was an amazing response to chemo and the best post mastectomy pathology possible, and I really thought I would be done (except for the year of Herceptin). I am so thankful for the good pathology but wow, this is such a marathon!   I slather on the gel and like the idea of the tank under the bra. I saw a study that said that calendula may help with radiation dermatitis. Here is the link: www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/herb/calendula. Looking forward to enjoying the weekend off. And next weekend we have Memorial Day off as well. I know that the more days off the longer this will drag on, but don't we all need days when we don't have to drive to the cancer  center and get zapped! Gentle hugs to everyone Linda",

I am trying -- not very successfully -- to picture warm healing rays. Arghhhh!!! Love your picture ChickaD. We need bright and cheerful here. I went shopping and bought myself two very lightweight and soft cotton shirts yesterday--lime green and hot pink. The colors make me smile and they are cooler with the tank under them than a lot of my other clothes. After Tuesday, we will be 1/6th of the way done, Idesim. Sorry to hear some ladies are experiencing fatigue already. Will your doctors allow you to take any supplements--B12 or ?  I never know whether to blame my symptoms on radiation or Herceptin or just plain tuckered out from months of treatment!  Arghhhhh again!!!

It itches a bit and burns sometimes. I have heard of women who get red early on and then don't get any worse for the rest of radiation. Hope that is us! I also work from home and I spent part of Friday topless--I just have to remember not to answer the door that way. Ha! I read that some of the radiation dermatitis is a histamine reaction. Would taking anti-histamines help? Something to ask the RO..... Stay cool somehow. My RO said I can put a damp towel on my chest or even a baggie with ice as long as I have something between the ice and my skin. It is 108 and dry here today. The forecast is the same all week. At least my rads are at 8:20 am. A friend just called from Boston saying it is 90 and humid there. As my RO said on Thursday, summer is a hard time to be doing rads!!

I can't remember a time when I looked forward to weekends as much as I do right now!  I can relate to the sudden fatigue. I can be sitting at the computer one minute and feel the urgent need to lie down the next. Or my legs suddenly feel very heavy! So far it hits me later in the day so I am still good when I go to rads in the morning. And I teach private flute lessons in the morning so am ok for work. It is weird, though, that sudden bone-tired feeling! The techs and doc worked on me today to draw on the marks for the boosts that I will get the last five treatments. I now have red, purple, blue, and green lines on me. Quite the sight! They told me that tattoos used to be done all the time to provide a permanent mark showing where rads had been done, but now that we have everything elecronic, tattoos aren't done as often or done everywhere. They do set me up very quickly for rads with all these marks, but the cream/oil I use plays some havoc with them. They have a clear tape that they can use for problem areas and don't seem to mind redoing my marks often. My doc says that my skin is holding up well considering I am getting the bolus every time. I joked that my skin goes from a rose' in the morning to a cabernet in the evening and back to a rose' the next morning. She gave me permission to use hydrocortisone on the itchy area.  The very best to all of you starting out. It gets less scary and I have to say that the past three weeks/my first half of treatment have gone by fast. Over the half-way mark! Yes!!! Hugs to all Linda 16/30",

I also have arthritis and have found that Turmeric capsules (with black pepper for better absorption) help relieve inflammation. My integrative medicine oncologist recommended Gaia brand, 1 to 1 1/2 grams/day. Not sure if you can take that much during rads. I have had what they call \"gel joints\" from Herceptin (some women get this side effect) and the turmeric has lowered my pain as much as the Percocet did.  I am quite red...blasted daily Bolus...and I have an itchy radiation rash area, but my RO and the techs say I look better than they expected. I told them that my skin starts the day looking like a rose', then turns into a merlot and then finally a cabernet by nightfall. A fine wine, indeed! Ha!!! Eight more right chest and axillary treatments and then five boosts to my mastectomy scar. I have an internal fire going on that drives me nuts and I am very tight so I keep stretching my arm/chest area to relieve that. My coolpad is great! It has been 110 here this weekend and using it cools me right down. I had a good weekend regardless of my skin bothering me. I went to a Downton Abbey Tea at the library yesterday and won the trivia contest so I get \"tea for eight\" as a prize. And a lady at the tea told me she likes my \"haircut\". SHe doesn't know it is growing out from chemo--it is only an inch+ long but is coming in thick. But anyway, the tea had yummy food and such pretty tea china. Wish I could invite you ladies. I will drink the tea in honor of all of you, though!!! Tea is good for us, right?!  Will you be ringing the bell when you finish radiation? I pass it going in every day, but I still have 5 months of weekly Herceptin infusions after radiation so I don't really feel like I am finished ... though the Herceptin is to reduce recurrence and my pathology was good after chemo and surgery. So am I a bc survivor or a bc patient or what???

I have reached my limit and the pain never relents so another area torn apart was just too much to bear. I understand your horror at being told your boost area will break down quickly now, Heart, especially since you were thinking that you are almost done with these horrific complications. Last night, to try to escape my current painful physical state, I took my Percocet, my melatonin, and headed to bed at 7:30. Then I took another Percocet when I woke up after 11. Right now I will do whatever I can to reduce pain. My friends all tell me what a great attitude I have had through all my treatment, and I am usually tough but sometimes the tears just have to flow. The level of pain from skin breakdown has taken me by surprise, and the fear of what may still happen is very real. I don't know why you have broken down this much, Heart. :-( My RO expected me to have major problems given my daily bolus but you weren't expecting such problems, were you? Anyone who says they did great because they moisturized the \"right\" way really doesn't know what they are talking about because skin breakdown is so individual -- all the moisturizing in the world may or may not help. No one should fear or feel overly confident about what their radiation experience will be like. Most make it through without too much difficulty. I have had three boosts so far over an area that is 2\" by 10\".The area has become angry red and swollen. Granted, it was red before the boosts but the swelling is sudden and the color is now like a cabernet. I am broken down above and on the top edge of the boost area--I don't know how I can handle more breakdown in this area. I have an infusion after radiation tomorrow. I'll be wearing a loose top with nothing underneath. A bra with prosthesis just isn't possible right now. The looseness of my top will hide my uniboober status a bit but like Melody's sister, I could deck someone if they made a comment about anyone's post-cancer physical appearance! They should be counting their blessings and be extra polite to some one who they think might have just been through treatment. You are a warrior Melody! Hold your beautiful head up high and be proud!!! I lost my hair with chemo and now that it is four months later, I get loads of compliments on my hair cut. HA ! I think I just wrote a \"book\".

The way I hurt now, celebration is the last thing on my mind. Sure I am glad that rads is done, but my non-radiated area deteriorated worse during the boosts and I know the boost area can very well deteriorate in the days to come.

I also did the dose dense AC and just finished Taxol, and I have the white thin hair going with the very sparse eyebrows and eyelashes. Not a look I want to keep indefinitely. Ha! I actually shaved the back of my neck today because I'm looking too much like a bald man with a hairy neck. Weird how it grows back in. Thanks for helping me to look ahead 6 weeks or so to some colored hair and eyelashes/eyebrows! It has been over 5 months now and I really miss my hair!

I understand you wondering how you will get through all of this because I felt the same way when I was diagnosed last August. At that time, each day seemed to be the new \"worst day of my life\". It did get better. My treatment plan has been similar to your plan in duration, but I started with the chemo (back in early September) and I will do surgery on March 6, most probably radiation later March, and then continue with Herceptin infusions for another year. I also have to wait on reconstruction because they would rather do that 3-6 months after radiation to let me heal from all of the treatments. It seemed so overwhelming at first, but my doctor is a \"one step at a time\" kind of guy and I have tried to follow his lead. Now I have to say that I have been surprised how fast the past six months of treatment have gone.  Many women get prescriptions for anti-anxiety medications (I have Ativan) or anti-depressants or sleeping pills (I'll be getting those to use pre-surgery). My doctor's physician's assistant encourages patients to take medication to make the road smoother. We heal better when we can relax and sleep. So don't be afraid to ask for help. I think it is often hard for us mothers to let others step in when we have often been the glue that holds the family together. Friends, family, kids...they can all do their part in helping mom to heal. I tell people to picture me healthy instead of focusing on the disease. This is a great message thread for March surgeries so I am so glad you found us. You will also find message threads for chemotherapy and radiation that will help you through those treatments.  Maureen -- Thanks again for updating the surgery list. Keke -- You will be in all of our thoughts on Friday. Godspeed! Hugs to Everyone, Linda",

Shari, I am with you on the radiation. My Onc hasn't committed to it yet, though my surgeon strongly thinks there will be radiation. I had positive nodes before chemo and am grade 3 so I especially want to throw whatever they have available at this. For me, another day of pre -surgery tests and doc visits tomorrow.

Triple negative refers to estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR) and Her2 status. Pathology reports include this information and treatment is tailored to your particular pathology. For example, my cancer was ER-, PR-, and Her2+. I did chemo for 6 months and will have to go for a year of weekly infusions of a drug called Herceptin because I am Her2+. It is amazing how specific treatment can be for each of us depending on our pathology. I had positive nodes before my chemo and am now clear. If you need chemo it will be tailored to your pathology. Good luck with your oncologist appointment. I ask my oncologist every question on my mind and he is very patient and kind. We are all thrown into this world suddenly and have to learn as we go. Never feel that you \"should\" know something because this is all so complicated. Hang in there. A treatment plan will give you some peace of mind.",

I had my first radiation treatment this morning and discovered that my RO is using bolus every time to focus the radiation closer to the surface of my skin. The tech told me the doc will stop when I develop a skin reaction. Hmmmm..... I meet with her tomorrow morning and will clarify that. There is so much to learn for all of us--first chemo, then surgery and now this for me. I am tired of the whole routine as I am sure many of you are. I was saddened to see a very sick woman in the radiation waiting area today, receiving palliative radiation for stage 4 esophageal cancer. Any time I start feeling sorry for myself I have to remember that it could be so much worse. I am making a special colorful calendar so I can cross off the days as I complete them. My daughter suggested that I get a little treat to celebrate making it through each day. She is coming up with all sorts of inexpensive and free ideas and goodies. So sweet. :-) I bet many of us are facing the choices of DIEP or lat flap after radiation. I go to MD Anderson for my care and neither plastic surgeon I spoke with will do expanders if radiation is to follow, though I have heard of it done elsewhere. I also know of women who have had DIEP and are very happy with the results but wow... the thought of that major surgery is overwhelming to me right now. I won't be facing any decision until early next year as I already had my mastectomy without expanders. The doctor left \"dog-ears\" for reconstruction. I feel for you,  Tinkerbellzcharm--so much to think about and tough decisions to be made at such a stressful time. I hope you get the answers you need to make the decision that is best for you. Heart2930--I am happy you will have a breath hold apparatus to help protect your heart. So cool! I also miss my Secret. I have Tom's and may try the Sephora that slv58 recommended. I live in the Phoenix area and we are coming up to our hottest month. At least my head with its baby hair growing in won't get cold! Idesim--We have one down! Check it off the calendar and treat yourself to something good.  ChickaD--I am still having burning two months after surgery. It may be hard to separate this from the radiation burning feelings. Sigh Nancy--Hope you continue to do well. I don't have tattoos but I have so many marker lines including a new red one that goes way up around the top of the chest wall treatment area. It looks like a stripe from an awful wound or something, so I am trying to wear tops that button high to hide it. Not good timing given that it is summer. Oh well... Hugs to everyone Linda ",

So, out of the next 11 days, we will only be getting radiation on 6 of them. That is doable. I get pink/red and then it fades a bit by the next morning.

We were all battle weary before this weren't we, so this is extra tough! Sydneyluv--The savi device sounds interesting. We have all learned so much going through this... I had a caramel ribbon crunch Starbucks this morning. Caffeine!!! I am also drinking a lot of water to keep hydrated. My onc said to do whatever I need to get by these next few weeks. I am taking B vitamins and hoping they help a bit.  Here are some recommendations from my integrative oncologist for breast cancer patients who are post-radiation and chemo:  Nature's Way Ashwagandha--vegetarian capsules in a purple capped bottle and available at Walgreens. Nature's Way Astragalus--also available at Walgreens  Gaia Herbs Turmeric Supreme (with black pepper)--for inflammation and these can be taken during radiation and beyond. Pickled foods--Deli pickles, Kimchi etc. She says not to overdo it but there is evidence that they help keep our bodies in balance.  She also referred me to the nutritionist, the exercise physiologist, and the acupuncturist so I'll share anything I learn from them. She is interested in treating the whole patient so I am excited about learning new things to keep me healthy in the future. I have met my copays and coinsurance so these services will be free. Yay....I guess.....though I do not want to reach these levels of medical bills ever again! Much rather spend the money on a cruise or something!!! Hugs Linda",

This morning I took a deep breath during rads and heard the tape they use to hold my bolus down go pop, pop, pop. Then a deep voice came over the speaker telling me to hold still please. I hope the rads were ok. No more deep breaths for me! Sorry your burns are causing trouble, Heart. I am red and also have an itchy area but not really pain. Just heat...

So now I am picturing the missing skin as cancer, even though my post surgery pathology was clear, and I am trying to be glad the treatment is doing its job. Mind games, huh! And how very frustrating for you, IamNancy!!! My heart skipped a beat when I read your post. I will try to think positive - - that your new cream will soothe you, and the boosts won't cause further problems for you. Geez!!!! Idesim--We are 14/15ths done with treatment. I hope the week after doesn't push us over any more edges. I have had it with this. Time to put it behind us and move on toward healing. Gentle hugs to all Linda 28/30",

I declare dark chocolate covered almonds to be a  health food!  I remember the pink fading away overnight early on. Hoping that it will keep doing that for you, Carol. Happy weekend!  Those fat rolls and lumps do get hit hard. My dog ear under my arm that they left for reconstruction was unhappy the second half of rads but is hurting less today. And as painful as I still am, I do see signs of healing in the areas that haven't been radiated for 8 days. Like Heart, I have that cruddy dead skin smell going, though. Yuck!! Ok...this too shall pass.  I had a bad reaction to one of the meds they gave me for healing so I am back to emu oil as it is the only thing my skin likes right now. Aloe burns, aquaphor burns, calendula burns, miaderm burns, silvadene burns, arghhh!! But the good news is that I see signs of healing 8 days out from my last full radiation so I will stick with the Domeboro soaks and emu oil. Skin reaction is such an individual thing.  Happy Weekend to all! I think the radiation departments around Phoenix must have left their doors open, though, because highs are predicted to be 120 this weekend. Why do I live here? Not because of the nutty wild west politics , but cuz I love the desert and the mountains and the sunsets and the beautiful hikes ... just not in the summer! Time to fill the bird bath--poor babies will be mighty hot and thirsty this weekend!  Gentle hugs, Linda",

Maybe if you tell your RO you will be sure it is off, he will ok it. I had bolus every day to bring the radiation to the surface of my skin (they wanted to fry me) and I am convinced that I would have needed a rads vacation if not for the emu oil. Most women do fine without it, though, so don't worry. I have heard good things about glaxol. Welcome aboard. It will go fast! Donna--A perk from your recent mastectomy, huh? Numbness. So glad you cannot feel it! I was very surprised and really rather scared by how much I hurt from my skin breakdown. Here's hoping that four days off will help you get through the last few treatments better.  Heart--So you cannot use the creams/salves either. We are so very tender right now, aren't we? And my nurse said the same thing about the smell. Hmmm... I first noticed it one morning when I woke up and noticed this yucky smell, and I thought it was one of my dogs having got into something gross...or something dead! Lo and behold, it was me. I cannot stand yucky smells!!! I think olfactory is my best sense, so arghhh!!! Maybe it will be gone soon and in the meantime, bring on the Mepilex.  Happy weekend to all! Linda",

I was accessing this site from my phone and putting the dates into my phone calendar, but it is getting overrun with dates so now I will print it out hard copy and add more if necessary. I also feel an increased level of stress. For me, my suddenly full calendar of additional medical appts and tests is a constant reminder of what is to come in early March. The bright spot on my calendar is my weekly Reiki appointment. :) I wish there was a button that we could turn off when we get really anxious. I guess that is what Ativan is for, but I am going to ask the surgeon for a prescription sleep aid when I see her next week. The time released melatonin dosen't cut it lately. And while people around me are celebrating my completion of 6 months of chemo, I feel like I have a whole new set of possibilities to stress over. Arghhh!!! Also I don't feel like chemo is really over since I'll be back at infusion next week for a triple dose of Herceptin, and my nurse says I may get flu-like side effects from that. It is what it is. :/ I am very glad for Herceptin, though--I had a dream where one of my heart tests came out poorly so I couldn't take Herceptin as planned this year and I woke up crying. Emotions are definitely on edge! jrose-- You and I will both be in surgery on the 6th, huh? I just got a call telling me to be at the hospital at 6am! I guess I am the first surgery of the day. I hope you don't need chemo, but if it will help with your outcome then it is well worth doing. I had my hair cut a bit shorter before I began AC chemo. Two weeks after chemo started it came out by the handful so I shaved it short myself. Drugs are different from one another in their effects on the hair so it depends on what you may be taking. Someone told me not to shave my hair to the scalp, so I left some stubble that has come and gone over the months, and now I have fine downy white fuzz. People tell me that is usually the first step in getting hair back. I have a wig that I wear when I want to blend in someplace, and I wear pretty scarves to the cancer center. The nurses and doctors always comment favorably on my colorful head coverings, and it really makes me feel better to have something pretty on my head, especially since my eyebrows, lashes etc. are sparce and my face gets a bit puffy from chemo. If you end up doing chemo, Headcovers.com has some very nice options for scarves etc. I now have to head to the center for a post-surgical garment. This is getting close. Sending good thoughts up for all of us, Linda",

I lost my mom to cancer in 1996, a long time ago but how I have missed her these past 7 months. We also had such good chats. It sounds as though we were both very lucky to have them as our moms even if they were taken too soon. The Herceptin is inflaming my muscles and joints so I can commiserate with you on the aromatase inhibitor. I wake up as a 90 year old lady but feel better after moving around a bit. I also cannot sit too long without tightening up. It is still better than the chemo was, though! I have never been flexible in my shoulders. It is a genetic thing in my family that even the kids can't lift their arms straight up. But I am glad to be going to the PT on Friday. I will continue trying the wall walk and have also tried using a folded towel to slide up the wall. One inch at a time. Ha! Gentle hugs Linda",

      "Content": "Mar 31, 2013 10:41AM - edited Mar 31, 2013 10:42AM by Lin43 Happy Easter! I love Maureen's comment about Easter being a time to be reborn as survivors! Happy Spring! Also a time to be reborn, and the warmer weather can help to ease the aches and pains. I had a busy week! :/ My axillary nodes excision resulted in \"cording and webbing\" under my arm and down to my elbow. It feels like painful rubber bands and super glue. No wonder it has hurt so much to lift/move my arms! The physical therapist made some progress breaking down some of the hard tissue at my first appointment on Friday and I have two more appointments scheduled this week and probably more the next. She says that some women develop this--the therapy hurts -- she says to take a Percocet beforehand-- but I am very motivated to clear this up. I need to start radiation soon and cannot lift my arm. At least my nodes were benign after the AC and Taxol chemo so the radiation will be to the chest wall and lower axillary, not the supraclavicle area. Meanwhile I get weekly Herceptin infusions (through November,,,ugh!) because the dose every three weeks was too much for me to handle--my blood pressure fluctuated very high and very low and heart rate skyrocketed. Anyone who has problems with the Herceptin or other chemo drugs can try changing the schedule and infusion rate to see if that helps. Wishing everyone strength and healing in April. We made it through March and are one step closer to bring done with this journey!!! Gentle hugs to all, Linda",

I developed cording and webbing after surgery, severely hindering my range of motion and causing lots of additional pain, and my PT has been a Godsend. She has the sweetest temperament (like Georgette on the 1970's Mary Tyler Moore show) but she massages, stretches, and works the problem areas hard. She recommends that I take 1/2 Percocet before treatment and it is very doable. She is also a lymphadema expert so I will be learning lymphatic massage from her since I had my axillary nodes removed. Don't hesitate to ask for PT if you need it. She has also given me a whole new set of exercises to do at home; exercises specific to my particular needs. I am finally feeling a bit better!  One thing I've learned since my diagnosis in August: our medical teams can make it all much more tolerable. To those of you facing chemo, speak up for what you need and it is very doable. I now thank those drugs for saving my life because I had a very aggressive, rare form of breast cancer and had a complete clinical response. I am 6 weeks out from my last Taxol and some nails are still turning blackish and I still have some neuropathy, but I have to think that this too shall pass. Next step radiation, Herceptin ongoing for a year and then, finally, reconstruction. My husband and I are planning a cruise between Herceptin and reconstruction. We will need that time to decompress. As patients we get knocked down but at the same time we often amaze ourselves by how we get up again and go on. There are days when we feel hopeless, helpless etc. Reaching out online and to friends and family is so important for our mental health! Thank you once again Maureen for holding us all together in our healing journey. What a great bunch of ladies! People who have not traveled this road have no idea of the strength of those of us who are walking it one day at a time, one foot in front of the other.  Love and gentle hugs to all, Linda",

As much as family and friends try so very hard to be supportive, we all know that there are some deep emotions that they cannot fully understand. Sharon and Leigh, thank you for sharing that you too have both fear and anticipation for your surgery. My docs are talking about tummy tuck/reconstruction surgery for me if I want it six months or so in the future. They say there is enough for one B cup. Weird conversations we all have with doctors and others these days huh?! I told my husband that I'd like to be a bear and hibernate until this is all done. They can even give birth that way -- sounds good to me! And Maureen, I will be sending my best thoughts for all aspects of your surgery to go well on March 4th. Karrie with her young kids has other considerations -- she will need extra help and support for herself and her youngsters. My \"youngsters\" are 24 and 27 and have both signed on to help their dad nurture me. And Shari isn't too far behind the rest of us for surgery since her chemo is also finishing soon. These last Taxol infusions cannot come soon enough for me. I may have to face radiation after surgery. I know there is support for that on this site also. What did BC patients do before the Internet? Warmth and wishes for as good a week as possible for all of us! Linda",

All I can see are some narrow white tape/steri strips (no real bandages) and one visible stitch where the drain comes out on my side. I hope your surgeon does it the same way because there is nothing scary or gross. I basically look like a guy on that side of my chest with some extra loose skin left for reconstruction six months after radiation is done. Pat--So sorry for your crazy mix up. Our emotions and anxiety are already all over the place, plus we are juggling personal and family schedules. We really don't need our medical teams confusing things further. I hope it gets worked out right away so you can move forward without additional stress!!! 2girls-2 spaniels--with your negative nodes and margins, what chemo are they talking about doing?

Kap-My drain is painful tonight too and I also have to wait until Tuesday. That will be just about two weeks too long for me and this drain! Koru--I will be thinking of you on Monday. I had to smile at your Wizard of Oz description. Perfect! I did 6 months of chemo first (am very fortunate to now have clear nodes and margins due to chemo success), then surgery last week, possibly radiation (will find out soon about that), and for sure continued Herceptin. I've had my port since August. Not sure what I will do when it is finally removed. Perhaps we could use it in some sort of modern art piece. ;) Lovinmylife--I am sending many warm thoughts your way. I will never forget the first hours and days of my diagnosis. I was devastated, and every time I tried to get up I felt knocked down again as I learned how serious my diagnosis was. I also had cancer in the nodes, grade 3 multifocal tumors etc. But here I am today, and after 6 months of chemo I have clear nodes. I just had a mastectomy, may still need radiation, and will be getting weekly Herceptin infusions until December, but I have learned how powerful and how specific today's cancer treatments are. Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA) does have a great reputation for treating breast cancer, especially if you need/want alternative treatment. I live in the Phoenix area, and we have a CTCA on the far west side and an MD Anderson and Mayo Clinic on the east side. I went with MD Anderson because it is close to me, has a great reputation, and I really like my oncologist. Your oncologist can be a strong source of support and encouragement. Mine has soothed me many times over the past seven months while taking my treatment one step at a time, always remembering that I am a person with a life apart from and beyond the cancer. I also have weekly Reiki sessions which I love, and I believe in the power of complimentary modalities. My next task is learning everything I can to make my body a bad host for cancer. I will share what I learn on this board. Please be kind to yourself, try to take it one day at a time, accept that we cannot always be/feel positive or strong, and know that the worst days do not last forever.",

As with some of the lafies here, the plan is to continue the Herceptin for a year. I hope we all tolerate any post-chemo drugs well. I also bought a pillow wedge and a leg wedge. I figure they will be helpful after my mastectomy on the 6th, and then again in the future when I have reconstruction. My breast surgeon has been talking up a plastic surgeon who does what I believe is called DIEP. She is fairly sure that I'll need radiation so they want to wait on reconstruction. I will look for the post surgery list on this board. Helpful ideas from women who have been here and done this are so valuable. I send good thoughts up to the heavens for all of us before I go to sleep each night. I can tell that surgery is getting near for me because of my suddenly busier calendar of tests, doctor visits, lymphedema specialist consult, post-mastectomy garment appointment etc. Won't it be a gift when our time isn't taken up in waiting rooms and tests and medical consults?!?!?
