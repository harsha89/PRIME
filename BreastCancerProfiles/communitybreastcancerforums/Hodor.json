It happened again last week, so I did a self exam and found a pea sized lump under my areola at about the 3 o'clock position. After my doctor felt it, I was sent for a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound, which showed absolutely nothing. Now what am I supposed to do? I just turned 50, no family history of breast cancer. My doctor thought it felt like a cyst, but I am post menopausal..is that possible, and, if so, why wouldn't it show up on ultrasound? It doesn't hurt when I press on it, but there is a general ache in the area. Very frustrated and worried. Thanks. Log in to post a reply",

Reading your responses has strengthened my resolve to push hard for additional testing...thank you so much for taking the time to respond to my questions with your stories, I am so grateful! I'll update my thread when I know more, still waiting for my doctor to return my call. Thank you!",

My doctor referred me to a breast surgeon and I have an appointment with her next Tuesday, so, only a week to wait. I hope she will take a biopsy that day and I won't have to wait for yet another appointment? Not sure how they needle biopsy something they can't see on ultrasound, though it is palpable and not too deep..maybe they will just cut me open and take it out! Again, thank you all for sharing your stories, it has been so helpful for me!  ",

Just to update, I saw a breast surgeon before Christmas; she said my lump did not feel like anything worrisome, and wanted to see me in three months. My lump is still smooth, round, firm, and it seems unchanged in size. Today I decided I want it taken out regardless (too many stories of misdiagnosis to feel confident in the surgeon's assessment!) and have another appointment with her next week to review the surgical information. As the lump is palpable, I was hoping it could be removed with a local anesthesia? Either way, I want this thing out! It is making me nervous that it doesn't move at all, but seems firmly rooted in place. I can't stop touching the hateful thing, ugh...",

Yes, my breasts are heterogeneously dense, so not the \"worst\" category of dense, but in category 3 of the 4 categories, the 50-75% category. So this has me worried; what if something is there but they just can't see it? I am waiting for another call from my doctor. I would prefer to just get the lump taken out instead of the mri, but we'll see. Not sure why the ultrasound wouldn't pick something up, though....the transducer was right over the lump, the tech could also feel the lump and was puzzled why it wouldn't show up. Thanks.",
