Because I am Diabetic as well, my risk of infection and peripheral neuropathy are both increased. As I understand it through my Oncologist and research - the advantage of weekly Taxol - less risk of blood abnormalities and the need for granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (which saves money) but with an increased risk of Neuropathy. Taxol every two weeks - requires the support of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor but less risk of Neuropathy and is completed sooner - costs more money. The first study involved 12 week Taxol at a lower dose vs. 6 dose dense treatments every 2 weeks. The researchers decided on 6 treatments to make the doses ultimately the same. Efficacy was the same in either arm of the study. Another study later decreased the dose dense(every 2 weeks) to 4 doses. They found the efficacy of 4 doses vs. 6 doses to be the same. So, I finally decided with my Oncologist to go for 4 cycles every 2 weeks. I'm going to use hypothermia gloves and slippers during infusion(like the cold caps). I think most women do OK either way and most say it's easier to tolerate than AC - but we're all different. Definitely one of those \"what should I do\" decisions. All the best!",
