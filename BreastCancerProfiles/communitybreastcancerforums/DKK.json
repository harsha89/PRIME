From what I understand there has been a previous study but only with Stage 4 with cancer that has metastasized. FDA recently approved it for this stage only. It has proved to be very successful and now want to study Stage 3. You may have seen the \u201cRelentless\u201d commercials. I can\u2019t find much information about the new trial either but some women have posted about using it in Stage 4 posts. I haven\u2019t even seen it listed on my hospitals website for trials. Side effects are mostly diarrhea and they list many more of course. I want to do everything I can to prevent recurrence and live longer,but not convinced to go through the sickness again. The dose is a pill 2x a day for two years along with your endocrine therapy. I will post if I learn more, I will be talking to the nurse on August 15th. ",

I have the tattoos, they X-ray and I see my RO once a week, and I don't do the deep breath during treatments. I have been using Aquaphor and Calendula lotions. Before I go to bed I slather on the Aqua poor and wear an old loose Cotten shirt. By morning it is absorbed and any redness or stinging is gone. I try to go braless when ever I can,because when I do wear even a soft or sports bra , I get a little redness under my breasts and armpit. I have been looking for clothes to coverup any jingle from my boobs when I wear a camisole . They are so comfortable, but I am kinda large busted and I don,t like the jiggle. Lol! I work part time, do my rad. Treatments then visit my mom in a nursing home. She has cervical cancer (even though she had a total hysterectomy). We were both diagnosed last last summer. I do get fatigue but I am trying to stay active. I don't do any other excersise because I am usually pooped by the time I get home, get dinner and clean up. Treatments have been going very quickly. Some days I feel like I am running on a treadmill and don,t have time to think about fatigue, but when I crash I am out! Two weeks ago I was in the ER with severe stomach pain. Found out I have gall stones. I still have stomach pain daily but not as severe.Having CT scan Tues. to rule out any cancer down there.............Always something, feel like it's never ending.. So glad to hear many of you are finishing. Best wishes ❤️ ",

I have told my oncologist, radiologist, surgeon and medical doctor about my burning, stabbing, VERY sensitive pain in my armpit and across my left breast where I had my lumpectomy and sentinel nodes removed. I was recovering well did my chemo & radiation. 9 monthes after my surgery this pain starts. All the drs say the same thing.... Take Tylenol, it will gradually go away. OTC pain relievers do not help the pain. Thanks to you ladies I have tried some topical rubs that dull the pain for an hour or so.. Better than no relief. I am beginning to wonder if the emotional/ mental fact that nothing is helping and my doctors are ignoring that fact of my nerve damage is making me fell like crap worse than my nerve pain itself. I am so afraid of taking pain meds, they always put me to sleep or make me feel woooozy. At least on this site I can see there is some home. I just can't settle for the commits from the Drs. Take Tylenol and wait. It has been 4 mos now in this pain. Thanks for letting me rant,, ",
