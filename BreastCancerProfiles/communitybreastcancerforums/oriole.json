This is a crazy path that we are all on, but I do not agree at all with your MO's comments that began your meeting yesterday. I was on Abraxane for six months starting at the end of July last year. It was my first IV chemo since mets diagnosed in Jan 2015. You do not need a port to get started as it is an \"easy\" infusion and you should not need premeds. I have had a few scans with significant progression and know that I feel better once I get back on treatment. I did not have any real side effects from Abraxane except being a little extra tired and hair loss. I worked full time during treatment. As to hair loss, I had lost my hair five years ago during dose dense chemo and was just dreading getting a wig again. My oncology center gave me information on a place in Los Gatos (close to San Jose) that only deals with breast cancer patients and their needs and I called them and went to an appointment and the first wig that I was shown has been just great. Here is the information (http://www.nextstepboutique.com). If this is too far to drive, I know that you can call them and they will know of places up closer to you. Let's hope that the abraxane gets the mets under control and you will not need to deal with ascites, but I know that Rosevalley dealt with them for a long time and I will find her posts and send them to you. I have been with my MO for five years and we have had a number of direct and honest and difficult conversations but every meeting has also been filled with compassion and understanding. My nurse practitioner is also a great support and I have been instructed to call the office about any issue that I am having. I do not know how long you have been with this MO, but I just cannot imagine any MO saying what was said to you yesterday to start your meeting. It also seems that someone at your MO's office should have been on top of the situation with your ascites far sooner. I hope that you can get started with the Abraxane and be at an oncology center that treats you with the respect and compassion your deserve. My thoughts are with you and your family. I do not know if you remember Diane (from Palm Springs) who was on IV chemo for quite a long time ... we messaged quite regularly ... she always said \"Not today cancer, NOPE!\" Oriole",

It was first thought that I was early stage but a CT scan a week before planned lumpectomy showed a slightly enlarged node in collarbone. My oncologist had wanted me to do dose dense chemo first anyway and it would have been difficult to biopsy the node, so I did dose dense ACT and then lumpectomy with lymph nodes removed and then radiation and then started Arimidex. I was watched very closely after treatment and a CT scan one year after treatment was clear, but mets in my lymph nodes were found in Jan 2015. My oncologist sent me to a nearby university breast cancer center for a 2nd opinion about treatment options for my mets and I was told that I was probably stage IV from the start. I do not regret having the initial treatment at all. On a practical matter, I was on sick leave for six months for the chemo/surgery/radiation treatments, but I felt well throughout treatment. Chemo/radiation definitely affects us all differently. I have continued to work this past year (since mets diagnosis) and have felt pretty good on targeted treatments. My one bit of advice would be to make certain that you have a good feeling about your oncology team. It sounds like you have met with two different groups and I would encourage you to make certain you can talk openly with your oncologist and feel that you are part of a team. This will be a long term very important relationship for you and your family. My relationship with my oncologist and everyone at my local cancer center is incredibly important in keeping me mentally and physically \"healthy.\" Wishing you all the best at this difficult time. This site is great and you will get lots of information on treatments and side effects, etc.",
