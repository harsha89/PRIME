    "Content": "Srichards0615 wrote: Hey there. I'm a little confused about info I have been reading and what my DR said. Found a lump a month ago. I have been dealing with cysts in breast for over 20 years. I had a partial hysterectomy 5 years ago. I am 41 yrs old. This lump is not the painful type. Had mammogram and US Friday. Dr told me it was a Fibroadenoma but wants to do a core biopsy. She also told me hormones have nothing to do with why Fibroadenomas form. The mass is 2.9cm. Why would she feel the need for a core biopsy if it's a benign cyst. any feedback would be appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
