I already do not drink, eat little meat, exercise daily, TRY to sleep but the hormone blocker makes that hard.  Any way, I am glad to be alive and to have time to think about the decision.  As it stands, I do not think they will recommend it until another cancer comes then I face the whole 9 yards again.  Let me tell you, getting that mastectomy before you have cancer is well worth it if you are other wise healthy.  Especially if you have good results with your reconstruction, which you can't really plan ahead except by interviewing surgeons and seeing pictures of their work.  The ladies in my support group have challenging times dealing with reconstruction during chemo and radiation, everything has to be timed so that the surgery can mend, and the treatments can be effective.  Thank you for letting me share your thread, believe it or not, ATM is even more rare than BRCA.  In reading about the mutations on reputable medical web sites like pub med, I learned there are many types of BRCA and the risk associated with each of the over 2,000 possible mutations varies.  You may want to investigate if the risk of your particular type is only 20% instead of 80% chance of getting breast cancer, for instance.  I have no idea what my increased risk is; it would be good info to have. Best of health to us all!! K",
