I personally do not know anyone who has been so it is quite comforting to have you all.Can the radiologist give me valium or do i have to get some from my doctor?5 days and counting I will write again to let u all know how it went.This waiting until i have it done is awful.I am probably scaring myself more than anything.",

The results were that the findings were \"abnormal\" and i needed to have it biopsied.They also found two spots on my left breast which they believe is just a benign growth so they will retest it in 6 months.Have never been through these tests before, i'm 36 now,and it's all a bit scary.",
