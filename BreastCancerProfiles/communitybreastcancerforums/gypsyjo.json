First from the radiologist, then from the lab. Interestingly, I picked up the latest copy from the radiologist and they had added more detail in the report on my numbing and how I weathered the procedures, much more than I initially received. After a review by a panel at the Breast Clinic, I am deemed a stage 1. That will be at least until the full lumpectomy and a few corresponding nodes are fully examined. I had to ask the surgeon what stage I was to find out. It wasn't in any report that I received. Your information might come in small bits of information. The good news is found early and not fast spreading. I spent most of yesterday waiting for various consults at the Breast Clinic. Though even a coordinated group, my information has arrived in pieces of information.  I have met with the oncology surgeon and oncology radiologist and have a plan in place. Scheduling today for about 2 weeks out, the first available opening since it requires coordination between the 2 doctors.  It does get better once you know and feel like you are more in control. I still find my emotions swinging.  I was ecstatic when told mine was \"very treatable\", very different from my immobilization when I first saw the word \"invasive\". While sitting in the surgical oncology waiting room and seeing all the brave women in various stages of recovery, the reality hit me. It was hard holding back the tears. I still have some second thoughts on treatment of choice, but each time I reevaluate I come up with the same answer. I'm scheduling a lumpectomy to be followed with a one time intraoperative radiation therapy. I may be done for the moment at that point, or my have to go through a reduced radiation therapy to supplement the intraoperative one if they find evidence in my nodes or margins. They believe I am a good candidate for this lesser radiation treatment, but it doesn't have the established track record as a full radiation treatment. My risks of reoccurrence will be slightly higher, but side effects less. Longevity rates the same. Whatever the outcome, my life and perspective have changed forever. I am more grateful than ever for medical advances, caring people and life in general.  ",

I also called my insurance and asked to be assigned to a contact there. Not only did they approve the procedure (it is an accepted technology, the real reason that few centers offer it is because of the cost of the equipment), but they covered it and the surgery as if in network. I was advised by my HR group at work to negotiate it upfront. It will also save the insurance company money for the one time treatment vs the standard 6 week treatment. I made sure I mentioned that to my assigned representative. I have been very pleased with the treatment and ease with the approval. Good luck.",

The thing about it is that it takes an hour for it to take effect so you can liberally apply with a gloved hand an hour before your appt. You then cover with saran wrap so it stays on your skin vs into your clothes. I did this for wire insertion and dye injections and it worked! If I ever have another core biopsy, I would again ask for this RX. Depending on the skill of the person doing the biopsy as well as the time alloted from their injections your experience could very greatly. This is just added insurance to make the experience as easy as possible. My BS prescribed after initially telling me I wouldn't need it when I explained what I had read on the discussion boards.

My surgery went surprisingly well yesterday and I am feeling good today. I chose to have IORT, intraoperative radiation therapy. If radiation is an issue, you should talk to a radiologist about all your options. As RaiderGirl said, visit a bigwig hospital for your second opinion. I went to OHSU, one of the National Cancer Institute hospitals and was given lots of options to address my treatment fears and needs. OHSU also negotiated with my insurance company to cover as if in-network since I was an ideal patient for an alternate procedures that my local hospital didn't offer.

I don't know whether it was the skill of the radiologist or the location. It set me off with fear for all following procedures. I did find before my wire placement and dye injection, that I could be prescribed EMLA cream. It is a numbing cream that takes full effect about 1 hour after application. I applied it myself one hour prior to each procedure. Though they numbed me with the stereotactic and had to stop midway to do more, my experience was painful. The procedures that I had with EMLA cream went smoothly. I did note for the biopsy that very little time was given prior to the procedure after numbing. I had no problem getting the prescription from my PCP. It just is added insurance for a better experience. Jo",

I really liked his approach and recommendations. With Chemo not recommended and hormone therapy optional (risk so small that treatment gives little reduction) I am following up with him.

If they do find something, you are finding it early. Good for you to be on top of it. I know it causes alot of worry. I remember being there. The biopsy is one event that will be quickly over. One step at a time. Hoping that they find nothing. Feel free to come back at anything with concerns. Hugs. GypsyJo",

With that in mind, I requested the prescription for EMLA prior to my SNB injection and for my wire insertion. Same location, but no pain. The nurse holding my hand during the wire insertion said I was the only patient in 6 months that didn't even wince. EMLA one hour ahead then cover with saran wrap works. ",
