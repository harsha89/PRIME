You can go to your hospital and ask for all your reports and they will either mail them to you or you can pick them up. If you are part of the Royal Bank they have a thing called Best Doctors.  They will retest your tumors and go over all your blood work and scan results and then it is all sent to a Dr (who has been appointed through other Dr's voting on who they would go to if they had Breast Cancer).  He/She will respond with a full report and you can ask specific questions.  ",

So far it's working. I hope you keep your hair. Lets keep tabs on each other. Lets just hope it's working. xo Michelle",

Especially if money is not a problem.  I am a firm believer in both practises.  If you want more info PM me.  Take care and remind her there are so many new treatmetns coming down the pipeline.  If she is just newly diagnosed she has lots of safer choices then clinical trials to try first.  Tamoxifen kept me stable for almost 2 years.  So she has lots to give her Hope.  She should when she is ready perhaps join us on here.  I know it took me ahile to join.",

Her  last email was a week before she died and all it said was \"can I call you?\"  I told her of course but I never got the call.

What about finding a few moms in your kids classes to help out driving your kids back or making playdates.  There is a site on here Lots of helping hands.  You can fill in a calendar with your appointments and what you need help with for that day.  You email it out to all your family, friends etc and people volunteer on the days they can.   Youare a saint for all you have selflessly done.   Hope you start to feel stronger and less drained.  Hugs, Michelle",

So yes some can live a long time and may get to NED.  That has nothing to do with how early they catch it but how well the tumours respond to the treatment options. That being said it does tend to show that those living with only bone mets can manage it longer then those with soft tissue involvement. Mind you everyone responds differently, no matter where the involvement.  This disease is so complicated.   I hope that helps. ",

Apparently they can't tell the difference. So I am pretty happy with that report.  I am doing it in Fort Langley, BC, Canada. ",

I truely believe we are living in the right time and they are finding lots of new drugs to target our specific cancers. It's going to be a long bumpy road but it will be a long one.   I hope once your kids are older and in school and other activities you will have to tie a string around your finger to remember Oncology appointments.  :) When I do get down I have a little cry and then I get mad and say that is enough and then I engage with my kids, exercise (I am trying to get to the mountains and play more) I am buying my tickets to shows. Just saw STOMP going to see the Blue men in a few months and as soon as it's 10am here I am buying Coldplay tickets.  I even bought Harlem Globtrotter tickets for the whole family for Feb.  So I guess just feed your soul with whatever you find pleasure in.  I also keep myself surrounded by my good friends. They keep me laughing and spoil me.  Now if this doesn't cheer you up let me know and I will find something even funnier.  Not sure how cause John Pinette is hillarious!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4PCF70HBkU Remember we are going to grow old together.  Screw the stats and screw cancer!  Here's part 2 you can find all his stuff on You Tube.

Especially in this nasty world of cancer.  I did not do anything before my diagnoses.  I was a eat whatever drink (yes please)  and pretty happy go lucky.  Once I was diagnosed I basically went to Chapters and bought every book on cancer I could find. As well as surfeing the net until I basically got sick of reading up on it. About a year and a half.  For me it made sense and I felt like I was heading down the right path.  I was working hard to get to NED. Not a drop of sugar for over a year.  I was skinny skinny!  I went to Mexico and was told my cholesterol was too low.  Who knew that could be an issue.  Anyway they revamped my diet to include meat again. Vegans eat a lot of beans and lentils high in copper which supplies new blood vessel growth to the tumours.  Anyway that is sort of how I came about this whole thing.   Amy triple neg patients often respond really well to high dose Vit C.  You might want to have a look into it.  If you have any specific questions. My ND is more then happy to answer them. He knows a lot fo people can't afford to see an ND and he is more then happy to help answer any questions.  Not trying to sell him on you just thought if you were curious.  That goes for everyone else. Even if they are based on doubt. I don't mind.   And yes I am also happy that this didn't turn into a mud sling. :) ",

No idea why that happened.  Guess it wasn't in the cards. If I feel fine Tuesday I will go then. I spoke with a Dr (good friend but couldn't get a hold of him till after I posted)) last night and he did say to be careful that it can flip the port or kink the tubes if I did any superman moves down the hill. Which he has seen me do lol.  Just wanted to share that so others reading are aware.  He is an anesthesiologist and has had to remove ports due to infections etc and he said even after the first month they come out easy so they are not sitting solid under the skin.  After a few months a layer of skin grows around it and keeps it snug. Medically he would not advise it but he said if it were him he would go.  Then he said he would kick my butt if I did anything crazy and messed it up.  Yes I do thrive on sports.  It's how I cope.  I have been cooped up with the last round of Paclitaxol kicking my butt then port and 4 weeks of company so it is time for me to get out and burn some calorise and energy. Hoping without the steroids I will have more energy. Penny I hope you do dust it off.  It will give your spirit a good lift. Nothing like being outdoors.  Thanks for all your feedback. ",

I just wanted to add I have liver mets they were at innumerable and my ND told me to put castor oil over the area that my liver is.  If you put it on a cloth and then cover it with serane wrap it is suppose to help pull the toxins from your liver. This might help take some of the burden off your liver, so it can repair itself. And it's cheap so why not.  You might also try an infra red sauna.  They help you sweat out all the toxins from chemo.  I hope you can enjoy the break from chemo and build up your strength.  I just came back from the Angeles hospital in Tijuana.  I won't know if things are working or not but I feel a lot more energetic and the treatments they do build up your immune system and train it to fight the cancer by harvesting your white cells and feeding them the cancer info, as well as a bunch of other treatments.  If you are interested I can send you the info on it.  They do what is called Functional Oncology.   I don't want to be annoying. If you are interested I can send you additional info.  Whatever you decide is right for you I wish you nothing but pain free happy days ahead.  I wish I could offer you more. Michelle ",

Not because it didn't work but for some unknown reason.  My ND has the stuff and has been giving it to one of his brain cancer patients.  He was seeing progression on every scan since Sept.  He started DCA 4 weeks ago and his last scan showed 25% regression. His own Onc told him that is the only drug that will shrink his tumour.  But he as an Onc can not perscribe it.  High dose Vit C I can give you countless success stories as well as fails.  Our cancers are all different and we all know we all respond differently.  Vit C can work just as well as any other chemo.  The only difference is it doesn't leave you bald, chemo brainned and sick.  It boost energy, repairs veins and shrinks tumours.  No FDA is going to approve it because there is no money to be made off of it.  Sadly this IS how our system works.  I have been doing the \"alternative\"way as well as the \"western\" way and I feel great.  I have no symptoms or pain.  I probably have more energy then most \"healthy\" people and am still on Tamoxifen coming up on 2 years.  I don't know for sure if it is the Quercetin or not.  But my ND says that it is suppose to help stop the tumours from building their little sub pumps and spitting out the drugs (how they build resistance).  I can't prove what is working but I know I will not give up anything to see which one it is.   We all chose to do what is right for ourselves but I find it annoying to be judged for doing so.   I am not scared I am fighting with all the weapons I can.  I have 3 kids relying on me to be around as long as I can.  I've reserched my treatments well and I have also been to Mexico for treatment.  I didn't get any shrinkage but I came back with more energy then I had in years.  The dendritic vaccine I had down there almost 2 years ago is now part of a clinical trial. So in some ways they are just ahead of the game.  If you look at Germany they have the highest rates of remission then any other part of the world.  Because they have integrated the two.  We need to follow suit.  There that is my 2 cents! :) ",

If you don't own the patent you can't make crazy money off of it.  So pharmaceuticals are not interested in spending millions of dollars investigating and running trials on something they will not make money off of.  They are a business and they are looking for ways to make a profit.  Selling natural agents does not even come close to what they make.  I do think there are people hard at work looking for the cure. I don't buy into the whole the cure is out there and they are hiding it.  I don't think natural agents can save us but I do think they have their place in keeping my butt on this side of the dirt a little longer then if I didn't use them.  A lot of places in Europe use Mistletoe/Iscador as part of there conventional treatment.  It can be used to inhance the effects of chemo. Thereforer they don't have to administer as much chemo to their patient to get the same results. Less toxic and costs less.  As well it works to boost your white cell count. Therefore ommitting the need for Neulasta.  Which they are discovereing might actually might not be that good for us.  Same as the bone biophosphates.  Which have all gone through rigorous testing.  They are now discovering that long term they in fact make your bones brittle. Not strengthening them like they once thought.  Anyway I could go on and on.  There is no right way unfortunately.  Or at least they haven't put all the pieces together.  Hopefully in our life time or at least our kids lives.  I wish we could all get out of this mess and go back to our old lives.  I think as a collective we are a pretty powerful group with a voice.  I wish if something was tried in one counrty it would be good enough for other countries to follow suit.  I think a lot of money is wasted testing it in all these different countries to get the same results.  They need to mandate certain guidlines and if those guidlines are met then the info collected from one source should be good enough.  It would help us get somewhere.  As well they need to regulate Naturopaths.  Right now anyone can pretend to be one.  So yes there are a lot of quacks out there preying on the sick. If they regulated it, it would be a huge step forward. K hope this helped somewhat.  Sorry it is late and I hope I am making sense.   ",

If you are not comfortable being on camera you could always get a friend or family member to do the talking. They would just need to get some background video of you,  spending sometime with your kids/family.  I am sure it would get some attention.  It might get the ball rolling a little faster.  You don't need to be waiting around for them like this. Just a thought.  Go the other route as well but I would start making some noise. Insurance companies don't like to give out money if at all but they also don't want bad pubilicity either.   I am so sorry you have to deal with this on top of all your health issues.  They need to change the laws so that if your Dr's STRONGLY recommend something the insurance company has to respect their wishes and not have some stupid quota they fill.  It's someones life!   Good luck my dear.  Fight hard!  ",

      "Content": "May 13, 2012 01:47AM 3littlegirls wrote: I totally get where your coming from . I have not had the sweet well meaning comment before but I can see how it would be a button pusher. I have 3 girls the oldest 10, 6 and the youngest 2.  It breaks my heart to think I won't be here to play tooth fairy or Santa Claus for my youngest.  All the silly little things I love to do for my girls. My 6 year old came home from school this week with my mother;s day gift. I just cried inside thinking that one year soon she won't have a mom to make her gift for while all the other kids are making theirs. I know thye will get her to make it for my mom or something but inside she will be so sad and that just kills me. My husband is not the most keen dad. He loves them but he doens't enjoy parenting like I do.  Think when they are older he will but I am so worried about how well he will raise and love them when I am gone.   I read an article that I plan on doing as well. It is ask a few girlfriends to step up when I am gone.  This guy who had cancer picked 3 of his friends to become involved with his kids. He picked each one because they had values/interests he liked and wanted to bestow on his kids. They started coming around and becoming involved with his kids while he was still battling cancer. So if he did die it wouldn't be such a transition for his kids. He ended up living (lucky bum) but the men continued on in their lives.  It was a Readers Digest story.  Anyway it stuck. I think I will try and get some of my girlfriends onboard. I know they probably will anyway.  I am blessed with amazing friends.  ",

It is soo unfair and I wish I could help ease the pain and just change everything for you and all of us suffering. Especially so close to Christmas. It is just plain unfair and I hate it. Your story has brought me to tears.  I wish we could step through the computer into your house and help.   I hope she isn't in any pain and that you have time to make some more wonderful memories.  I will pray for your family and for a miracle. It is Christmas after all.   Hugs to you and your family. ",
