Just as Jenco60 clearly had a bad experience with radiation, there are many women on these boards who did not. Try to consider your specific bc and your specific risk profile, taking into consideration your risk tolerance. Also think about what will give you the best sense of having done what you believe is the \"right\" amount of treatment - the amount that gives you the confidence to move forward in your life without looking back (as best as you can determine that). We each have to find that balance, and it isn't always easy. Sending you warm wishes and gentle ((hugs))",

I cannot stress enough to you that your comfort with your providers and your confidence in them is paramount. Urging you to go into the city may be what will make THEM feel better, but I would give that a much lower priority than making YOU feel better. :) Also, how far away Boston is and how long it takes to get there may be a consideration depending on your type(s) of treatment. At one point, I was working with my team in the small city where I live and really liked going home, or being able to work (great distraction) as much as possible. When I had to go to another state at times, I had to take extra vacation/sick days for travel back and forth and then wasn't sleeping in my own bed at night. If you feel at ease now, and secure with your team, that is a big plus. If you have any questions that aren't being answered, or believe that a second opinion/additional information could help you or alter your course of treatment, then you should follow those instincts. In my own case, I got a second opinion on the pathology from my lumpectomy which did, in fact, change the course of my treatment pretty dramatically. The great thing is that it sounds as if you have a wonderful network of family, friends and colleagues that care about you and want the very best for you. Good luck and hugs to you as you move forward and make your treatment plan.",

They will give you something to relax, even if you tell them you don't need it (which I did) lolol. They just said, why don't you take it anyway? I was in one of the older machines (like a tube), you lie face down with your breast through a cut out in the 'bed' and go in feet first. I actually did breathing and meditation while inside and the time passed pretty quickly. It was a bit loud, but other than that, there is no discomfort. Don't be alarmed if the mri does, in fact, find something. It is very sensitive, but not specific (it finds everything, not just breast cancer). They then almost always have to biopsy what they find to verify. Make sure to get copies of all of your reports (not just the patient letter) so that you have them for comparison in the future. You are also entitled (by law) to copies of your images on cd. This is really good to have in case you are ever using a different imaging center or physician. Good luck!",

I'll try to answer your questions in the order you asked them: Did anyone have an MRI that showed something the us did not? Yes. I had an mri after my initial lumpectomy just prior to starting my radiation. There were 2 more areas of DCIS that had not been previously seen by mammo or ultra sound. MRI is much more sensitive, especially in dense breast tissue. Does anyone have experience with a situation where there's likely a papilloma but it doesn't show on imaging? I have no experience with papillomas, sorry. Is it standard to take a wait and see approach with this type of situation? The wait and see approach is very standard when the risk seems to be below 2% for bc. There is a BIRADS system (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and sometimes includes letters, like 4a, b or c) that corresponds to the statistical risk of something being breast cancer based on characteristics appreciated on imaging. BIRADS 3 is most likely benign and therefore is recommended continued followup at 3, 6 or 12 months. Anything 4 or up is biopsied. They wait a prescribed time to see if the finding grows during that time. If it doesn't, it is continued to be watched until it is either deemed \"stable\" (not growing) or has grown and is determined to need biopsy. 70-80% of findings that are biopsied are still not breast cancer. Hope this helps! ",

The wait for results can be quite different from different facilities, depending on the size of the department and workload. I've had everything as fast as a couple of days up to a week+. I would ask the surgical practice where your surgeon works how fast they typically get results back. Also, some practices have a policy of no results by phone, so you have to have an appointment, others will provide phone results; so you could also ask about that if you call them. As far as follow ups, I'm afraid that is yet another answer that is situation specific. I would discuss all of these things with that practice so that you can better understand the expectations.

Feeling \"something out of the ordinary\" is also a common reason for an us referral. The VAST majority of things that are referred from US to biopsy are benign, and you aren't even at that stage yet. At your age, it would be very very unusual (with no family history) to have breast cancer. And the way to stop obsessing (which is of course easier said than done) is to replace thought of BC with other thoughts (like of honeymoon, wedding details etc) or distracting yourself (binge-watching Netflix, going for a walk, yoga, listening to music, practicing a hobby etc). Try very hard not to focus so much attention on this and miss a very exciting time in your life. The chance of this being anything other than B9 is slim, although we all understand how horrible the waiting and not knowing is. It is miserable. ((hugs))",

So, yes, many young women are not \"looking\", so don't \"find\" things that are happening in their breasts. This is actually appropriate as young womens' risk is extremely small. Surveillance practices are population based, and are determined by the prevalence of the disease, the diagnostics available, the number needed to treat and number needed to harm for that disease; plus many other factors. Once a young woman's individual risk is elevated, routine surveillance makes sense. What that routine surveillance comes with, unfortunately, is occasionally years of finding things that have to be identified and the anguish that comes with the waiting each and every time. Which is why all young women are not actively screened. Sorry you both had to go through this, but am glad you have B9 findings.",

So the calcifications didn't specifically meet the criteria to make them clearly concerning for malignancy, but neither did they meet the criteria to make them clearly benign. That's why you're BIRADS 4. The criteria are overly cautious. Any findings with over a 2% chance of being cancer is biopsied to be sure. Try to remain as calm as you can. You have a very good chance that this is benign. I'm so sorry you're having to go through this awful waiting to find out!",

I can answer some of your questions, but will leave the rest for others who can better answer them. An MO is a medical oncologist, whose specialty is medication interventions for cancer (chemo-therapy); as opposed to an RO (radiation oncologist), a BS (breast surgeon), or a PS (plastic surgeon). Your team at Moffitt will most likely also contain a Pathologist (or clinical pathologist). All of these different experts stay current on the latest research in their specific areas and the implications for treatment. As for the info under the signature line, go to \"my profile\" at the top right hand corner, and go to my diagnosis and fill it in. You can also select your privacy settings to show or not show items. In regards to pathology, your first pathology report comes from the biopsy. You will get an additional one any time there is a surgery. For example: I initially had liquid withdrawn from the palpable mass I presented with and cytology results which suggested cancer (cytology is from liquid, pathology is from tissue and is more precise. if someone has a needle biopsy, they'll get an initial pathology report), then I had a lx and SNB (sentinel node biopsy) and that pathology report set my diagnosis. After an mri found more DCIS in other areas of the breast (multi-focal), I had several ultra sound guided biopsies and got pathology reports from those which only slightly upgraded me from grade I-II to II with some areas of necrosis (so more aggressive, but only slightly); although my ER-/PR-/HER2- characteristics remained the same in those samples. If those samples had come back with microinvasions, I could have been upgraded further depending on their size and the micro-invasions themselves would have been tested for their characteristics (ER/PR/HER2). Finally, I had mx and ANOTHER (the final) pathology report was generated. So women may end up with more than one pathology report, as more than once tissue was submitted for pathology. It is important that the entirety of samples be considered as many bc is not homogeneous, and your treatment plan should take into account the most aggressive aspects for maximum control. We are all \"in your pocket\" as you go through your planning. Please let us know how we can help ((hugs))",

It is completely understandable, after your sister's battle, that you want to do the absolute maximum you can right away. I would encourage you to find a team that is accepting of your decisions as you are a very important part of your treatment team and they provide you with expertise to help you make your decision (not make it for you). I don't believe that you will have difficulty finding a surgeon to perform BMX, given your history and strong desire. I also wanted to let you know that BRCA 1&2 are not the only genes that have been identified that raise your risk of bc. The genetic panels now have (someone will correct me if I'm wrong on this ;) ) 26 different genes that they test. Anyway, if your previous testing was limited to BRCA gene mutations, it may be a good idea to get a newer more comprehensive test done. currently, Insurance companies are required to cover reconstruction. unfortunately, there is no way of knowing what impact the current administration will have on insurance coverage starting in 2018. At your first visit, your doctor will go over the specifics of your pathology report, perhaps give you an intial staging (based on current pathology and size of the lump) and the implications to treatment. For example, women that have over amplified expression of HER2 (which you do not) or women who are Triple Negative (again, you are not) are frequently given neo-adjuvant chemo to shrink their tumors before surgery. You will most likely have a team, MO (the one who's expertise is in chemo), RO (the one who's expertise is in rads) and the BS and/or PS (the ones who operate and reconstruct). I actually had an additional member on my team who was a Pathologist who was the expert in DCIS. (he actually recommended an mri before radiology which found additional areas of concern that also turned out to be DCIS, hence my initial lx, followed by mx). You may decide, at any point, that you want to get a second opinion if you are not feeling confident in what is being recommended or you don't feel like you are getting the care that you want. That is ok, many of us have done that. Sometimes you hear the same information, but sometimes not, providers have varied experiences/strengths/weaknesses and preferences of their own, there must be a good fit between you. The other thought I had for you was, perhaps a therapist, support group or nurse navigator might help you, given that you still feel like you have PTSD from your sister's battle. Having someone who is supporting you on your journey, who can help you process whatever it is you are experiencing could be very helpful. Many of us here have used a therapist as part of our support system. Sending you love, light and ((hugs)) Please let us know how else we can help and support you.",

I would assume that your additional images were sufficient, but you should get a copy of your written report to verify this.

For 100% certainty, you need further diagnostics (mri, biopsy) which is why they referred you. Once you have had your mri, talk to your doctor. Get him/her to explain what has been found and what it means. Take notes, take a friend or family member to take notes for you if you are super nervous.

It can be very scary to find lumps and to have to wait to find out what they are. If you feel like you didn't get in as quickly as the radiologist wanted you to, why not call back and talk to his nurse. Or have your gyn call and consult about the timing. In the meantime, to help put things in perspective:  So notice that you are advancing to the second stage - diagnostic workup. 75% of the women who make it to that stage are told they should return to regular or 6 month follow up (have less than 3% likelihood bc). Even if you get to the biopsy stage, 80% of those are found to be b9. So you are early in the process and the odds are astronomically in your favor.

That means that it isn't being fed by estrogen or progesterone and that it isn't overexpressing the HER2 growth factor (HER2 is a human epidermal growth factor protein involved in normal cell growth. when overexpressed, it leads to rapid cell growth). Ki67 is a protein that increases in cells as they prepare to divide. That is a sign of rapid growth. The implications of these things is most likely that they will want to do neoadjuvant chemo (chemo before surgery) as they can then tell if the chemo is effective in slowing/stopping the growth or actually shrink the tumor before surgery. That gives them an opportunity to make sure they know which chemo agents are most successful prior to surgery. It also means that she will not be recommended for a targeted therapy like Herceptin (that is for HER2+ bc) and will most likely not be recommended for anti-hormonal treatment (which is for ER/PR bc).

Try your best to just breathe, use your anxiety reduction strategies, don't poke and prod the area (which can make it sore) and for heaven's sake, stay off google (there is lots of outdated or just plain erroneous info there). Think about it this way: if the same phenomenon were happening on your leg, would you be anxious? Good luck and I hope that it starts to fade quickly so that your anxiety can go down!",

If your biopsy shows a benign process (which is very likely as 70-80% of biopsied findings are B9) then they won't necessarily even remove the nodule.

It seems that even before a biopsy, you've assumed you have bc and scheduled a consulting appointment with a bc specialist? Would that be a breast surgeon? I agree that the word \"spiculated\" is concerning, but not a guarantee that you have bc, so thinking about hormone receptor status seems a bit presumptive. But I'll try to roll with your assumptions, to answer your questions about plans of \"attack\". There are lots of factors that go into determining treatment strategies and appropriate risk reduction interventions. First, there are the personal/family history factors such as family history of bc or genetic mutations (genetic testing is recommended in certain cases to determine this). Age at diagnosis is also a factor. The size of the tumor, histological grade , receptor status (ER/PR) and other markers (HER2 and/or KI67); whether any lymph nodes or other areas of the body are involved determine the stage. The standard arsenal of treatment options are: surgery (lx vs mx), chemo (neoadjuvant is before surgery and used in specific cases, adjuvant is after surgery), targeted therapy (like Herceptin, used for HER2+) and radiation (typically used in conjunction with lx, less with mx). Each of these are interventions used to reduce specific risks, so should be applied to a specific individual's risk profile and their personal risk tolerance as well as their preferences. For example, some women prefer lx over mx or vise versa. Some women opt for reconstruction after mx, others not. Some women want to throw everything possible at their bc, for maximum risk reduction, others think about their side effects and/or have comorbidities that increase the risk of certain interventions. I'm not sure I can really give you any more helpful information when you haven't even completed your biopsy yet - 70-80% of biopsies produce B9 results. Hoping you're in the majority!",

The term 'spiculated' is certainly concerning. My advice would be to breathe, and try your best to take one step at a time. Waiting (for what you fear may be bad news) is difficult. Try to keep yourself busy and do your best to get enough sleep, as you'll need to be able to think clearly to take in and process information. Many facilities insist that women return to discuss their pathology results in person, others will give results by phone. You can ask them about their protocol and then, if it is in person, schedule your follow up apt and make sure you have someone with you who is level headed and can take good notes. biopsies aren't typically painful for most of us, but plan on using ice packs and Tylenol, if you need them. Depending on how many samples are taken and if you have a problem bleeding, then a compression type bra (like a good sports bra) can help. You can do this!

BC tumors can be heterogeneous and I've read women's posts from these forums where their pathology was different from different samples - and the final pathology report must take them all into consideration. Just curious, did your Oncotype come from the original biopsy sample or the surgical sample? And if it came from the surgical sample, why wouldn't they re-run the ER/PR/Her2? Maybe someone else here can shed some light on this, I am stumped.",

I did not have a spiculated mass. I found what felt like a tremendous lump (but, of course wasn't all that big) that looked on images like a sunburst. It was a complex cystic mass, which the radiologist was unconcerned by (there was a fluid filled component), but he was a protocol follower so he did give me a surgical consult. The breast surgeon immediately \"didn't like it\" and asked if he could aspirate some fluid right then; which I of course agreed to. We got back the cytology report in a couple of days (cytology is done on fluid and is less precise than pathology which is done on tissue) which indicated adenocarcinoma. At that point, we knew I had breast cancer, but no more than that. So he asked me what I wanted to do, a biopsy or an excision (lumpectomy). I just wanted to remove it, not knowing if it was fast growing and aggressive or not. So he scheduled a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy at the same time - in case it turned out to be invasive and we needed to see if I had nodal involvement (to limit my surgeries, if possible). I got very good news with my pathology report - DCIS (and of course, no node involvement). I had my initial consult with the RO (radiation oncologist) and planned my rads treatment. I also sent for a second opinion on my pathology to an expert on DCIS, as my small local hospital might have missed something. The day before I was scheduled to go in for my rads mapping and tattoo, I got back the second opinion path report indicating I should get an mri as the architecture of my dcis tends to present itself as multi-focal disease. (MRIs are very commonly used now, but this was 14 years ago) I had the mri, which did in fact, find 2 more areas that were biopsied and proven to be DCIS, in a different quadrant of my right breast. At that point, the recommendation was for mx, as doing multiple lumpectomies in various quadrants does not result in a \"good cosmetic outcome\" and I was only 38, so they wanted to be sure and remove all of the DCIS. After the mx, I had several reconstruction surgeries (instead of just a couple, because I got a pretty good hematoma after my lx), TE placement, exchange surgery and then nipple reconstruction. I think that answers your questions. Please do ask if you have any others. ((hugs))",

When something on imaging matches the pathology results, that is concordant (results that go together or make sense) When results are discordant, facilities have a procedure which include review of all materials, images, biopsy procedure notes etc for a recommendation (which could include re-biopsy, or additional imaging like mri, surgical consultation etc).

One of the companies that first started sequencing genes (which has the largest single database) refuses to share their information regarding on which genes they have clear evidence - either positive or negative links to cancers. They insist that when people are buying their test (at a premium) that they are paying for that database, while newer companies are pooling their findings to create a massive database to benefit patients. But as some patients are paying for genetic testing out of their pockets, a lower cost test is more attractive to some patients. There is now a site for sharing genome information that is being created by Washington University in St. Louis ( https://genome.github.io/civic-api-docs/ ). Patients are actually allowed to enter their own data (that needs to be validated by one other professional) to help grow the database.

The fact that they haven't identified any cancer cells does make a recommendation to an oncologist a bit premature, IMO. I think getting the TB results back first would be a good start. Then, based on what those results tell you, you can discuss options with your doctor as far as other diagnostics or testing goes. As you are 19, you do not need your parent's permission to have surgery, and this shouldn't be an issue unless they financially support you and you would be unable to make whatever out of pocket expenses are involved.

I would get the earliest available apt with the bs and discuss it with him/her (even if you haven't heard back yet) as the bs may be able to pull some strings and get answers. It is aggravating to have to be on top of things when we're worried, but we do have the most invested in getting accurate answers. Keep pushing, you can do it and we're here to help you!",

Your young age, and the rarity of IBC (only 1-4% of all bc) makes that particular diagnosis highly unlikely. Also, 1 week is not so long to be considered \"persistent\", although I'm sure with an itchy and painful rash one week can seem like a really long time. What types of \"methods\" did you try?

It was pretty evident (although I would have sworn it wasn't there the day before I found it) and I immediately went in to have it checked out, never having had any lumps before. I was only 38, and the NP \"wasn't worried\" about my lump as it was \"not small like a pea\" and she felt it \"moved\" more than bc would. I did press her, never having had a lump before, and she referred me for a diagnostic mammo. The radiologist saw a cystic mass (complex cystic mass) and said because he could see fluid and because of my age, he was \"not concerned at all, 99% chance it's nothing\", but gave me a surgical consult when I pushed him. When the BS laid his hands on my lump he \"didn't like it at all\", although he couldn't really tell me why. He aspirated some fluid in his office right then and there. It was amber in color, and he didn't like that either. He let me know that the fluid would go to cytology and that either the cyst would collapse and go away, or it wouldn't. If my cytology came back b9, and it didn't go away, I should return and we'd figure out a f/u plan. The cytology came back adenocarcinoma. So it is possible for a complex cystic mass to contain some malignant components. I'm not saying that is what happens to all women who present with complex cysts, but thought you should here that possibility. I am hoping that your path results are b9!

You would also want to verify that your insurance will cover the cost (out of pocket expenses etc) and you may want to schedule this at a different facility or with a different provider. \"Well, mostly this started because I was complaining of pain, so why has there been no follow-up to schedule this?\" Please see above, as some women would not want to proceed, they won't just \"schedule this\" for you, you will need to initiate. \"And they only recommend getting another mammo in 12 mo. Is this common procedure w/ these results? \" Absolutely. They have found benign cysts and given you a BIRADS 2 score (which correlates to the b9 findings), which has a recommendation on normal 12 month interval follow up. \"Also, they do have prior findings available.

This advice is ill-timed as well as being ill-informed. When anyone who has been diagnosed with bc is considering their options, they need to consider all of the information (stage, grade, type of bc, histology, genetics etc) and make their decision based on those facts. A one-size-fits-all recommendation is not very useful - much like 75 years ago when bc always meant radical mx. Missvan, the link MelissaDallas provided above will lead you to very low or free breast screening centers. Hopefully one will be near you. If not, check for your local Planned Parenthood, or a local Community Health Center. Any of these facilities should be able to schedule an affordable appointment for you to have a breast exam and then (if warranted) imaging. If you are young, they may recommend ultra sound only, as younger women tend to have denser breast tissue and mammos are not as useful. We cannot help you identify what is in your breast, only a doctor can do that. PLEASE seek medical attention. Good luck!",

They did SNB on me, as you aren't able to find the sentinel nodes later (if there is a problem) so they are typically removed if there are any questions. They may or may not recommend that to you. ANY major surgery to the chest (mx alone or with SNB) raises your risk for LE. That risk is not limited to immediately after surgery. Your risk goes up a tiny bit each year after, so you will ALWAYS need to be careful. A referral to a certified LE specialist would be important to get good education on what you should/shouldn't do and what to watch for. I had a TE, and did not find it painful at all. At the end, when it was really full (and looked a bit like a dirigible sticking off my chest) it was tight so I felt pressure, but no pain. I was not able to have anything spared, so have an implant and had my nipple reconstructed. At first I had complete numbness, ranging across my chest and extending fully under my arm (it was wicked weird to shave - although I hear now that is NOT recommended due to risk of LE). The numbness actually faded over time and I have full feeling back in the skin over my foob. I think that meeting with a PS to get their opinion on your specific case (do they want to do SNB?) will be helpful. Best of luck!",

The calmer you are, the easier it is for your health professionals to discuss your tests and options with you.

I would get a copy of your written imaging report and the BIRADS score. It will explain about the two findings and why they wanted to biopsy one and not the other.

It was frustrating that they didn't find the second and third group of DCIS until after my lumpectomy, but I'm very glad that they found it.

It also provides probability (based on those same characteristics) about the likelihood of a finding being cancer. Here is more on that system: http://breast-cancer.ca/bi-rads/ A BIRADS 4 score has a positive predictive value of about 30% - which means that about 30% of BIRADS 4 scored findings turn out to be bc. The shape of a finding is one of those characteristics upon which a BIRADS score is assigned. Oval is usually good. Read more about complex cysts (or complex cystic mass) here: http://breast-cancer.ca/comp-cysty/ I would take comfort in the fact that your doc believes that there is a strong probability that this finding is b9.

Mindfulness is training the mind to just notice what is happening in the moment, without assigning judgment to it. It is the practice of observing the moment, not reflecting on the past or worrying about the future. So the \"pattern\" that reflects uncertainty is relegated back to just a pattern. It takes practice, but can be really helpful in decreasing anxiety. Really interesting! Thanks!",

While I am happy that you found out that you don't have bc, I would NOT recommend that women consult doctors online. Any new or concerning breast symptoms should be reported in person, for their doctor to examine and potentially order imaging for further exploration. BC can only be positively diagnosed (or ruled out) using tissue samples that are seen by pathology. No one online has the ability to examine and palpate any finding; this should be done in person. If you are anxious about having bc, the best thing to do is to go and talk to your doctor. Depending on your age, and personal risk factors, your doctor will discuss what kind of regular follow up is right for you. The best way to overcome a health based fear, is to focus on the facts and what you know to be true, not what you fear. If you have a lump, or other health symptom, see your doctor, get specific and personal information about your symptoms, your ongoing risk and what you can do to reduce that risk. Good luck!",

Some of the info I read prior to the onset of the season was a prediction that this would possibly be a bad flu season. One of the reasons is that the vaccine wouldn't convey as robust an immune response as other years for a couple of reasons. That is because one of the strains that was predicted to dominate the season, and was therefore incorporated into the vaccine is H3N2. It was also in last year's vaccine. When a strain is incorporated into a vaccine 2 years in a row typically means that a person getting the vaccine will not have the same robust immune response. Another reason is the strain H3N2 is a bad one, and the immune response conveyed for H3N2 is typically not as high as it is for other strains. All in all, avoid places where many sick people are, frequent handwashing, staying hydrated, and staying well rested.  Stay well everyone!",

      "Content": "MTwoman wrote: Hi, I've been NED for 14 years and have been a therapist for 17 years, so I have a lot of varied experience dealing with anxiety. Anxiety is just awful and can not only be debilitating, but can keep us from being able to take in and process information just when we need to be at our best. Too little stress can leave us bored, but too much stress/anxiety can leave us with panic, unusual amounts of anger and/or the inability to \"perform\" at our best. In the \"not diagnosed but worried\" category, anxiety can mean that we aren't able to hear our medical providers when they give us good news, or we aren't able to rationally discern what information is good and credible scientific evidence and what information is unscientific and only inflames our anxiety. It may impair our ability to listen, remember, read and comprehend our personal risks, our treatment options and our ability to calm ourselves, even if we have been found to have no evidence of disease. So how do you know if you are too anxious? Look at the stress curve above. Do you feel fatigued or exhausted? Are you sleeping well? Can you turn your mind to something else when you need to focus on another task? Or is your anxiety all you can think about. Are you eating properly? Or have you lost your appetite. Are you able to engage in activities that reduce your feeling of anxiety/stress? If you are able to concentrate on something else for periods of time, and utilize good coping skills to reduce your feelings of stress, then you'd fall in the optimal performance stage. If your normal patterns of sleep, energy and appetite have been disrupted, then you would fall in the distress stage. I am going to suggest some strategies for each category, and am hoping that others will chime in with what works for them. What I'd like to see is a thread where anyone who is new to the experience of breast cancer or other breast health issues, has a place to refer to for concrete suggestions for managing their anxiety. There is no judgment here, as we've all experienced anxiety (to some extent) in our own journeys. Stress occurs when perceived pressure on a person is greater than their ability to sustain resilience. The following skills can be used to improve and maintain your resilience: Practice distraction: deep clean something; do a home project that you've been wanting to do but haven't gotten around to; binge watch netflix; if you like to cook or bake, make a complicated recipe that takes your full concentration. Exercise: studies have shown that at little as 20 minutes of walking can bring down your stress response and walking in nature has a more robust response Regular relaxation: listen to a relaxation cd or use an app, try guided imagery, practice counting your breathe, practice yoga, try mindfulness or meditation, take a hot shower or bath, get a massage Use good self-care: make sure you are getting good nutrition and good sleep For those of you who find that the above strategies aren't enough to reduce you anxiety to a tolerable level or for those of you who have pre-existing anxiety issues. Talk to your primary care provider (or psychiatrist if you have one) about medication options, both long term and short term; for both anxiety and sleep Think about getting into therapy and learn cognitive behavioral techniques to address your anxiety Find a group that lets you connect to others who have experienced similar levels of anxiety and who may be able to share ideas about what has been effective for them. For those who are here who have been diagnosed, there was a study recently released that found a statistically significant improvement in the recurrence anxiety of breast cancer survivors. See a summary here: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/105/topics/855472?page=1#idx_1 I may review and revise this post at will without defining why, unless saying why is integral to the work. I would like to be able to add links and additional information as I find it.

Any new or concerning changes should be discussed with your doctor. There is almost no chance that it is cancer. See these statistics by Cancer.gov: Notice that they don't even list the percent risk for women under 30 as it is so statistically improbable. Take comfort from that, and please do talk to your doctor about your concerns. There are many things that can happen in the breast that aren't cancer, but should be looked at just the same. Take care and good luck!",

I also wonder if you've considered NOT frequenting forums like this one, which is for women who have/have had breast cancer. Reading through forums like this, will encourage you to focus on 'scary' things that are not happening in the moment. Focusing on things that might happen goes against everything living in the moment is about. Maybe this would be a good conversation with your therapist. It is hard to calm the monkey mind, but feeding it with sites like this one is almost guaranteed to make it more active. Mindfulness is the practice of being totally present. If you haven't tried, this might be helpful for you. It takes practice, but can be very beneficial. Try going to some sites that are mindfulness oriented instead and see if they provide more relief. Good luck!",

      "Content": "MTwoman wrote: Hi, I've been NED for 14 years and have been a therapist for 17 years, so I have a lot of varied experience dealing with anxiety. Anxiety is just awful and can not only be debilitating, but can keep us from being able to take in and process information just when we need to be at our best. Too little stress can leave us bored, but too much stress/anxiety can leave us with panic, unusual amounts of anger and/or the inability to \"perform\" at our best. In the \"not diagnosed but worried\" category, anxiety can mean that we aren't able to hear our medical providers when they give us good news, or we aren't able to rationally discern what information is good and credible scientific evidence and what information is unscientific and only inflames our anxiety. It may impair our ability to listen, remember, read and comprehend our personal risks, our treatment options and our ability to calm ourselves, even if we have been found to have no evidence of disease. So how do you know if you are too anxious? Look at the stress curve above. Do you feel fatigued or exhausted? Are you sleeping well? Can you turn your mind to something else when you need to focus on another task? Or is your anxiety all you can think about. Are you eating properly? Or have you lost your appetite. Are you able to engage in activities that reduce your feeling of anxiety/stress? If you are able to concentrate on something else for periods of time, and utilize good coping skills to reduce your feelings of stress, then you'd fall in the optimal performance stage. If your normal patterns of sleep, energy and appetite have been disrupted, then you would fall in the distress stage. I am going to suggest some strategies for each category, and am hoping that others will chime in with what works for them. What I'd like to see is a thread where anyone who is new to the experience of breast cancer or other breast health issues, has a place to refer to for concrete suggestions for managing their anxiety. There is no judgment here, as we've all experienced anxiety (to some extent) in our own journeys. Stress occurs when perceived pressure on a person is greater than their ability to sustain resilience. The following skills can be used to improve and maintain your resilience: Practice distraction: deep clean something; do a home project that you've been wanting to do but haven't gotten around to; binge watch netflix; if you like to cook or bake, make a complicated recipe that takes your full concentration. Exercise: studies have shown that at little as 20 minutes of walking can bring down your stress response and walking in nature has a more robust response Regular relaxation: listen to a relaxation cd or use an app, try guided imagery, practice counting your breathe, practice yoga, try mindfulness or meditation, take a hot shower or bath, get a massage Use good self-care: make sure you are getting good nutrition and good sleep For those of you who find that the above strategies aren't enough to reduce you anxiety to a tolerable level or for those of you who have pre-existing anxiety issues. Talk to your primary care provider (or psychiatrist if you have one) about medication options, both long term and short term; for both anxiety and sleep Think about getting into therapy and learn cognitive behavioral techniques to address your anxiety Find a group that lets you connect to others who have experienced similar levels of anxiety and who may be able to share ideas about what has been effective for them. For those who are here who have been diagnosed, there was a study recently released that found a statistically significant improvement in the recurrence anxiety of breast cancer survivors. See a summary here: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/105/topics/855472?page=1#idx_1 I may review and revise this post at will without defining why, unless saying why is integral to the work. I would like to be able to add links and additional information as I find it.

Any new or concerning symptoms should be reported to your doctor, as you did, and when you have doubts or concerns about their follow up, getting a second opinion from another doctor is a good safe bet. Once, you get to the center, they may or may not want to mammo your breast (young breast tissue can be quite dense and mammos don't \"see\" through dense tissue very well), although 3D mammos are better. Ultrasound is typical to use in younger women, so that may be their first step. There have been young women on these boards who report getting a mammo order from their doc, but at the center they don't want to do it (dense tissue).

I did end up with some lasting effects (mainly word finding problems, although my processing speed also seems diminished and sometimes I think I don't retain information the same), so I am grateful at being able to avoid any unnecessary sedation.

I will say that this time, right now, the time before you have all your stats and your treatment plan together and your treatment team working with you, was the worst for me mentally. Once the team was assembled and the plan was created (even after additional testing found other \"areas of concern\" that were identified as DCIS changing the first plan) I was able to make decisions and move forward. That part was critical for me to stop feeling like a frightened and helpless person and start feeling like an empowered problem solving fighter. Mindset is important. You can do this! And these boards filled with these amazing women are one of the best resources you can use for support. There is not much that you can have happen during your bc journey that someone here doesn't have experience with as well.

That is a compound that is naturally made in our bodies, although levels naturally decline as we age (which leads many elderly people to sleep less). I remember (quite a long time ago) studies were done to see if ingestion of melatonin would have similar effects to naturally produced melatonin. Thankfully, the answer is yes. :) Some people experience a bit of fogginess upon waking from melatonin, but I do not. I love it. It is not habit forming (other than sometimes people are reluctant to stop taking it if they've had episodes of insomnia and are anxious about it returning). In our natural state, melatonin levels start to go up when we near bedtime and help us initiate sleep. (they also go down during the night as our wakefulness hormones start to increase) The next active ingredient is GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid). I love this too, and have taken it with great effect when my mind has been too active and unable to shut down at night. So, our bodies have an excitatory response, the Glutaminergic system. This is the system that becomes active when we are anxious and keeps us awake and restless. Glutamate is the most common of those neurotransmitters. The opposite response is represented by the Gabanergic system. (GABA is a neurotransmitter) This is the calming or quieting system in our bodies. So GABA sort of tells our mind it's time to slow down, time to rest. The combination of the two of them means that your body is getting the hormonal signal that it's time to sleep and that your brain is winding down so that you are able to engage in sleep. 5HTP is the last ingredient. That is a precursor for Seratonin - and an effective way of increasing serotonin in the brain, which leads to regulated sleep and anxiety. Please do ask your therapist about it. My thoughts would be that if you have problems sleeping, that leaves you more vulnerable to anxiety. So if you need help with sleep right now, and respond well to dream water, use it! I think that as you work with your therapist, and your ability to use anxiety management skills improves (and you are out of treatment, which is a pretty big stressor for most of us) you may feel like you don't need it anymore; which would be a signal to stop. Keeping a bottle in your fridge just in case sounds like a very reasonable strategy. I'll be interested in hearing what your therapist says!",

That includes things like: having a routine at bedtime, going to sleep at the same time each night, making sure your room is as dark, quiet and cool as possible, eliminating blue light (from tv, computers etc) at least an hour before you want to go to sleep*, making sure to be hydrated (but not too close to bedtime) and perhaps doing some breathing or relaxing prior to sleep. I like to have a book to read, but not a new one that might catch my attention and activate my brain, usually one I've read before so I can close it at the right time. *blue light is absorbed by special photo receptors in the eyeball. the blue light can delay the release of melatonin by the brain, causing us to have more difficulty initiating sleep Anyone else have tips to help get good sleep for others who may be struggling?",

There may even be \"anniversary\" anxiety that pops us years later. I am 14 years NED, and had settled into a routine with health care that didn't typically include anxiety. But when I moved back to this area, and had to re-establish care with a new provider (all mine had retired or moved), and had to refill in all my history (on those blasted forms that don't have enough space), go through it with the nurse (who was clearly unnerved as she was learning their new electronic system and entering all my info was daunting) and then my new doc (who was great, btw) I definitely experienced anxiety. And pretty significant scanxiety waiting for my mammo results. My new provider asked why I hadn't been sent for genetics testing (it was 14 years ago and wasn't as typical as now) and when I was supposed to get my foob imaged (for the life of me can't find a specific number of years written in any report). All in all, I had a pretty significant increase in my anxiety and have had to work to get it back down. Give yourself some time, gb, based on your sig line, you aren't a year out from diagnosis.

A little anxiety can be helpful; make us more alert, give us energy to 'run away from the lion' (from our evolutionary past). But when there is no lion from which to run away, it is a phone call or wait time to hear about results that floods us with fear, that's when it isn't very useful. It actually can keep us from getting our sleep, which we need for our bodies to repair themselves and our minds to be able to properly take in and process information. It can keep us from being able to distinguish between real and only perceived danger. You also raise a good point about hormonal instigators or exacerbaters of anxiety. Recognizing what is driving the anxiety is also a step in the management process. Then it takes figuring out what management techniques work best for you and practice.

In the \"not diagnosed but worried\" category, anxiety can mean that we aren't able to hear our medical providers when they give us good news, or we aren't able to rationally discern what information is good and credible scientific evidence and what information is unscientific and only inflames our anxiety. It may impair our ability to listen, remember, read and comprehend our personal risks, our treatment options and our ability to calm ourselves, even if we have been found to have no evidence of disease. So how do you know if you are too anxious? Look at the stress curve above. Do you feel fatigued or exhausted? Are you sleeping well? Can you turn your mind to something else when you need to focus on another task? Or is your anxiety all you can think about. Are you eating properly? Or have you lost your appetite. Are you able to engage in activities that reduce your feeling of anxiety/stress? If you are able to concentrate on something else for periods of time, and utilize good coping skills to reduce your feelings of stress, then you'd fall in the optimal performance stage. If your normal patterns of sleep, energy and appetite have been disrupted, then you would fall in the distress stage. I am going to suggest some strategies for each category, and am hoping that others will chime in with what works for them. What I'd like to see is a thread where anyone who is new to the experience of breast cancer or other breast health issues, has a place to refer to for concrete suggestions for managing their anxiety. There is no judgment here, as we've all experienced anxiety (to some extent) in our own journeys. Stress occurs when perceived pressure on a person is greater than their ability to sustain resilience. The following skills can be used to improve and maintain your resilience: Practice distraction: deep clean something; do a home project that you've been wanting to do but haven't gotten around to; binge watch netflix; if you like to cook or bake, make a complicated recipe that takes your full concentration. Exercise: studies have shown that at little as 20 minutes of walking can bring down your stress response and walking in nature has a more robust response Regular relaxation: listen to a relaxation cd or use an app, try guided imagery, practice counting your breathe, practice yoga, try mindfulness or meditation, take a hot shower or bath, get a massage Use good self-care: make sure you are getting good nutrition and good sleep For those of you who find that the above strategies aren't enough to reduce you anxiety to a tolerable level or for those of you who have pre-existing anxiety issues. Talk to your primary care provider (or psychiatrist if you have one) about medication options, both long term and short term; for both anxiety and sleep Think about getting into therapy and learn cognitive behavioral techniques to address your anxiety Find a group that lets you connect to others who have experienced similar levels of anxiety and who may be able to share ideas about what has been effective for them. For those who are here who have been diagnosed, there was a study recently released that found a statistically significant improvement in the recurrence anxiety of breast cancer survivors.

That score comes with a positive predictive value of 95%, which means that there are times that women get b9 pathology results, but it isn't typical. So they were trying to give you a chance to prepare yourself for a bc diagnosis (without outright diagnosing you). I would plan on bringing someone in to your appointment, someone who is cool under pressure and can take good notes or help you ask good questions. You don't want to get too many steps ahead, but if you do get a diagnosis, things can move pretty quickly. Start thinking about your support system and how you may want to activate them if you need to. I am sorry that you're in the awful stage of waiting, it really sucks. If you get a diagnosis, there will be a bit more of that as there are other results to wait for and potentially other imaging to acquire. You can do this. We will help you.",

EpicSquirrel, Good for you for getting walking and trying to find some distraction techniques that work for you! I think that the more you practice distraction (and relaxation techniques) the more effective they become, keep it up! Also, I think that getting support for your anxiety is the key, whether it be from your MO or other provider. Some MOs may be good at this and others not as much. I don't see any problem bringing it up with your MO, who can then let you know about their ability/comfort level in helping you manage. And, as gb2115 mentioned, they may make a referral to someone who specializes in treating anxiety. Please let me know how it's going and if you need extra support. Thanks MinusTwo! It does seem to be a pretty common experience for folks, so I was hoping this forum might help us help each other :)",

What types of things are distracting for you? Movies/tv? then binge watching Netflix. Specific hobbies? Make sure you have plenty of supplies (knitting, beading, painting, etc). Puzzles? Books? What about deep cleaning something? or a baking/cooking project that requires concentration. Scrap book? (organize all of those old photos laying around) Find something to occupy yourself based on your preferences. Your plan should also include relaxation prior to bedtime. Things like (relaxing, not energizing) yoga or breathing, meditation, guided imagery, listening to soothing music, a warm bath, candles (like lavender), drinking chamomile tea (or other \"sleepy\" time teas). Make sure to dim lights and avoid things that are wakefulness inducing (turn off the tv, laptop or cell phone) for the last 30-45 minutes. Try to keep your bedroom cool and dark. If you need white noise (always a plus for me) then use a fan or humidifier to drown out ambient noise. If your mind starts to wander down dark paths, tell it \"not now\" and perhaps think about scheduling some time to think about \"what ifs\". If you can't avoid having \"what if\" thoughts, then don't. Plan for them. Give yourself 15 or 20 minutes at a time of day that will let you move on afterwards, and then let your mind \"go there\". Just make sure to answer the \"what if\" questions. Like \"what if x y or z happens?\", you tell yourself \"well, if x happens, I'll do this. and if y happens I'll do that\". Either when you've completely exhausted (and answered) your \"what if\" list OR when your allotted 15-20 minutes is over, move on. Don't allow your mind to dwell there. It takes practice, but you can train your mind just like you can train your body. Our minds are very powerful, so we need to make sure we're directing them in a helpful way. Hope that helps!",

The Glutamate system is an excitatory system, it activates the body (and mind). The Gabanergic system regulates GABA which is a neurotransmitter inhibitor that balances the brain by inhibiting over-excitation. I'd think it's worth a try!

Please consider getting a written copy of your imaging report (not just the patient letter) as you are legally entitled to it and it provides much information about the level of suspicion. Breast findings are scored using the BIRADS system of scoring, with each level 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (4 also sometimes has subcategories a, b and c) corresponding to a positive predictive value of the finding actually being bc. If you get your report, pay attention to the impression section and the BIRADS score. You must have received a 4 or 5 as those come with recommendations for biopsy (while 3 is typically short interval follow up). Read more about that system here: http://breast-cancer.ca/bi-rads/ ",

When you're ready, \"getting rid\" of Ativan after daily doses for 4 years will take some time. Your prescribing physician should come up with a very slow taper plan with several plateaus built in. Those will serve several purposes. The first is to make sure you don't have any withdrawal symptoms, which can happen with medicines in that class (benzodiazepine). The next is to make sure you don't have what is called \"rebound anxiety\" which can happen when you come off of benzos. That is a phenomenon that goes something like this: benzos are particularly good at reducing feelings of anxiety to the point that people who previously had the anxiety think that it is \"normal\" NOT to feel any. (which isn't true, we all have feelings of anxiety, they are nature's way of telling us to pay attention/something's up) So when someone reduces their dose and has some feelings of anxiety, it creates more anxiety in response. The third is time, to do what you are currently doing. Working to address how you manage your anxiety. If you go slowly, and build your skills, you will most likely be able to significantly reduce, if not fully discontinue your Ativan. But only when you're ready. You can have a conversation with your therapist about preparing, and what might be signals that you are ready. In the meantime, GOOD FOR YOU for first asking for medicines to help when you needed them, and second for working towards managing your \"monkey brain\" that many of us experience. ((hugs))",

      "Content": "MTwoman wrote: Hi, I've been NED for 14 years and have been a therapist for 17 years, so I have a lot of varied experience dealing with anxiety. Anxiety is just awful and can not only be debilitating, but can keep us from being able to take in and process information just when we need to be at our best. Too little stress can leave us bored, but too much stress/anxiety can leave us with panic, unusual amounts of anger and/or the inability to \"perform\" at our best. In the \"not diagnosed but worried\" category, anxiety can mean that we aren't able to hear our medical providers when they give us good news, or we aren't able to rationally discern what information is good and credible scientific evidence and what information is unscientific and only inflames our anxiety. It may impair our ability to listen, remember, read and comprehend our personal risks, our treatment options and our ability to calm ourselves, even if we have been found to have no evidence of disease. So how do you know if you are too anxious? Look at the stress curve above. Do you feel fatigued or exhausted? Are you sleeping well? Can you turn your mind to something else when you need to focus on another task? Or is your anxiety all you can think about. Are you eating properly? Or have you lost your appetite. Are you able to engage in activities that reduce your feeling of anxiety/stress? If you are able to concentrate on something else for periods of time, and utilize good coping skills to reduce your feelings of stress, then you'd fall in the optimal performance stage. If your normal patterns of sleep, energy and appetite have been disrupted, then you would fall in the distress stage. I am going to suggest some strategies for each category, and am hoping that others will chime in with what works for them. What I'd like to see is a thread where anyone who is new to the experience of breast cancer or other breast health issues, has a place to refer to for concrete suggestions for managing their anxiety. There is no judgment here, as we've all experienced anxiety (to some extent) in our own journeys. Stress occurs when perceived pressure on a person is greater than their ability to sustain resilience. The following skills can be used to improve and maintain your resilience: Practice distraction: deep clean something; do a home project that you've been wanting to do but haven't gotten around to; binge watch netflix; if you like to cook or bake, make a complicated recipe that takes your full concentration. Exercise: studies have shown that at little as 20 minutes of walking can bring down your stress response and walking in nature has a more robust response Regular relaxation: listen to a relaxation cd or use an app, try guided imagery, practice counting your breathe, practice yoga, try mindfulness or meditation, take a hot shower or bath, get a massage Use good self-care: make sure you are getting good nutrition and good sleep For those of you who find that the above strategies aren't enough to reduce you anxiety to a tolerable level or for those of you who have pre-existing anxiety issues. Talk to your primary care provider (or psychiatrist if you have one) about medication options, both long term and short term; for both anxiety and sleep Think about getting into therapy and learn cognitive behavioral techniques to address your anxiety Find a group that lets you connect to others who have experienced similar levels of anxiety and who may be able to share ideas about what has been effective for them. For those who are here who have been diagnosed, there was a study recently released that found a statistically significant improvement in the recurrence anxiety of breast cancer survivors. See a summary here: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/105/topics/855472?page=1#idx_1 I may review and revise this post at will without defining why, unless saying why is integral to the work. I would like to be able to add links and additional information as I find it.

The clinician can then order a diagnostic mammo + us if there is something concerning. That is different from a regular mammo.

MRI are very sensitive (meaning they find all kinds of things in the breast) but not as specific (meaning what they find is not limited to malignancies). That leads to many additional biopsies (along with the increased anxiety and the additional expense). So typically, they recommend them for specific women and/or under specific circumstances. The other option, instead of trying to get your doctor to order an mri if she's against that, is asking her to make a referral for you to a breast specialist. That would be the person to decide if further imaging is warranted and typically, if a specialist orders additional testing or imaging, insurance will pay. Good luck!",

What I would encourage you to do is call the scheduler or the nurse at your doctor's office (whichever you think is more understanding).

As much as we'd all like firm answers to our medical questions, sometimes \" Come back in six months and we'll keep an eye on it\" is the appropriate response. There are actually written guidelines for breast findings in regards to imaging, biopsy etc. that correlate the characteristics of findings, to how likely is the finding malignant, to what are the recommendations AND what insurance covers based on the likelihood of something being b9 or not. The system that I'm referring to is the BIRADS scoring system. Read more about that here: http://breast-cancer.ca/bi-rads/ So, based on your findings' characteristics (on imaging) if you are a BIRADS 3, which means \"probably benign\", that has a pretty low positive predictive value (the chance that the finding is actually bc) of somewhere around 1-2%, the recommendation is \"come back in 6 months\" to insure that the area is stable. Being referred for imaging is quite common, but frequently younger women are not given mammos (even if their gp orders it) as mammography doesn't \"see\" so well through dense breast tissue (common in younger women) so it isn't a very effective imaging technology for them. US \"sees\" better through dense tissue, but doesn't always \"see\" every kind of breast phenomenon. IMO, going to your doctor to get the evaluation process started is a good first step. Your chances of having bc at 25 are exceedingly low, but getting any new or concerning symptoms checked out is always a good policy. Good luck!",

Sometimes, with biopsies, there is a bit of bleeding, which could cause the area to feel differently after. As far as giving you an idea of what is going on, based on exactly how you describe what you feel, most of us here are not trained breast experts, so cannot really speak to that. I do believe that with an excisional biopsy, more tissue will be removed, as it is uncommon for docs to be able to actually see with their eyes how much tissue needs to be removed and they want to get the entire mass. Frequently, if the mass is appreciable by imaging, a marker is placed so that the area isn't missed. what is your doc recommending at this stage to follow up on the \"cannot rule out malignancy\" part of your report?",

But just so you understand, IBC is a rare type of bc that doesn't come and go or cause \"occasional\" symptoms. It presents aggressively and progresses rapidly, in days, not months. So I would not fixate on that. Work with your providers to better understand what is going on, but if they don't find anything with the mri, here is a thread created by DJMammo on common b9 causes of breast pain: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/83/topics/857903?page=1#post_5028462 Best of luck!",

It very well could be benign (and most likely is), but it isn't only worthwhile to go to an appointment if you KNOW what the result it. It is also helpful to go when you DON'T know, because medical experts have the education, training and experience to be able to understand what the different possibilities could be and how to do further testing to determine what the actual cause is. No one here will be able to tell you what is happening in your breasts, we are only trying to share our experience and support. I would encourage you to go to your appointment and discuss your concerns so that you have peace of mind and understand what is going on inside your body. That is a waste of no one's time :) edited for meaning: When I said \"that is a waste of no one's time\" I should have been more clear. I meant that it is NEVER a waste of time to see a medical provider and get answers, even if they are benign answers. Your peace of mind is worth getting answers. Sorry for any hurt or confusion over my intent.",

Same with \"parenchymal\", so parenchymal breast fibrosis, where parenchymal means \"whatever-stuff this part of the body is made of\". Basically, it's fibro fatty breast tissue with patchy breast fibrosis. That's great news!! So happy for your B9 results :D",

As much as you can, try whatever types of things help you relax (breathing, mediation, listening to soothing music, warm bath). Even just a few minutes each hour can help your overall level of free-flowing anxiety. Your Dr. referring you for a diagnostic mammo is standard of care (unless it is clearly something that they can identify), so don't worry about the referral as being concerning, in and of itself. As far as the scan date is concerned, is there a sympathetic nurse at your doctor's office? I've found that sometimes nurses can get pretty remarkable things accomplished (even finding a last minute appointment that was rescheduled or cancelled).

You're right that with the first mammo, they regularly have to figure out what is \"normal\" for some women, hence the call backs and re-imaging. Calcifications can happen naturally as we age, so some of them are \"normal\" and b9 and those typically present in specific patterns. There are other types of calcifications that are not \"normal\" and point to a potentially malignant process, these form different specific patterns. That your pattern was \"indeterminate\" means that it wasn't clearly one type or the other. BIRADS 4 is given when a finding has greater than a 2% chance of being malignant (less than that is BIRADS 3 and those are usually imaged on a closer interval schedule to assess for stability). The 'better safe than sorry' nature of BIRADS 4 means that 70-80% of biopsies in that category come back b9. If you have any other questions, please post them here and make sure to let us know how you're doing. Hoping that your biopsy comes back b9!",

For example, according to the American Cancer Society, about 1 out of 8 invasive breast cancers develop in women younger than 45. About 2 out of 3 invasive breast cancers are found in women 55 or older. In fact, the aging process is the biggest risk factor for breast cancer. That's because the longer we live, there are more opportunities for genetic damage (mutations) in the body. And as we age, our bodies are less capable of repairing genetic damage.\" and Komen site presents this:  Freshmustard, so bc is possible in the 20's, yes, but age most certainly does have something to do with it and decreases the statistical probability significantly.

Mammos are not as good with dense breast tissue. Xrays are good with bones, but not soft tissue. MRIs (using contrast dye) can note the difference in normal and abnormal tissue. A CT is limited in viewing tissue on one plane, while mri is not. Depending on lots of factors, doctors might want another type of imaging used to help them better understand the type of tissue they are dealing with. For example, if there is a palpable lump and dense breast tissue that doesn't allow for optimal viewing, they'll add another type of imaging to better \"see\" the lump. Using more than one type of technology gives experienced radiologists a lot of information, although it can be confusing for anyone not trained. Please contact your doctor and ask them to explain to you their assessment of why they believe your nodule behaved the way it did. Good luck and hoping for B9 results for you!",

When you wrote \" Completely downplayed the swollen lymph node as nothing\", it sounded like you didn't quite believe them? From what DJMammo (one of the members here with vast knowledge on radiology) explains, it is very possible to use ultrasound to assess \"normal\" vs \"abnormal\" nodes, so I'd be comfortable with that assessment by your radiologist. As for your risk for bc, an article published in the Annals of Oncology stated \" According to the statistics from American Cancer Society, 95% of new cases and 97% of breast cancer mortality occurred in women aged 40 and older during 2000\u20132004; in the same period, women aged 20\u201324 years had the lowest breast cancer incidence rate, 1.4 cases per 100 000 women\". That means that, without any other factors that increase your personal risk, you have a very very slim chance of this being anything other than benign.

If I understand what you are reporting correctly, her diagnosis is now IDC ER/PR+ and Her2+ or Triple Positive (Fish refers to a type of testing for the HER2 protein, btw, there is a forum for HER2+ bc). HER2+ bc tends to be more aggressive than HER2- bc and typically means that targeted therapy (like Herceptin or Perjeta) will be recommended. Targeted therapy is done in conjunction with chemo, so that is also a typical recommendation.

If they cannot get good images using regular mammo, 3d mammo or mri might be recommended. IF what they see on imaging has specific characteristics, then they may recommend a biopsy. IF what they see has clearly b9 characteristics, then they may recommend short interval follow up. Either way, it is good practice to get a copy of your written imaging report and carefully read the impression and recommendation sections as well as noting the BIRADS score. That will give you quite a bit of good information about the likelihood that your lump is \"bad\". Please feel free to post any confusing language here and we'll help you sort it out. Good luck!",

It may have saved my life, as there were 2 more tumors that had not been seen by either mammo or us in a completely different quadrant (that were a tiny bit more aggressive (comedo necrosis) than the lump that got my attention).

If you are referred for an ultra sound, what is typical is that you get a diagnostic mammogram (more views from different angles) in conjunction with an ultrasound as the two imaging technologies combined provide for better diagnostics. If, after those 2 technologies are applied, then sometimes, women might go in for an mri. During an mri, they use a dye and watch how the dye is both taken in and then \"washed out\" of an area. The pattern of uptake and washout can be very telling to an experienced radiologist and things in dense breast tissue can be \"seen\" that can't be seen with mammo or us. They are doing what they should, please don't be alarmed at that. Also, there are radiation techs that typically perform the us, but it should be read by the radiologist as well (hence a potential delay).

You will be seeing the surgeon again in 2 months, after the additional images and reports are written? (not before). Well, #$%. Sorry, I would be super frustrated. It is understandable that after the confusion around where/who your results would be given to you, and that the doc that gave you the results had nothing to do with your care, that you were relieved enough just to get the results. I'm honestly waffling between encouraging you to get a second opinion (BIRADS 4c does have a high suspicion of malignancy) and thinking that 2 months isn't that long. But only you know how disruptive the wait and worrying has been to your life, and what your 'gut' is telling you. For the pathology not to have listed what the mass IS, and only to have said it isn't bc doesn't sound right. I am not a doctor, but that sounds IMO like a case of discordant findings (when the anticipated outcome doesn't match the actual pathology results). Typically, with discordant findings, all of the reports, images and procedure notes are examined to make sense of the results. It doesn't sound like that is happening, which is why I'm leaning towards a second opinion. Is there a well respected center anywhere near you where you could get a second?",

I agree with Hopeful, there are some distinctive features on imaging that can be pretty suggestive and IMO they wouldn't give you the bc 'news' unless they were pretty confident. A biopsy is technically the final say, but they do sound confident (based on your post). Do call if you haven't heard by 3pm as there is no need to go through the weekend in limbo. Also, do start collecting all of your reports and images for your own records - there's no telling when you might need your own copies (mine have come in handy a time or two). When you go in for your biopsy, ask them how long pathology will take, as that is your next waiting time before you have any 'real' tangible idea of what's going on.

I am in agreement with the others above, I believe that her age (and RBC status) is affecting the options. I also, very respectfully and gently, suggest that you listen to your Mom and what she wants. It sounds like you want her to have all of the information, and that you'd prefer a more aggressive approach. But we all need different amounts of information. Some women need more, some don't respond well to more. And quality of life should NOT be underestimated. My father had laryngeal cancer. Due to his age, the treatment was surgery plus rads. If they had been really clear about the side effects of rads, I'm not sure he would have done it. He was already 80 and, after 2 bouts of hospitalization with aspiration pneumonia, they realized his airway wasn't protected when he ate or drank any longer (se from rads). He had a peg tube the last year of his life and it was awful for him. He could smell, but never taste the food that he had loved his whole life. To spend the last years that way is something that he never would have chosen had he known. The cancer didn't kill my father, but the side effect of one of the treatments left him with a life he never would have chosen and once he realized it would never get better, he gave up and passed away. I know the situations are very different, but I hope that helps think about the toll that treatment can take and the impact of that toll. She does need to have information on treatment options; but if she and her doctors decide to go less aggressive than you'd like, please do trust her judgment. ((hugs))",

You got some relief from the creams she prescribed, but a rebound of the symptoms upon discontinuation. That actually might give the dermatologist more information for her diagnostic process.

Every time your mind starts to go to the \"what if\"/scary place, you need to grab ahold of it and tell yourself (out loud actually works better) \"I have seen medical providers about this and I DO NOT HAVE IBC\" and then you need to distract yourself with something else to get your mind off of this persistent worry.

I'll add that your traumatic response to your father's cancer diagnosis and treatment sounds significant. In fact, I would suggest that you give thought to seeing a counselor about it. There are many effective treatments for trauma (like EMDR) that can allow you to process these events as information, instead of a traumatic trigger. It is really helpful, when we have the ability to sort out what are real concerning symptoms and then be able to let go of the fear when a reasonable diagnostic workup has been performed and diagnosis sorted out. Sometimes we do have a feeling in our 'gut' and need to be able to trust that feeling and pursue a second opinion or additional diagnostics. When every twinge is perceived as \"red alert, it's cancer\"; then you'll live your life in constant fear and not really be able to 'trust your gut' because it will always be saying the same thing. That is really bad for your overall health, not to mention quality of life. Please take this in the spirit in which it was intended. Anxiety sucks!",

To some (few), it can exacerbate their fears about getting/having cancer. Because the women here are not the norm. We don't represent a typical group of women. If someone is reading threads here, and using that info as 'research' about what can happen (i.e. to bolster/justify their fear), then they are using a skewed sample, meaning we aren't representative of the general population. I'm sorry if my suggestion made it sound as if your anxiety were unfounded, quite the contrary. I do know how anxiety provoking it can be to go through the diagnostic process. I would never intentionally downplay how difficult it can be. I was just thinking about how horrible anxiety is on a daily/weekly/monthly basis. And, for full disclosure, I'm a therapist, and so, biased. :) Really wishing for B9 results for you!",

I'll briefly answer your questions, knowing that others will come along and give you some more detailed answers. DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) by definition stays in the ducts and isn't invasive. The IDC or invasive ductal carcinoma is invasive, meaning it could have spread. IDC is commonly found together with DCIS, but the DCIS will not alter your treatment as any treatment for IDC will most surely take care of the DCIS. Your IDC will be the focus. Most likely, you will have more scans ordered (like a CT) to look at your lymph nodes or other areas of your body to see if there has been spread. Once they have those answers back, they can give you your stage, which also effects your treatment. Her2 neu over-expression drives rapid growth, so negative means that your cancer cells are not over expressing HER2 neu. (That just means that you won't be receiving a targeted therapy that focuses on HER2+ bc.) I would recommend that you join the IDC forum and post a brief description (as you did above) in order to connect to others with similar stats and to find women with whom you can discuss treatment options. There is so much knowledge, experience and support here. Please do let us know how we can help! sending you gentle ((hugs))",

Worst case scenario, he/she recommends the same thing, best case, he/she orders additional imaging (at another locale) and decides it is in fact b9 and does not recommend biopsy. Either way, you'll have more confidence in that person's recommendations and you can give them your medical history to insure that all appropriate precautions are taken on your behalf.

The mri isn't routinely used as a front line imaging tech as it is very sensitive (sees lots of things other imaging doesn't) but isn't specific (sees lots of things other than bc). The numerous findings then leads to biopsies, the vast majority of which are b9. (so $$ and lots of anxiety). Meet with the bs, take a list of your questions and maybe another person to be able to listen and remember for you (hard to retain info properly when we're really anxious) or recording device.

This may factor into the negative recommendation for mammo from the OB NP. Maybe talk to the GP about your concerns and ask for his/her recommendation. There are other technologies that are more effective for dense breasts, but without a \"finding\" (i.e. lump or other concern IN your breast) not sure what will be investigated, AND insurance will most likely not cover it. For example, when women present with a lump (like I did at 38), they are referred for a diagnostic mammo (this has more views than a screening mammo) coupled with an US (ultrasound \"sees\" tissue differently, so the combination provides additional information). Younger women on these boards have been monitored using other technology, depending on the situation, their presenting issue, family history etc. So glad that you are feeling more at ease and good luck at your GP's next week!",

HER2 neu (a tyrosine kinase protein receptor) is typically sent out to a specialty lab, so comes back a bit later. These are the hormones that \"feed\" tumors. If the ER comes back +, then typically, after surgery, there is a follow up treatment with either Tamox or an AI. HER2 also has a targeted treatment (Herceptin), but it is not typically used in DCIS. I do believe that there are studies being conducted about whether it is useful and whether the risks/benefits make sense for DCIS (I believe there are ladies on these boards who had DCIS and used it). You should get a written copy of your pathology report for your own records. As for extensiveness, I had what is called multi-focal/mulit-centric DCIS. That means that they found several tumors in different quadrants. It is not uncommon, especially for certain architecture types. I had cribriform, papillary and micro-papillary architecture. My understanding is that cribriform poses a higher risk for multi-focal disease. That is actually why I had an MRI after my lx. I got a second opinion on my pathology from a specialist in DCIS and he suggested due to my age and the architecture, that I should look for more disease before I underwent radiation. (that news came the exact day before I was scheduled to start my first radiotherapy mapping appointment) I paused my rad treatment and went for mri, which found 2 other areas of concern, which when biopsied also turned out to be DCIS. They recommended mx at that point, as I had very close margins on my original lx (and had thrown a hematoma from that surgery). They did pathology on the mx tissue as well, and found that the 2 other lumps were similar in architecture, no micro-invasion or idc, but areas of comedo necrosis were present. Genetic testing is done to determine if you have any gene abnormalities that typically result in a higher risk for certain types of cancer (BRCA 1 or 2 are the most well known, but there are numerous others). This is not done on your biopsy tissue, but is a separate procedure. You should get genetic counseling to help you decide the risks benefits of this and to help understand what the results mean if you do proceed with this. These results sometimes impact people's treatment decisions as they can change your future risk. I know it is a lot to take in right now, but keep asking any questions you have. Either/both here and with your treatment team. The more you know, the better decisions you can make for yourself. It is overwhelming, and no one minds repeating or restating things. If you do have questions for your team, write them down and then either write or record their answers so you can go back over it and refresh your memory. It is amazing how some things can slip right out of the brain when it is overwhelmed. Sending you healing light and ((hugs)).",

If you get more details, there will be women here who've been through similar and who can speak to the current treatment options so you have a better understanding of what may come for your DD. The other thing that may be helpful is the forum for family members/friends and caregivers. There will certainly be other Moms there who are worried about their DDs and they may have some comforting words for you. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/16 So sorry for your DD!",

I don't believe with BRCA testing you would say you have a \"false negative or false positive\". You either have the gene mutation or you don't. That being said, they are continuing to collect evidence suggesting additional gene mutations other than just BRCA convey increased risk for bc. I don't believe this site encourages BRCA testing as a replacement for actual monitoring for disease, more as additional personal risk information. Can you provide a link where you read that BRCA testing is a \"benchmark for bc\" and should replace imaging?",

As far as the biopsy, I felt some discomfort during the procedure, but nothing that some ice and a few over the counter pain relievers didn't fix. I didn't even need those the next day. Please make sure and ask your center for little ice packs if they have them (they are small and round and fit neatly inside your bra for maximum comfort). Ask for a couple so that one can stay in the freezer and one on the site. Each lab is different in how long results take, so be sure to ask them when they are expected and if they'll tell you over the phone or if you'll need to be seen in person (facilities vary in this regard). Also, ask them to send you a copy of your pathology report and ask for a copy of your images for your own personal records. Either way, having a set of them lets you provide them to a future different imaging center or medical provider as needed. The other thing you might discuss with your provider is genetic testing. Given the family history you've described above, it doesn't seem out of the question. And could justify increased future monitoring.

Please do continue to follow your physicians advice if he/she has advised against this, but gentle stretches turned the corner for me. Trying not to move (or go over bumps in the car, ouch!) means you may be 'guarding' your arm and that only leads to more tightness and discomfort. Let's see if others have additional advice for you.

The poster was a bit (understandably) annoyed that she didn't get a biopsy, but the 2nd steroid cream actually worked. I am going to try to find that thread to post for you to look at here. Not sure the symptoms are exactly the same, but it could give you an idea of other work ups for nipple/areola symptoms. edited to add, here is the link: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/83/topics/856763?page=2#idx_45 Hope it helps!",

There is a forum http://anxietyforum.net/ that will let you interact with others who are also dealing with different types of anxiety. That site is actually more useful for your ongoing mental health and anxiety reduction than a breast health site, where you are going to consistently be focused on your breast and \" Nothing came out on US so I ask the question, what is causing all this?

But you will want to know your BIRADS score, which should correspond to their recommendation. For diagnostic screening, BIRADS 3, 4 or 5 are your 'options', and 4 or 5 mean biopsy. Typically, 3 means a shorter interval follow up to monitor for changes as the chances of it being bc are very very small.

Some of what you've posted is a bit conflicting, so it's hard to know how to respond. \"result BIRADS 4 and reported BIRADS 5\" doesn't make sense. So, BIRADS 4 biopsies typically come back anywhere from 70-80% benign. \"BI-RADS category 5 is usually reserved for lesions having a 95% probability of malignancy. After biopsy the average rate of carcinoma in category 5 biopsies is about 75-97%.\" http://breast-cancer.ca/bi-rads/ But even then, as you see from the stats, it isn't cancer until the pathology report says \"cancer\". At that point, there still is no \"life expectancy\" info because breast cancer isn't just breast cancer. It is: DCIS, IDC. ILC, IBC etc etc and there are grades (how disorganized the cells are) and receptors (whether estrogen or progesterone \"feed\" the cancer) and HER2 expression (a sign of rapid replication) etc etc as well as stages (how big is the area of cancer, has is spread to lymph nodes or other areas of the body) before \"life expectancy\" can be discussed.

There will be others along shortly to give you more info (and support), but I wanted to let you know that the DCIS part of your bc will not be the focus, as anything that is needed to treat the IDC portion will most certainly take care of the DICS as well. The DCIS could affect how much tissue needs to be removed (sometimes women may have a large amount of DCIS and a smaller amount of IDC) so may affect your surgical recommendations, but the dcis will not alter your other treatment recommendations. The information that you'll be looking for next will be the hormone receptor status, her2 status etc, from your IDC. Those characteristics will inform your treatment as well as the size of the area and extent of involvement. I think the thoughts about a bmx is common initially, but that won't reduce your risk to 0%, so you should be aware of your personal risk profile to make the best decision for you. And while not having the BRCA is certainly good news, only about 10-11% of bc has been linked to the genetic mutations that we know of so far. Sending you warm thoughts and gentle ((hugs))",

Tender breasts for 3 days are most likely from cycling hormones. Here is the breast cancer diagnostic process:  Notice that of the women who get a diagnostic workup, 75% are given b9 results and returned to either routine or 6 month follow up. The other 25% of the women (who get a diagnostic workup) are referred to get a biopsy. Of those women, 80% are told they have a benign or atypical result and they can also return to either routine or an increased screening regimen. So you are getting WAY off base from what the doctor who saw you thinks and what the statistics actually say at this point in your diagnostic process. Try to stay distracted and keep yourself busy. Hold on to what you know, not what you fear. Good luck for b9 results!",

Now, all breast surgeons are technically general surgeons. There isn't an actual designation (like there is for PS). But how much of their practice focuses on breast surgery (as opposed to, say, appendectomies or cholecystectomies) will give you quite a bit of information. If they've done some sort of specialized training, or include staying current on new breast surgery developments through their annual continuing medical education; then you can feel more secure. You can find out about how much breast work they do by calling the office and asking. If you don't like their answer, get a referral for someone else. Good luck!",

I do understand that when another member of the family has cancer, it tends to make others more anxious about their own health. But educating yourself, like talking to your doctor about your own breast health, may be useful. Young women's breasts are typically dense, and prone to change, have discomfort or go through fibrocystic changes. Your gyn may be able to discuss this with you and give you information to help alleviate your fears. Please look carefully at these statistics to help you feel less anxious while you wait for your appointment:  Please note that for the group of women between the ages of 20-34, there is only a 1.8% risk of getting a breast cancer diagnosis. That isn't a 1.8% for 21 year olds, that is a 1.8% total risk spread across the whole group, which means that your risk at 21 is phenomenally low. Good luck!",

Focus on what you know to be true: \"the numbers that are in my favour - 80% of biopsies are negative for cancer, breast cancer in your 30s isn't terribly common, the doctor said 5-50% of cancer which means 50-95% chance that it isn't\" NOT what you fear. When you start to go down that 'what if' rabbit hole, stop yourself and focus on what you know. Keep yourself busy with Thanksgiving festivities, bake or cook something that requires your full attention. Deep clean something. Go for a long walk. You'll get your results soon and then you can respond to something real, not something imagined/feared. Your anxiety today won't change those results, so it doesn't help you at all.

Your doctor did an exam, and does not believe that there is cause for alarm. That should help you feel a bit better. Also, 20 year olds are at extraordinarily low risk for BC. See chart below:  Please notice that you are in the age bracket that includes 15 years worth of women and represents only 1.8% of the women diagnosed with bc in the US. So it is possible, just very statistically unlikely. Also note, mammograms are not typically used in 20 year olds, even if there is an issue, as their breast tissue is normally too dense for the mammo to \"see\" through. An ultra sound would be a more appropriate imaging technology for you. Now, fibrocystic breasts are more typical in younger women and can be painful. Please just take one step at a time. If the pain continues, follow up as your doctor directed.

The amount of tissue would depend entirely on the size of the area of concern. Did she tell you what the dimensions were? Taking into account wanting good clean margins, the size of tissue will be somewhat bigger than the actual area of concern. It sounds like the BS feels that they may have missed the biopsy site? (hence the discordance, imaging and her opinion vs B9 pathology) Even though I know waiting and worrying is the absolute worst, I believe like your BS is acting out of prudent caution. My BS was the one who sounded the alarm for me, everyone else that saw or evaluated my lump said \"don't worry, it's most likely nothing\". He did not. He immediately encouraged me to pursue sampling, which meant we caught my bc very early; instead of 6 months or 1 year later. Try not to worry overly much, but I'd absolutely follow your BS's recommendations. Better to find out that it is B9, than not find out it isn't. ((hugs))",

I am glad that you have an appointment with a BS and MO next week to start talking about your treatment options. It might be helpful to read through some forums so that you can come up with a set of questions for which you'd like answers. (the surgery, before during and after forum; the idc forum and the radiation, before during and after forum) Also, either taking someone who can take notes for you or getting approval to record the discussion can let you review it later when you're not so overwhelmed. It is really difficult to hear and remember everything that will be discussed. Try to pamper yourself right now, as this time (when you have your diagnosis but don't really have your team or plan in place) is really difficult. Once you can start making decisions and get your treatment started, you will begin to feel more empowered.

Follow up as your doctor suggested, but try not to worry too much while you are waiting on your appointment.

Hopefully others will come along to answer the rest. Is it possible that microcalcifications were present before but not seen because of breast density? I believe that is possible. I have seen comments that, even though patients were told the area was considered contained, a mastectomy was suggested. I'm not sure what you mean by \"contained\". If you mean Ductal Carcinoma In-situ (meaning hasn't yet become invasive disease, i.e hasn't left the duct) then yes, I am one of them. The reason that mx was recommended for me was that after lx for a palpable lump, I had an mri that identified 2 other areas of concern in another quadrant of my right breast that also turned out to be dcis. Multi-focal/multi-centric dcis frequently comes with the recommendation for mx. Is it possible for SOME of the microcalcifications to be cancerous, while others are not? While there are both malignant and non-malignant causes for micro-calcs, I do not know if they are typically found mixed together in the same area of the breast. Maybe someone else knows that. Are there options other than mammogram for breast scannning, as I have read so much about mammograms actually being the cause of calcifications spreading? Let me address the second part of your question first. Mammograms do not cause the spreading of calcifications. If they did, the majority of women would present with very large areas of calcs (as the recommended age for women to begin mammos has been 40 (or before with higher risk) and would represent years of them before being diagnosed); and that isn't the case. So that information is false. As to additional options for imaging, there are ultra sound (which is better at seeing specific types of 'findings' in the breast) and mri (which is very sensitive, but not specific to bc, so creates the situation where many b9 things need to be biopsied). It is typical, when a finding can't be well enough identified through mammography, to add ultra sound, as 2 imaging types provide better information than just one alone. When mammo+us can't make a determination (or can't see well enough through dense breast tissue) then an mri may be recommended. That is the radiologist's job, to determine which imaging technology is best for the task and to evaluate the findings overall. ",

It is hard to tell from your summary above (instead of the actual language used in a report) exactly what happened. It sounds as if you have a summary of the procedure, but perhaps not your pathology? Typically, the pathology report comes separately, names and lists the sites samples and then what was found in each sample. re: \" It also states that she didn't do a mammo after because of my age\" that is because younger breast tissue is typically denser and mammos don't \"see\" well through dense tissue. It isn't \"an assumption\" as in 'we won't bother, she's too young to have bc', but an assumption that mammos aren't very useful in women your age. It sounds like, based on your comment \" My family is not like what they think is normal cancer hit fast and hard\" that you have had genetic testing (family carries a genetic mutation) and that is why you were surprised at your initial pathology? If that is the case, and you're being closely followed due to your increased risk, then why not call your doctor's office to sit down and review the procedure and pathology and make a plan for next steps.

People are exposed to the virus through skin to skin contact with another infected person and can be contracted in various places in the body through contact (i.e. to the throat - through oral sex, to the anus - through anal sex, to the genitals - through sex etc). Genital warts are caused by one of the HPV viruses and warts can be spread locally by autoinoculation; for example, no shaving around warts. Otherwise they don't spread body-wide.

The machine has \"plates\" (think flat, square glass plates, not dinner plates) that will squish whichever boob is placed in between them. They will try to get as much breast tissue in between the plates as possible. You lean into the machine to aid in that process. Then they squeeze. It is uncomfortable. They ask you to hold your breath while they take the images. As soon as they've taken the images the plates separate. So the discomfort doesn't last longer than you can hold your breath. Then they get a different view. Same procedure. The diagnostic process has several different views (screening has fewer). If it helps, this is the bc diagnostic process:  Notice that 75% of women having a diagnostic workup are either told to return to regular or shorter interval follow up. Of the 25% that are referred for biopsy, 80% have b9 or atypical follow up. Math is on your side right now. Try your best to just take one step at a time. Good luck for b9 results!",

From the source that I typically go to, I find \" A birads 4b has 36% chance of malignancy.\" Read more here: http://breast-cancer.ca/bi-rads/ If it makes you feel any better, there are 'things' that grow in breasts that aren't bc. Also, 70-80% of biopsies come back B9. Given the vast differences in opinion, a biopsy is the appropriate step. \" I really want to beg for them to just do the excisional biopsy and lymph nodes and get a step ahead instead of then waiting AGAIN for that.\" An excisional biopsy and especially any lymph node (SNB) removal would not be a good first step. There are risks that come along with those interventions that far outweigh the risk of an unidentified mass. The risk of lymphedema is present, even if they just remove 1 lymph node. I know that this has come as a surprise and that you are scared and angry, but take the first step to get a biopsy and pathology results before rushing too far ahead. Hoping they get you scheduled quickly so that you can get your results back quickly as well. Good luck for b9 results.",

It sounds as if you want to ignore the medical professionals who evaluated you based on their education and expertise in reading breast mri. Now I do realize that women frequently become hyper-sensitive to threats to their unborn babies. That is absolutely normal, and I think reasonably pursuing answers to your medical questions is important. I just think that there is a line between advocating for yourself and demanding medical providers do what you tell them to, instead of what is the standard of care. There are reasons, based on science/medicine that dictate when biopsies are done, or when additional imaging is done. And then there are reasons for what follow up is recommended. When you jump from one to another without the proper education/training/experience, you may be hamstringing the very people trying to provide you with good care. I, therefore, would go into the expert's office and provide the symptom history, scans and reports that you have to date and ask HIS opinion.",

What is sounds like to me is that your results were \"discordant\". What that means is that the biopsy did not match the expected results. Did you get an actual copy of your written report of the pathology? When they \"find\" something on imaging, your pathology results should then clarify what it is, i.e. radial scar, fibroadenoma etc (in this case that wouldn't match the spiculated description, but just as an example). It shouldn't say \"nothing found\" (i.e. normal breast tissue), as that indicates that they may have missed the targeted sampling area when they did the biopsy. When someone gets discordant results, the process can be different at different facilities, but should include a review by experts of both images and pathology to make a recommendation (re-imaging, re-biopsy). Sometimes, if an area is difficult to sample, there is a wire placed or clip placed so that they are sure to sample the right area. Did they do that for you? It didn't sound that way. In any case, the (older) doctor is most likely going through the discordant review process. As it's been a week, I'd call his office. It is time to get some answers. Be pushy if you need to be. Get a follow up appointment scheduled and bring a list of questions (and perhaps a level headed friend/spouse who can take notes). What you want to leave that appointment with is a diagnosis of what the find was on imaging OR a plan to advance that goal. If you have any more questions, please do ask us.",

Having worked closely with psychiatrists for years, I do understand how difficult it is to get in and see a new one urgently. So here is another work-around option that I'll toss out there (to add to the options above), at the clinic where I worked, we frequently got calls from docs (non-psychiatrists of all types) who had patients that they wanted to be seen urgently for meds. What we did much of the time was consult. For example, the lovely and compassionate new doctor might be able to call a psychiatrist that she is acquainted with and present your case and get guidance as to what meds (Ativan etc) would be helpful for your new doc to prescribe. It would be a good idea (if she was going to do this) for her to have a list of meds you've taken both with success and ones that you had poor or no response to (as well as your previous working diagnoses etc). Please pm me if I can be of assistance in putting together helpful info to further that consult. Don't forget to keep breathing, nice and steady. You can do this!",

NOT having acoustic shadowing is, then, good. As for increased blood flow, cancers typically require a blood supply of their own to grow, so they tend to show increased vascularity or blood flow. Not showing that is, again, good. These are the characteristics that they write in a report when they are seen. Yours didn't have them, so Lotusconnie is saying, that is a good sign.

So mri is usually reserved in the event of a finding not being clearly identified by mammo + us - which is your situation. The specialist is making recommendations based on standard protocols.

If I hadn't had the mri, identified remaining DCIS and then had mx, I would have happily gone into radiation after my initial lx, thinking the DCIS was all gone and perhaps had an invasive recurrence (I was triple neg, so not on Tamox or AIs). If you need the MRI, as you've had other imaging that aren't definitive (or you have breast density or a history that warrants it) it could save your life. I understand your reluctance, and agree that there may not be \" another alternative to finding (my) problem\". Sorry!",

How horrible for him not to have had an open and honest discussion with you about his concerns, instead of sending in his nurse to tell it to (at) you. Shame on him! Now, as for your question, I know that there have been women that I've heard from on these boards mention not using prescription pain meds after mx surgery. If you don't get enough responses on this forum, you could also try the \"surgery, before, during and after\" (but delete this one first so you don't have 2 different ones running and potentially getting the same info from the same people). I am also wondering about your feeling that you would have horrible withdrawal from short term use of opiates. I'm sure that your addiction could be triggered (I've worked with clients who struggled with addiction), and having support set up for yourself in anticipation of this would be very wise, but I'm not as sure that a post surgical injection or 2 and a day or two of opiates (which is all I actually used) would leave you withdrawing. Most likely you'd want a wash out period before you re-started your Suboxone. Personally, I'd want to have a quick consult with the provider of my Suboxone (many doctors are NOT familiar with how to use this medication) and discuss a plan to support your care, use of medications for pain control, and coordination of care (when to stop Sub., when to use opiates, when to stop opiates and then restart Subox.) and ask for your providers help in being on your treatment team. Then I'd have a come-to-Jesus meeting with my surgeon and discuss this wrinkle in your otherwise already made plan. You deserve care as we all do. Please don't let yourself be treated with any less respect than anyone else. If the line has somehow been drawn in the sand around taking opiates home, then talk to your surgeon about planning to stay in the hospital until your pain is well enough controlled to transition to over-the-counter pain meds. You can't heal properly if your pain and swelling cause more pain and swelling, that causes pain that causes swelling; and your surgeon knows this. so sorry!! ((hugs))",

It seems like you are one of the people that this applies to. Basically, our digital technology has gotten better; which is good. There has been an increase of over 11 people detected with bc per 1000 screened, since the digital mammo (improved sensitivity). Unfortunately, there has also been a 50% increase in the number of biopsies performed due to the increase in sensitivity (decreased specificity). There is now a call to improve the negative prognostic use of digital mammography so that we are able to catch more bc more quickly, but not put so many women through multiple biopsies and the anxiety that goes along with it. There are many, many women who go through multiple \"finds\" and biopsies to be told B9. In fact, 80% of BIRADS 4 biopsies are B9. BIRADS 4 is the lowest score where biopsy is warranted and insurance will cover it. so sorry you are going through this (again). I certainly realize that 'false-positives' might cause someone to be complacent, but your health is certainly worth vigilance :) There is something called the GAIL model, that could help you get some idea of your personal risk.

The only real way of knowing there is a problem (short of biopsy evidence) is changes in your mri, which won't be clear if it happens too soon. Do you have confidence in your surgeon? If yes, try to take some comfort from that and do your best to put your mind at ease. If no, seek a 2nd opinion (but be prepared to wait for the 6 months anyway due to above reasoning).

You are feeding it only what supports it's growth, instead of looking at balanced or scientific information. How many 20 year olds do you know? How many of them have had bc? Most likely, the answers are hundreds/thousands and none; in that order. Has it ever happened? yes. But you've now seen multiple doctors and you are discounting their medical opinion because you saw something on youtube and now know more than they do? Did you do what BarredOwl suggested \" Today, please request a copy of the Radiologist's written report, so that you can see for yourself if you are dealing with a no-brainer (e.g., clearly benign). I suggest that you work with a medical professional, such as your primary care physician (\"PCP\"), to help you understand YOUR results and obtain his view of whether you can feel comfortable relying on the professional medical assessment of the Radiologist.\"? If not, why not? It was a very reasonable approach to actually getting a medical opinion on what is going on, instead of conjecture based on googling. Please please, for your own sake, and the sake of the amazing women on these forums, who take time to support those going through diagnosis and treatment, stop feeding your anxiety about having bc. Stop googling bc, stop looking for it on youtube. This has clearly migrated from an issue of your breast health to an issue of your mental health. Anxiety is pernicious and debilitating.",

Call your insurance company. Keep heading up the ladder until you get somebody who can get it done. When someone \"can't help you\", then ask to be transferred to someone who can or their boss. Keep going until you have what you need. I'm not saying that I think you have a malignancy, but your concerned medical provider wants you to have a procedure. In the situation you describe (mammo finding, unable to locate with us) it is best practice to get another imaging technology. Each technology is best at certain things. We don't typically use mri as the second source, because it is very sensitive (finds lots of stuff) but is not as specific (doesn't just find malignancies), which results in many women having biopsies (the vast majority will be B9). BUT IN YOUR CASE, where us is not adding any additional information, it is totally appropriate. Using two imaging technologies is standard of care for areas of concern. You need to push them. Sorry if that is difficult to ask, but sometimes we have to be our own advocate! You can do it! Let us know what's going on and how we can help! Good luck!",

When an asymmetry appears, a spot compression sort of magnifies the area so they can see it better, it can clear up any issues like \"overlapping tissue\" when the spot compression shows \"nothing\" to be concerned about. I think you should 1) get a copy of your written report. that might explain why there is 6 month follow up recommended and then 2) if you still have questions, follow up with the radiologist when he/she is available (not an emergency, just follow up consultation) so you can understand the process better. It may be the imaging center's protocol to re-image women who've had an asymmetry, even when that has been cleared by spot compression. You would be able to better understand his reasoning from either the report or an in-person consultation. Good luck!",

Let me give you a link here: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/83/topics/858196?page=1#post_5033387 that is a thread on how to read your imaging report. The important passage, as it pertains to your report, is this, both oval and circumscribed are \"good\" descriptors, which is probably part of the reason they believe your mass appears b9. A BIRADS 3 score routinely recommends 6 month follow up to insure the area is stable, so that is consistent with the descriptors and recommendation. You can read more about complex vs complicated cysts here: https://radiopaedia.org/articles/complex-breast-cyst Basically, there are 3 types: simple (which is easy to distinguish on us, and is fluid filled), complicated (contain some debris or texture inside the well-defined cystic structure - the recommendation is usually 6 month follow up) and complex (which is sometimes called complex cystic mass or solid and cystic mass; so it isn't confused with complicated cyst - the recommendation is typically biopsy). Hope this helps. DJMammo may also swing by to add his more expert opinion.",

What concerns me now is \"my head began to think of the stories I've read of women with IBC who's biopsy's were originally negative to later have a positive one.\" Sometimes, when we've been in a situation where our anxiety is really high (like a health scare), it is hard to get the anxiety to go back down to \"normal\". When that happens, we can continue to focus on the thing we fear (which is now gone) instead of focusing on what we know to be true. As long as you focus on the thing that you fear, you'll continue to have the \"feeling of doom\". What we know to be true is that you've seen a dermatologist who examined you and said that you \"absolutely do not have IBC\" and that the rash was actually \"looking better\". What is also true is that (in order to make you feel better) she also did a punch biopsy to verify that you do not have IBC, and it came back negative for IBC. That the dermatologist said your rash is looking better means that it is NOT progressing in a rapid and aggressive way, like IBC does. So please try your best, when the fears start nagging at you, to go through the list of things you know to be true, focus on the rational and logical facts: I've seen a dermatologist who says I do not have IBC, I have a rash; and I've had a punch biopsy that indicates I do not have IBC. If you continue to struggle with the anxiety, then I do think an urgent referral to a counselor is in order; anxiety can consume your life and that would be an awful waste!

I asked to be discharged the same day of my mx surgery (had the surgery at 7am and went home about 2pm) and after my surgeon rounded on me, he agreed. I did not have any recon at that time, and had no problems healing (I don't know if you have had any healing issues in the past, that might make a difference). I restricted my activities pretty significantly for a few days, but was wearing big sweaters (to cover my drain collection reservoir - similar to a very small canteen) with jeans and moving around pretty easily after the first few days. How do I use the washroom etc? I was not allowed to shower for quite awhile initially, but didn't have any problem using the bathroom as I only had umx, not bmx. My partner washed my hair for me in the kitchen sink, so that was helpful. How do I even get clothes on since i won't be able to lift my hands. I am envisioning lots of pain if any one can shed some light re after the surgery what to expect. If you are having bmx, then I imagine that your inconvenience will be more significant than umx. I was able to dress myself (again, the first couple of days I was in jammy pants and big soft button up fleecy tops or a bathrobe) without any assistance after surgery. I did stay with a friend (a doc who put a baby monitor in my room in case I needed help) but never needed her assistance. I would say that I had quite a bit of discomfort, but not \"lots of pain\". Now, I am told I have a high pain threshold, but I only took pain meds during the day for the first few days. After that, I took them at night for several more days and then I was on only OTCs. It was important for me (mentally) to get back to normal as soon as possible, which meant that I had goals set for myself to get back to work (I'm a therapist, so mainly sitting while at work) as quickly as I could. I was back at work within 2 weeks. Everyone is different in how quickly they heal, how they experience pain and how they recover. Do try to prepare yourself, but I'm hoping you find that your recovery is much easier than you are anticipating. ((hugs))",

If you do that, you should absolutely have the images (you are legally entitled to a copy on disc) as well as the written report (not the patient letter) from the first opinion, to take with you to your second opinion.

It isn't uncommon for women to have skin issues on their breasts and become convinced that it is bc and seek treatment from an OB/GYN, Radiologist and BS, when in the end a Dermatologist is what's needed. The same may be true here. Whatever is causing yout pain should be found, but it doesn't mean that it will be found in your breast tissue. There is a strong possibility that the mri might \"find\" things in your breasts, as it is very sensitive. This might even lead to biopsies (70-80% of which are b9). But as DJMammo has suggested, if you actually had metastatic bc at the age of 28, it would be extraordinarily unusual. In fact,  Please note that the category of women to which you belong comprises 15 years worth of women and represents only 1.8% of all the bc diagnosed in the US. You don't seem to be \"brushed off\" by the doctors. They've done exams and ordered imaging studies. You just may be seeing the wrong kind of doctor because it isn't breast related.

This thread hasn't been active since 2009, but I can answer some of your questions. BIRADS 4c has a positive predictive value of 79%, which means that in 79% of the time a BIRADS 4c finding is malignant. Notice that isn't 100%, so there is still room for a b9 pathology result, but given the radiologist's impression, I would encourage you to try and prepare yourself mentally for a bc diagnosis, continuing to hope that it isn't. I guess I'm not sure whether it really matters whether a surgeon (who does some biopsies) is better than the Radiologist (who does lots of biopsies), but if you already have your biopsy scheduled, that point is mute. I would ask them on Thursday when they expect to get your pathology results back, and also if they will insist on you having a follow up appointment to get the results, or if they will give them over the phone. (different facilities have different protocols and it helps to set expectations) If they want you to have a follow up appointment, I would encourage you to bring someone with you as it can be difficult to remember to ask questions and take in all of the information given - even with b9 results (in that case there will be short interval follow up, or sometimes even removal is recommended). That person can be there to support or celebrate with you. Sending you positive thoughts for b9 results.",

Shorter time than that isn't long enough to be certain. But if they didn't find anything, there is no reason to believe that they will suddenly find something 2 months later. The unfortunate fact, Littlewhite, is that many women have breast pain where no cause can be found. There is a radiologist who comments on these boards, who has said that breast pain was the number one presenting concern at his old clinic and that many women didn't have any cause that could be found. so it could be something, and should most definitely be checked out. But if nothing is found by several different imaging technologies (like mammo plus ultra sound or mri), then there is a point at which the answer is, we don't know what is causing it.

You need to find a balance of noticing, but not being irrational about it. You need to notice changes, so that you can present them for a medical workup when necessary. But you need to remain rational so that you can hear and believe credible experts when they examine you and give you their opinions.

Following up in either 3, 6 or 12 months, when the risk of breast cancer is believed to be less than 2% (based on characteristics and imaging) is very common. What they are doing is seeing if the area is stable over time, or if it changes/grows. There are also benign things that grow, so that criteria alone doesn't suggest malignancy, just closer inspection. See the diagram below:  May I ask your age? and whether you have any family history that increases your personal risk? These are also factors that are considered. If you continue to have concerns about the lump, you could discuss getting an mri with your provider. MRI are much more sensitive, but not specific; meaning they find lots of stuff, but it isn't necessarily cancer. The sensitivity leads to an increased number of things that then have to be biopsied for verification. Hope that helps somewhat. The waiting is the worst, but some women are on 'enhanced' imaging protocols (going every 3 or 6 months) for years. Good luck!",

The EU has actually banned the use of the most popular contrast agents used for mri in the US due to gadolinium build up in the body. Alternate imaging is recommended to limit a person's exposure to too much of either imaging's risk.",

There is a contrast agent that uses chelated gadolinium, which I understand is easier for the kidneys to remove. I guess my point (to Lisa) was that she was focusing on the radiation risk posed by mammos without considering that mri also poses some risks. However, IMO, the risk of NOT using the imaging technologies we have in pursuit of early detection for bc is far greater.",

MRI are used in specific situations, for example when mammo + us doesn't answer a diagnostic question with sufficient certainty. (or even when a palpable lump isn't \"seen\" on mammo + us, but is concerning). As far as \"false positives\", mri are very sensitive (meaning they \"see\" lots of things other imaging sources don't) but they aren't very specific (meaning that what they \"see\" isn't necessarily malignant). There are contrast agents that help with that differentiation, in that the pattern of uptake and washout of the dye in the area of suspicion, can be more similar to a b9 or a malignant process. The definitive answer comes from biopsy, however, not imaging. So your surgeon needs to \"see\" the area before he can sample it.",

There are circumstances where rad schedules may be different or even not recommended. I recovered quite quickly from my lx, and was back working within days. Everyone is different, and I would make sure to discuss the \"don't do well with surgery\" specifics with your surgical team and/or anesthesiologist (whichever is the most appropriate). There are very informative forums (DCIS, Radiation, Surgery etc) for you to read through to collect a good list of questions (when you're ready) for various members of your team. One step at a time. Try your best to start good self-care practices now. Work on finding out what things help you to relax, which are your best distraction techniques and what helps you sleep. If sleep is elusive, don't hesitate to ask one of your team for something to take. You'll need your rest for clear decision making and healing. We are all here for you, please do ask questions and let us know what you need! ((hugs))",
