I know everything about survival rates, etc. You do not have to panic, but you have to be wise! There can be more innocent phyllodes tumors, but if you have rapidly growing and returning tumor(s) I would not hesitate one second and have them urgently removed. If the doctor advises partial mastectomy, don't hesitate, do it. Yours sound aggressive, so don't hesitate. Reconstructive surgery is optional, that depends on you. At 30 I would seriously consider that. A second opinion is always helpful, but don't wait with this. I don't mean you should panic, but I do mean you should act decisively and take care of this, take steps right away. Good luck with everything. My sister is still doing fine by the way, so things can go well again.",
