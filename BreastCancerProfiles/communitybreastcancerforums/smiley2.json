But I have seen and known many gals that are stage 0 and stage 1 and end up stage 4.  You assume you would never be stage 4 because you just have this \"litte tiny breast cancer\" and doctors even tell you that you will be fine.  But cancer is sneaky.  So for Guliana to act like she is just going to get on with life.....I don't think she is sending a good message.  And that isn't to say you should live your life after a diagnosis focusing only on breast cancer because God knows we all need a break from this disease and isn't it a great day when you can go a day, an hour or a minute without thinking about his disease.  But just the fact that she just wants to shove it out of her existance..... And I get the issue of having a baby.  I was stubborn and was determined to have more kids.  Maybe if I realized the severity of even a stage 2 breast cancer diagnosis and went all out on shutting down hormones and having ovaries out,  etc....mabye I wouldn't be in this stage today.  Bottom line, I would do so many things differently if I could go back to my stage 2 diagnosis and I just hope she is doing something rather than assuming \"I am just stage 0 or stage 1\"....nothing to worry about!",
