It would be best if the doc could be with you to explain them. I wouldn't just read the report all by yourself. Too stressful. Also, you might not understand the results, and then you'd be even more freaked out. Most docs want to tell you once the results are in. Maybe you can make an appointment with the doc once you know they are in? Good luck...",

You will probably have some type of surgery, and then you will have some other treatments as well (chemo, radiation, or medication, for example). As time passes, things will feel more normal: the \"new normal.\" This is definitely the hardest time. Hang in there!",

In the end, I decided that I really didn't want to deal with the side effects of chemo. I had radiation and then hormonal therapy, and to add just a bit more, I'm also doing a study that uses ovarian suppression.  Some studies show that ovarian suppression may be what happens with chemo anyway, and that reducing the hormone is what gives women the benefit in terms of recurrence. So I opted for that route. Good luck with your decision. Do what is best for you.",

I remember the chemo decision and discussion to be the most stressful part of the whole BC experience. My onc was pushing for chemo, even after my Oncotype came back in the \"low\" range.  I really wanted to avoid chemo as nausea is an issue for me. So in the end, my onc agreed with the no chemo. But it was a struggle.  The Oncotype score will help with this decision. You also need to determine, for yourself, if you feel that chemo will benefit you. Apparently the chemo regimens today are much better than they were in the past, and the anti-nausea drugs are much better. So most people get through it okay. Good luck with this decision.",

I don't think the tattoos had to do with the margins of the radiation treatment at all...it's just to make sure that you are lined up correctly.",

May have to go in again (re-excise) to get a good \"margin\" around the lump. Then, as someone else said, you should have a sentinal node biopsy, if they do that procedure where you are, to see if the cancer has spread into the nodes. If it hasn't, you can get the Oncotype Dx test done on your tumor and they will see if you would benefit from chemo. It's a process...take it one step at a time... and good luck.",
