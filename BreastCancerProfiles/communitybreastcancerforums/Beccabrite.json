Diagnosed May 27, thought first would be surgery but after my PET scan found a couple of node involvement they switched gears on me, saw the oncologist first time July 12.  Was going to begin chemo immediately, but they found a gum infection during dental work... so, two weeks of antibiotics and NOW have my port in and ready to go 65 Days after diagnosis!!!! TC X 6 cycles neoadjuvant, then surgery, then radiation. ",
