I am very small breasted -- barely a B cup, and my lumpectomy and re-excision left my affected breast very VERY small. I've been wearing a homemade prosthesis, but when I had my first post-rad mamo, I experienced pain and inconvenience (the whole thing took twice as long as usual because the breast is just so small). I'm considering reconstruction now. Have any of you thought of reconstruction or had it? Do you have any tips? Thank you all for sharing your experiences. I, too, couldn't work during my treatment because I was too exhausted! I was having pain, but I think it's just because of my small breast size (and, I'm thin, too). Luckily, however, I have minimal lumpiness and no discoloration. Sweetpea, I'm feeling more and more like my treatment is a distant memory, so hang in there!",
