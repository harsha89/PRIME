    "Content": "Dec 29, 2016 01:58PM - edited Dec 29, 2016 02:42PM by HBK Finished radiation at the end of August. Diagnosed with pleurisy in December, 4 months after radiation. Relieved it wasn't a heart attack or blood clot. Very scary symptoms, especially since I had a small panic attack from being scared and made it seem worse. Told everyone in the ER about my radiation treatment. No one mentioned the connection. But the stabbing pain centers on the very spot on my lung that the radiation Dr. had told me they couldn't avoid hitting. And it branches out from there. On Motrin, which is helping. Humidity helps my pleurisy. Feel susceptible to the condition as a former smoker and suffered from bronchitis as a kid. Condition brought on under cold, dry conditions - driving north from Florida to New England. Car heater, hotel heat, both very dry Very thankful for this forum. First helpful advice I've gotten. My doctors never warned of this side effect. Very frustrating how they won't be straight with us. Love and strength to all of you. HB",
