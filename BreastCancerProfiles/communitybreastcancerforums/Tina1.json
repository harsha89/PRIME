I finally found one who can do it with really short hair. Mine was 1-2 inches. I love my extensions. I have a full head of hair that is past my shoulders. It is really gentle and does not harm my new hair. The salon is called Plush and it is in Bear Delaware. The stylist is named Kitten. She is wonderful and I got my confidence as I look like I did before I got sick.",
