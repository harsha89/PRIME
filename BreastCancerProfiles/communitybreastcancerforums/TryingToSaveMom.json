It seemed to go very smoothly and she was doing very well for a couple of days after, but early Saturday morning she developed severe abdominal pain and had to go to the hospital emergency.  After tests and examination she was diagnosed with pancreatitis and admitted. Today she developed bowel / GI bleeding and the Drs are treating that too. The real puzzler is that all her pre chemo tests, scans and checkups were good. She doesn't drink and has never had pancreas. GI or bowel issues and had her gallbladder and appendix out years ago, which eliminates gallstones as a possible cause. All the Drs. said she had no outstanding health issues and was in good health - except for having TN BC of course.  The oncologists who've examined her this weekend say that pancreatitis is almost never a side effect of chemo and the sudden bleeding isn't normal either. Has anyone else here experienced any of these after chemoand if so were you able to get over them and succesfully continue with your chemo treatments? Poor mom is so discouraged. Only a week ago she was feeling great and ready to get on with her treatment. Now she is dejected, stuck in the hospital coping with these awful things and says she doesn't want to do any more chemo as it's done such bad things to her. Thanks in advance for your help.
