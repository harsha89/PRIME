This is such a frightening issue and it is so comforting to have someone you trust on your side.  Having said that, I still think its ok to scream, cry and stomp your feet if you need to...and sometimes, well, you need to.  The anxiety and tension have to go somewhere, right? I did want to tell you that I have been in twice for abnormal results.  Once last year with a mass that turned out to be benign and now with some \"focal asymmetries\" that seem (we are still waiting on a test result) to also be normal, involutional (aging, don't you know) changes.  Scary, yes but in the end, ok.  Yep, it sure do suck getting older, but I guess I'd better buck up and enjoy it.  I really thought someone would make an exception for me, didn't you?.  If it makes you feel any better, when I was under a twilight compound for a different kind of surgery I had the WILDEST dreams!  Hubba, hubba and nudge, nudge.  Maybe you can ask if you may have the same. It is also safer because you are out but not as deeply as a general.  They monitor you constantly to keep you just on this side of down for the count;  it is certainly worth a query. I must also say that Disney World is the best place to forget your troubles and absorb a little magic.  Have fun, kiss Mickey, believe in happy endings and have a great time with your kids if you can. Wishing you nothing but Pixie Dust...",
