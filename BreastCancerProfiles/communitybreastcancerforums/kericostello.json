I think I may have done something to strain myself on that side. Is it possible to dislodge the cathater? I have a call into my surgeon who is on call, but it is Sunday and I have not heard anything back yet. I'm just scared because I am scheduled to start my first chemo (TAC) on August 15th.

I finished up chemo late November 07, and notice that sometimes I feel like whatever muscle controls the swallowing reflex just feels really lazy. Sometimes I have to concentrate on making it work. I have recently been getting the senstaion that my throat feels like it is not open all the way. Kind of like something is tied around my neck and slightly choking me. It's the strangest feeling. I have no soreness whatsoever though. I should also mention that I had surgery to remove the right lobe of my thyroid (benign tumor) in December 07. I'm not sure which it is related to or if I should be concerned??? Keri :-) Dx 5/24/2007, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIB, Grade 2, 1/18 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
