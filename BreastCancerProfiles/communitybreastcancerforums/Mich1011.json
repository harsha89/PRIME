I went through the double mastectomy April 2008,  had a delayed reconstruction just completed in April 2009... went with the silicone implants... yes they are more natural and comfortable than the saline, my sister had the saline for a year and hated it....she went back and did the silicone as well.  I spent time trying to decide between the different reconstruction options and decided on the implants. Almost did no reconstruction, but opted to after 6 or 8 months.   Well I am very happy with the results of of the delayed reconstruction and can honestly say I would probably do it again.... hope all is well for your recovery!! ",
