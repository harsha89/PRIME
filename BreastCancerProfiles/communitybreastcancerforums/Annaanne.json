Also, I go there for all my follow up, despite living in Oregon.  I get results from my mammos within 15 minutes.  I get MRI results the next day.  I always have my scans on the same machines, read by the same radiologists.  When I have mammos, Giuliano also looks at them himself every time.   The nurses there are great.  I feel like I am in really good hands.  I am so grateful I found him. Everybody is different and your friend will know what's important to her.  It's such a personal decision.  Hope this helps.  By the way, I'm 4 1/2 years from dx and doing great. Good luck A  I know how important people skills are at the time of dx, when you are so scared.  But in retrospect, I wouldn't look for that from my surgeon.  Of course, you need to be able to talk to them, but I think personality is more important with an oncologist, who you will see much more often.   ",

But you can't keep it up forever. You must refill and recharge. Can you get help? Housecleaning? Cooking? Child care just so you can flake out? Can you carve out any time/money to do things that will relax and re energize you? (and give you permission to do nothing for a few hours) Massage, acupuncture, therapy, reading in bed, going to movies and plays, etc. Can friends of your husband's help with his needs? Do your friends and relatives know that you need some relief? Are you so competent that no one thinks of offering help? What you're feeling sounds totally appropriate considering your situation.
