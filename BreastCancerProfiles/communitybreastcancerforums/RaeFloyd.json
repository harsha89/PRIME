I had a lupectomy first, then a mastectomy on the same side(left), then a mastectomy on the right, followed by an axellary node removal a year later and now another tumor removed with lymph nodes that all tested positive. I am going to see my oncologist tomorrow to see whats next. All of this has been since 2001. Hopefully it hasn't spread anywhere else. I think I am a cancer magnet. Log in to post a reply",

We're doing 4 months of chemo, then radiation with another doctor, then herceptin for the rest of my life or until my heart acts up. If it comes back after this, then I guess I'll just fight some more. I feel pretty good since he seemed upbeat about everything.",
