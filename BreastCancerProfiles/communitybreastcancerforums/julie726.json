    "Content": "Oct 7, 2007 11:59AM - edited Oct 7, 2007 12:00PM by julie726 Stage 3a...I had an expander put in when my mastectomy was done.  Had it expanded apx. 8 months then had a \"gummy bear\" implant done. It was perfect for 3 whole weeks when it ruptured from my chest wall and had to be removed in emergency surgery.  Seems that the radiation did a lot of damage.  I now have a very strange looking mound where a breast used to be.  I have scheduled a new expander adventure for March '08 but am just not sure if I will go through with it.  The prosthesis isn't as bad as I thought it would be.  I was offered the diep flap initially but chose not to go for that at all.",
