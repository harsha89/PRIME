      "Content": "ksaghy wrote: I am 51 and have had recurrent mastitis for the past 5 years.  I have had countless aspirations, core biopsies and lumpectomies from a breast surgeon.  All were benign or showed \"metaplasia sheets\".  I eventually started seeing a gynecological oncologist because I wanted to find an end to the recurrent mastitis.  The oncologist is of the opinion not to biopsy or excise the aggravated cysts/area because it could lead to further dna/cell changes and create a higher risk for cancer.  I have had 5 cases just since Sept 2010.  This last episode was by far the worst in that it was more painful, achy joints, tiredness and finally as it began to heal lots of itching. It also reoccurs every time I exercise but since I am on the antibiotic it clears up overnight (weird).  I am now on a 60 day course of antibiotics.  My questions are:  1) does anyone else have this \"rare phenomenon\" as they have labeled it. 2) Does ultrasounds or MRIs diagnose IBC and 3) has anyone ever been told why the mastitis reoccurs in non-lactating women?  I know these are alot of questions but I am so confused and don't really know what to do next since this last episode was so different.   Thanks for any input you all have.  I have prayed daily since this started 5 yrs ago for all women who have cancer or received the diagnosis.   Log in to post a reply",
