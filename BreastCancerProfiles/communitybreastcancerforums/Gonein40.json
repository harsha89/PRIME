Keep in touch as I will let you know how I make out ok. ",

I know it sounds terrible but I was overwhelmed with anxiety before my treatments started. I cut my hair all off just because I didn't want long strands falling out on me. I just want to get this show on the road to recovery. I don't feel too bad other than tired. I can't believe how many times I've had to go to the bathroom.   Drink drink drink. I know it does the body good.  Hope everyone is not a wimp  like me.  Gtg get some rest.  Thanks for the great thread ladies. I lol forward to reading them all . Jetnet91 hope your second treatment wasn't that hard on ya. Hope u get your new look soon. Undecided whether or not to get one.  Time will tell. Ttyl all",

We also have been de-cluttering and preparing ourselves for the really bad days.  Let me know if u can how the first treatment is. If you can ok ",
