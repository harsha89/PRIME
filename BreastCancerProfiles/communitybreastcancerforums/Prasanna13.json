Actually I am still waiting for my result from pathology after the mastectomy as I am not sure yet whether I need to go for further treatment or not; hence I thought this was the correct area. I am new in this forum, and was not aware of it. My apologies. Thanks again. Prasanna xx",

I am Marfans syndrome and have metallic heart valve. I am on warfarin and also on HRT (hormone therapy) since 2008 as both my ovaries were removed due to suspected cancerous ovarian tumors. After the lumpectomy of my breast cancerous lump in 2010, I was given loads of radiotherapy. After that, I would say the last two years went fine and my quarterly, half yearly and annual follow up report in regards to breast was normal. However, I found another lump in the same breast in November last year; mammogram did not show any thing but in ultra sound, radiographer suspected something and biopsy was done instantly. The biopsy report shows I have breast cancer (recurrence) with grade 3 (aggressive) HER-2 positive with previous Ostrogen and Progestogen negative. My consultant surgeon told me I needed to undergo mastectomy as lumpectomy cannot be done due to recurrence and radiation was already given in that breast. I had mastecomy done just a week ago with removal of remaining auxillary lymph nodes; I was told whether I need to undergo chemotherapy or not depends on pathology result now, ie. if cancer spreads upto lymph nodes I may be given herceptin with chemotherapy as they cannot give me Tamoxifen. He also said due to metallic heart valve, chemo may affect adversely so unless the oncologist speak to my cardiologist he would not be able to advise me. I am much anxious about my result now. Is anybody else who has gone through the same problem like mine to suggest me? Does anybody know do i still need to undergo chemo if they do not find cancer spread to lymph nodes? Do you know the life span of this type of cancer though cancerous tumor was already removed. Your answer will be much appreciated. Thanks.
