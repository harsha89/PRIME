Due to a family history of breast cancer - my mum was diagnosed when she was about 30 years old and had a possible second primary at 43 (they were not able to decide if it was a second primary or a delayed recurrence), her mother had both breast and ovarian (though both were post menopausal) - I've been followed at the high risk clinic since I was 25 (I'm 34 now).  I get yearly mammograms and MRIs (spaced 6 months apart). I had my most recent MRI in December (day 7 of cycle, so reduced risk of false positives) and had a call back since they saw a new spot of enhancement (with contrast uptake).  They didn't see anything by mammogram or ultrasound, but still want to do an MRI guided biopsy. I don't really understand why they want a biopsy.  I get that sometimes ultrasounds/mammograms miss things, but I'm thinking it is much more likely that the MRI was a false positive.  Or am I wrong?  I've had call backs before and when the ultrasound and/or mammogram was clear, they sent me on my way.  Perhaps the other call backs didn't show contrast uptake?  I'm all for being \"better safe than sorry\", but should I be concerned? I suppose my question is: which is more likely - a false positive on the MRI or something being missed by ultrasound? Log in to post a reply",

I was just surprised that they didn't see anything on the ultrasound and mammogram today, but still want to biopsy.  I've had many call backs and that hasn't happend before.  So, I was looking to see if this was common (and what other people had experienced).  And, so get an idea of just *how* worried I should be.  Clearly, either the MRI was wrong or the ultrasound/mammogram was wrong - I just don't have a sense of which was more likely to be wrong.",
