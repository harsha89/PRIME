I had mamograms every year and never had a problem, although, now looking back at it, the reports always specified that I had dense breast tissue.  I know now that that was their way of saying that they really couldn't tell anything.  Anyway, in Dec. 2010, I got a call back for an ultrasound, apparently, nothing was showing in my breast, but one lymph node next to my breast showed on the mammogram as swollen.  So, I had the ultrasound and was told they couldn't find a tumor, so it must be an infection causing the lymph node to be swollen.  The radiologist suggested that I call my primary care doctor and get a prescription for antibotics to take for 6-8 weeks and then have another ultrasound to see if the lymph node had shrunk.  That didn't sound right to me as I hadn't been sick (and my sister had previously been diagnosed with DCIS and my aunt had had stage 1 breast cancer). I went to my PCP and she suggested getting another ultrasound at another facility. (So in Jan 2011 I went to a radiologist that specialized in breast imaging.  Best decision I ever made.  They saw the lymph node and biopsied it two days later.  I got a call the next day that it was cancer.  Later, an MRI showed two areas of cancer in the breast, one was about 3 cm and the other less than 1 cm.  I also had a PET scan which showed the cancer in the breast and a small area just outside the breast in the lymph nodes.  Although the PET didn't specify a number of lymph nodes, my oncologist said she thought it was one or two.  She suggested I have neoadjuvant chemo because I wanted reconstruction and she was worried that if I had surgery first and then had any infection from the expander it would delay the start of chemo.  She wanted to stop the cancer before it could spread. I am so glad that I did this.  I had TAC chem, 6 infusions.  It was tough, but at the end all tests, mammogram, ultrasound and MRI, showed no cancer remaining.  At surgery, six weeks after the end of chem, there was nothing.  Nine lymph nodes were removed and they were all negative.  No remaining tumor cells in the breast.  In fact, they could not even find a \"tumor bed\", the area where the tumor had been.  It gave me hope that I might beat this thing. I now feel great and am looking into a DIEP reconstruction in lieu of the implant I had originally planned. When I heard that I had cancer in my lymph nodes I thought I was doomed.  Now that I have discovered this site and read others experiences, I feel very positive. Best wishes to everyone on their journey.",
