Great so it was suggested that I do FEC_D (taxotere).. 6 treatments 3 weeks apart.. and i dont now if its 75 dose or 100..i know so few people on it. So my question is if anyone else is on it, why did there onc prescribe that.. why did they chose that over other chemos . I was told it was quite STIFF and so why with a low risk am i being pounded.. I wish ther was some real info on it. thanks to u ladies i might learn something new",

My words cannot express the sadness and sorrow i feel for you both. However , we  all want to help and I am sure I speak for everyone here. Know we can.. Heidi is special -her honesty, vulnerability and strength was strongly felt.  I think we can perhaps help by us all uniting in healing energy session. We can all send distant healing energy to Heidi. More powerful if we all do it together within the next 24 hours. Please  take down the website at the bottom and it clearly explains how to do a healing session. No charge. just read and do. There is much success in the power of healing Energy medicine. I can be performed absentia, across the miles or across the room, through focused intention. We will focus on manipulating \"life force\" to bring about balance and wellness to Heidi. Balance and wellness.. We will regenerates her Immune System  because for now, her energy is contaminated  and it's unable to function properly . THis contaminated energy gives  her immune system  wrong information to act upon and has broken down her immune system.  Don't get hung up on the process itself. ,,there is no perfect way or time. All reiki or other healers hear our words. Thank you http://www.wellbeingalignment.com/energy-healing-therapy.html",

What did ur doctors say... is anyone going to have ovarysuppression and or zometa.. I will also need to wait to start tamox even though doctors said it was fine to start all.
