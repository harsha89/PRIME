I also took all the precautions to avoid mouth sores, but did get a couple. I'm trying to remember all the anti-nausea meds they gave me. I know one was Emend and I took one very big tablet just as they were starting chemo, and had two tablets to take one on each of the next two days. I also had dexamethasone and ondansetron. I took all the meds I was supposed to when I was supposed to and never threw up once. I did feel quite queasy from time to time, but never threw up :-) You need to make sure you take the meds they give you at the times they tell you to. It's easier to stop nausea before it starts. Once you start throwing up it's very hard to stop. I also had very bad diarrhea - some people get constipated, others get the big D. Be prepared for either. My hair fell out too. Head hair to start with then every single hair on my body fell out lol - even my nose hair! My worst days were 3 and 4 after infusion, then I started to pick up. I didn't have Taxol - I had Taxotere and it nearly killed me. I couldn't finish it. So - for me at least FEC was very doable, soooo much better than the taxane. If I had to do chemo again, I wouldn't worry too much if it was FEC, I think I'd have to pass on a taxane though - too rough on my body. Taxol and Taxotere are part of the taxane group. Good luck!

FEC was not too bad - as everyone has said here - lots of water, take all the anti nausea meds, whether you think you need them or not, that will help a lot with the nausea.  I was never constipated - I was always the opposite lots of diahorrea.  My hair fell out around day 14.  I'd feel ok on the day of transfusion - would have a bad headache that night and be ok for a couple of days. Days 4 and 5 were bad for me. Taxoetere was altogether a different kettle of fish.  I ended up only having 2 doses.  Second dose was decreased substantially, but my body couldn't tolerate the drug.  On Taxotere my eyelashes and eyebrows fell out along with every single hair on my body - even in my nose lol but interestingly enough I started to grow some stubble on my head.  I had no nausea on T but flu like symptoms (very, very bad) along with mouth ulcers, heartburn, diarhoea (extreme) blistering on my private parts and extreme taste changes.  Even the air I was breathing smelled like a chemical.  Water tasted like mud which made it hard to keep hydrated. I need to stress though - not everyone will get these se's - we are all different, and you may not have any of them, or they may be mild.  I was just one of those who couldn't tolerate it - hence not doing the last dose. I am almost 12 months out now - and my hair, eyelashes and eyebrows (and all the other hairs) have grown back.  And I feel great! It's a long, hard road, but you can do it!  Trish",

As Annie said - you are usually pampered a bit - lovely recliner to sit in, warm blankets, food, water etc and the nurses fussing over you. My advice would be to take the Xanax (is that diazapam?) before you go in.  For your port - I'm usually not too bad with needles, but was pretty terrified about the needle they use to access the port (it's really not that bad) and I got some Emla cream.  Not sure if it's called the same thing over there - but it's an aneasethetic for your skin.  I'd put a pretty good dollop on the skin over the port and cover it with a plastic \"bandagey type of thing\" lol - don't know how else to describe it - sort of like Glad Wrap - Saran Wrap I think you guys call it? And left it for at least 3 hours before the port was to be accessed - and I never felt a thing :-) The main thing is to drink lots of water on the day you get chemo - as well as the following days, but as you are getting it to keep your bladder flushed - some chemos can be harsh on the bladder. Apart from that - depending on the type of chemo you are getting there's not too much to do to prepare.  If you are getting a taxane - ie taxotere, taxol etc you can ice your fingers, paint your nails black etc to minimise nail loss.  Some women have this happen - I never did.  I didn't ice, but I had lovely black polished fingernails for a couple of treatments lol. Make sure you bring something to keep you occupied - a movie to watch, a book to read, knitting or whatever you are into.  Chemo infusions can take a while. I was never allowed to have an infusion unless there was someone to drive me home.  My DH came with me, but as the treatments went on - I sent him out to do other things while I was there so I could relax and not worry about him being bored. Good luck with it - keep us informed, and ask if you have any questions at all. I'm over 2 years past chemo - and doing very well, feeling wonderful and on top of the world. (((((hugs)))) Trish",

With regard to the cold caps, I think they are reasonably common in the big hospitals in Australia - just not widely advertised. The Canberra Hospital has them, and I decided against them, mainly because I wasn't keen on the -30degree temp that they operate at.  I figured that going through chemo was enough, with out a severely cold head lol. Yes I lost my hair, but I was resigned to that, and it has grown back.   I had short hair to start with though, so now it's actually a little longer than I normally wear it.  It doesn't look quite as long because of the curls lol. I would imagine that a major hospital such as RPA would have cold caps.  As everyone has said before - it's a matter of choice. Jen, take your time to recover from your surgery. You've been through a lot, and just the anaesthetic will take time to leave your body, let alone the trauma you've been through in the past few weeks.  It's unfortunate that your Mum is visiting at such a bad time, especially if she isn't well.

I've always had curly hair and my hair has always been extremely dry - heaven knows how it will grow in after chemo lol - I can't imagine it being curlier or any drier.

It really wasn't worth a seizure over.  You can't feel it going in (that was one of my fears) and I never vomited once on chemo. It's really scary to have to go through chemo, but it does finish and the oncs can manage most of the se's efficiently.  There is a wealth of information on here from others who have done the treatment, and it's all good information. I just want to encourage you all who are starting - don't panic over it, remember to breathe and drink lots of water lol It's a long and hard road, but it doesn't go on forever and will finish.  Just take one day at a time, deal with everything in little steps and it will be a bit more manageable.  And we are all here to hold your hand when you need it.

Firstly - I didn't have any anti nausea meds on Taxotere.  And I didn't need them.  My main problems were extreme taste change - everything tasted like crap - even the air I was breathing smelled like chemicals.  This made it hard to keep hydrated - the water tasted like mud - that made me feel a bit sick and also I had really bad diahrroea and that made me feel a bit sick too. I felt like I'd been run over by a truck.  It was like having the flu - but 10 times worse.  On top of that (and the bad diahrroea) I had mouth ulcers (despite doing everything I was supposed to, to stop them), bad heartburn and blisters \"down there\"  I ended up having to use baby wipes to clean myself after going to the loo and then putting Bepanthon (used here in Oz for babies and nappy rash) to try to help.  Extreme fatigue, but up half the night for the first couple of nights because of the steroids - and had a bad steroid \"crash\" after the first round. My second round was reduced as I was having such a bad reaction, and that helped a bit - but my Onc stopped me at two treatments.  My body couldn't handle the Taxotere.  I'm comfortable with that - my life saving drug is the Herceptin, which I'm on until January . I didn't have Neulasta shots - they aren't done routinely here in Oz, and luckily I didn't have any fingernail issues or neuropathy. I really hope you don't have the problems I had - it isn't common, so you will probably sail through treatments. Hugs to you Trish xoxo",

Are you taking something for the heartburn?  I still have occasional heartburn, and take something for it - but while on chemo took a tablet everyday, which helped a lot. Trish xoxo",

I had a single mx 2 years ago - I had pretty large breasts, I'm in Australia so not sure if our sizes are the same as yours but I was a 38DD and when my breast was removed it weighed 1.1kg, which is almost 2 1/2 pounds.   I hated looking at myself with just one breast for a long time, but now it doesn't worry me. I also had ILC and asked my bs to take both breasts. He talked me out of it, and I really, really wish I'd insisted.  I don't want the worry I have now that it will come back in the other breast.  I've already had a scare (just a couple of weeks ago) where I found new lumps in my \"good\" breast. I wear a prosthesis - although only when I'm out or have visitors - and it's pretty good.  I don't wear anything at home, not even a bra and don't feel lopsided or off balance, although I think it took a couple of months for my body to get used to it.  I don't really remember as I was going through chemo at the time and too busy with se's from that lol. You will have to make your own decision (I know doesn't everyone tell you that! ) but for my part I'm used to being one sided, the foob doesn't bother me, but I do wish I'd had them both off.

I finished chemo in late Feb last year and finished Herceptin in Jan this year, so still have a way to go.  I do feel pretty good most of the time - not like before bc, but much better than while in treatment. I'm also on Arimidex, and that's causing most of my problems at the moment.  I've developed arthritis in hands, wrists, elbows, knees, ankles, feet shoulder and lower back.  I will see the onc next month and look at what my alternatives are. Herceptin will slow down the growth of your hair.  I had a hair cut in October 2010 just before my mx, then didn't get another one until Dec 2011 - and that was more shaping than anything.  Since I finished Herceptin in Jan, I've had 2 full haircuts - but I keep my hair fairly short and have always had to have a trim every 5-6 weeks. Give yourself some time - it may be the Tamox that's giving you grief more than anything else.  I too had some balance issues - and still have to be careful when I'm not wearing flat shoes.  I don't wear stilletos lol haven't done that since my 30's, but I do have some shoes with a 3/4 inch heel and have to be careful.  But that's not so bad these days. Your body has been through so much in the past 18-19 months, it needs to recover.  You don't say how old you are - but if you are on Tamox, you must be relatively young.  I'm 55 this year and will take longer to get over all this than a 30 or 40 year old.

FEC also seems to mess with your head, it's probably a lot to do with the steroids you will have been given as well.  I found all I could do was cry when I needed to and let it out.  There's not a lot you can do about it, and there doesn't seem to be any way you can stop it, so just go with the flow.

Finally finished in January this year.  I'm now on Aromasin as I was ER+ as well. I look back on those horrible days of chemo now and I really feel for you - I remember so well the feelings of hopelessness and how I thought it was never going to end.  I would start crying uncontrollably over nothing really (apart from being bald, swelling up and my chest disfigured lol) and not knowing how I would come through the other side.

I'm feeling pretty good now - in fact wonderful!! I've come out the other side, and life is great.  Breast cancer took over my life for 18 months or so - but now I can move on and know that I've done all that I can to beat it and not have it come back.

It seems to me that someone who can totally understand what you are going through and how you feel would be the best person to run a shop like that. I'm appalled at the treatment you all have received.  It's horrible - especially after all you've been through to even get where you are now. Hmmm... maybe when some of the sisters in the US are feeling up to it - it might be a good business idea lol Trish",

Took all the meds I was given and that helped. Felt a bit queasy from time to time but never vomited. Drank lots and lots of water, sorry not sure of what the conversion is, but I drank around 3 liters a day. I worked through it all, but usually fairly short days, mainly because of the fatigue. I chose to buzz my head before it started falling out, and I did it with the dog clippers - they worked a treat. The next round was to have been 3 doses of Taxotere. Taxotere and I didn't agree, and I only did 2 doses. Extreme muscle and bone pain. Extreme taste change to the point I couldn't even drink water without feeling nauseous. Extreme diahorea, mouth sores, blisters \"down below\" and so fatigued I couldn't drag myself out of bed. Not everyone gets the same se's and some people get very few. Just be prepared and the main thing to do is drink lots and lots of water and listen to your body. Good luck with your treatments, and may they be gentle on you. Trish",

I found FEC to be relatively easy.  Not a walk in the park, but not too bad.  The main problem with FEC is that it can cause nausea - and I had so much medication to stop the nausea that I never really had a problem.  The main thing to remember with FEC is take all the anti nausea medication - even if you think you don't need it.  It's easier to control the nausea than try to stop it once it has started.  I also had bad diarrhoea, heartburn and headaches.  These can also be controlled with medication.  I had taste changes, nothing tasted very good, and I generally wasn't terribly hungry.  My bad days were the day of infusion - I'd get a migraine that night, and days 4 and 5. The Taxotere though is another kettle of fish.  It has been quite awful.  No nausea, but extreme taste changes, just drinking water is a battle as it tastes like mud.  Very bad flu like symptoms - these last around 5 days for me.  Diarrhoea again - very bad, heartburn, mouth ulcers, sore nose and headaches.  There's a thread for on this board called \"Taxotere is a nightmare\".  There's also steroids that you have to take with the Taxotere - and they can cause some issues as well. With both treatments there is also the constant tiredness.  The first treatment of FEC and the first and second treatment of Taxotere had to be monitored fairly closely in case of allergic reactions. I wouldn't reccomend doing any of the treatments without someone with you - I defenitely needed someone to drive me in and home. Of course everyone is different - you may or may not have any of the se's, you may be one of the lucky ones and sail through with minimal se's. Good luck - chemo's no fun, but there are lots of wonderful supportive ladies here who can help you through this emotionally. Trish",

I have to stress though, that not everyone gets the same se's and you might just sail through it. There's a couple of threads about Taxotere on here - they are worth reading. Good luck with your treatment, I hope it is gentle on you.  Remember to drink lots of water and take it one day (and sometimes one hour) at a time. Trish xoxo ",

I tolerated FEC fairly well, but Taxotere was a nightmare for me.  One thing you could think of is to have weekly Taxol instead of three weekly Taxotere. I think the Taxol is not quite so rough, and it's further reduced as it's done weekly. It may not help, but then again, you may get through it a lot better. As you are HER2- though - it might not be worth the battle you are having now. You probably need to really think about whether you've had enough (and no-one would blame you if you decided you have) and stop the chemo, but feel that you wouldn't regret the decision if the cancer came back or spread.  You are very young - and usually that means you need to try all you can while you are able. But - you could still go through and complete chemo and have it spread or come back. You could also stop now and never have another problem with cancer again. No-one knows. You have to make a decision that you are comfortable with. It's a hard one to make, but no-one can make it for you. Sending you ((((hugs)))) - whatever you decide will be right for you.
