I have DCIS, no nodes involved. I am having genetic studies done and these should be in next week. I am having a problems with surgeon and pc getting their schedules together and they want me to wait until Jan for surgery. MY nurse brain know this is early cancer and will grow slow but my other half of my brain is just freaked out.Â  I am a homecare nurse, I take care of alot of post op patients. Just never thought I would be one of them",
