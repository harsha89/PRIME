Same thing happened to me - my lump was large and rock solid.  After a few biopsies the surgeon said it had to come out as he didn't like the look of it and was not satisfied with the benign results.  They had alot of trouble inserting the wire guided placement prior to the lumpectomy as it was so hard. It was actually benign, although in the final pathology they did find a seperate small area of DCIS.  Mine was a tubular adenoma. Fingers crossed you get a benign result xxx",

If you have a birads 3 it means that they have seen something but it is most probably benign, and watching and waiting should be done with a 6 monthly follow up just to see if it has changed or not.  The chances of it being malignant are less than 2%. Birads 4 does warrant a biopsy - but in approx 85% of biopsy's the results will be benign. Birads 5 means it is highly suspicious of malignancy with a less than 5% chance of it coming back benign.

I actually waited 12 days for my biopsy results due to public holidays etc and there was no way they were going to be given out over the phone.   I cannot fault either my treatment or their methods and I know I couldn't have actually coped with \"waiting for the phone to ring\" either.  It was bad enough sitting in the waiting room at the alloted time of my appointment but at least I had a semblance of a normal life in those 12 days. xx",

Nothing is conclusive until the pathology of the biopsy results are in although with a Birads 5 there is much more likely hood of a diagnosis. HOWEVER - do not panic just because they used the word \"invasive\", this just means they are assuming at this stage that whatever is diagnosed has more than likely left the ducts i.e. it will not be DCIS which is contained within the ducts. Invasive means in open breast tissue - it does not mean it has spread beyond this point so please take a deep breath, take somebody with you to appointments and things will get much better and easier once you have a plan in place. xx You are at the very worst part now.

      "Content": "Janet456 wrote: This is my first post so apologies if I ramble on.  It's all a bit of a shock really.  Have never noticied anything amiss until 7 May when I thought I felt \"something different\" in the shower.  It was enough to worry me but by the next day with alot of proding and poking I had convinced myself it was nothing.  It was definately not a lump, more of a curve if that makes sense.  Having decided that there was no need for the doctors etc matters were then taken out of my hands as I received an invitatation for a first mammogram (I will be 50 in September). I went along, call back was almost immediate and 2 days later I was at the specialist breast unit in the hospital - (no portacabin in a supermarket car park this time round!). Another mammogram, ultrasound and a biopsy followed along with being told \"it\" was 5cm by 3cm and they would be treating it aggressively in view of my age and I assume the size, also I could expect to be very busy for the rest of the year going back and forth to hospital.   At that point my world fell apart.  I was made an appt with a breast surgeon last Weds where I was to be told my treatment programme and what type it is.  I went along last Wednesday to be told by a Consultant that the results are showing benign (rather surprisingly to everybody on the team), but that could be due to the fact that the biopsy missed the target so I had a further 3 biopsy's taken.  Only one was taken the first time round. The first biopsy was taken under ultrasound and I am trying to think that it is a big target to miss but my head is still all over the place, and I guess it will be until next Wednesday now. I am hoping that they might have said something like - \"oh we just need another biopsy as it was inconclusive and not enough tissue sample was taken\".  I would have been none the wiser but I just feel now like they have got my hopes up only to bring them crashing down again next week.  Thanks for letting me ramble on, I just felt the need to get it off my chest to people who will understand.

Lumpectomy is now scheduled within the next 6 weeks and they are saying that there is still a slim chance that it could be BC because they cannot rule it out until lump has been analysed by histology. For now I just feel relieved and I will move myself to the \"not diagnosed, but worried\" section of this forum. I have learned so much through reading the posts on this forum and I have found it a great source of comfort. Janet xxx ",

Ask what your birad score is after the mammogram.  If it's a birads 4 there is more than an 80% chance of a benign result, but a birad 4 does warrant a biopsy to be certain. You may very well not need one, if it is a cyst the ultrasound will pick up that it is fluid filled and not solid. Good luck xx",
