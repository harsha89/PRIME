Now I can't be pregnant so that's off the table . I did notice yesterday my right breast has a lump . And sometimes the soreness becomes a pain and it goes to my armpit . My family history isn't great my grandmother(mothers side )and her sister both had breast cancer . I'm staring to worry , over the last new months I've had 3ovarian Cyst that have ruptured ,for the first time in my life and now this . I just turned 40 . Thanks for listening Log in to post a reply",
