I thought taking less would be better for my organs ie liver and kidneys. But it turns out if I am not on a consistent pain plan I have more symptoms. I don't know what is normal anymore when it comes to pain. I did not want to take too much because like in the poopy post we have problems in that department. So for a year I have been on a Fentynal patch 75mg every 3 days and vicodin as needed. Well I was only taking 5mg in the am and 5 in the pm trying to be conservative. But at nite I had so much pain. I could not sleep in one position more than a few hours without waking up with pain. I saw a new dr traveling and she is going to change my rx to Ocy because it last 12 hours. I have no idea why my other drs would not prescribe this. Maybe because the pharmacy thinks your a drug addict when you try to fill. They don't even carry it in the CVS they have to mail it to you. Last nite I took 3 5mg vicodin spread out am, afternoon and before bedtime. This is the first time in a year I did not have pain sleeping in a position and having to wake up. When your sick and in pain you forget what is normal and don't realize the pain is too much. Anyone have anything to add? Has anyone switched from vicodin to Oxy?

I realize from the feedback that each person's cancer is individual and treatment will vary according to size and location of primary. I do believe my Onc did not want to do surgery for several reasons. I was weak after the chemo and I needed to gain back some strength and weight and stabilize my blood counts. Secondly, as mentioned above there is no research to support whether removal of a small tumor is beneficial when it has met to the bones. I think I had a problem with his recommendation because I recently moved from CA and he is my new Onc in FL and he disagreed with my Onc in CA treatment plan to have me on chemo. He stated and showed me a website that was put together by all onocologists in the country with its protocol for treatment plans for various cancers. In it for my stage 4 cancer with met to bones there was no call for chemo. But I think because I was in such pain from met of hip and bone they need to stabilize my condition. I do want to get a 2nd opinion though despite everything. However, the hospital my onc recommended is 2 hrs away and my onc is affiliated with it and probably will recommend the same treatment plan. So to me it makes no sense to get a 2nd opinion there when it would most likely be exactly the same treatment. I will most likely look for another hospital that is not affiliated with my doctor. thanks again and stay strong!",

I had a comparison of 2 PETs one from Sept 09 and April 10 and there is no new growth in the bones and lesions and they seem to be getting smaller. I also wiped out on my patio when I was watching where I was going and hit a step. I fell hard on the ground and nothing broke. I was in some pain but it all felt better the next day. My doctor told me my bones were not at the point to fracture as they were in Aug of 09 and I guess he's right. Yeah for good news keep on rocking on!",

I have 5 fractures and more compressions. I will have to do 2 or 3 surgeries because they can only do 4 spine cells at a time. Some benefiets are stablizing the spine to prevent breaks and paralysis. Also, the procedure uses a liquid heated up to 90 degrees which can kill cancer cells on spine. The surgeons insert a needle like device with a baloon attached it opens up the spinal cell and then they insert concrete. YIKES can u imagine. But I am told they have done over 300,000 of them.

I don't understand waiting 6 months for scans Suzanne. I have been on a 3 month schedule. I had kyphoplasty surgery yesterday and was able to go to my hotel afterward. I had done research on their website and talked to the pre-op nurse but no where or no one explained that the dr was going to hammer the instrument into my spine. I opted forÂ the new procedure not using anthesia. I was given something intravenously that made me sleepy but not knock me out. So, I awoke to a hammer banging on my spine with something like a chisel. I was not a happy camper. Anyway I am home now and hope to see the next few days how it will help me. I have several fractures on my spine and lost 4in in height. Not to mention the pain which I hope I will have less of. This procedure should protect my spine from breaking. I need to have 2 more of them. I think I will opt to sleep over and do the anthesia. I don't know if this helps Suzanne, but maybe someone will write on a similiar issue with your femor. Good luck girl and get more frequent scans.",

I opted for out patient which they do not give anthestia, instead another pain and intravenous medication which doesn't completely knock you out. So, I awoke during surgery when they were hammering the instrument into my back. They never mentioned that either now I know why. It was painful and awful listening to them hammer this thing in my back. It felt forever because they had to do it 4 times for each vertebrae. Its not quite a week yet and I cannot tell if it will help me because I still have pain where the incisions were made. I mistakenly took a bike ride 2 days afterward not a good idea. I was in pain afterwards. I will update again in a week or 2 if there is improvement",
