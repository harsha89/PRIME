It started a week ago and I've had several days this week that I am shocked I have hair left as it seems like its everywhere. Looking at me you can't tell but i can see some spots thinning when I look close. It is freaking me out! and my head keeps tingling in spots which makes me think those spots are thinning next? Suddenly my hair is frizzy and rat's nest like so soon after my daily comb.",
