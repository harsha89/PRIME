She has her usually manual Lymphatic drainage through the physio & addtitional treatment from me, however I have never come across a client with this illness & not quite sure how to massage her & help her, I do not know anything about Lymphodema i shamed to say, we are not taught what to do with Lymphodema patients. I was wondering if anyone out there can help. My appoligise to anyone that I may have offended with this thread, I understand that it is a very difficult subject to touch upon.
