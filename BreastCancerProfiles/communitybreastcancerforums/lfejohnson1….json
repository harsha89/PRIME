I just finished to talk to my BS and I will have the biopsy done on Wednesday  theydo not see cancer but they see ADH and ALH and my best understand is that theyare seeing both. Basicly I am looking one step more close to Breast cancer. I ask if instead of biopsy will be better just go and remove everything but they think is impractical ( or maybe I am crazy). I was told if this biopsy is positive then I will need to have and MRI and then will decide if we get lobectomy or mastectomy. I just thinking in the worse case scenary because even when they sound optimist I am not the hole seems getting deeper. Thank so much for listen and reply. Mean so much that I am not alone. Thanks again",

I spoke yesterday again with my doctor. I told her if we going for the biopsy why we do remove all the entire area that is affect? she said again no to worry about it, she seems not to be concern. But everytime I took this approch I find my self in a deeper hole so speak. I guess I just have to wait and see.  Probably will be until next friday that I have some news. Monday is my pre- testing and Wednesday is the procedure. I will keep posting.",
