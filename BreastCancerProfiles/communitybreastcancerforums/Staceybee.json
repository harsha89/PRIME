      "Content": "Jun 23, 2018 04:42PM Staceybee wrote: Here is the update on where I stand after starting this thread a few weeks ago. After learning I had a 1mm micromet in 1/2 sentinel nodes removed during a lumpectomy for 1.1cm ILC, a few weeks later I received oncotype score of 13. My surgeon's office submitted my report request as 1 - 3 positive node category, so the report I got back said I have 10% chance of distant recurrence (MBC) in 5yrs if I am on tamoxifen for 5yrs AND 12% chance if I do chemo. + tamoxifen That I really do not understand -- it is saying I have a higher chance of MBC if I do chemo + tamoxifen. I would understand if it said no difference, but how does chemo increase the chance of MBC? I then learned that if my surgeon had submitted the report as a micromet, they would have sent me the data for node negative as well. I had the report resubmitted as a micromet and received the negative node data which says that I have 9% chance of distant recurrence in 10yrs if I am on tamoxifen for 5 yrs AND 7%-ish chance if I do chemo + tamoxifen (they do not list the % for this, but I can see from the graph it looks a few %-points lower). So the conundrum for a micromet and my oncotype of 13 is if you treat it as a positive node it tells you chemo hurts you in 5yrs, but if you treat it as node negative it tells you it helps you in 10yrs! I saw two MOs - one at a major cancer center and one at the hospital where I had surgery, but she came from the major cancer center, so there may be some \"group think\" here. They both are recommending AI + OS (Lupron), which they say is more aggressive than tamoxifen and could shave down some additional risk. (I am 52 and still getting monthly periods, so need the OS to take an AI). They both said they will give me chemo if I want it and it is up to me, but they highlight all the risks and you can tell they are not advocating it. The MO at the cancer center said she presented my stats at a meeting with her colleagues and asked them to raise their hand if they would recommend chemo and no one did. I have not decided yet which MO to go with. The one at the cancer center recommended also taking Zometa, the other did not mention anything about that. I started looking Zometa up and it does not seem to be a walk in the park. Lupron + AI + Zometa seems like a lot of potential for bad side effects. I am going to start a separate thread to ask for anyone's experience on Zometa. In all, both MOs were surprised that I was so interested in potentially getting chemo. I am really of a mindset that I will do anything to improve my chances with this disease -- but really getting no support to do chemo given my stats. I asked if I should go to a a cancer center in a different city for a another opinion to get away from potential \"group think\" here. One MO suggested I try to see one of the top guys at Dana Farber in Boston. If anyone has a view on what their approach might be for a relatively low risk onco score and a micromet, I would be very appreciative to hear. Sorry for the long post, but if anyone has any thoughts or recommendations for me, please let me know. I also wanted to document this for anyone in the future that may end up with a micromet looking for information. This site and all on it have been so incredibly helpful! If anyone in the future has any questions for me, please do not hesitate to message me directly.   ",

My oncotype was not back yet, but she said she thought it would be low since my Ki67 was low at 5%. Still, she said the MOs might still recommend \"chemo-lite\" for me, which really made me think hard about it and question them now that they are not recommending it. Thank you again!",

The Mammaprint says that even in the 1 - 3 positive node category, the chemo would have a 1.3% benefit, which is not statistically significant. I want to be aggressive with treatment, but with all of this, I have no basis for chemo. Both tests cite 5yr and 10yr outcome statistics. When I asked the MO if chemo could have a longer term benefit, she said there is not good data to make that call. So plan is radiation and then ovarian suppression + AI + Zometa.",

I showed the nurse who came in to see me (not my doctor's nurse) the rash that was starting and she gave me a 10-pack of Carrington Radiadres gel sheets. They are supposed to keep the radiation burn area moist to help with healing. I've used about 7 of them and I think they do help.

Everything was going well until the boosts. My skin did very well during the whole breast - I used a lot of creams, hopefully I did not overdo it. I used calendula, Miaderm, and Aquaphor. I just read on someone else's post that her RO said not to use too many products because it may not all wash off and could interfere with radiation. Mine said nothing about that. I was also bummed out to realize toward the end that one of the calendula salves I was using was in a Vitamin E oil base -- which I was told not to take orally during radiation. I asked my RO if it was a problem that I had inadvertently been applying Vitamin E topically and she said no big deal. But at that point what's done is done. I drank a lot of water and forced myself to go to the gym and ended up with not a lot of fatigue. Just made sure I got an extra hour of sleep. My problem came with the boost. They painted a decent sized circle with dye on me to mark the boost area (on my smallish breast about 25% -33% of my total area) and told me not to wash it off. Just let the water run over it in the shower and to apply creams inside and outside the marks, but not on the dye. So now I have a raised red itchy bumpy blistery rash on the whole line that they drew! I do not have sensitive skin and no allergies, so this is weird. The RO was shocked at the reaction and is having me use over the counter hydrocortisone on it but so far slow to resolve. A bummer as it is itchy and uncomfortable and gross looking and still reminding me of the radiation even after I rang the bell. Hopefully clears up next week. Again, wishing everyone more uneventful outcomes. All the best!",

How big is your boost area? I can measure mine because the dye they used to mark it has left an ongoing rash, but I figure if the radiation worked I can deal with a rash for a while. The area is surprisingly big - 9cm x 7cm for what was a 1.1cm tumor. And again I have no indentation from it. I am no medical expert but the boosts are such a standard part of the treatment protocol I imagine that there has to be some expected benefit. But we should all have control and a voice in our treatment so you should definitely discuss the importance of the boosts with your RO if they are difficult - and of course consider if you will have better peace of mind down the road if you complete the original plan. All the best to you for speedy healing- either way you are close to done",

I convinced myself that I wanted to have chemo because I wanted to do everything I could to prevent recurrence, but after an Onctoype of 13 and a low-risk Mammaprint, the two oncologists I consulted did not recommend it. So I just had radiation and started an aromatase inhibitor with ovarian suppression and getting Zometa infusions on a 6-month basis, which maybe helps shave down risk of bone metastasis. The Oncotype result will be key to your decision.

Now I am not one to have a man speak for me, but he is a physician, though does not deal with cancer, but I still think it brings some authority -- and I will take any help I can get right now! The RO listened to him and my concern about undertreating the nodes and agreed to widen one of the radiation field margins to better include the 1st and 2nd tier nodes. That makes me more comfortable. She did say that her initial approach is based on 10yr follow up of participants in the Z0011 study. Nonetheless, I think/hope I have a radiation plan that is more aggressive and in line with my treatment approach. ",

I am going in to see a MO at MSK (Sloan Kettering) for first time today - had to wait to get oncotype back. I was just told that if she recommends chemo it will probably be CMF, which is an MSK thing. I was very surprised as I was expecting TC based on all the reading I had done. I just learned that hair loss is less under CMF but can still be significant. I was already prepared to cold cap with TC, so if it helps at all with CMF hair loss I am ready to do it",
