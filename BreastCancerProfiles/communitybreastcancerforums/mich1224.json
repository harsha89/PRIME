My husband loves that place. I used to live in Newton for 7 years before I moved to South Amboy.",

At least I can get the 10yr old to empty the dishwasher. He's actually the most helpful. The kitchen garbage will be overflowing before I get stuck taking it out. (No one else notices this?) Thank goodness my mom will be taking time off work to help me out here. Although that means the rest of the family won't feel the need to do anything with her here. I'll owe her big time.",

It gets a little better day by day, but is still there. I went to the doctor today, but drains are still outputting too much so they must stay in. I'm taking 1 vicodan every 4 hrs, since 2 at once made me feel funny in a way I didn't like. I'm going to start taking the valium tonight to sleep. I haven't gotten much since sleeping sitting up is hard, plus it hurts your back as well. Then there is the swelling near the underarms that just started today. Plus the itching. I'm also taking the antibiotics every 6hrs and now taking stool softener since still have not gone. Yes, the whole process stinks, but it does seem to get better everyday (thank goodness for that!) I keep trying to remember it will get better one day. It is awful that we must go thru this to get rid of the cancer.  Best wishes to all who have upcoming ops.",

Thank goodness for my mom. She is being so patient and understanding. In a house full of guys, having another woman a few days a week is needed. Thank goodness she'll be here after my surgery. The house would fall apart if she wasn't. My husband actually asked \"who'll do the shopping after your surgery?\" Gee, can't he pitch in? Men can't think sometimes.

Although my delay was also due to MRI that I had to schedule as my dr wanted to be sure there were no other areas before she went in. Then the MRI showed areas that needed to be biopsied so I had to schedule MRI guided biopsies. Good thing too. The MRI biopsies found multiple areas of pre-cancerous cells in additional to the cancer area. You can imagine what a pain all the waiting is. It's the worst part.",

Once that was found, my dr sent me for MRI to be sure there were no other areas before she did surgery. Well, the MRI showed suspicious areas in cancer breast and in the other. So...MRI guided biopsy was done which didn't find additional cancer, but did find areas in both breasts with atypical ductal hyperplasia. (I had this problem last year and had surgery-but it came back). Thus, I am having bilateral mastectomy on 2/6 with recon. As much as I am not looking forward to this, I am grateful she sent me for the MRI since the original mammo never showed anything in the opposite breast. I wish you the best in the days ahead.

Well, she called me Wednesday night to tell me I scored a 10. She was not expecting that and could no longer recommend chemo.  I dodged a bullett!  I still can't believe it.  To me, a bilat MX was enough to go through without the chemo.  I still have to do Tamoxifin, but so far I'm doing OK with it.",

I don't like the idea of them in me and knowing replacing will be needed every 10 yrs or so. (I'm only 45). That leaves me with TRAM which is the most involved. So, either lots of pain and longer recoup or no breasts. I think I can handle no breasts since I'm not that big to begin with (36B). My hubbie is fine with whatever, but quite a few family and friends feel I should have recon (I guess psychologically they feel I will feel better). So with most everyone saying I should have recon, I am more confused. No one says \"I wouldn't have recon\". This is the hardest decision. It helps though to read everyone's posts on this website. ",
