      "Content": "Dec 30, 2011 08:45PM - edited Dec 30, 2011 08:47PM by hotlyn Hi everyone,  Just home from my first chemo infusion, well actually it was done yesterday but stayed in hospital just in case. Alll  went well, turned up on time 10am, brother and sister in law came with me. They stay for an hour and enjoyed the proceedings. Greeted by my onco nurse Christne who stayed with me all the time, then my Onc Michelle came in and talked about everything again and asked if we had any questions, I was pretty stressed by this time and was given 1 Ativan (Lorazepam) to suck under my tounge for nausea/ restlessness /sleep. It certainly took the edge of everything for me I was so glad to drift along and left the others to ask any questions. Then i was given an Emend tab(aprepitant) for anti nausea, and take one for next 2 days. Had to have that one one hour before chemo. So Christine just got everthing ready i needed, Then she set up the iv stuff that had to run through 3 bags of saline to make sure I had  lot of fluid in my body. By this stage I was feeling nice and whoosy. rellies went and got a sand and had a walk. 1 lot of chemo FEC was fed in through the chemo line so no drama there. Now 11am    Got to give the power port the  thumbs up. No problems, no pain. no digging around, straight in straight out ...fantastic Stayed in the chemo room having lunch and doozing till 2.30pm than taken  to my room where I had been before with a nurse have had before. again climed into bed doozed till mum came, had tea, hubby came, talkjed to hi . sleep 10.00  Slept all night, no problems in the am, was given an injection into my stomach which I was told was to help rebuild red blood cells and would probably give me bone pain.Joy! sent home whith lots of tabs for nausea. all I feel now is pretty tired and letargic, which i think is more to do with the lead up than any thing else. Well that the first  step on this part of the jouney will write agin with any changes Love Lynne  ",

Did mine one on one with the chemo nurse who pretty much went over everything with with me and hubby but to be honest the list I downloaded from this site and reading everything I could has helped more day 4 after first chemo and I can't eat any solids at present. Have sore throat - went to gp tonite and got antibiotics for that so hope that picks up soon but can't stomach solids. So just have protein shakes and ice poles. And to deb who has fibromyalgia I do 2 and was very worried about how all this would work. My rheumy explained that the steroids for bc would dampen down the fm and it has. Joints r good fatigue is lousy though hope everyone gets through another day ok Lynne",

I am now day 10 after first infusion and yesterday I started to come good Thank goodness!!  Infusion day and overnite  stay in hosp were fine Fine but tired and nauseated next few days but then I got a sore throat that quickly  became ulcerated. So only ice poles and water for 4 days... which was sorta good.. lost 5 kilos.. but also felt sick and light headed and bloody awful actually. Went to GP who gave me 2000mg amoxil antibiotic and rang onc and she told me to take panandeine for pain and GARGLE with asprin , and so those two things have finally kicked in. Have had small meals last nite and today .. my new best friend at moment is Mcdonalds soft serve ice creams. Yesterday hubby drove me there 3 times just so I could have one.. yah for the good men on this planet, took me three (marriages) before I found one! And I am sure Jenn Deb I replied to both of toy , can't remember what though. I think Deb yours was about FM which we both have. I think I I told you what my Rhuemy told me.. that the steroids we take for BC helps to dampen down the FM pain.. so far virtually no joint or  muscle pain I normally have. Am off the Plaquenil tabs and Mobic tabs as well. So I must admit I am enjoying not having my usual 24/24 hour pain issues at present. Still have fatigue X 2 now but oh well can't have everything I guess  Will send this  and hope it gets on to list  ok  Bye for now Lynne",

Steroids keeping me on a high. Hair hasn't started falling out yet, so all is pretty good. Have spent most of today helping 36 year old da, and her partner move house  today, they as usual have left everything to the last moment!! On one hand I feel cross about their inactivity and then on the other hand I think oh well will help as much as possible, with small stuff, mostly mind baby . go messages etc and then when I've had enough I come home and its not my problem anyway. But it has helped keep my mind of this BC stuff. so that's good  Next week go back to work, which is is sorta 3/4 time but from home so should be very doable. Can stop and start when I want with on reason , so after reading lots on this site I realise how very very lucky I am at present. Have spent many years on my own and realise who tough it is for those on their own with little or no support. My heart and love goes out to you all Lyyne",

Lost 5 kilos that week, only on water and icepoles . Still have sore mouth , teeth, gums, tongue etc, but bearable , must be because have managed to put on 3 kilos this week!!  Have found having yogurt ( which I had not  been having before ) before and after every meal and rinsing my mouth out with water and bicarb to be really helpful in calming things down. Depression hasd been pretty bad but on Cymbalta for that so just have to keep putting one foot in front of the other. I go to the pool everyday and do water classes which has been a great outlet at the moment  .  For those with Fibromyalgia which I have ,as my Rhuemy said the steriods really do dampen down the joint and muscle pain. Normally i take Plaquenil and mobic, but have stopped them while on chemo. Then on day 16 the really bad stuff.... hair falling out!!! I must say that although I knew it was going to happen and I was all prepared, have the wig, scarves etc etc  and I had had it cut really short when It came away in my hands after a shower I just bawled my eyes out!!! It was a terrible feeling and 2 days later I feel the same. Its not like my hair was long  or beautiful or anything its just that it was mine and there goes another thing out of my life, first boob now hair . I feel like I have a sign on my forehead  \" Cancer\"   Stupid I know, but that's how I feel. Got it all shaved off yesterday, even had that bit organised ... Family, friends all saying don't worry it will grow back ( when?, how about tomorrow!!) etc etc, don't care, want to throw a tantrum and say its not BL@@dy fair.. life sucks... there thats me done... sorry for dumping,, maybe when I read this back I will be able to laugh at myself for being such a ninny.. and for those to get to this stage yet  take no notice of me ,its like they say  .. its doable... yep, but its hard... waiting now to see what infusion 2 brings next weeek .'By the way very hot and sunny here in Melbourne Australia..no hair to catch the drips off my head though, god this is weird Lynne",

I am now day 4 after second infusion of FEC. So again have sore thoart, cracked lips ( this has not gone away from last time), putting Kenalog on them and it helps but the corners just keep cracking now no matter what. Any fix ups any one knows?? and then today I rang GP to get result re   blister (down there, sorry!!!) that I had on Monday has come back as type 2 genitel herpes!!! does any one one know any think about this ???? He had given me tablets and cream and all is settled down now. He said to tell the onc people at next visit , that it is something that happens with low immune system... but now I'm concerned about long term stuff, does this mean I have genetil herpes for erver or what, any help or info gratefully received, Oh and if  any one remembers  I fell on News years Eve and bruised myself all over. Left knee  is still very sore so had xray today... get result next week, gee I hope there is nothing wrong there as well.. bye for now Lynne",

All I do is wait for 8pm so I can take another sleeping tab and move onto the next day... since my onc has said that she got the lump our with clear margins I am so tempted to say no more treatment,,, has any one else does this?? or at least thought about it , if you have  done/said it what was the result.. ie how much much did your onc yell at you, or rather what was everyones considered opinion?  and JENN28 I am at cabrini Brighton, and Iv'e got to agree with you. Have rung the breast care nurse three times now, she has got back to me eventually, but shows no interest or concern at all. All she says is see yoour local GP well Iv'e done that, and and that has not been all that much help, like you said GP's don't know about our individual BC journeys. I think we have claritin here in Australia.. used for colds and flu but have never heard any talk about it being used in any way for BC so will ask the onc on Monday.. However although I whine and whinge every day ( in my head!! ) I cannot get over the fact that some of you and lots of others do this with children.. I am ready to to loose the plot every night as my husband gets home, do not know how I would do it with littles around.  Still trying to work pt from home but not working as well as I thought. Most days my heart races, and I have dry mouth all the time.. take all the stuff I'm supposed too but makes talking on the phone sometimes for half hour at a time a bit trikey!! Sometimes by the time I get off the phone I have to run to the toilet.. have drunk so much water.  oh well on to another day bye for now Lynne ",

The xray showed arthritis which I knew , so next step is to get my Rhuemy to give me a referral to get a MRI. Referal from her means no cost , from my GP cost is $350-500 Australian, So will be doing that soon, as knee is getting more painful all the time.  But lets see.. since last infusion  I have had thrush all through mouth.. Nilstat oral drops were the only thing that worked cracked lips at corners (ongoing) got script from gp for Kenalog optic ear ointment  ) had tried everything else sore scratchy eyes continually .. using terra tears eye gel at night and systane lubricant eye drops during the day( I don't know if they are just Australia brands but they are pretty basic stuff here) severe headaches and feeling like my head is in a vice all the time (can't do much about this cause I am on MSContin 120mg a day for Fibromyalgia) Fatigue that you could cut through with a very very big knife Got hthe thrush under control, now have dry mouth 24/7 swilling the Biotene like there is no tomorrow Haven't seen family (other that hubby) for over a week  because I don't want to pick up anything and I can't cope with any one in the house, just talking on the phone is a killer with my mouth sooo sore, we all txt through the day. and play words with friends on the iphone , takes my mind of stuff. They drop of food and books etc I feel like I'm marooned on an island Cry every night at 6pm as my hubby walks through the door... I then go to bed and eat tea and watch more tele in there. He comes in every half haf hour to check on me.. I know this might sound strange to some but he works 6 days a week and I figure he needs some quiet down time with out me going on and on about how sh@t I feel.  yesterday I ralised I was suffering from finger neuropathy in my fingers.. oh joy.. I feel like what ever is on any list i'm going to get it and yes I know there is 2 big ones starting with V and D ( don't wanr to jinx my self by saying or writing the words out loud  LOL.    Oncologist says getting everything is because I have Fibromyalgia and with that you have low immune system anyway so getting this poison in my body just means I get to feel like a truck is running over and over me all day every day ok thats it ,will stop whining now, I'm sure some one ,some where is doing it harder than me .. I have good family and hubby to help get me through this rotten trip. Hopefully next week things  will be sorta ok before we get on the train again. PS. Watching the news on tele, headlines here are some states in Australia are looking at banning sun tanning saloons over the next few years.. hopefully the laws will be passed and no other young girls will go to them with the idea of getting a tan and and then finding out they have skin melanonas and possibly looking at a death sentence. bye for now all Lynne ",

Today I am 7days past that and coping a bit better.When I went last week I explained to my onc ( a female)how bad things had been for me. She explained that often the chemo drugs can dampen down other pain issues, like the ones I have OA, RA FM etc and then sometimes the chemo drugs work in reverse, which they have done for me. Now I realise that's what happened, is all the pain from the other things I have went into over drive , no wonder I felt sooo bad and in constant pain. Chemo was cut back 25%, no pain since... what a relief. Still feel tired, yukky, having nanna naps every day, etc but much better than before. Plus she has told me no taxatore as my body would not be able to stand what it does. I must admit I am so glad about that as after readng up on it I was pretty scared about how I was going to cope. She assures me that having got all the lump with clear margins ( ie taking the breast) and no node involvement that cutting down the chemo dose is ok. So gotta say living without 24 hour migraines is am improvement . My husband and I have also been reading other threads about diet, not that we have done any thing to change things, but we would like to juice our vegies and fruit, have the jucer, not sure if we have the will though. Getting some books out of the library tomorrow so w'ell see.  Hope you are all feeling of if not heaps better on this sucky journey Lynne",

Wig looks ok, but it was very hot here and wearing a wig sure is a challange in hot weather!! and the other thing Iv'e noticed is without any hair on a hot day perspiration just runs off my head... makes me realise how much perspiration our normal hair takes up.   I forgot to mention in my rant yesterday that I am constantly \"up\" because of the steriods. I have inflammatory arthritis and when it is out of control my rheumy puts me on cortisone tabs which work a treat, however I then have cortisone withdrawel when coming off them,,, so to prevent that the onc has me on steriods tapering down until the next infusion next Monday and even though the dose is now is pretty low I am always on an 'up'.. sleeping is the hardest. I go to sleep and wake up every few hours ready to do something, anything , so I read, walk around the house, Txt , play words with friends, watch tele ( alot) , I wish I could sleep during the day but the steriods have me just high enough to stop that !!  Any way Hope everyone is as well as can be expected on the other side of this big planet of ours ..

I'm taking everything /doing everything as recommened on these threads, but my body is really digging in and saying, nope, not enough, what more can I do to make her life miserable!!  Rang my GP yesterday and got new ointment for my mouth , its acually for ear infections but to be used carfully 3 times a day on cracks at sides of mouth. I haver tried every thing else but nothing has worked. Tried ativan for sleeping last nite, i think that was a bit better, just up at 12md and then slep till 5.30am and dozed from there . With the temaze I'm awake every 2 hours. Am off the steriods, so no high from that, just feel absolutly crap I so wish I was one of you who copes so so and gets on with things but thats not happening here. My poor husband never knows what sort of woman he is coming home to.. If I could talk i'd tell him at least he wont't die from boredom!. This mrorning I send txt to all family that I felt crap and for them not to ring (hurts to talk) or come around, but to txt so while I feel terrible telling them that ( I have been keeping up the big happy front till now! )I figure this is easist  for everyone today. Anyway its 11am and I'm off to bed again, sorry for being such a misery guts, its just I feel like one!!! ;ove Lynne",

Had power port put in last week ( 7 days ago) due to poor veins. It was a terrible experience getting it in. My left boob ( it is placed armpit level on left boob) is bruised from above shoulder level to nipple. So not sure how one gets it put in the same day as infusion, the pain is just starting to settle down now. First chemo FEC is on 30th Dec 2011 , so in 2 days. I am absolutely terrified. Have brought lots of the stuff listed  on this board, just in case. Have the wig, got most of the A$300 back through health fund, got the breast form, again,got all that back A$400 from a government initiative here in Australia. Have the scarves etc, have lined up my hairdresser to come and shave my hair at home when I get to that stage!! Have my brother and sister in law to come with me on Friday, need them to help push/drag me through the door.. Jenn28.. I see you are from Australia as well and starting this month. Which state are you in? And you have a female onc.. so do I !! My BS was a female as well. Would love to hear from you. AND   Deb267 I also have fibromyalgia... so would love to hear from you about how you plan to do this with FM. MY Rhuemy docter tells me that the steriods may help to calm down the FM she says sometimes for about 1-2 years, that would be great BUT... I have learnt to take it all with a grain of salt. Would love to hear more from you about how BC and FM are treated in USA and if it is different to here in Aust Look forward to hearing from everyone as we journey on into 2012 Regards Lynne ",

Dx 20 years ago, am on buckets of meds as I also have bad osteoarthritis and Inflamatory arthritis. So pain and fatigue levels can be pretty bad. Am on MS Contin, Plaquenil, Lyrica, etc. Also have a massage every week, has been a major reason I can still get around that and the fact I try to go to the pool each day  and do all my excercises in the pool . This year I have had 2 knee replacements,  and 2 carpel tunnel ops , then this...  So 2011 sucks!! Hoping that things won't be too bad on chemo but not expecting  much as I have had major flares after each of the ops this year. Terrible flare after the mastectomey, every part of my body was in agony. My onc says she has had another patient with bc and FM so hopefully I won't have to bash  heads against a brick wall to much. In Australia FM is not really recoginsed at all and most people, even some docters, still think we are making it up. I don't argue with any of them any more just change drs and support people until I found ones who were willing to help. Jenn, I am in Melbourne, at Cabrini Brighton. It is a lovely private hospital near the beach. Have had all my ops there this year, so it has been a bit like old home week every time I go back!! Staff have alway been really nice and supportive.  Iam 60 with 2 da's and 3 grandchildren 14, 8 and 16 week old baby. I work with part time and and love my job too so hopefully will be able to work ok, well all fingers and legs crossed for that one!! So you will be heading in to nice weather like us. Lovely warm days at present. Of to chemo tomorrow which I guess while still in 2011 will technically make me one of the first for the new year. Will be staying in hospital o/n, something the hospital does and also due to all the meds I am already on , so will be back on the board on Sat am and will give you a full heads up as to what goes on .. so see you on the other side one and all  Lynne ",

It was either do something or I'm off all this stuff ( even though  I know that's not really an option!) Any way was supposed to have 3 infusions of Taxatore but won't be doing that , will just continue on the chemo for 3 more sessions, so can't tell you how pleased I am about that As she said my body would not have coped on taxatore so thank goodness for common sense from onc. As for the juicer stuff, I know how you feel nancy, at the moment I am living on green jelly and green ice cream, 2 things I normally never ever have , both full of sugar. I just feel like damm, everthing else sucks so I want food that I want!! makes no sense I know but one day if I can get my head straight and can think straight for longer than 5 mins I will look at this juicing of vegies and see if I can make it work for us. My hubby is keen, but I suspaect I will do all the work about it anyway ,everyone take care of yourselves, as best you can Lynne",
