Astarte good luck with all your tests tomorrow.  It sound pretty overwhelming, but I think it will be good to get it all over with in one day.    I'm feeling better since starting the antibiotic for my urine infection when my white blood cell count was low last Friday.  Hope all is ok for my next scheduled infusion Thursday so I can stay on the recommended schedule.    ",

It has a strange odor but you only need to apply a little with a Q-tip. I've also had several recommendations to keep my fingernails painted with clear polish. On hands, I also have started using cotton gloves at night with Udderly Smooth hand cream which was one of those recommended by the oncologist office education material. Got both on Amazon. This morning I also tried putting some coconut oil on my hands and face. My hairstylist had recommended it and I had gotten some to add to my morning smoothie. I made the mistake of not using sunscreen on a somewhat sunny day for a very brief walk without a hat and got surprisingly somewhat burned. So now am very diligent and have sunscreen everywhere, purse, car, by door, etc. I also have nose problems but had allergies before starting chemo and switched from my prior medicine to Claritan which I've been taking every day, Also use saline rinse spray. Love the picture's and the cute short haircuts. My stylist also did one for me. While I only had it a little over a week it made it a lot easier when my hair feel out. Also gave an idea of a short hairstyle when it grows back.",

It's good to reconnect with this group and see what is going on with everybody though I know there are some duplicates.  I completed my AC treatments in the December and had my fifth Taxol infusion yesterday. For the most part the Taxol treatment has been easier however I've had sinus problems and/or colds and nose bleeding which for a couple of weeks of caused way more fatigued than I expected. My oncologist suggested I get back on my allergy medication which seems to be helping even after a few days.also I'm using a humidifier. Best is I have much less brain fog, less dry mouth and more normal taste buds. I do have constipation and have been using Senna S. I'm trying to transition to a less dosage of that adding more natural fiber to my diet. I had to move away from that during AC because it was causing way too much gas and caused other problems. This week I've started to have neuropathy symptoms but they aren't impacting any major life activities at this point. The doctor may reduce my taxol dosage to try to prevent it from getting worse. Now that I'm on the homestretch of the chemo I've started to think about my surgery. Currently I plan have a lumpectomy on the left breast with the tumor (which is shrinking as well as the lymph node). This is based on different factors including my age (I'll be 60 next month) and the recommendations of my doctors and the tumor board at the hospital. I do not have any family history of breast cancer so they did not do the BRCA test. They've also asked me to consider participating in a clinical trial that relates to amount of lymph node removal and/or radiation treatment depending on the results a pathology test on sentinole lmyph node tissue they will do during the surgery. At this point I am leaning towards participating. Best wishes to all. ",

My original bone scan was clear and the plan was for another in 12 months unless I have symptoms. My insurance denied her original request for a PET scan and she now says the MRI\u2019s are better for follow up. I did not have a brain scan and she said that should be done if I have any symptoms.

Robin -it\u2019s so good to hear from you. Glad things are looking better.

I\u2019ll get another bone scan once a year unless I start showing of the activity. At this point I just have liver Mets. My insurance denied a pet scan my original diagnosis. My onc says the MRI with contrast is the best way to measure changes in the liver. But at some point I would like to get a PET. The insurance rationale was that it wouldn\u2019t impact treatment. I still haven\u2019t set up a second opinion so maybe when I go for that I can get one. I had a brief moment of panic today. I called my treating facility to ask for copies of my blood test with tumor markers from last week, which I\u2019ve gotten from the front office in the past without needing to talk to my onc. She looked in the system then told me she would need to have the doctor call me, so my immediate thought was \u201cthis must be bad news\u201d. Fortunately my onc calledback really quickly within 10 minutes and told me that the markers were stable. They were just having issues with access because they\u2019re converting to a new system. It would be nice if they would go down but I\u2019m OK with stable. I decided to delay my next scans until after our vacation to Hawaii next month. ",

My Foundation One test came back with the ESR1 mutation mentioned in the article which may be partly why I developed/progressed my liver metastasis while taking anastrozole. The report recommended Faslodex and said AI\u2019swould not be effective for me. The good news is that is what I am taking, along with a Ibrance. Since my progression was within 2 years of my first treatment I\u2019m wondering how long I\u2019ve had the mutation and was dealing with side effects from a drug that wasn\u2019t working or if it ever worked for me. I also had 2 other mutations that are common in lobular, probably somatic but could be inherited so my MO referred me to genetic counseling, which she wouldn\u2019t do when I was originally diagnosed and treated. I totally relate to what you have all said about needing to be very active in driving our care. For example I would not have even known about the Foudation One if I hadn\u2019t been on these boards and asked my MO to order it. Thursday I spent hours and many, manyphone calls dealing with the office staff working on getting scan orders processed, correct timing of my follow up appointments and a few other things that should have been easy. Felt like total craziness. Enough complaining. Late Thursday afternoon I drove to a local park with my binoculars to and saw a big white bird with a very long beak, turned out to be a pelican, fly down to the water of the small lake in front of me and spent an hour watching it and many other birds which was quite calming. It reminded me that often getting out in nature often is the best medicine.    ",

The polyps were removed and she described them as small but didn\u2019t upload the report to the system so I can\u2019t see it for myself. I have lobular which I\u2019ve heard will sometimes metastasize to the G.I. tract. Lobular is also difficult to see, so there could be more that is undetected. I\u2019ve had several MRIs with contrast of my abdomen and pelvis over the past year and these mets have not shown up on those scans. On the other hand, my recent liver MRI came back greatwith more shrinkage and mets barely visible at this point. However it did note that I have stones or possibly polyps in my gallbladder, something I don\u2019t recall from any prior reports though I need to check. I\u2019ve been having a lot of gastro symptoms, constipation gas gastritis, etc. lately and wondering if they may be related to either of these new findings. The gastroenterologist called my oncologist yesterday and I haven\u2019t heard from her yet. I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s likely that the cancer is been in in the colon all along, just wasn\u2019t able to be detected on scans. Anyway that\u2019s what I\u2019m choosing to believe for now, that the I/F treatment is working systemically and this is not indicative of any type of progression. I was a bit concerned because my tumor markers went up a bit but that blood test was done within a week of the scan with the good results, also the day after my colonoscopy which between prep and procedure maybe impacted the results. My potassium on that test was also low for the first time ever If anyone has any insights on breast cancer in the colon I\u2019d be interested in hearing about your experience and knowledge. Best wishes to all.",

I agree with Z that it is difficult to deal with care and decisions while going's through such severe pain. Maybe you can get some quicker local care for that. I'm in California now but originally from the Midwest and feel so bad for you trying to drive in bad snow and having to cancel your appointment and delay your treatment. Cure-ious and Z it is helpful to see your comments on immunotherapy. It totally makes sense that earlier is better, while your immune system is less compromised. From my recent cold I can see an impact on mine already. My MO hasn't mentioned next steps after Ibrance/Faslodex, just said we need to hope for it to be effective for a long time. I haven't set up a 2nd opinion appointment at UCSF yet but feel like it's time to do that for another opinion in the event of other recommendations or future trials and next line treatments. Also to ask about Y90 or other radiation options which my MO did not support. I'll be starting my 5 cycle later this week. I think several of you have used/use complimentary treatments for example Vitamin C infusions. I just heard about a nearby naturopathic physician who provides various therapies for patients undergoing cancer treatment. I'm interested in any thoughts about things to consider in going to a naturopath. Best wishes to all.",

It's hard to tell with oncologists if they just focus on the one direction they want to go and don't want to consider any other options or just aren't very good at communicating. My oncologist was also pretty dismissive of the foundation one recommendations. She said there were several treatments she'd want to try before the actionable recommendations in the report. For now we both hope Ibrance works for a while. My concern is looking for options is what next if/when Ibrance fails. One of the men in my local cancer support group who has pancreatic cancer recently hired a doctor to consult with him on looking at treatment options for the future to provide additional input with whathis current oncologists is doing. He is feeling really good about the consultant and I made note of it as something to consider in the future.",

That seems to be what happened to me, Ibrance worked well on my liver Mets but in the meantime I was getting new mets or maybe had unseen mets in my G.I. system that it did not effec. So now I will be switching Doxil. It is so frustrating. One minute you think things are going well with your treatment only to find out that it\u2019s not working after all. My new meysaren\u2019t able to be seen on Imaging so I\u2019m not even sure how they\u2019re going to measure whether the treatment\u2019s effective other than by having my stomach start functioning again. Hopefully research will come up with better solutions sometime soon .  ",

I am hoping they have a good plan that will provide an effective treatment that allows you to maintain a good quality of life. Grannax I was also sad to hear your news. Hopefully with just one met they can do a local treatment. I know from my recent experience how disappointing it is to think all is going well, then suddenly find out it isn\u2019t.",
