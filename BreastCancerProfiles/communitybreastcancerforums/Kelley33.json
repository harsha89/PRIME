Went to see surgeon and she said it's just normal dense tissue. This year when I went for my physical, my PCP said as she was doing my breast exam; have you had your mammo this year and had this lump checked. Well of course, I immediately began to worry again. Went for mammo and received letter stating mammo was clear but I should have clinical evaluation because not all cancers are seen on mammograms. I don't know what else I can have done other than a biospy. My paternal grandmother died of BC as well as her brother , have a aunt battling BC and my maternal grandmother had ovarian cancer. Therefore, I am always worried anytime something like this happens. I know you are worried and that's understandable. Try and not let it consume you and wishing you the best.",

For the past three weeks, I have been having dull aching pain off and on in left breast only. Should I see my doctor or be satisfied with the mammo results for this year.
