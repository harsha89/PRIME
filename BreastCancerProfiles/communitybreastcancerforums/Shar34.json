A quick overview, I found a hard lump last summer, and the initial ultrasound said fibroadenoma, second lump appeared a few months later and had second ultrasound which ended up me being sent for a core biopsy.   I just met with the Dr who said the biopsy came back not malignant but there was thick tissue.  He says there is no \"capsule\" around the masses which would suggest a fibroadenoma.  He said next week he is going to take my case to the team, and they will discuss it.  What do you think this means?  He says he's 99% sure it's benign (I needed a number to compare)  He did say I could have the lumps taken out, but it's not as simple as a fibroadenoma as my lumps are thick without the capsule around it.   I left a message with the nurse to call me back so I can go over again about my appt.  I did have my husband with me but I was so nervous and hubby did tell me what the dr said, but I'm one that has to make sure I heard everything correctly!!
