The tech. took like 60 pictures of my right breast where even I could see something? Compared to maybe 20 of the other breast. When it was over she left the room to see the Dr. and told me to wait to see if he wanted more photos. I could hear him and he said no that he had all he needed and couldn't tell anything definite from the photos. He came in with her and said I had a small mass with dialated ductwork, I do have some breast discharge yellowish in color, but that nothing looked cancerous, but he's recommending an MRI because there is enough going on that's cause for some concern? Huh? Clear as mud. He seemed worried about something though, so now I'm worried. Plus my chest is so sore. A routine mamogram showed something abnormal. The day of the mammogram I had a pelvic ultrasound looking for fibroids because as I've gotten older, 44,  I have been having  heavy periods and I did have a fibroid removed in my 20s.  I really wanted some help with this problem which now seems to be on the back burner. When I had the mammogram the right side it really hurt when I had the mammogram. Could this all be my wacky hormones? I have had weird hormone levels in the past. Any ideas? I hate waiting and I guess that is all I can do now. Donna Log in to post a reply",

Apparently the ultra-sound I had done at the other hospital was no good so I needed another on. They only took a few pictures unlike the other where the tech. kept pushing down.  They said it did not look like cancer, but to be sure come back in a week for a needle biopsy.  Today I just had that done along with another mammogram. I'm not too sure on why I needed another mammogram following the biopsy. It was less painful than I anticipated considering how sore the first mammogram was. They still said it does not look like cancer, but that I have a whole lot of dialated milk ducts? I'm not finding much information on what this is or why this is? Next week I'll get the results and I'll update this post then. Donna",
