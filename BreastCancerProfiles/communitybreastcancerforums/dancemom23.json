I think they also 'shot' into the air to let me know what sound to expect.  I went home with 2 steri strips (I think, but with the size of it, I can't imagine why, maybe they were x'd) covered by a bandaid.  The bandaid was off the next day.  My steri strips were stuck on for like 3 weeks until I finally pulled them off (same thing after my lumpectomy, not sure why these things won't come off of me!) Good luck!",

Yesterday I had a late afternoon appointment and for the first time since I started, the waiting room was completely full.  Usually when I get there for a 4:00 appt, they are waiting for me, so I knew there had to be some sort of a problem.  Apparently some part of the machine wasn't working right, so it was taking every one a bit longer to set up, and by the end of the day they were far behind.  Up until yesterday, the longest wait I had was about 20 minutes, I ended up having to wait about an hour and a half.  Today I was at 7:45, so even thought the machine was still not working properly, no delay because they hadn't had a chance to get backed up yet. They handed me a card yesterday for an appointment tomorrow for a CT scan to sim for my boosts - I wasn't really expecting that, but I guess it makes sense. The mudslide looks great - that's my favorite drink for girls weekends (when my daughters have their dance competitions, the moms have to have fun too - right?)! Kristy - I was also told no ice/no heat - at my very first appointment they handed me a list of dos and don'ts and that was on there, they never actually told me that though.  I worry about my shower being too hot - I like a HOT shower, and since it is starting to get pretty cold here, I need that hot shower even more, I just try to keep it up when my back is to the shower and turn it down when I turn around. I also have an itchy spot right at the top of the entire area - I was also told to use OTC hydrocortizone cream.  She said if it got worse I should let them know and they would prescribe something stronger.  So far I am still just using the aquaphor and the generic hydrocortizone cream.  I don't really have any blisters yet, just a few \"bumps\" are starting to show up.  I just put my prescription for Tamoxifen in the mail so that I have it for when I am done.",

I have an appointment with the med onc the day after my last boost - we set the appointment before we knew when I would be starting rads (or even what type I was having) so it's interesting that it is one day later.  My tamoxifen arrived yesterday, but I am not supposed to take it until after rads, so I guess I won't take it at all until after my appointment Tuesday. Today it still hurts, but not nearly as much as it did over the weekend, but I have stopped wearing a bra - I hope my coworkers are enjoying my new \"free\" look, but I guess they understand. For the regular treatments, no sharpie markings - they just worked off the tattoos.  For the boosts they are marking me every day.  I guess that's better than more tattoos, and at least it is not ruining the bras that I am not wearing.  I have requested purple markings since I wear purple almost every day. Tracy & vhqh - we are nearing the end of treatments together, hope all goes well for the last few.  Thanks to the others for not abandoning us. ",

I asked about the number of treatments and she said 28 with 5 boosts at the end but then said 32 total, so I'm not 100% sure how many. I wanted the last appointment of the day (which is 4:00) so I can leave work early every day and not have to go back (since I have been working very late every night since I have been back to work).  The only problem with that is apparently that they sometimes have to do certain treatments at the end of the day, so I willl get bumped for that.  Tomorrow is 4:00, next week is 7:45 am (at least at the beginning of the week) - after that we will play it by ear. She reminded me not to wear deodorant, but started mentioning some natural stuff they make, so I asked about using Tom's of Maine which was actually what she was talking about and she told me to get some and bring it in (I already have it) so they can check out the ingredients - I'm REALLY hoping it will be OK. I guess I will know better after tomorrow how a typical treatment will go.  I feel so far behind you all - almost like I don't belong here in the Sept group. Chris",

I can relate to the driving a distance - when I am at work, it's not so far, but Monday I was off, so I drove 45 minutes, was there for 10 minutes and drove 45 minutes home.  Somehow when I have to wait a few minutes to get in it seems like the travel was a little more worth it.

I asked about using the Tom's of Maine deodorant and was told no  - they gave me some deodorant crystal spray mist, but it doesn't seem to work as claimed.  I'll continue to use the Tom's on the right anyway. I think I'm glad that I'm easing in to this all with this first week being a partial week of treatments followed by a restful weekend before getting into the full swing of it all. Have a great weekend! Chris",

Nancy, I have been extremely busy at work, my dx came right in the middle of a huge project with a deadline of October 1.  So while I am glad I have had this project to keep me busy, some days it has been hard to concentrate, hopefully all will be ready next week - I have no choice in the matter, so I totally understand the schizophrenia thing.

Tomorrow is my last.  This weekend I started peeling underneath my boob - any thing I put on it is stinging.  I'm still slathering on the aquaphor at night, but trying to keep it away from the peeling area - not easy since it is pretty close to my scar where I'm getting the boosts, and I want to make sure to get that area.  I have used Neosporine as the Dr recommended, then tucking some gauze in there to \"protect\" it.  There are multiple different colors going on - generally red and redder, with some purple, gray, brown and white - under my arm it just looks dirty.  Oh well, I guess it is only going to get better going forward. I am going to make some fudge today to take into the techs tomorrow - if I can get up, get ready, and go to the store to get the ingredients, I'm just being lazy this weekend.",

Makraz - not sure about the visits with the rad onc - I've wondered that myself after I got the bill for the first visit with the rad onc before rads started - my insurance covered 80%.  I'm starting to see bills (really EOBs from the insurance) with balances for my 20% (I think just for doctor visits) and I'm having a hard time figuring out what they are for - I guess I'll have to wait to see if I get an actual bill.  The part I am worried about were the initial 3 simulations I had (which is what I think these bills are for) - I don't think they were all necessary, so I am hoping I will not have to pay for all 3.  The first one was done at one cancer center and because I wanted the mammosite trial they needed specific requirements and couldn't get a good enough picture there, I had to go to another center with a newer machine, then by the time I was denied mammosite, they decided too much time had passed so they wanted yet another simulation.  I certainly hope they don't make me pay for those plus the weekly visits for the doctor to say - how are you feeling?  I guess it would be worth it to at least question it.",
