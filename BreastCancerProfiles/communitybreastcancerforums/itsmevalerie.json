The pain seems to come and go and sometimes I feel a slight swelling in the right armpit. I do not detect any lumps, and not experiencing any other signs like change in appearance, discharge, etc. I am going to the doctor tomorrow and to say that I'm scared is an understatement. My mind is just racing and jumping to conclusions already. I've told no one about this except my husband and now you...I just don't want to worry anyone. I'm trying to keep the panic down but I'm getting myself so worked up I can hardly breathe! Just needed to \"get it out\" to someone, I guess. Â Valerie Log in to post a reply",

Holy cow, my head is just spinning. Nurse said don't worry..doesn't appear to be a mass..possibly an \"artifact\" (??). But they just want to be sure. I have very dense breasts and fibrocystic disease. I do self exams and I'm not finding anything out of the ordinary. Here's the thing...I've actually been having pain in both breasts but mainly in the RIGHT breast. It's not constant..it's not always in the same place...it doesn't keep me up at night or anything, but it's just THERE. I find nothing different on the outside, no problem in the nipple area. I complained about it over a year ago to a GYN and she seemed stumped...ended up telling me it's probably hormonal and add more fiber to my diet! (by the way I am 53) I don't even know what to think about all this other than petrified! Any thoughts?? Log in to post a reply",
