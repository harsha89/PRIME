She said anything can set off the numbers, infection, cold, STRESS (which I am under cuz of my Dad) and I mentioned to her about giving blood 8 days B4 the test and she said that could very well do it. PHEW so this person is going to STOP worrying. OH BTW, I had a scope put up my butt and I have 3 hemmeroids and 1 anal fissure. He wants to see me in 3 weeks.

So glad to say he gave me a clean bill off health on the procedure.  Nothing found although I do have diviticulosis and a B9 polyp was removed during the colonoscopy. Tubular Adenoma.",

FYI, if anyone is on thyroid medicine, calcium and Vit D interfere with the potency of your med.  I found that out a few months ago.  So I take my calcium and Vit D at night.  I hope nothing interferes with Arimidex, does anyone know anything about that?",

Scarred lymphatic vessels which are thin, cord-like structures that look a bit like violin strings may also appear underneath the skin of your arm. Cording usually develops within a few weeks after surgery. These structures, although alarming, are essentially harmless and will disappear or actually \"snap\" on their own as you do your stretching exercises.",

I have been going there to have my mams since I was 42, I am now 59.  When I was dx in March of 2007, my BS ordered Bone Scan, CT, MRI, chest X-rays and tons of blood work.  Nothing found except for a cyst in my Pancreas which I probably had for a long time and did not know.  So that was followed with a MRI every 6 months for a few years, it is gone now.  I had mams every 6 months for almost 2 yrs and saw my onc every 4 months.  Now it is down to mams once a year with a follow up with BS right after.  I just had TM test done, all was normal except one, it was abnormal. My onc says not to worry because the others were in the normal range.  So I will have the blood work re-done in March with a few more liver function tests which I know are normal.  I have those test done every 6 months because of thyroid and cholestoral meds.",
