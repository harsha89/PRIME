In my case my oncologist said my cure rate was at 82%. In other words there was an 82% chance it wouldn't come back if I just did AI drugs. I happen to be 40 with a 12 year old son so 82% was not good enough for me. It is not going to be fun. It will suck and you'll question it the whole time, but is it worth it? Yes, in my opinion. I go for round 2 of AC on Friday and even though I know what to expect, I'm still nervous. As far as going out into public, sure! Thoughout this first cycle I've pretty much lived life as normal. I've been working (I teach high school). I grocery shop. We went out to dinner with friends and I went out to dinner with my son tonight. I did want to go see Wonder Woman over the weekend, but it was my nadir so I thought it was best not to be in an enclosed movie theater during that time. However, I'm planning a trip to Arizona between rounds this summer (driving, not flying) and basically living life as normal. The more normal things I do, the more normal I feel. I told my husband the other night that despite the fact that I have cancer and have to go through all of this medical junk, I'm a pretty happy person. I'm spending my time looking at all of the positives in life and celebrating them. They are what is getting me though those moments when I sit in shock and think, \"holy *hit, I have cancer.\" We can all do hard things. I promise",

One thing we don't realize before we are bald is how cold your head gets. Invest in a good soft beanie. I bought one at our cancer center store. Cost me $40, but worth every cent. It is bamboo and spandex and I mostly wear it around the house and in the garden. It's lightweight, cute and keeps my head warm.

I felt very good yesterday. I worked in the garden all day long. It was so nice! I plan on doing it again today. I'm taking advantage of the good days and getting stuff done.

I've been eating out, eating fresh fruits and veggies (washing them first) and my WBC was 10.17 before AC#3 this week. The neulasta works! I get my neulasta on the same day as the chemo. My MO said that in order to get it approved for the original chemo/cancer regiment it was delayed. The thought behind it is that the chemo is supposed to kill off the fast growing cells, but if you give neulasta right away it rebuilds cells. However, in trials post neulasta approval they find there is no difference. Therefore it is ok to be given the same day. The shot itself (according to my EOB) is $10,000 each time. Day 4 and so far so good for me. The new anti-nausea med is working much better. I've been hungry all day and eaten all kinds of random foods. Key lime frozen cake, guacamole, grilled cheese, bagel, cherries, granola. Whatever sounds good. The fatigue has set in a bit and I napped twice today.

My theory at the moment is if it tastes good eat it. Crisp bean burritos from Taco Time are one of my favorites. My symptoms are not as bad since being on chemo. I still have some belly bloating when I eat gluten, but not like it normally would be. I also am not getting the mouth blisters that I would usually get. I can't tell if nose running is gluten related or lack of nose hair related. I'm guessing nose hair. Did you mean lymphoma or lymphadema? I'd never heard of celiacs eating gluten causing lymphoma. I'm in the same camp as you with weight gain. I've gained 6 pounds. I agree that it is lack of activity and diet. I'm normally a vegetarian and try very hard to continue, but I'm also anemic so I've had a few too many cheese burgers. I also ordered a steak in a restaurant one night. It was a bad choice, but I needed the iron. I can only eat so much kale. I still have my brows and lashes too. I have noticed them falling out a little more now that I've started Taxol. The last little bit of stubble on my head is also falling out at a rapid pace. However, if I look close I can see little baby hairs here and there on the top of my head. I've heard that some women begin to regrow their hair during taxol. Maybe I'll be lucky and at least get this considering I'm one of the rare ones who responds so poorly to Taxol. It's sad to say that I'd take AC over Taxol. Round #2 was just as bad as #1. I broke down and told my husband I can't do it anymore. He told me I could and I love him for that",

I went to bed at 8:30 last night. Part of that is because I have a wee bit of a cold. The teenaged carrier monkeys decided to share with me. I met with my RO and it looks like 28 rounds for me. No boosts. She did a mini chest CT for planning purposes. It took over a week to get the results back and to be honest I was a little nervous. To this point no one had looked at interior nodes, my sternum or lungs. Good news is the scans came back clear. I have the radiation simulation on the 28th and should start treatments shortly thereafter. I\u2019m 2/3 of the way done with this journey (except reconstruction). My hair is slowly growing back.

This allows them to make sure your WBC counts are adequate and gives them all the information to mix your chemo drugs. They are specifically mixed for you and your cancer. I get my Neulasta shot on the same day as my chemo. My MO doesn't feel that it is necessary to wait the 27 hours or whatever it is. That was just part of how the drug was approved for a different treatment. I do know many women who have given it to themselves. It's ridiculous how tiny the shot is for the price insurance is charged for it. My personal regimen for meds is colace and senna day before just to get my body prepared then 2 colace in the AM and senna at night for the first week after AC. Claritin day of and for 5 days after (haven't had bone pain yet). I take lorazepam every night, but add Compazine the first week. I can't take Zofran because it gives me a horrible headache. I also take the compazine any time I feel the slightest twinge of nausea. When I go to chemo I take a blanket my aunt made for me as a comfort item. My cancer center has a blanket warmer that we're encouraged to help ourselves from. I also take my iPad with the pencil and draw most of the time. I've taken a book, but I don't have the brain capacity to read. My cancer center has private rooms so my husband picks a playlist for us to listen to. Last time it was Sgt. Peppers then Macklemore.

My husband shaved it off that Sunday to about a 2mm buzz cut. I was expecting it to continue falling out and it was short enough that I would be able to rub my head to get the rest out. This was true. It would come out in the shower when the pores on my head were more open. Otherwise it wouldn't really shed. By the next Friday the top of my head hurt so bad from the stubble and the scarf on my head. I actually went to the seniors awards assembly at school with nothing but a flower crown on my head because the scarf hurt so bad. Talk about feeling vulnerable. A gym full of 1600 high schoolers seeing one of their teachers bald. That night I used my husband's electric shaver to buzz it down to the scalp and it felt much better. The hair that was left still grows albeit so very slowly. I did use the shaver to give myself a \"haircut\" at one point. It wasn't really falling out anymore. However, yesterday I rubbed my head over the bathroom sink and a bit more came out. I'm day 11 AC#3. My armpit hair stopped growing shortly after AC#1. I've only shaved my legs once since AC#1. I still have arm hair, but it's thinner than normal. And on an intimate level... I have about 1/2 of my pubic hair left and that's stopped falling out. I still have my eyebrows and eyelashes. I have nose hair in one nostril and a limited \"supply\" in the other. That's because I have a nose piercing and I have to clean that side a little more vigorously. So my nose runs all the time on that side. My scalp is super dry and when I rub it to try to get the stubble out I start to look like a leper. So instead of fixing my hair every morning I make sure I moisturize. Cuts down on the getting ready in the morning",

I could put in where I needed transportation, meals or general help and people could sign up for what worked with their schedule. And 2) just flat out asking specific people for help.

Only 4 weeks of school remaining... I can do this MsRobin - I wish you luck tomorrow. While you're getting your 2nd dose I'll be getting my port placed. I'm digging out the dangly earrings and brighter lipstick too! I also had a friend suggest the brow bar at Ulta. I think I'll be making a visit there when the time comes. I am a little worried about the loss of nose hair. I don't think we take into consideration all the places we lose the hair. I have terrible allergies and can have bouts of post nasal drip as it is. Without nose hair to hold it in I'll have to carry Kleenex with me everywhere. Ugh.",

My thought is that it is the end of the school year and there really is not much of substance going on for the next 4 weeks. I'm going to administer finals early because I'll have a treatment on one of our actual finals days. Then I can get my grading done and not worry. Upheld - my RO said the same thing about reconstruction. She said that radiation does damage to tissue and she doesn't want to radiate newly reconstructed breasts. Both she and the plastic surgeon said that natural tissue reconstruction is a better option for patients who have undergone radiation.

I even went to our seniors assembly at school wearing just a flower crown on my head. Whole school got to see my bald head. However, on Friday the last remaining bit of stubble from the shave was driving me nuts. Thus the flower crown at the assembly. The top of my head was killing me. We decided to go out to dinner because I was having a serious craving for a cheeseburger. (My iron levels must be low). I didn't have the energy to fully wrap up my head and I don't really have hats that don't make me look like a cancer patient. Anyway. I quickly wrapped a scarf around my head. I looked tired and frankly rather cancer patienty. As we're sitting at dinner I notice this family across the restaurant. The husband and wife are talking and the wife turns around and looks at me. Right at me. She talks to her husband and turns around and looks at me again. This happened 3 times! My husband likes to give people the benefit of the doubt and he said maybe she was a survivor. I just made me feel like the object of someone's pity. Anyone who actually talks to me would see that I am nothing to be pitied. I'm strong, confident and determined to not let this illness slow me down. However, I realized that there are going to be times that I just want to be anonymous. I want to throw something on my head and blend in. I'm lucky in that my local cancer center has a store that is specifically designed for... well, cancer patients. It's nice. They do free head shaves for people, carry a large selection of hats and they also do wig consults. They have over 400 different wigs to try on. I tried on all kinds of them; long, short, straight, curly. I went with a medium blonde/brown asymmetrical short cut. It looks just like my old hair. Now I can be anonymous when I want to.",

It doesn't seem to be that common. It was a very long appointment. I had to get my blood draw at 7 am and then my infusion appointment was at 9, but they called me back at about 8:30. Pre-meds were steriods, Benadryl, zofran and a heartburn med. That took the usual 45 minutes or so then a 30 minute \"marinate.\" The taxol was set to infuse over 3 hours. My MO said that they do a long infusion the first time because of the potential allergy/side effects. They want to see if any crop up. About 1/2 way through my hands and feet were a little sore so they stopped the infusion, gave me more Benadryl and restarted 30 minutes later. They also slowed down the rate. I didn't get out of there until 2:15. 7 1/2 hours! Ugh. I'm on day 3 now. The nausea is nothing like AC. I haven't had any issues with it at all. There also haven't been any food taste changes so far. My major SEs are fatigue (but not horrible), pain and diarrhea. My MO warned me about the pain. It is odd. It's joint/muscle pain. It moves around, but for now it's settled in my knees and thighs and forearms. The first night my arms were tingly from the elbows down, but that subsided. Overall this drug is much more tolerable (so far). I was able to get out and walk about a mile yesterday morning. Tylenol mostly takes care of the pain so I can get up and down the stairs in my house. I don't have to take steriods aside from that in the pre-meds. I'm hoping this will allow me to eat more sensibly as opposed to likea 12 year old boy.",

By Wednesday night the pain was much worse and I could not sleep at all. I finally got up and took Vicodin just so I could sleep. In the morning the pain was still there. Tylenol and ibuprofen were not touching this and I was in tears. I tried an epsom salt bath with no relief. My husband finally took matters into his own hands and made a trip to buy a CBD tincture. Fortunately that helped relieve some of the pain. I would much rather use a natural method of pain control like CBD than deal with all of the side effects of Vicodin. Last night the pain was so bad I had to crawl up the stairs. That warranted the Vicodin. Fortunately I was able to sleep off and on with another does at 2:00 am. This morning I am still sore, but can get around much better. I am hoping that with a little walk later I can work things out.

In preparation for losing the hair I cut it in a short pixie and had my hairdresser color it in a rainbow. It's now faded to a very cute unicorn look. My theory was that if it was going to fall out I wanted to see colorful hair on the counter and floor rather than chunks of sad brown. I've been loving it. I intend to shave it when it starts to fall out. I'm a teacher and I've considered asking my students if they want the honors. It will be the end of the school year when it falls out. After it's gone I'll go with scarves. I spent many hours watching YouTube videos on scarf wrapping from the lovely ladies at Wrapunzel. I have a shaper to make it appear as if there is hair under the scarf and boat load of beautiful scarves (most of which I already had). I'm going to make chemo beautiful... now if I could only learn how to draw in eyebrows. I'm owning this whole journey. I frequently wear an F-Cancer t-shirt. I wear inappropriate socks to all cancer related doctor appointments. I even have a girlfriend that sent me an F-Cancer bracelet from Sweden. I'm taking charge as opposed to letting it take over me",

One of them was gardening. I almost cried. We compromised and she said to avoid it during the low days, always wear glove and I may want to wear 2 pair. 2 pairs of gloves! HA! I have no breast nor ovaries doc. I'm hot all. The. Time! Besides she doesn't exactly know how aggressive I am as a gardener. I finally had enough energy to go out yesterday. In a flurry of activity I weeded 1/2 of my back flower bed. I came in with little scratches everywhere from pulling blackberries. Yeah...

It's almost where the sentinel node biopsy scar is, but it kind of feels like it's under the expander. If I press on the top of the expander it doesn't hurt, but if I move my shoulder forward it does. I have a feeling that I just have over extended myself the past two weeks cleaning the greenhouses getting ready for the end of school. I do plan on talking with the nurse tomorrow. I'm just concerned that it's a little bit of lymphadema. It doesn't appear to be swollen, just hurts. The other thing is my hands. I'm pretty sure the start of neuropathy is setting in. The skin on my thumbs and index fingers, on the palm side, is killing me. It kind of feels like when I have dry winter skin, but it's not rough like that. I chose not to ice my hands and feet because it was a pain in the rear to set all of that up. I will say my feet hurt too, but I've been going like mad this week and haven't made the best shoe choices. I will talk to the nurse about this one too. She asked about it last time, but I didn't have any pain. This makes me sad because I also teach floral design and don't even have a desire to arrange the leftover flowers in the cooler because my hands hurt",

I'm headed out the door in a little bit for my last DD Taxol! Today is the last day of my chemo journey. I can't wait to walk out of there today. There's no bell at my cancer center, but I have other plans. We decided to do an end of chemo party tomorrow. We've invited tons of people and tons have RSVP'd. A few people are worried I won't be up for it. I figured that I'll still be on the steroid high and if not, I'll park myself in a chair and people can come to me. I do love a good party. The only sour note about the party is that last night my best friend was admitted to the ICU. She had abdominal pain and fluid had built up in her abdomen. They drained 800 ml of fluid and did an ultrasound. They aren't quite sure what is wrong with her. Test results should come in this morning. My worst fear is some kind of cancer. The pain came on suddenly, but she'd been battling a bronchial issue for months. Like Susie's patient she's 48 with a daughter the same age as my son. The two kids are like brother and sister. While ending chemo today should be very exciting for me it is bittersweet because I would much rather be with my friend. I have to settle for text between the husbands for information. On a more positive note, I wish all of you the best this holiday weekend. Enjoy the sun if it is out. Hug your loved ones",

I had to wait for over an hour in radiology because they were so backed up. Once they called me back everything went very smoothly. It was an odd sensation for them to place it while still being awake. The coolest part was after they took the final x-ray I could see it up on the giant monitor. I could see the port and the line, but also the metal ports for the tissue expanders. It looked like I had nipples for the first time in over a month!

I have a friend going with me for that. The PA always finds it hilarious that I bring a different person with me almost every time. I have friends lining up to go with me for \"boob fills.\" They find the process fascinating. I can feel the port tube going over my collar bone.
