It was not pleasant, it didn't last long. I still have 2 drains in and I'm thinking of just keeping them, though. Not really ;)  So I met with the surgeon today. She said everything went well and looks great. The weird thing is that she said there were no nodes under my arm. She could not pick up any of the radioactive isotope and none of the blue dye picked up under my arm either. She said she spent a lot of time looking and even felt around and there was nothing. She said my prior radiation pretty much destroyed everything and it was just a lot of scar tissue. I talk with my onc tomorrow. Does anyone know what this means for staging? Do we just assume stage one?",

I am not a candidate for an implant due to all the damage from the rads I had. The only other option would be a lat flap and I'm not comfortable with that. I can pull things on over my head if they are stretchy, but getting them off can be tricky. Hubby is a big help when needed. With the bras, he could help me, too.

She said, and I agree, why get more than needed right now, especially because last time I had heavy treatment and they cannot use the same chemo again. But it seems most people here fall into the neoadjuvant rather than adjuvant treatment or were able to delay reconstruction. My PS is doing immediate DIEP reconstruction and 2 weeks later I meet with my onc to confirm which types of chemo and targeted therapy I will receive, with those treatments starting immediately thereafter. Anyone else in this boat? I'm concerned about recovering from this very major surgery while doing chemo as I remember what the chemo was like last time around.

I am not totally sure how it will work. Mostly from a clothing stand point. The PS said no bra until at least the end of April, possibly May.

I hope everyone has a quick recovery. \"Good\" news about work is that in addition to cutting pay and laying off people, they abolished the dress code. There's nothing in writing, so I can only go off what my boss texted me: no shorts, no rubber flip flops, nothing vulgar. So I can at least wear leggings, since my abdomen still has some swelling and jeans and more structured pants are uncomfortable. Just need to get some loose tunic length shirts. The PS said I can wear a bra as long as it is front closure and non compression non underwire, which HE felt was an easy find (not sure when he was last bra shopping), but in reality, is not. I have 7 days to track something down. I'm tall and need adjustable straps so nothing tugs, rides up on, or pulls on the DIEP side. I've found 1 non compression front closing bra but it's a racer back with non adjustable straps. The straps are about 1/2\" to 3/4\" too short. Worse comes to worse I I'll add a bit of elastic to lengthen them",

What treatments will you be getting? 14 years ago I was treated with 4 AC and the 4 Taxotere. The side effects were not pleasant but were very manageable, especially if I did exactly what my chemo nurses said. The first AC I took some of the anti nausea meds but not all and was queasy quite a bit. I hadn't understood their instructions as well as I thought and when I clarified them at my next treatment, I did much better the next three. I let myself get terrified by side effects I read about others experiencing on Taxotere. I talked to my nurse at the first treatment and she was patient and understanding and went through my concerns with me, putting my fears at ease. My side effects were quite minimal compared to what others experienced.So talk with your team. I hope you find them as caring as mine were. Side effects are scary but know that everyone reacts differently. Just because a side effect can occur, it doesn't mean it will happen to you or be as severe as someone else. Your chemo nurses can help you manage them so don't hesitate to talk with them. Hair loss is hard, no way around it. I have found taking charge made me feel in control of something I have very little control over. Last time, and this time, I cut my long hair into a cute short cut. There are great thread here to read and gain support from. Does your treatment center have a social worker you can talk with? Or maybe they have a support group or can put you in touch with?",

Hopefully everything looks good to the doctors on the 4th. I'm getting Taxol and Herceptin weekly for 12 weeks.",
