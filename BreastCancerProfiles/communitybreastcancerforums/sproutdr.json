OMG can you say freak out... It's my first MRI and just would like ur opinions on this one...maybe I shld stop reading and as NIKE says \"JUST DO IT!\" lol  I had my period until 31, went thru chemical menopause with BC, then after tamoxifen and lupron for 5 yrs...well mother nature came a knocking again at 37 & I guess I'm feeling anxious getting my follow up check ups n scans w/ estrogen running around again over the past 3 yrs... yay periods!
