    "Content": "EMS568 wrote: I was diagnosed last year with DCIS of the right breast. I'm 8 months post lumpectomy with radiation. I was originally on Tamoxifene but quit taking it because my blood pressure became dangerously high for weeks on end. It caused severe joint pain and the night sweats as well. My oncologist took me off the Tamoxifene and I was off the med for a month (and felt great!) and then I started Raloxifene. I've been on it for almost 2 months and I am having severe joint pain, lower back pain, and arm pain, involving my elbows, ironically. I am a paramedic and volunteer firefighter and I feel I am having difficulties performing my job. The pain in my lower extremities has gotten so bad, I feel worthless. I don't sleep well at nights and on average, I get one night of good, full sleep.  In the entire time I've been seen by my oncologist, he has only done labs one time. I have no clue if the DCIS was taken care of by the radiation, and my oncologist stated to me, 'there's no way to be sure, there are no blood tests to determine that'. So in a nut shell, I was diagnosed, had surgery, then radiation. On Raloxifene, and now feeling horrible. I have no clue if the DCIS is gone, and I'd like someone to explain to me how to know if the radiation was effective and how to live my life, with the horrible effects of raloxifene. Any insight would be fantastic! Log in to post a reply",
