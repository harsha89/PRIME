I'm sorry you had a tragedy in the family.  I hope you're feeling physically a little better today with the antibiotics and all. I had something burst in my under arm the last week of radiation (just had five weeks of rads, final treatment on april 30), combined with chemotherapy at the same time. A \"fold\" in the armpit cracked and crevassed, and was purulent. I thought it was because I had put cream there, but the \"cream\" I noticed (stinky) was actually pus. (sorry... tmi). It helped to read the opening article about  \"missing skin\". Anyhow, they're having me put Eosin on it three times a day to keep it dried out. It's painful at night, and in the morning. I think I'll live.",

If you do have a wish to keep your hair, do take the head freezer. I'm being taken off Halaven now and going to Xeloda. Ironically my hair has chosen this time to fall out all at once. I lost all my hair twice before, the last time was when I was on a stronger dose of Halaven, it began exactly three weeks after the first treatment. Then my hair grew back while I was switched to a different chemo (Cisplatin) in preparation for my second mastectomy, and while waiting to be recovered enough to begin Halaven again. Halaven began again in November 2018, this time on a reduced dose, so my hair did not even think about falling out, or so I thought. The nurses even offered me a head-freezer contraption last time, and I refused, thinking there was no need. Well my last treatment was the 28th of February. Here we are March 20 - I guess that is exactly three weeks later. Now look what happened. Sigh. And all my pretty chocolate shoulder length hair is now hoping to make a bird nest in the garden.

They took me off Halaven because the right side was progressing during it, however it did a good job of beating back the bone and lymph node mets and the skin on the left side. The right breast and left ex-breast have different profiles and do not respond to the same things ! so now we are trying to cool the cancer in the right breast with daily radiation, and weekly Cisplatin, hoping to get to a place where a palliative mastectomy will be safe. However now the left side is marching forward, with skin mets moving down the abdomen. I guess skin mets are not that concerning, won't kill me, but maybe are a screen for worse ? Not sure whether we are going to go through with the whole of the planned five weeks of Cisplatin and rads now because the radiation doctor was worried. Anyhow, that's more than you wanted to know I'm sure ! I'm still feeling pretty upbeat most of the time, although yesterday was a bit of a meltdown. Argh. I'm happy to see all my old friends here on this thread, quite an active thread, isn't it. Okay, well good luck ladies !",

I had my first shot on the 6th of February. Yesterday the 7th and today the 8th, I've had a dull headache and more than usual sleepiness. Lots of extra sleeping has happened in the last two days. I haven't found much written on side effects of XGEVA. Of course the dentist had to be consulted first, so I had to overcome my terror of drills to have that panoramic xray done, and one broken molar repaired. The dentist was the charmer of the century. So anyway, I see here on this thread that others have written of the headache and the fatigue. And and tonight I feel just ... desperately tired. Anything else you can share ? How has it been going ? Does it seem to work ? Thanks ladies !",

Also people think I am doing really wonderfully, and I don't look like I have cancer. Yes, I am wonderful, I am super happy to still be alive, and enjoying each day. But I have a hard time getting out of bed before 11 am, my hair is falling out for the third time, I can't really walk very far without feeling like throwing myself on a bed, stuff tastes weird, I have horrible pains in my ribs at night, bla bla bla.
