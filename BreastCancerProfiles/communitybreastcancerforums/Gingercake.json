They are hard and unforgiving and as much as I like sleeping on my side, I can no longer lie comfortably that way :( On the plus side, I had my first fill today, only 50 cc, and I'm not feeling any additional discomfort. I was on perjeta for 6 treatments and will be on herceptin for a year as well. My onco stopped the herceptin when I finished chemo with the understanding I'd be starting back up after surgery. I'll be starting back on Jan 13 and will also be starting on Lupron and Aromasin. I know it's a means to an end but I'm not looking forward to it at all.",

The worst of it was below my knees on my calves and ankles but it spread up both legs, my lower abdomen, and my back. This was my 9th treatment of Herceptin and I've never had anything like it. It took about 11-12 days for it to completely go away. I'm just curious if any of you have experienced this? If so, did it happen more than once? ",

For those of you suffering hot flashes, I'd like to recommend the Chillow. Yes, as advertised on TV. No, I'm not a paid spokesperson.  I got it at Bed, Bath & Beyond for $7.99 and it has been money well spent. I leave it on the floor by my bed at night and when I'm woken up by a hot flash, I reach down and pull it across my stomach, cloth side down, and rest my arms on the slick side. I don't really like having it on my pillow because I'm a side sleeper and the cold makes my ear hurt. Plus, I don't have a lot of hair on my head and it makes my head too cold. I've tried it in my pillowcase but because I'm a side sleeper, it makes crinkly noises that make it hard to fall asleep. BUT, it does cool me down when I need it, and I'm able to fall back asleep easily. It's worth a try, hope it helps. ",

I had my husband put some lotion on it. I just so happened to have a dermatologist appt the next day. When she was checking me over, it had popped up on my legs, abdomen, and back. When I asked my husband if he had noticed anything the night before, he said he thought it looked like that because I'd been scratching it. Sigh. My exchange surgery is scheduled for 3/26 so I will likely give the contour pillow a try. Anything for comfortable, uninterrupted sleep! As for opening tops, opening anything makes my hands really hurt. I understand the mild depression/feeling down. Completing chemo and getting through surgery are such big milestones that I sort of thought everything would be smooth sailing after that. I never put any thought into the amount of adjusting that would be taking place afterwards, and well, reality is a bitch! It's difficult because a lot of the support we get during treatment sort of drifts away because we're \"better\" now. And I am, except when I'm not - just like you said. I plan on discussing this with my MO at my next appt. I don't think I need (and don't want) an anti-depressant but I do want him to be aware. Have you had a chance to talk with your dr about this? ",

Except for being fairly bruised up from the fat grafting, all is going well for the most part. The effexor really seems to be doing the job of keeping the hot flashes at bay - I only periodically have to reach for the Chillow. I lost all motivation to exercise for some reason in the past month. The only exercise I got was from walking the dog, which got me moving but not enough to break a sweat. I think I was stuck in a mental \"holding pattern\" until I got through this surgery. Once I get the all clear, I hope to get back into some kind of a routine. Best wishes for smooth recovery for everyone.",

I've been to the eye dr and he wants to put stents in my tear ducts. Have any of you ever had this done? It seems like it's my only shot at getting this corrected but there are no guarantees. Any feedback/experiences/tips are appreciated. I really don't want to spend the rest of my life dabbing at my eyes and explaining to people that I'm not crying!",
