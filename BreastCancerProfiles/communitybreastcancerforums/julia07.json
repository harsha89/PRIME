      "Content": "julia07 wrote: Hi all I'm new here.  My partner had her routine MRI today and they found enlarged lymph nodes on the other side from where she had breast cancer 6 years ago.  Back then she had Stage 2A, node negative, ER positive invasive breast cancer.  She had a mastectomy, didn't require radiation, but chemotherapy.  The chemo didn't go well.  She contracted a serious pneumonia at the time and they stopped her chemo treatment.  (that experience was the hardest of my life.) She's scheduled for an ultrasound and biopsy on Monday with a follow up from her oncologist on Wednesday.  Waiting. waiting wait.  We've been here before and it feels like PTSD.  We had some recent good years and I don't wanna be back here.  I really don't.  The fears, anxiety, trying to focus on work. . . staying strong for my spouse. . . keeping our 7yo calm and happy.  Ugh + sigh + I wanna cry.  I just wanna cry and I can't.  I can't upset my kiddo.  I wanna take care of my sweetie. I wanna make her feel better.   anyway we're waiting and I would love to hear about scares about enlarged lymph nodes that turned out to be nothing.   thanks.  Log in to post a reply",
