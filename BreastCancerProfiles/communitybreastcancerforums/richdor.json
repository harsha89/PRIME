I recently found this blog and what a godsend it is! I wish I had the opportunity to know of it years ago. It is only recently, the last year or so , that I have been considering reconstruction ---all the years I have been wearing a form. I did have two attempts at a recon back then but they failed miserably and had terrible infections both times. I was advised by family members to leave it alone and be grateful for my life, which I am. So, I saw a surgeon recently, I think she is very accomplished and recons are her forte but after seeing and reading some of the postings here, I am deciding against having it now. Your post especially made a great deal of sense to me---why should I mutilate the rest of my body in the hopes of having a mound of flesh that once was? You are a very brave and courageous woman to have had all you had done. I must admit that I also fear the possibility of infection again ---mine was systemic and I was almost a gonner during the last one. Why I would even consider this surgery now really has baffled some of my family and friends. My husband, dear soul, has not once ever turned away from me and been totally supportive. He, actually, is the only one that is on board with me if I should get the recon done. Everyone else thinks I should leave well enough alone. Perhaps they are right. Thank you for giving me a perspective on how and why I would consider doing more harm to myself than (maybe) good. God bless and take care.",
