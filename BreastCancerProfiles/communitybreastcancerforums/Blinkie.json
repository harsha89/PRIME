Think of it - something normal! This is something my therapist has told me - that being fearful or upset is sometimes a normal reaction to an event. My first diagnosis in 2007 was Stage 0. For this second occurrence, it is Stage 1. My mind races and I get anxious and afraid, thinking that next time (see, I think there will be a 'next time') it will be Stage 4. My life and my thoughts - and evidently some of my cell divisions - are chaotic, which I hate. If only we could channel our imaginations into something more positive. Like writing a novel or something. haha. Everyone finds their own way of dealing with things. I am going to my therapist. I might change primary care physician to someone who is at the same clinic as the cancer center. I'm not telling everyone what is going on with me - just a few people. These are actions I can take which give me a feeling of control in an uncontrollable situation. Plus I've decided to get as much in my life as order as I can. As soon as I am not so tired (from treatment) I'm cleaning my house, getting rid of tons of stuff, getting my legacy file (will, etc) completely in order, etc, etc. I'm in my 60s so this is something I should be doing anyway. When that is done I hope to have calmed down and be able to live more fearlessly. & if cancer comes again, at least I will not be thinking, \"Why didn't I prepare for this?!\" Hope for the best, prepare for the worst. This helps me, but it may not be everyone's cup of tea.",

I received radiation to the left breast and the left nodes, which the Radiation Oncologist thought would be enough if there was any tiny bit of invasive cancer in the nodes. I hope he is right!",

When I'm feeling that way I want to be comforted. I want someone to sit with me, in my sorrow, rather than trying to take the sorrow away. I want a listener, a witness. Things you might feel comfortable saying to her: I'm so sorry this has happened. I'm not sure what to say. You're not going to go through this alone; we'll be right here with you no matter what. It's okay to just be there and be quiet, too. When someone is ill, the whole family is affected. So you can help your mom by continuing to take good care of yourself. Take your vitamins, get enough exercise, get enough sleep. Whenever life is stressful, it is good to increase your self-care. Your mom is fortunate to have a caring child like you.",

I think they did a needle biopsy but I don't remember any details about what they learned. (This was before I was diagnosed and I didn't pay attention like I would now.) They did not treat the cancer at all. My mom was fine with this. The doctors felt that any treatment for her would be worse than the cancer. The oncologist told her that she would probably not die of cancer, but of something else, probably heart failure. She is still alive, well into her 90's. The cancer is now considered Stage 4 due to it's size and the rapid growth that happened this year. She says she has no pain. One thing to remember is that surgeons always always always want to do surgery. They make it sound safe and easy. It might be the best option but it might not. Ask many questions. I always ask what the doctor would recommend if it was his or her mother in the situation. You might consider getting a second opinion. My mother was still living in her own house when she was diagnosed; it was probably five years before she moved to assisted living. She is on hospice now, mainly because of the rapid growth of the tumors and because her primary care physician didn't want her to have to come to the clinic so much. Now, any medical needs she has are taken care of by the hospice who come to her apartment. She is mainly very tired and might really die of heart failure, not cancer. I'm so sorry this is happening to your mom. I can really identify with your story, and so can also say, I'm really sorry this is happening to you. Being in charge of my parents has been like becoming a parent. Full of challenges. I'm glad you posted.",

It sounds like your oncologist is doing all the right things for you. I just had a CT scan & then a PET scan. I was in a panic & then in a funk. There were spots on my bones; they turned out to be just spots, not mets. & it seems the spots in my lungs are not worrying the doctors. (They are going to re-check them after some times passes.) I hope all your test results bring good news. If not, your medical team and the people on these boards with experience of mets will be able to help you cope. You are not alone. Sending hugs & looking for those with more experience to answer your questions.",
