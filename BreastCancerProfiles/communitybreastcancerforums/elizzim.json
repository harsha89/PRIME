      "Content": "Jan 16, 2009 12:51PM - edited Jan 16, 2009 12:52PM by elizzim I think my very recent experience should be helpful to you right now:  I just had (Jan. 6th, 2009) bilateral mastectomy with insertion of tissue expanders. First of all, let me state at the outset that NO ONE COULD BE VAINER THAN I!! I always loved my breasts, and while my desire to live a long life with my 2 wonderful daughters outweighs everything, the idea of losing my breasts was devastating to me.  I won't go into the reasons that I opted for a BM here, but I will say that I found out post-op that there had been DCIS in the \"healthy\" breast, which was sobering news and told me I made the right decision.  I bring that up here because - while everyone's experience is different - it might be thought-provoking for you. But the main thing is: while I was so devastated by the idea of losing my breasts - I feel SO HAPPY with the results already, that I know the final result will be absolutely FINE.  I think the key is to use the BEST surgeon and reconstructive surgeon that you can find.  My plastic surgeon did such a beautiful job with my nipple-sparing mastectomies, that I can already see my new breasts taking form, and they are amazing.  Be careful looking at pictures on the internet: there is a wide range in technical expertise among reconstructive surgeons, scars do fade over time, and it can all look scarier than it needs to be.  If you find an excellent surgical team, you can look forward to surprisingly nice results.  All of this is, of course, in the context of doing all you can to save your life!! Feel free to ask me any specific questions - I have no modesty left!  But keep in mind that I, too, am new to this whole world.  There are so many others here who have much more experience with the whole process. -Liz ",

Although this is the first time I've had an opportunity to post, I've thought of little else since. For all of the love we feel for Heidi on this site, for our sense of her sparkle and her grace, we could not have begun to imagine the person she was. I am a different person today than I was before I attended her memorial. Seeing Heidi come to life in the words and stories of those who shared her life, I fell in love. And I understood what \"a life well lived\" truly means. Often after a memorial service - even after the beautiful memorials of people close to me - I have felt that while the service gave comfort to those who attended, it didn't begin to do justice to the life and the unique soul being celebrated. But at Heidi's service, it was quite the opposite. The love that she created in her life and the imprint of her spirit on those close to her were so vivid and alive that it was as though she was there in the room. Through the words and the stories of her husband, father, and her closest friends, I came to know a woman who understood what makes life precious, and whose every act and expression was a reflection of that. She was funny, honest, loving, and totally genuine. She showed the people around her how much she loved them, she shared herself without censorship. She brought her friends together, made the moments they shared insanely fun, made each moment meaningful and created the life that she desired, instead of waiting for life and circumstances to shape her. Hearing her friends describe their life with Heidi, it was clear that without her, each of them would be missing a part of themselves. The pain that they feel without her here was palpable. From listening to Heidi's friends, I have a new understanding of what friendship is, and what I want to give to those closest to me. Even in the gorgeous pictures of her that surrounded us, Heidi simply radiated light. She loved her family - her husband and beautiful children, her brother and parents - selflessly and without inhibition. As I looked up at her beautiful smile and the twinkle in her eye, and as I heard the countless stories of how she elevated the lives of everyone she came into contact with, I wondered how many people in my own life don't truly know how much I love them? Maybe I don't express it, or small grievances get in the way. But I have no doubt that those close to Heidi know and feel how loved they are by her. As one of her friends put it, \"she made each of us feel that we were the most important person in the world to her. Because we were.\" I can't possibly do justice to what I experienced yesterday. Every person who spoke about Heidi was in themselves exceptional, and they were talking about a uniquely exceptional woman. Some of the stories about her were hilarious, and others just made you desperate to know her and be in her presence. I wouldn't try to paraphrase. But I feel blessed to have shared in this small part of her life. I never thought it would be possible to miss someone I never knew, but I miss Heidi. Even though I've only peeked through a small window onto her incredible life, she has taught me more about living and dying than I would have thought imaginable. Now, when I waver or when I'm unsure, I find myself looking toward Heidi and wondering how she'd feel or what she'd do. Suddenly, what is unimportant falls away and what's truly important becomes clear. From having know her even from this distance, I will aspire to be more like her - more loving, more present, more adventurous, more my true self. I'll seize this day to spend time with the people I love, to see them and listen to them with an open heart. And while I wouldn't expect to be in Heidi's league, I'll think of her and try to make my own life and the lives of those around me as rich and as brilliant as possible, today.

But I did finally stabilize and came home Saturday.  I get a little stronger each day. Today, I saw my surgeon, ahd my drains removed and got the path report.  There was a larger tumor in my left breast than had been suspected from biopsy, and my right breast (on which I got a \"prophylactic\" mastectomy), also had DCIS. Very scary, but confirms that I did the right thing in getting the bilateral mastectomy.  I'm so grateful to say that my sentinel nodes on both sides were clean. That's my update - I'm getting used to this new body, but I feel surprisingly OK on that front. I think my true struggle will be just living each day with the fear of metastasis down the line - I saw my mother go through so much, as I know so many of you here are going through.",

It's so hard living with that dark cloud. The only thing that really helps, I think, since we can't have the guarantees that we'd like, is to try as much as possible to live in the present moment. If you can manage that whenever possible, your anxiety decreases, too. Is there anyone that you talk to on a regular basis about how to live with this fear? I think it's important to have someone other than family and friends, someone who is yours and yours alone, and with whom you never have to feel bad about venting.  Anyway, I'm thinking of you. -Liz ",

Being here for my 2 daughters, especially when they have issues w/their Dad, from whom I'm divorced - is all that really matters. For me, it is not a question of whether or not to do chemo.  I know I have a high-grade, aggressive cancer, and I may be BRCA + (still don't know yet).  Also waiting for my Oncotypedx test. I'm pretty certain that chemo will be indicated, and there's no question for me about doing it.  I'm just trying to wrap my mind around this next step in fighting the disease.  I'm still just 2 weeks out from my bilateral mastectomy surgery.

That gives me hope that it won't necessarily be as bad as I've read! Janet - Yes, if I were you I'd opt for chemo. And 45 better be young - I'm 46! I still feel like I'm 28! Well, I am working with the top oncologist at MSK. And he pretty much WOULD NOT LET ME DO THE ONCOTYPE DX TEST!! His reasoning was that I pretty much know I want to do chemo, even if it improves my chance of recurrence only be 3-4%. I just need to know that I've done absolutely everything I can to reduce the risk. And he feels that if I got a high number, it'd tell me nothing I don't already feel; if I got a low or middle-range number, I'd just ignore it because I already know I want chemo. He also - and this is the 1st time I've heard this - expressed reservations about the meaning of the results of this test. I walked away utterly confused - I thought the oncotype test was one of the BEST new tools we've got to fight this disease.  I also would like to know everything there is to know about the characteristics of my cancer, for possible future treatment options, and for my daughters' possible future use. But when I told him that I might just want to have the test done ANYWAY, he told me that he'd talk me out of it!! I basically like this guy, and I know that he has actually been instrumental in much of the research that we're using to structure treatment now...IF I KNOW I WANT CHEMO, DO YOU LADIES THINK THERE'S ANY GOOD REASON TO GET THE ONCOTYPE DX TEST? I'd appreciate any input on this question. I'm starting chemo on Thursday, Feb. 26th. I'm participating in the study where one arm gets 4 X AC, and the other arm gets Taxol, so I don't know which drug I'll be getting. ",

Sharon, I know where Northport is - I'm originally from NY, and I'm somewhat familiar with LI. I'm near exit 10 off of I-84. I have 2 girls, ages 10 and 7. I'm interested to know how you felt after your exchange surgery - did you feel immediate relief from the pressure of the tissue expanders? It's comforting to know that there is, eventually, light at the end of the tunnel. I have a feeling that no matter what stage of treatment you're at, having cancer continues to feel surreal. Sharon, I will definitely update you on my info as things evolve. As far as my surgery goes:  I did have reconstruction w/tissue expanders. They are pretty much constantly uncomfortable (my original fill was 300 cc - lots of pressure, having intermittent trouble getting a deep breath), but overall, I feel surprisingly OK about the mastectomies. My focus is squarely on trying to regain health, as well as trying to gear up for chemo, which I know we all dread. And lastly, my daughters have been truly incredible through all this.  They are amazing souls! I am determined to live to be an old lady in order to be with them. (BTW Sharon, we have a very similar diagnosis. My tumor size was 1.6 cm, everything else is pretty much the same.) I am really touched to have the support of women such as you, who share this experience. Maybe at some point we will meet face to face! Thanks for being there, Liz ",
