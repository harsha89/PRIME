I saw that you were from Atlanta, so I thought I would lend you my support. I now live in Athens but lived in Atlanta and the Emory area for many years. If you read my bio you will se that I have been through BC twice. You really will not know if you need chemo until after surgery. If the nodes are clear, the surgeon will need to order an oncotype Dx test to determine if chemo is beneficial. This is also dependent on the type of cancer\u2026.usually it is done on ER+ IDC. Then depending on whether you choose a lumpectomy, you will need radiation. If you choose a mastectomy and the nodes are clear you will not need radiation. I have done it all. So ask me anything and I can try to give you the pros and cons. There are plenty of skilled surgeons in the metro area and I hope you find a team that you feel comfortable with. In my opinion, the traffic to the treatments would be the worst part. Send me a PM if there is anything I can do to support you through this time. Waiting is truly the worst part. Sending you gentle ((HUGS)) Jenifer",

I am thankful for you, that it was not broken.  Congrats to Canada on the Hockey win. I was not able to see the game, but it was a well deserved win! Now for the gold!! yep, coffee cup is empty so gotta start another Great Day. Hope all have a wonderful weekend! Jenifer",

      "Content": "Jun 26, 2014 03:53AM momof2doxies wrote: welcome ladyb\u2026.I am having some insomnia tonight, so I thought I would say hi and give you my prospective. I finished 4 rounds of C/T at the end of January 2014. My previous careers were teaching high school science and being a medical technologist for the organ transplant division of a large urban hospital. I left both of those careers long before BC, however, there is absolutely no way at my age,60, I could have taught HS science, grade all the labs and assignments. It was overwhelming when I was not ill. So it really depends on your age and type of work. Some people are able to take their chemo on a Thursday, and still work on Friday because you are hyped up on steroids. Then you will have the weekend to crash. My side effects were all over the place and never the same pattern. Eat healthy during chemo, do not try to eat fast food and do not go long periods without eating. I made the mistake of not eating until my DH came home and asked him to bring some outside food\u2026which I consumed too fast and of course lost it later in the evening. I experienced bone pain, and it was alleviated with hydrocodone or motrin. My taste buds were altered, so some things did not taste right. You will lose all your hair\u2026so keep kleenexs handy for a constant runny nose. My internal body thermostat went wacko\u2026hot to freezing cold. And there were some very non sensical disturbing dreams that would cause me just to get up and go to another part of the house to roam the internet. Nausea may come, but stay on top of the anti nausea meds. Be proactive with the nausea\u2026get it before it gets you! As you get further along, your hemoglobin will drop, so you will be tired. Now for the good news. As soon as it is over, your hair starts to grow back. Taste buds return and as the hemoglobin rises, so will your stamina. I still poop out, but I am battling a issue with a torn muscle in my shoulder. I love to sew and I made 5 rooms of drapes, bedspeads, etc. and all the decor for my daughter's wedding. I was very proud of myself. Yesterday I refurbished an 5 piece bedroom set. I continued to keep up the house, and iron my DH shirts and pants. Just be aware of what your body is asking and do not over do things. Many people work to maintain a sense of normalcy. I continued my household routines and DH was never deprived of his cup of coffee brought to him each morning or his lunches for work. Like every \"event\" in life, there are some things I never want to see again and for me it is Smart Water and the 2 restaurant meals that made me nauseated . And if I should have to repeat chemo, fingers crossed that I will not, I will not be afraid, but I also probably will never wear that expensive wig/s I bought  You will make it through; you know where to come if you have questions. I am still not sleepy, but I think I will go cyber shopping. Take care fellow warriors. I will write again, later. Jenifer",

Oh, the fun never ceases. Surgery is Oct 6\u2026.oops, that colonoscopy on the 9th will have to wait\u2026too bad. Guess I had better get busy doing all my projects! If I have my right arm in a sling, I am not going to be doing much sewing or painting.  ARGH! Funny thing\u2026the doc said I had developed some sneaky modifications in being able to move my right arm without excruciating pain. That's me \u2026I am so sneaky. I am also getting OLD. I looked in the mirror this morning and realized that I look like a chia pet with this curly gray hair. It has grown but just continues to curl, so it does not look like I have any length. I wonder if my stylist could do anything about this frizzy mound of gray? Gosh, I really am not that upset\u2026just trying to make fun out of old age\u2026LOL Hope everyone is doing good\u2026think I will go have some ice tea now. Love ya'll",

I will be busy making meals for DH and putting them in the freezer. I have a wonderful husband, but I have spoiled him so much.  But I enjoy every minute of spoiling him.

I am having the BMX with TE put in by the PS. Then go through all the fills and later go back in for the implants. Seems so silly for a 60 yr getting implants, however the BC nurse thinks it is better because women are used to carrying a certain amount of weight in their upper torso. Without that weight our bodies tend to slouch and begin to have a hunch back. I hope you can have some piece of mind now that you have a plan in place. I will keep you in my thoughts. Yesterday I went for my preop with the PS. I signed about 15 pages of \"what ifs and you need to be aware\". then I got prescriptions for a bag of meds. I swear, I have enough narcotics to sell on the streets and pay for my DD wedding!

He is taking things slow, because he wants to make sure that the left side that had rads last year, continues to be cooperative. I go back to the MO on 11/20 to find out the results on my oncotype.

A parent came to the school and had her car radio on with the news report about President Kennedy. A little while later, we were released and sent home. Back then you could walk or ride your bike to school without the fear of being kidnapped. We had a small black and white TV and for the next few days all we did was watch the reports. It is so surreal what happened to the members of the Kennedy family. The answers will never come. Need to go find food for DH. I really have been a lazy wife the past few days. Enough!!

It seems that it is going to be a long road before I get my full range of motion back in my shoulder. If I had a full time job, I would really be in a difficult situation.

Adagio\u2026.now you have 2 daughters who can fix the holiday dishes! I declared no more Turkey Day in our house, so DD is cooking and invited us to join her and her DH. I might bake the pumpkin pie. But I will not be doing the turkey :) Best wishes to all\u2026((HUGS)) Jenifer",

That Monday(day 12) the output had not changed, so him had the nurse take them out because he did not want me to get an infection. The longer an open site is available for bacteria, the greater your chance of infection. If I were in your shoes, I would be furious. I would be back at the hospital ER that did the surgery demanding some attention. Heck, if Clarksville is so small, then drive to Chattanooga or even into Georgia to get treated.

It is so easy to take that beauty for granted when you are around it all the time. But when you have the opportunity to go out and take such majestic pictures, I am certain that you realize the heavenly beauty in which you live. Was feeling down today. DH was an usher for a symphony concert and I was home alone. Not a good time to be alone. DD called and that helped some. I am really dreading Tuesday night; I just get anxious before this type of surgery. Tuesdays are the day that DH teaches a late class at UGA and does not get home till 8 pm. Guess I will clean the house and do more laundry. Benny, I am hopeful that these calcifications turn out to be not as bad as the radiologist reported to you. When my radiologist said BIRADS 5 , I knew I was back to square one. That is why I want this surgery to be over with. I do not think I could ever go through another mammo without serious drugs. So I will be wearing BIG POCKETS Wednesday. Crossing fingers for negative nodes and good pain meds :) Jenifer",

These drugs are serious business; in their task of killing the cancer cells, they do harm our good cells. So get it checked out so we can have a worry free summer this year. I am coming to Oregon and now that I have that passport, Canada is a real possibility. I will be thinking of you tomorrow. We are going to get through this..DAWG GONE IT...play on word there from Athens. Oh Movie....I read in the paper that there might really be a BCS Bowl between Oregon and Alabama. I am going to decorate my yard in GREEN and YELLOW. That will definitely turn heads in the neighborhood...but really, how can UGA respect ALA..they have had easy teams to play.

Maria...I am so very concerned to hear of your awful rad experience. I was blessed to have a lady in our neighborhood who formulated skin care products for her mother when the doctors told her there was nothing they could offer. Well, she went on a mission and is also a 11 year survivor. I used her products religiously through rads last year and had minimal SE. But I did cheat the system and had the Canadian version of 16 high dose treatments. My PS was amazed at how my skin held up. So I can PM you the information if you are at all interested. She has traveled around the world refining her products and they are used at the Walter Redd Medical Center, Movie...glad you made it home safely . I know that thing of the DD driving. I need a break on my side when driving with her, and an extra dose of ativan, LOL. Again GO DUCKS!!! Rest up. Got more picture of the Keiko Cottage. The weather must be holding up on the Coast because the outside shingles are going up. Neighbors are dropping by daily to inquire...Oh Jenifer and Erik are moving back. So nice to have a West Coast group of friends that remember you after 8 years. Nihahi...I have agates all over this house, along with sea shells. Most of them were found in the Yachats area ; Agate Beach actually has been depleted of the good ones. But I love to hunt for little treasures. I do not polish them, because it just takes too long. I wear a size 8 US women's shoe, in case you have an extra pair of snow shoes for next winter. DD unfortunately wears a size 16D...you know cockroach stopping size. Ridley...you are also in my thoughts. I do hope the treatments and DH work situation will resolve in a positive manner. Edi...keep us posted on your delicious meals and adventures with the newly retired DH. I hope to meet you soon. I love Movie's idea of getting together this summer. As we say in the in the South...we would be a \"hoot\" of a group of ladies. Benny..you are MIA again. That gets the mother hen in me concerned. Give us a short update, PLEASE. Dakota...the super mom. You are an inspiration for all, you need to write a boo. It would be so inspiring for other sisters. Morwenna....ah the glory of a geiko BM...what a relief. I am still rubbing my agate for you. I really believe in my heart you are okay. Stress is so twisted and your present twitches, I do hope they can be alleviated with the doctor recommendation or even acupuncture (never tried it, but I would if given the opportunity). I am going out to get some Claritin and get started on it for this upcoming Neulasta shot. Thanks for the advise. If I left anyone out, just know that when I read your posts, I truly enjoy the stories and send you positive wishes for relief of any distress. Now lets go have a good day. Love to all, Jenifer",

Since yesterday's Thanksgiving was non existent, DH and I went to a little Italian place for lunch...Small portions, and they were tasty. However, that was about the end of my travels today. Do not know what the normal down time is. It has been so long since I was really sick, I have nothing to compare this to. But I am going to just do what I feel like doing, and the rest can wait.

I have an okay day followed by a day/night from ^&*)....I go for followup tomorrow...I have a lot of questions. Hope I have them all written down, and also hope tomorrow is not a bad day because DH cannot go to appt with me. Gosh, the thought of \"me\" actually doing something on my own...(Southern sarcasm) So here is my question, which I am desperately trying to wait till tomorrow, but it \"hurts\". On Sunday, I noticed a knot and redness at the site of my IV. I normally wear my watch and found it suddenly uncomfortable. Then yesterday I had a slight skin tear on that same knot. I put triple antibiotic ointment on it and a bandage. Today there is no change; it is still red and you can tell that it is following the vein where I received chemo last Monday. This is not a bruise and is getting me a little concerned with my immunocompromised state. Anyone have something similar? Next question...this Neulasta is a killer...the bone pain exceeds my memory of childbirth. Again, Sunday night from ^&*(...I laid on moist heat trying to get some relief. I finally gave up around 4 am and took 2 Hydrocodone/Acetaminephin 5/500. That shut down to pain. I just do not want to take something that can mess up all these drugs(poison) in my body. Neulasta is suppose to be a 10 day time release....certainly hope it is finished with me by Friday, because I am counting the days!! My chemo induced cyber shopping is being delivered daily. DH is not one to question anything I do, but I think he looked at the CC statement online....because he said for me not to worry about the Discover card. What, me worried, about a credit card? HA HA HA I am more concerned about the 5 bolts of fleece I bought to make doggie blankets for the pups at the shelter. Hey, on the more serious side....my GI tract FINALLY got the message from Senekot-S. That was really cramping my day, too. Movie...hope you are doing well...Oh what a difference a year makes Liefie...About time for some pictures..hope you had a fabulous time. Nihahi... Thank you for your incredible wisdom. Dakota....you continue to amaze me with your busy schedule and devotion to your kids . Benny..(((HUGS))) And to all that I might have missed, have a wonderful evening. Stay warm and safe at home.

I lost 40 lbs last year and was able to come off my BP meds. But then after >6months on arimidex, the BP started going up so I had to go on another type of BP med. I do not eat red meat, only fish (wild) and organic chicken. All that and I still got another tumor. I will go back to my low sodium diet soon. But it will be more for heart reasons than BC. I believe the BC is just what I was dealt\u2026working in research with carcinogenic agents during the 70's and 80's (thanks Emory University Hospital :( ) But when you limit your sodium to 1200 mg, you will quickly learn that broccoli and sweet potatoes are about the only thing you can order in a restaurant. Another question\u2026does chemo cause your internal thermostat to go wacko? I am like a popsicle and it is not even cold outside. It is an ordeal to change clothes because it takes so long to get warmed up. I just do not know how my Canadian sisters can survive with the arctic extremes we are having. When you meet up on Monday, have a very warm cup of \"something\" for me. Liefie\u2026you might like this. I have tons of fabric upstairs but I still cannot get my self up there to sew\u2026mainly due to popsicle issues. So I found some 15\" round lavender placemats at Bed Bath and Beyond on clearance. I ordered 110! I am thinking about using them on the white tablecloths/napkins to give the look of plate chargers. Then all I have to do is put the floral arrangement in the center with random votives. The venue has a rustic feel with high open beams. So that is my current \"experiment\"..we shall see. Otherwise I had better get myself going 98 more days. Movie\u2026the Newport News Times says there is snow in Yachats! Stay warm and safe\u2026I know Oregon does not believe in using salt on the roads\u2026.just that sand and gravel that chips the windshield. DH is home, so I shall go..have a great weekend to all!

My DD who is the PT helped interpret my shoulder MRI. I have a tear in one of the 4 tendons that support the rotator cuff. So perhaps PT will work or maybe another surgery. I will see that doc on 9/4. Meanwhile, I was given a prescription for tramadol for pain. LOL\u2026that does nothing for the pain but makes me sick to my stomach like chemo did. So the next 2 weeks revolve around doctor appoints, surgery, and court testimony. I will be ready to go back to Oregon by the end of September.

Went to the ortho doc and he said I need 2 more weeks in this sling and months more of PT. Dakota\u2026I hear you about SE. I am on the other AI, arimidex and the side effects are just ridiculous. I am on an additional 5 drugs just for side effects of that one drug. Looks like I will be headed toward statins unless I change to a vegan diet. The arctic cold has reached us. I had to put the flannel sheets on the bed. I was going to have the bedrooms carpets replaced, but after the estimate, I decided to try having them cleaned. Therefore, each evening DH has to help me clean out the closets and remove clutter for them to do the cleaning. For some reason I find it hard to donate some things, but I just close my eyes and DH loads the items in the car for the thrift store. It really feels better to make an effort to reduce \"stuff\". Now if I can keep the closets and drawers clear I will be much happier. DD invited us to Charleston for Thanksgiving. So we will be going to South Carolina next week. It will be nice to see her, DSIL, and his parents. I enjoy the holiday as long as someone else is cooking that turkey. Edi I thought of you last night as I was trying to clear the stuff I had collected for DD's wedding. I must have 8 pedestal cake stands that would be perfect for one of your cakes. Wish you were closer, I would ship them to you. Liefie, little Emily will be having her first Christmas. I know there is no way she is going to be spoiled.Please consider sending us some pictures of her beautiful face. Adagio, Hope all is good with your family\u2026and would still love to see the wedding pictures. Websister\u2026\".bless your heart\" I wish you relief with your ankle. I am at a loss as to what to suggest. But I do know that I would not be a nice and polite patient, if I were dealing with what you have endured. Mowenna, Nihahi hope you are doing well and staying warm. Gosh, those warm summer months were short! So I am going back to my clearing of the closets. Let us all have a good week. ((HUGS)) Jenifer ",

I remember how the chemo would cause me to have terrible dreams and my taste buds were not allowing me to enjoy my coffee. So I would get up at 4:30 - 5 am and roam the boards. At that time Edi was the only person up so she would be my first contact each morning. This year, I should want to celebrate many things\u2026but I have no desire for a Christmas tree. My husband are just going to rest and count our blessings. This week Nihahi urged me to come on over to the FB side. It has been enjoyable to fit real names with screen names. Everyone seems to have gotten along for the most part from being \"In Shock\". I am still a year behind everyone, but at least I am not in active treatment this year for Christmas, If you are on FB you may already be linked to some of the gang. If not, PM me or Nihahi, and we will hook you up. I am still new to FB, that is why I included Nihahi\u2026our lead Warrior! So come join the gang for fun. Then we can come back here to complain about the side effects of hormonal therapy and give each other the support we still need. Jenifer",

My DH got me an iPod for Christmas last year so I could listen to something in my ears instead of my head, as I walk. Well Movie, guess you will be coming for a visit in Yachats this Summer :) I taught science at Newport HS for a couple of years and then moved back to GA. But my DD graduated from NHS!! So for some reason I could not stop eating one of those BIG Hershey bars today!!! I ate the whole thing!! I try to watch my sodium, good thing there was only 90 mg in the whole bar. So I went to our organic store this afternnon and bought wheatgrass. Even though, I was a science teacher at one time, I do not have a green thumb. I would never be able to maintain a consistent crop of wheatgrass. So I was able to get an dose down with organic fruit juice...that is my dinner. Since i was so bad with chocolate. Anyone ever take this stuff?  Well, the other good item was Maine lobster tails on sale...so I bought 8. They are in the freezer. It is just me and DH so I hope he likes lobster..LOL So hope everyone is having a good week. I am trying to stay positive until the biopsy results come back. Until then DRINK MORE WHEATGRASS.

Ten years of a truly beautiful woman was lost to a cockroach that did his best to destroy her and their beautiful daughter. But my email to her about my BC got through! Now we are back, but it is going to be very difficult for her to regain her self esteem and limit the damage that has been inflicted on her DD. But we made a promise to each other...she will be with me for my surgery and my DH and I are going to help her with the exterminator. That cockroach is gonna really feel the impact of a size 16D..

Definitely something I never imagined in my wildest dreams. Sometimes people will comment on my weight lose and I just say thank you, BC has that effect. Then they look at me like...did she really say that? So what color is your MOG dress? DH is home and the dogs want dinner, and I want some tea. So have a wonderful evening ladies. Oh, what a difference a day makes, I feel so much better. Love to all, Jenifer",

Tried to call the help line, but the polite recording said they would try to get back with me within 48 hours. I politely told them where they could pick up their tree. So now I will get out my little purple tree from last year. I will hang the doggie stockings on the mantel, because last year, Miss Heidi was so depressed that there was no stocking for her...and I felt like the worst dog Mom. Things happen for a reason. That is how I try to look at things. Of course they look much better with anti anxiety pills, and anti depressants. I just feel that this week is going to be the beginning of another long journey that many of you have been through. So now it is off to Kohls to return this crappy tree. Ps. Liefie, have your husband stay away from avocados, and fried foods...those were my culprit. However, I am glad the source of pain has been discovered. Have a good day all..Love, Jenifer",

Funny how TV programs give areas a stereotype. I have never watched Duck Dynasty, or Here Comes Honey Boo Boo (that one is actually filmed in GA). No, my idea of the South is a more educated gentile version. My favorite movie was filmed in my hometown, \"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\"....I can recite almost every line. And Paula Deen does not define Southern dialect or cuisine. Benny... the episode of Carol Burnett, where she comes down the stairs in the velvet green drapes avec the drapery rod is from the Southern classic \"Gone With the Wind.\" That is still my favorite comedy piece of hers. Well, tomorrow I go for more saline fills. So far, so good. If that was all I had to look forward to this week, life would be easy street. But I am going to be okay. I will follow all the rules and I will take plenty of liquids, probiotics, and nourishing food. My BP will behave and my veins will too! Liefie...have an absolute fabulous time in SA. I am overjoyed that things worked out for your DS and future DDIL. Remember, I want to see your dress. So good night to all from the East Coast. Love to all, Jenifer",

So I grabbed 4 agates and this is how I decided to name them...I chose to dedicate them to my fellow TN warriors...Edi, Morwenna, and Adagio...Then there was a pure white agate that I dedicated to Carla. I told one of the nurses my story and I thought she was going to cry. You know she must see all kinds of things in chemo lab, but she was really taken with these agates...Just wait till the next treatment...There will be a load to carry. I held each one and rubbed them, I sent positive vibes to you Morwenna. This is about as religious as I get, so I just want you to know I thought of each one of you. So that is my \"Rock Cancer\" story. Hope all are having a good day....gotta go drink more water. Love, Jenifer",

I went through menopause around 56 and there are changes in our body due to lack of estrogen. I am on Arimidex and have no side effects such as bone pain. I did however, have to go back on a different BP med because AI does effect BP and cholesterol. However, I was still able to lose 40 lbs. Each person as to find the right combination. I used CalorieCount.com and logged everything I ate and all my activities (mainly walking the dog). Since doing chemo, I have let myself indulge in some foods, because I deserved a break. I can still fit into my clothes, but I have 8 lbs to work off. Perhaps there is a dietician through your MO that you can consult. But for me, I used Calorie Count and restricted my sodium, switched to organic everything, whole wheat,\u2026LOL and still got a second primary tumor\u2026 That was not supposed to happen, but BC just loves my body! So do not give up hope. It can be done, and everyone does not have the horror stories with Arimidex. I restart the Arimidex next week along with my last surgery. So I will be back to my regimen with the low sodium. I helped my FIL lose 50 lbs of fluid by educating his caregivers on sodium and cooking his meals. It did not help his dementia, but his life was definitely extended a few years. I hope you can use some of our ideas\u2026.you will find what works for you\u2026do not give up. XOXO",

I am planning the take a chalk paint class and learn techniques on how to paint all these \"needy\" pieces of used furniture. I have another sewing project for bedroom #3.

And I hope you can find another doctor...meet me in Oregon, I will see that you get taken care of How is the oven? What delicious recipe have you tried? So my 9 ft Christmas tree arrived at my door.... I just love to shop online! When I was in WalMart yesterday there was a sign that said 40 days till Christmas. So I had better get DH to get that tree up this weekend. It may take another 39 days for me to decorate. the 2 wiener dogs are in my lap..coffee cup is empty. No doctor appts until Monday. Gee I think I will have some Jenifer time today! Have a wonderful day ladies. Love to all, Jeinfer",

The anesthesiologist gave me some dilaudin to get rid of a headache and the result was a extremely painful esophageal spasm...the technical term is the sphincter of Odi that leads from the esophagus into the stomach. They gave me some pepcid and then more versed to shut me up. But my BP dropped, I lost my color, and my legs were uncontrollable shaking. This has happen randomly since my gallbladder surgery, usually after eating something, See if the symptoms are similar...the pain is right in the center of the chest.

He told my husband that he has been in practice long enough to see the SE from the more aggressive treatment. I did ask him about 6 cycles, but he did not seem to think there was an advantage. And to make things more interesting, I have to go off of Arimidex while I am on chemo. Then go back on it to keep the other cancer at bay. I have a background in immunology and organ transplantation, while working at Emory. As far as going back there for a second opinion, I am going to leave that to my MO.

I did not want a port, because these TE are taking up a lot of surface area on my chest. And all the publicity of a news anchor, Robin Roberts on Good Morning America, who had TNBC and then developed MDS 6 years later scared me. I have heart disease in my family history, but I do not smoke or drink, so maybe I would be okay. It just seems that the same drugs are used for all the types of BC, until you develop mets. My head feels like a stuffed toy animal. It is rainy outside, but I am going to try to drive to Atlanta to see my friend with the bipolar cockroach. There are always others with bigger problems than me. On the lighter side, plane fares from Atlanta to Eugene, OR are $328 RT.

Edi\u2026congrats to DH for reducing his waist line. Wish that I had the desire to plant some flowering plants in my yard. But I am just a inside person. I do not like yard work. So yesterday a dear friend surprised me at 9 am with a visit. She came to help me do the 11 floral centerpieces for DD wedding. We had a good time together and used up all the flowers I had collected over the last year. Then the downer came when I sent a picture to DD of all our work\u2026her comment was they are ok. Then she seemed to be not so impressed with my cake plates for the cup cakes, and did not like the silver picture frames I bought for table numbers. ARGH!!! DD is my pride and joy\u2026but she seems to be indifferent or dislike everything I create or buy for her. So I told her to find the plates she likes for her cake table and get whatever she wants to number the tables with\u2026.More ranting ahead\u2026.She picked out a lavender tie with white dots and asked her Dad to wear a tie that matches the groom's dad. But after all her indifference to my hard work, DH told her he was going to wear the lavender tie I chose for him and did not want his tie to match anyone else's. Thank heavens I only have one daughter to get married. I have one last thing to do (I think) and that is to make the aisle runner\u2026which she first said she did not want, but now she is worried about her shoes digging into the grass. So I will to that, I hope it is the last thing I have to do. Ahh, what a rant! I have been busy with the drapes for Keiko Cottage. I have been fairly productive. I have one more room (master bedroom) to do. That is going to be my focus for the weekend, and the wedding is going on the back burner. Hope all is good with everyone.

The bad thing is I have to get up at 3 am to drink the prep and get to the hospital at 6:30 AM\u2026but that is not until October. So I have time to change my mind\u2026LOL, not. My friend's divorce goes to court next week and the attorney decided to have 2 experts testify, so I am off the hook for that. Now I just have the ortho doc to see about this shoulder. Maybe I will get to my 61th birthday without another diagnosis this year! Websister\u2026You have been in my thoughts all weekend and week. I hope no news is good news. It sure is crowded in your pockets! Andrea\u2026so relieved that all is good with the X-rays. However, I do not know how you have managed to entertain a kidney stone this long. I hear they are very painful. Adagio\u2026number 2 is getting closer. I think if I had another wedding at this point, I could get through it without a lot of the excess worry I imposed on myself with the first. It is a learning curve\u2026seriously, we should write a book for mother of the brides on what not to do  Edi\u2026 hope all is going well for you. I am getting ready to redo the guest bath\u2026time to try to use some of this left over purple. I will sent photos when I finish. I told DH I was going to try to stay away from the thrift stores (for me that will be a 12 step program). All it takes is for me to find one \"treasure\" and I am hooked, again. Life was more relaxing in Oregon because the cottage is smaller and there is not a lot of clutter. Movie\u2026it is getting time for the Ducks again! I listened to a hilarious broadcast of PBS \"Prairie Home Companion\"  that was recorded in Eugene. DH was born in Eugene and I think some of the traits of Oregonians are truly in his personality. Hope you are doing we'll and the DD is doing well in the film industry. We got a picture from our contractor who is continuing the work on Keiko. The guest bath has been gutted. So now I have to select tile, vanity, sink, etc. I really have no clue about those things. Hoever, anything that flushes and runs clear water will be an improvement over what was in there. So hear is the challenge for all \"In Shock\"\u2026.mark your calendars for around the middle of May 2015 through the first week of August 2015. That is when we will be back in Oregon. I truly hope someone will come see me\u2026I really want to share the cool breeze and scenery with all y'all (excuse my Southern slang). Liefie\u2026hope your time on the Sunshine Coast was relaxing. As a Canadian, I suppose you need to soak up the sun's energy in an effort to make it through the cold but beautiful winter. I am so pleased that we have managed to keep this thread going. I enjoy reading each post. It is good \"food for the soul\" because we have such wise and inspiring members. Love to all\u2026have a great week, Jenifer",

She essentially threw the kitchen sink at me my doubling my beta blocker, adding a diuretic, and tripling my anxiety meds. I did not think I was particularly anxious, but she said that arimidex is the culprit in this sudden unexplained episode. She wanted me to be able to pass my pre op for the shoulder surgery. So my BP finally came down, but the PA did not even take my BP during my pre op. So I am good to go Monday at 6 am. So as it turned out, I still spent my birthday and the following 2 days at some doctor's office. Oh well, I am here and feeling better\u2026so I am thankful. What good are birthdays, anyway? My DD plans to come \"take care\" of her mommy next weekend. That will be nice. I get to see the 2 grand pups too! Fortunately I have cleaned her bedroom up from all the wedding things!

The PS will use the same incision site to remove the TE and replace with gel implants. However, the numbness is a very \"creepy\" feeling that I will probably have forever. It feels uncomfortable to sleep (which might improve with the removal of the TE), and very strange to have someone try to hug you\u2026.no hugs for me. That being said, I still would not change my decision about a BMX because this was my second BC within a year. However, please ask your surgeon about the regeneration of nerves.
