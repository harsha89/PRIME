      "Content": "soami123 wrote: I'm 67 years old and just diagnosed with a second cancer in my right breast. Thirteen years ago I was diagnosed with stage 3 invasive lobular carcinoma in my left breast. I had a mastectomy, chemo, radiation and 5 years of exemestane. My oncologist sent me for genetic counseling and because I have no family history of breast cancer and few cases of any kind of cancer in my family the counselor let me decide about genetic testing. I've had treatment for hydrocephalus and a brain tumor (benign) removed in the last year. I've become anxious and totally phobic about any kind of medical procedure because of these life experiences. So I decided to forgo any genetic testing. Now my daughter is upset and frightened that we may have a genetic form of breast cancer. She is pressuring me to have genetic testing. I've shared with her all of the above but she's not convinced that my breast cancer is probably not genetic. The thought of one more needle stick for a blood draw makes me shaky. What should I do Log in to post a reply",
