My mom lives in Wisconsin while I live in Florida, but I will be calling every day, to see how everything is going. And I'm gonna try to visit up there, next week, to be there for when my mom has her surgery.",

I guess the shock right now, is making me a little more worried, and never having to worry about anything like this before, than I probley should be, as it is at the early stage cancer.",

And I'm starting to think that genetic counesling might be good with breast cancer, as it seems to be quite hereditary. Its just, I can not believe it, at all. I've cried like at least 10 times today. The waves of wanting to cry come and go.",

From what I've heard is all she needs is surgery on her breast but no chemo, or radiation. I haven't been told what type of cancer it is, other than, I think my dad said its non invasive. But I'm still worried, about this, I don't know what to think. I'm worried about lossing my mother, before I'm 25 or earlier. My Mom's mother died at the age of 62 from breast cancer, that spread to her bones, now I'm afraid of lossing my mom now. I still remember how my grandma looked and I even remembered her voice, the day before she died, as I was with my mom, as we were visiting her with jello, as she wanted it. I miss her. I was 7 when my grandma died. Log in to post a reply",
