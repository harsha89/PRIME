I feel good physically, legs ache a little not enough to stop me from doing what I need to do though, just more conscious of it. Mentally has been a bit tougher, it's been kind of hard feeling better but looking shittier. My eyebrows are all messed up and lashes well they are hanging on but I haven't used mascara in months in hopes of saving them. I also did use the cold caps so I have my hair, although it is stringy, grey and greasy. I wish I could say all was well. Just try to take it a day at a time, this to shall pass....at least that is what I keep telling myself. Hang in there. Water, water and water......I also take a bunch of vitamins. Lisa",
