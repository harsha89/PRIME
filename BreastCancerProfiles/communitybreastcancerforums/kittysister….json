I feel worse for the younger ones who are fighting this disease than I do for myself, even though I've griped a lot and am still trying to come to terms with it. Anyway, I feel like I've led a full life so far, so consider myself lucky. I do still feel kind of like I'm living on the edge sometimes and could fall off at any time. Thank goodness for Medicare, because I had no idea going into this how expensive everything would be. I also got a supplement when I hit 65 and that has taken up the slack of what Medicare did not pay. I am sure glad I did. I guess every cloud does have a silver lining.",

At the time, I had very good insurance that paid for Enbrel, which you all probably know is really expensive. I don't take it anymore. It gave me a racing heart and the nurse said to stop immediately. Now I wonder if there could be a connection to lowering the immune system and BC. Anyway, since the BC diagnose, I have noticed the psoriasis is getting a little worse. For me, it has always gotten worse with stress.",

What I never did understand is how \"health nuts\" (sorry if that offends anybody- not my intention) get BC in spite of their good diets and exercise. Yet, so many who eat junk food and never exercise don't get it. Sorry, I haven't read this whole thread, but wanted to reply. No rhyme or reason to anything related to this horrible disease. I suspected stress and estrogen use in my case. But who knows and I can't afford to blame myself.",
