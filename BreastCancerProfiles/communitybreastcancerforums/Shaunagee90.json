I have tried several methods to clear it up but nothing is working. I am heading to see my doctor today but of course have been on Dr. google. All the info I can find on persistent breast rashes is linked to IBC. Wondering if anyone has any insight on this or has any words of advice. I hate being so anxious Thank you all x Log in to post a reply",
