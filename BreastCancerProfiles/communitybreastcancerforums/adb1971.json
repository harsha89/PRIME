The center where I will be getting treatment is not very appealing.  I really feel comfortable with my oncologist (specializes in premen. bc) but the facility is like grand central station...so crowded and a bit dreary.  Hoping the people I get to know there will add some charm. It will be so much easier with some hand-holding from others going through this! We can get through this ladies! ",

Anyone else go this long? I never thought I would be depressed about NOT starting chemo.  So I am praying I won't have another delay and will start on the 18th.  Anyone else starting then? However, thanks to you wonderful ladies that I will know what to expect.  Sending positive thoughts to all of you!",
