Noooo catheters for any of the procedures:))  I guess every doctor will be different, but mine did not use any at any point.  When I woke up from my first surgery, the first thing I did (after looking at my chest) was rip up the sheet and look for a catheter!  The concern does seem stupid, but I just wanted to let you know I had the same stupid concern :) Oh yea, and the whole process is nothing like what I imagined it would be (way worse), I don't want to sugarcoat it, HOWEVER, imagine the alternative. DO IT! You will not regret saving your own life...",
