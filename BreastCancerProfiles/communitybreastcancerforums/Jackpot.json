Will it be as effective? Tried to google this but not much information out there, I'm going to start swimming soon as ive been told its good for lymphedema has any ladies tried this and found it effective? Also same question for exercise A low carb diet is recommended for lymphedema any success stories out there for this Also considering LVA surgery i know this is not a common surgery but have any ladies had this done or enquired about it and have any information on it Lastly any other tips for arm/hand lymphedema would be very much appreciated Thanks in advance for any inform  Regards Gill",
