So again, a huge hassle for me..My lump had the same features as yours and every doc/surgeon I talked to agreed that it seems benign. I hope you can get an appt soon. waiting is awful. its hard to even plan past that biopsy date. I know for me, I was assuming the worst and couldn't have any fun/buy any new things/do anything important until I have these results.. Hoping for benign results for both of us",

I think its just a less frequent place. I have heard of right under the skin by lots of people but the nipple location was less common. But like I said, I've heard of it before.  I had a core biopsy. They could not do a FNA because it is solid. The biopsy honestly wasn't very bad at all. I felt some tugging and there was one little part that was painful but it was fine. It was most painful after the freezing started wearing off an hour or so after the procedure. But even then, I jsut took two regular strength tylenol and I was good again. You have to keep icing the are though.  Mine is firm but not like a rock or anything. It feels smooth. I never really quite understood what rubbery meant to be honest lol. But my docs and surgeons all said it feels like a normal fibroadenoma.  And yes, the radiologist told me that because it is right under the skin, they wont be sticking in the needle as much and it will be less painful. However, the nipple area is sensitive and that are is supposedly more painful than others. So she had to do the incision actually a bit lower than my actual lump so she wouldn't hit the nipple area so much.",

My symptoms were not like yours but my lump was deemed 99% benign (only not 100% because I did not have surgery to take it out and doctors cannot agree for liability issues). I have ultrasounds every 6 months to monitor change or growth and it has stayed the same.I don't know much about breast cancer whatsoever and I am sure everyone on here is probably more knowledgeable than me, but I hope I can help a bit. Like Chrissy said as well, it is really, really unlikely for it to be cancer. Cancer under 18 is basically unheard of. Yes, not impossible, as in there have been cases, but these are news stories. It is not a common thing. Also, peau d'orange is a symptom of IBC I believe, which is even rarer, which decreases the chances of it being cancer for you because of your age even more. But because you have history, you should get it checked out for sure. Also, I'd say even if your doctor shrugs you off, ask to be sent for an ultrasound or another means of testing regardless, because lots of people get shrugged off because of their age unfortunately and it either ends up causing them unnecessary anxiety of not knowing exactly what it is or can lead to diagnosing cancer too late.. Secondly, googling is not a good and I've learned this the hard way. I'm an awful hypochondriac and most of this is fueled by googling. Googling can give you some ideas if what is may potentially be, yes. But I have been sure many times that I have cancer until I go to the doctor and it is an extremely benign condition. However, you should always go to the doctor when you have any concern, so its good that you're doing so. I'm not exactly sure what peau d'orange looks like and from what I know, it may look somehwhat similar to the picture you posted, but none of us are doctors. My guess would be that they are simply hair follicles that seem to be more visible or maybe a form of cellulite. I know some people who have that, just on other parts of their bodies. Do you have it anywhere else? Did it pop up randomly? I'd assume if it popped up randomly, that's when it would be more concerning.  I have also gotten a burning feeling in both of my breasts before, and it was not constant. It was maybe for a few minutes and then it stopped. No idea what caused it..but it was in both of them. Also, you are right it can be normal for one breast to be larger than the other. I think its more concerning when its significant or suddenly. Has it always been slightly larger? No ones breasts are symmetrical but if the difference is significant or randomly happened, then I assume that is more concerning as well.  I hope I helped at least a bit. All the other wonderful ladies on here will be able to give you much better advice and knowledge than me. But just letting you know, I've had your worries before and I know how you feel and my issue was benign. Marie",
