One more to go then done -then mastectomy. I have daily neupogen injections from day 5 for 5 days. I am having horrible groin pain and I am just exhausted - sleeping a lot. Any hints and tips to help or is it just the cumulative chemo ? Drinking lots of water and trying very hard to eat more protein. This is Day 7 since chemo day. Thank you Log in to post a reply",

It is Day 10 now and I am in the daylight ! I know that exercise helps so have been doing light yoga and qigong when I can and a lot of meditation which helps. Now I just want to be quiet and no noise. I get lower back pain after the injections and I am using a heat pad on the area which helps. I know - only one more session to go then I have told my friends that I want balloons and streamers !! Next is surgery - I will have a mastectomy (left) and 2 lymph nodes removed but will deal with all that when it comes. This certainly teaches you to take each day as it comes and even each hour sometimes. I've not been at work since I finished the first batch of weekly chemo as I had problems with weight loss and lack of energy. I've now been given 'booster juice' as I call it that is helping build me up more plus eating a lot of protein. Thank you for the bone broth suggestion I will google that one. My Doctor described the chemo as running a marathon and now at the end you need all your strength to get over the finish line. Head down keep going.üëπü•äü•äüéÄüçÄüçÄüéàüéâ ",
