I started Taxotere 11/24 but does the muscle soreness linger on a week after? The dose of Zofran I took was 2 days ago. I'm not taking anything else. I'm also under a lot of stress and aggravation at home so it may be that too. Family members who are more needy than I am! I'm trying to drink lots of fluids but maybe not enough? Thank you for your help.",

I had long thick straight black hair though I would have bald patches at the top or back of my head and by high school I was wearing my hair up all the time to hide it. I successfully gave it up a couple of times through my adulthood. The size changed depending on the stage of my life and every year I would resolve to be strong enough to overcome the obsessive habit. I cut and trim my own hair because I couldn't go to the salon, too embarrassing. A couple of years ago I started to have better resolve and the patch was filling in, down to about an inch across. My hair had also been thinning from stress, poor diet and possibly premenopausal so the growth is much slower . But this past summer, I did it! No more bald patch! I kept my hair really long and started to enjoy letting it down, dreaming of a day soon when I can splurge on a luxurious salon visit and have it nicely cut and dyed to hide the gray. And now I may loose it all again. Maybe the feeling of loss won't be as bad or maybe worse because I've been waiting for this full head of hair for a very long time. What's another year of waiting, probably thicker and without gray!",
