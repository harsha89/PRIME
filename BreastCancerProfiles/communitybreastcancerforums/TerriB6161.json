I had a double mastectomy April 2008 with expanders.  Chemo from June to November, THEN I had my swap surgery for my permanent implants BEFORE rads.  Had that surgery December 3rd and i'm a little over half way through my rads (18/33).  My PS said that he needed to get the surgery done before rads because my skin wouldn't heal otherwise.  He still says there is a chance of failure, but this way has the best chance.  I guess we will find out! ",
