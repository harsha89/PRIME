I am having a stereotopic biopsy (with a core needle?) next week if that makes a difference. This was part of the information given to me over the phone- but I was a bit distracted and overwhelmed with everything that I cannot now remember. They will ofcourse go over this stuff with me the day of- but I am just trying to make some tentative plans. Thanks for any information that you provide! Log in to post a reply",
