I thought I needlessly had a lot of nodes removed but you almost tripled me.  I haven't had any lymph edema issues yet, hopefully I don't, but I'm only two months out. I started lifting weights again and I think it's helping. Contrary to what some PTs have told me, I've read several studies that say weight lifting is good at helping prevent LE if you slowly increase the weight.  I started a month ago with 2.5 lbs for biceps and shoulders and am now up to 15.  My MO and RO agree with the positive weight lifting studies.  BS told me I couldn't lift a gallon of milk anymore with that arm. Phooey!  ",

I had a lump for 28 years, was always told it was a fibrous cyst.  Finally had a routine mammo, a little late, I know, at age 47, but that's how I found mine.  Funny thing is, the only reason I went to doctor was I developed heartburn, which I had never had before, didn't know what it was, (possible heart attack), so thought I needed a 47,000 mile checkup. Ever since MX, I've not had heartburn again.  I had it for two straight months before DX.  Divine intervention, I believe.  Had I not had the heartburn, it may have been years before I ever went to doctor.  I was 41 at last check where doc said my lump was just a cyst, just as other three did since I found it at 18 yrs old.  Cancer must have grown under or into the lump I had.  I'm the only one in my family to ever have it.  We do have a family friend that is going to be 99 yrs old in December, and she had BC with lymph node involvement.  She fell down some stairs recently and didn't break a single bone.  Her doc said it was the years of tamoxifen that strengthened her bones that prevented any breaks.  I try to focus on those positive stories.  99 year old BC survivor!  Good luck to all of you gals, and I'll say a prayer for you all.  Kim",

I was always small, 5'0, 100 lbs, but now have much more muscle and I don't eat fast food 5-10 days a week anymore, (blessed with high metabolism).  I've only had fast foot 3 times in the last 11 months!  All docs think I had the cancer for quite a while.  Both oncs said I will be on Tamoxifen for 10 years.  I'm hoping to stay on that instead of moving to an AI, as I've had no side effects except for missing periods.  Yay!  I think I was beginning menopause last year, as I had skipped a couple periods, and once I started the Tamo, have not had the hint of one since.  I had blood work done two weeks ago, which indicated I was post menopausal.  I was shocked, as I've had not a single hot flash.  I'm always cold, so I kind of welcomed a hot flash, but none yet.  After writing all this, I feel a little better, ha, but still a little uneasy.  I was totally at ease with my original decision, moved on with life, but since last week, every ache or pain I have, I immediately think it could be cancer running through me.  Of course after I left new onc's office, I thought of a lot more things to question him with.  I go back in February, where he's going to do another cancer antigen blood test.  Oh, he also was impressed with my scans I had after the mastectomy, CT with contrast, bone scan.  He said they were so clean.  He said they usually find something, not necessarily cancer, but mine were totally clean, which he agreed was very good.  He did say that if I was his patient originally, I would've had chemo.  (I say it was still my choice, though) Thanks so much for listening/reading, ladies, and responding.  It truly helped me to vent to others who have been through this.  Time to just move on and hope for the best in February!  Kim",

Also, I didn't go through chemo or rads, but I know someone who was dx'd a week before me, has had to go through chemo and she says hers has not been bad at all.  She's run a 5k in the midst of it and hasn't lost her hair.  She said they mix it specifically for you and your cancer.  Thinking of you and hoping for the best.

It's not a one size fits all treatment plan anymore.  I had one lymph node involved, even though before surgery they didn't think I did, so don't panic if you do.  They removed 12 since they found it in one and the other 11 were clear.  I had mastectomy and then tamoxifen for the next 10 years, which I've had no problem with so far.  Thinking of you...Kim ",
