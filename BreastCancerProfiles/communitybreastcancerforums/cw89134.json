I went to one last year when my annual mammogram showed a \"mild increase in calcifications\" of the left breast. Positioning for a follow-up stereotactic biopsy showed that the calcifications were in the skin, not in breast tissue. No sample was taken at that time. The surgeon said to have a follow-up mammogram in six months. Six months later was 2/18/09. The mammo showed a mass that was not visible six months earlier. Long story short, it's breast cancer. My point about breast surgeons is that they (at least mine) are kind of a \"one stop shopping center\" for breasts. My surgeon does mammograms, ultrasounds and biopsies, all in his office. I think he also does dexascans. What I had done on 2/18 (mammogram, ultrasound, attempted aspiration and core needle biopsy) took under two hours and saved me at least 2-3 weeks of phoning, running around and trying to get appointments. Better to be safe than sorry, IMO. Find a good breast surgeon in your area and follow up. Best of luck to you. Carol W.",

If he doesn't get clear margins with the 4/10 re-excision, the bs and I will be having a serious discussion about mastectomy. I've already anticipated this and have discussed it with my husband in advance. My husband is fully supportive of whatever I decide but also says not to \"get ahead of myself\". I'm 62 years old and don't feel particularly attached to my breast. I know that others, even at my age, feel differently. Thanks again.",

      "Content": "Apr 2, 2009 11:59AM - edited Apr 2, 2009 12:01PM by cw89134 I might as well chime in here. I had a lumpectomy on 3/26, the day after Linda's. My surgeon, too, did not get clear margins on the superior and inferior sides of the sample (I think that's the top and bottom). The path report was marked \"invasive carcinoma present at the superior and inferior margins focally\". I looked up the word \"focally\" and found that it means that < 1mm of tumor was present in those two inked margins. My surgeon said that if it had only been one focally involved margin, he would have let it go but with two focally involved margins, he needs to re-excise. I respect and understand that. If he let it go and I had a recurrence down the road, I would always wonder if that was the reason. My concern is that I'm only a B cup and I'm afraid that, like Pam, he won't get clear margins again and I'll need a mastectomy (I would not necessarily be averse to that but it is more major surgery). I asked him about that and he said that there is no need for me to have a mastectomy -- \"It's just a little bit of tissue\" were his words. I asked his nurse how many times he's had to go in three times and she said \"a very few\". I'm scheduled for re-excision on April 10.",

It is odd that the dirty margins were on opposite ends of the tissue.  The quote I copied was from the diagnosis section of the path report. There is a diagnosis, in addition to the IDC, of DCIS \"Low grade and high grade\". In the detail section, in the section on margins, appears the following: \"Margins: Margins uninvolved by DCIS                   Closest margin = Superior; Distance: 0.6cm              Margins involved by invasive carcinoma:                   Margins: Involved margins: Inferior and superior                 Extent of margin involvement for invasive carcinoma:                  Multifocal: Blocks B9 and B10 (inferior) and B7 and B11 (superior)\" Does this shed any additional light on my situation, in your opinion? Thanks.",

I had a core needle biopsy on 2/18 and am having surgery (lumpectomy, most probably) on 3/26. So a month plus from biopsy to surgery seems average. My breast surgeon sent me for a CT/PET scan which turned out negative, except for the 1.5 cm malignancy in my left breast. So that's at least some good news in a sea of bad news. My husband and I took two copies of our questions when we went for the biopsy results (which the surgeon had already said would probably be malignant). I asked the questions and hubby took notes. My surgeon is a very accessible guy. I can stop by his office (for example, to pick up or drop off films) and he'll make time to talk to me even though I don't have an appointment on that particular day. I like that. Also, my receptor reports (the ones you're waiting for) showed that my tumor is estrogen and progesterone positive. Once those results came back from the lab, the breast surgeon immediately put me on Arimidex which is an Aromatase Inhibitor that stops estrogen production. I feel that by taking this medication prior to surgery, at least I'm doing something to combat the cancer. I'm trying to gather as much info as I can and am trying to make informed  decisions. It's not always easy, is it? Carol",

Well, I thought to myself, isn't that a bit too late? So, I did some research and found onc #2 who does do these tests. I just saw #2 for the first time last week and had blood drawn before I left his office. Two tumor marker tests were done (1)  CA 27-29 and (2) CEA. I called his office Friday and got my results over the phone (and also faxed to me). Both of my numbers were well within the normal range. Onc #2 also ordered a PET scan which will be taken one week before I see him again in three months. I had had a PET scan a year ago when I was diagnosed. However, #2 said that since I had an \"abnormality\" on the PET one year ago (namely the malignancy in my left breast), a follow-up scan should be done to make sure that it is gone. Now that's what I liked hearing! I know that a lot of oncs don't do these tests routinely but I feel more comfortable having them done.",
