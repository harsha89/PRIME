    "Content": "suefg wrote: Hi - Just joined today and have a question for those who are undergoing or have completed chemo.  I developed tendonitis in both achilles during my first chemo treatment in June 2009.  It bothered me throughout treatment but I ignored it and just didn't walk long distances very often.  Of course that only added to my weight gain during chemo.  Once radiation was over (Oct 2009) I started trying to walk for exercise and just couldn't do it with the achilles pain.  First visited family doctor in December and made appt with podiatrist for Jan 2010.  Physical therapy Jan-March, immobilization of worst ankle for 2 weeks plus steroids, then back to PT for another month.  Still no better - as a matter of fact left side is worse - about where right side was when I started. I will be going back to the podiatrist again tomorrow but have been doing research on drug causes of achilles tendonitis.  For example the antibiotics Levaquin and Cipro can cause this but it usually resolves once off the drug.  High doses of steroids can also cause this and I did have dexamethazone prior to each chemo infusion - I did not consider that a really high dose and it was just for one day every few weeks.  My original treatment was to be Taxol plus Cytoxan but I had a very severe allergic reaction to the Taxol so my regimen was changed to Doxirubicin (Adriamycin) plus Cytoxan.  I did have the neulastin shots as well. If there is anyone else out there who developed this while on chemotherapy (and it definitely started long before I began taking aromitase inhibitor), let me know.  None of my docs have heard of this being caused by chemo, but if antibiotics can do it (and I read that that is because they stop the growth of dividing fibroblasts that heal the everyday damage to our tendons) then it seems that chemo drugs that attack dividing cells could do the same thing.  Sorry for the long post.  I am just really frustrated with this.  Also have other tendons with pain, but they don't slow me down the way the achilles does. By the way, for those just beginning treatment or just finishing - there IS life after BC treatment.  One year after end of chemo I have hair (curly for the first time in my life!) almost down to my shoulders!  And the fatigue gradually got better over the course of the year and I feel I am now back to my previous energy levels.  Good Luck to all.
