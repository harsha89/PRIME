      "Content": "Tnackt wrote: I have been having pain in my armpit for about two weeks. It has now started spreading into my breast and arm. It's not extremely painful it's just more sore and tender. When I try to feel for lumps is when it gets really sore. I can't really feel any lumps in my armpit but when I look in the mirror and lift my arm I see what looks like lumps. It started as 1 and now there are 3. When it first started I also checked my breast for lumps and didn't feel anything but last night I was feeling it and it just doesn't feel right. My left breast feels completely different from my right. It feels fuller and looks bigger. I can feel hard spots but they're not like round lumps. I told my doctor two weeks ago and he said not to worry because breast cancer is not painful. He thought it might be infection and gave me antibiotics. The antibiotics did nothing, it just seems to be getting worse. I go back to doctor tomorrow. Could this be symptoms of breast cancer or am I just freaking myself out for no reason. I'm 35 and have 5 kids (3 of my own and raising my 2 nephews as well). I cannot stop thinking about it and haven't been able to sleep. Log in to post a reply",
