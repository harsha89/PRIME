I was diagnosed with invasive Ductal Carcinoma this past July, 2013. The invasive size tumor was only 4mm, grade 2, and I was triple negative. I had a mastectomy on July 31, and also have bilateral tissue expanders in place . Plan to have the implants placed in January. The oncologist told me the tumor board at the treating facility recommended no chemo and would give it to me if I still wanted it, but he felt that I would only receive about a 2% risk reduction in reoccurrence. I chose not to have the chemo, but I worry about reoccurrence because it is triple negative. I am working on changing my diet and exercising also. I need to lose about 50 pounds and would love to hear how you loss your weight.",
