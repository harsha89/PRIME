      "Content": "SammyDee wrote: My headache began 4 months ago. Two weeks later and I was chewing Advil to no avail. The doc was -yet again - on a 3 wk holiday so the receptionist says \"Go to your country emerg dept. Just in case.\" Really? I felt silly- I'm not dying for goodness sake. But I did go in the next day. After work. Shooting apologetic and guilty glances to the other more needy folks there. That doc finds sporatic high blood pressure and something else - not sure what - so I'm sent to the city to see a city neurologist in a different hospital emerg. Pronto. Uh oh. Neuro doc gives me shots, puts me in a cardio watch unit overnight, sends me through 2 cat scans, an MRI, 4 lumbar punctures and an ultrasound all within 8 hours. I'm frightened, I'm in pain from the lumbars, but whew! he says everything is A ok in my brain and - go figure- my blood pressure is fine again. Must be a fluke issue. See my family doc if the headache is not gone in a month. The recuperation is two weeks because of the 3 failed lumbar techniques, and I spent the rest of the month hoping the headache would disappear all on its own. Nope. Not wanting to look like my hypochondriac mother, I gave it another month. Nope. The only difference is that I'd switched to Tylenol. I was pretty sure the new nausea was from overdoing the Advil. So - are you still with me?- two months later with said headache still being an obnoxious bully, I made an appt with my family doc, and decided that since the chronic minimal spotting and tender ovaries caused by my endometriosis was still around -despite my being postmenopausal for two years- I would just get that long overdo pap & physical done while I was there. Okay? Okay. At the appt it's decided my headache needs to be looked into further, tho they'll think on what next should be done. In the meantime, voila! I have a new issue. An enlarged right ovary is found during the pelvic exam. Probably nothing but to be on the safe side, I'm to have an internal & external looky loo ultrasound. At 49 yrs old, I might as well have my first baseline mammogram done too- since its at the same place. By the time the appt came around a couple weeks ago, I'd suddenly added the toilet to my list of best friends: watery # 2s twice a day, and too many \u2018HAVE TO GO!\" #1s from morning til night. The dull ache in my spine, leftover from those fumbled lumbars, has changed to a dull ache on the other side of the spine. Plus I felt like I'd experienced sexy adventures with King Kong during my sleep... front and back entrances thank you very much. The mammogram was a cinch. Well in comparison to the internal pelvic u/s that is. I mean, I'm no baby, but that ultrasound actually hurt. I've had them ones before (endometrosis). This time was not just uncomfortable. It Hurt. Capital H. \"Can I see what you see?No? Can you TELL me what you see? No?\" Sharing our private moment with that oh so important small talk was forbidden by the tech and I was told to call my family doc the next week for results. Meanie. Cruela. Witch. She wasn't really but I was feeling rejected and afraid. As that long and slooooooow next week progressed, I became conscious of new \u2018things'.. like my breathing becoming increasingly hampered. My face seemed thinner, my arms.. I could again wear my wedding rings for the first time in over 6 years... yay! I attribute it to my once voracious appetite having disappeared. Making my usual two tuna sandwiches, I find myself so stuffed after ½ of the first one that I \u2018m burping for the next hour. wait sec... the waistline is the same though... and so is the scale. It's weird enough that I finally gave in and went surfing online. Uh oh. That's when the inner voices of fear began to scream and wail and whine. And when I made the time to call the dr's office and leave a message. \"Give me my results NOW. \" It still took three more days- last Friday - for the return call. Given how I was feeling, I wasn't really surprised at being asked to go back in for another ultrasound. What was surprising however was that the docs receptionist was asking me to schedule an ultrasound for my left breast.And being told to get it done asap so that the family doc could have the results back before my appt with her the following Thursday.  \"Breast?! It's my PELVIC area that I am concerned about ... I have more discomfort there than ever before. I truly feel unwell.\" \"Oh? Let me look if the results are in\".... rustle rustle... \"Yes it says you have fibroids... if you start feeling REALLY bad go to the hospital... so anyways now listen closely... this is what I want you to tell them when you make the appt for your breast ultrasound... do you have a pen? This is important.\" The day proved to have more food for thought: after doing exactly what I was told, I had a second conversation with the ultrasound place. \"Hi, me again... sorry to bother you at work... you know that appt for next Wed? Well someone from your doctors office just came in with your requisition form and we are going to move your appt up. Yes I know I told you that next Wed was the VERY earliest we could get you in but we happen to have these special spots open. For emergencies. So can you make it here in a couple hours?\" At work, no car, an hours drive away... we made the new and improved appt for Monday afternoon. Today is Monday and this morning I awoke with pain/discomfort in my liver, kidneys, both ovaries, lower back and stabbing throbs in my top back and centre chest, and a sore left armpit. Sneeezing and coughing, a static lump in my throat, peeing every half hour.... And a headache of course. Total hypochondriac I self-chastised, as I headed off to work at 7am. I didn't bother fooling myself that I could work, but I had to put in time there before I left for the afternoon ultrasound appt. Knowing my frame of mind was unhealthy, I sat at my desk and tried to take my mind off all my \u2018things'. I needed to find something positive and uplifting to hang on to. I stared at my computer screen - acting as if I was brainstorming my next marketing project. Hmmm. Still can't eat much, so stuffing my face with junk food pity party ala moi was out of the question... and then out of the blue I had the answer: Love.  Since that King Kong feeling has become chronic, I imagined all the ways my secret lover and I must have been \u2018active' last night... giggles came out in little sad bursts over the next hour, as I pretended that what I was feeling was just my \u2018after glow' and I tried to mentally bask in all that love. The distraction worked right up to my country drive into the city for the breast ultrasound. Then my breathing became more ragged and shallow. I couldn't talk to myself on the long journey without needing to inhale for every five words out. But I made it to the place. In record time actually. As I was sitting there in the waiting room, worried and anxious, I reminded myself that these techies would NEVER tell me \u2018what is what' during their looky loo. I was another three days away from knowing. Unless... ! I went back up to the receptionist and ask to see my requisition. Yes the one she paperclipped my health card to. Because I was never told what's being checked out and I wasn't the one who brought the requisition form to her, that's why. Thank you. Into eager hands, my eyes jump greedily to the bottom of the page. Big neat feminine handwriting says\" Well developed nodule 4 cm deep 0.8 x 1 mm left breast areola.\" I handed the paper back without a sound, sat down and wrote it down on the bookmark meant for the novel I'd naively brought for killing wait time. My brain froze and time stood still as I pondered. In with the tech, sliding onto the bed, I asked and was advised-as expected- she wasn't allowed to say or share anything. I did manage to peep some of what she saw, but I have no idea what I was looking at. Some blobs, some streaks, some lines. The only items gleaned are that the tech is not surprised she hurt me during the scan, that it hurt just where she thought it would hurt, and my doctor should have the results tomorrow afternoon. My inner banshee wailed \"But they won't tell me squat before my friggin appt THURSDAY morning!\" She left me alone a moment to get dressed and I spotted my requisition form on the table. Grabbed it for another peek. Yup. Says the same thing as the first time I looked at it, nothing more. For most of my journey home I cried out my fear. Some of the time I laughed at myself. Then I cried. Then I spent a few stupid minutes laughing AND crying. I can only imagine what passing drivers thought. I've been home for hours now, sitting on the couch and unable to DO anything except obsess about myself. My husband will be home soon. The house is a mess. The workload I brought home to get caught up on is untouched. And I still have this headache. A headache hassle that turned into a pelvic problem, and morphed into a breast bomb....                                              and three more days to go.   ... what the heck does \"well developed\" mean?

I'm very glad I did, for today was the first in well over a month where I met my dawn with a brighter and more optimistic me! With each concern I chronicled (began a health journal last week to gauge progression & changes) this morning, I was instantly reminded of conversations from here, and in other BC forum posts I scoured last night. It enabled me to take a deep cleansing breath.  Sure I'm having to contend with some of my new best beasties for yet another day, and yes the clouds are blocking my view of how high this mountain climb will be ... however t'was somehow easier to get on with the day. It will be what it will be. That's all.  A saner, calmer me today and all the credit goes to the people here. Thank you so very much for the light and warmth everyone. :0) Sammy",

GREAT suggestion though Kimmer...  I WILL make sure to bring a wad of cash when I go in two days, and ask for copies of my recent head, pelvic AND breast tests. Wish I'd thought of that for the pelvic test results when I was in the city on Thursday... no Friday... no it was yesterday. Holey moley was that breast ultrasound only yesterday??!  Feels like a week ago. Wow, fear sure puts a curve on time.",

The good news is we know what the issue is so no more guessing! \" Cowgirl: You've assessed my worries to a tee (and in only a few sentences! grin). Yes, I was hoping all this would tie in together somehow because I will most certainly be overwhelmed if it is not.

Not wide but tall, well defined but definitely not a cyst (this last was said twice in the report.. jeesh).. I asked if we could just check on it in a month or two to see if it gets bigger before going in for the looky loo, but was told that not all lumps get bigger before they hit the bloodstream and go traveling elsewhere. That was something I didnt know. Biopsy is in two weeks. There was good news: xrays say lungs are dry and clear despite my obvious breathing issues and lack of air movement, and no thyroid problems even though the area is swollen and sore. What's this mean? I wont be sitting around getting worried about the biopsy because I have appts with a Neuro, a Gyno, and an abdominal u/s next week. And another blood test tossed in for good luck. And some sinus, migraine and vaginal meds to help take the edge off in the meantime. And cholesteral meds as a reward for my very high test score.   Last but not least, an appt with someone to help me cope with being overwhelmed by all the appts. Snort. All in all I am okay with it just this moment. Kinda hard to get too down when I am thinking good thoughts and sending positive energy toward everyone here ( and out \"there\") who have landed on the other side of wondering whats going on with their bodies, and -not liking the answer- are pushing to change it. This forum is full of ..... well I can't think of the perfect word, but its a wonderful one to be sure. ",
