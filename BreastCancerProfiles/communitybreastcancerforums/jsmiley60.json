I guess I'm feeling sorry for myself today. I had a hysterectomy last July and was just getting to feeling better and was excited to start school full time when I got diagnosed. Seems like I've lost an entire year and I am so sick of laying around watching TV or reading or being bored. I'm not into crafty stuff or knitting or anything. I'm feeling very bored and lonely. Plus it still hurts to do things - like load the dishwasher, laundry, even emptying the trash. UGH! I'm frustrated and tired of having to ask people to do things for me!! The chemo was hard on me, especially the A/C so I've been needing help a lot in the past year. I probably just need to have a good cry! I see both surgeons today so I hope I get some encouraging news from them. I'm going to try to drive myself. Thanks for letting me vent some!",

There are certain things I cannot do, such as shave with a regular razor, get blood pressure taken on that arm, etc. I think if I take the precautions I will be okay. My bs sent me to a lymphedema therapist who went over all the do's and don't's and measured my arms and checked my range of motion. She had me come back today and massaged me to try to release some of the swelling that is water retention. I was even swollen on my back right below the shoulder, which has been hurting by the way. She had me do my exercises and pushed me further, so I'm pretty sore tonight. Went to ps and NO MORE ACE BANDAGE!! I can wear a sports bra now. Got my first fill of 120 cc's and he had put 50 cc's in at time of surgery. We are shooting for 700 cc's so I've got a long way to go.......lol! I'm wondering what to wear in the cups of my bathing suit to get in the pool as doctor said I could get in the pool next week...... maybe I will just put some pantyhose in there. Don't really want to spend money on anything as I probably won't be swimming that much this summer. I would love to walk but it has been so hot and humid here that I have been staying inside. I think today it was 97 degrees.....hope it cools down soon. My te's are tight like some of the rest of you were saying, but my left arm is still numb underneath and in a couple other small spots. As it becomes unnumb, it aches but propping it up on a pillow when I'm sitting seems to help.  Hoping we all get better and better with each day.",

I'm really getting annoyed with all the waiting the oncologist expects me to do! The other news is that my doc does want me to have radiation and they will refer me to a radioligist and call me back with that info and an appointment. I'm certainly not in a hurry to start that anyway, but gee why can't i make my own appointment! I guess i just have to laugh at all this and then they were supposed to fax the prescription to my mail order prescription provider and they didn't, they called it in to my pharmacy so I only got 30 days worth. :( The doctors office did tell me to take 1500 i.u.'s of Vitamin D; how much has everyone else been told to take with the estrogen blocker?",

I'm very sore and when I change positions or get up from sitting there is searing pain. Ugh! Does anything know anything about lymphedema risk and exchange surgery? I wore my compression sleeve for the surgery and when I got home my hand was swollen, so Itook it off and not swollen today. Should I be wearing the compression sleeve post surgery or not? I'm afraid I'll cause more problelms if I wear it....or if I don't wear it... Sorry for the poor typing...I'm percocet brain! ",

I understand what it is like when it is the middle of the night and you are all alone......so sorry, but glad it worked out okay. I'm sure it wasn't because of helping the elderly woman - it was just time for the drain to come out! I have been fighting a sore throat and sinus headache here in humid \"sinus valley\" Ohio. So yesterday I took my bra off and took a 3 hour nap and left my bra (sports bra) off the rest of the day and last night. So this morning I was really swollen on the left side including above the \"breast\". I went to physical therapy and she worked me hard, but massaged me a little. I think the swelling has come down a little but I am very sore and having weird pain. Anybody else had anything like this - I'm a month post surgery??? So I called the ps to ask something else and his assistant asked him about the swelling and he said it was probably nothing, but I could wrap my chest if I wanted. Yeah right - I'll get right on that! I don't even have any ACE bandages and really don't want to buy any. So she said I could come in tomorrow if I wanted.......I'm afraid if I go in, he will wrap me again and I WANT TO GO SWIMMING and do some fun stuff this weekend. I'm hoping the swelling is way down in the a.m. so I can just cancel my appointment. Argh! Sure wish I was back to normal by now..........I'm beginning to think back to normal won't ever happen, but it will become a new normal.",

Heal well and take care and Laurie quit lifting stuff!!",

It helps me to hear from others and see that I'm not alone with the TE pain. It has been better today and yesterday. My PS showed me how to massage them in the shower (oh boy!) so I don't know if that is helping or what it is. They still hurt but not as bad as they did. I have 550 cc's too and am going to 700. I feel envious when I read about you guys getting your exchange surgeries set up! I ended up having to have radiation, which no one told me until 7/20 and then it was 8/12 before I met with the radiologist and found out we would have to stop the TE fills during radiaiton. So I had my first rad treatment today. When I'm done end of October, we will have to wait 6 weeks before doing any fills and then will have to have 2 or 3 to finish and then wait a month for surgery. So I'm probably looking at February or March for surgery - Grrrrrrrrr!!! Anyway I'm sure it will go fast and I'll have my new boobs (if all goes okay) soon!  ",

I think it is due to the radiation but the doc says no it is just the nerves growing back (funny how didn't really have the sharp pains til I started rads!)

And I didn't have pain when I woke up.........just wanted to sleep and they kept talking to me. Lol! You will be okay - you will wake up and be able to inspire and minister to others! It's okay to  be bitchy and ur husband may just be scared so he is acting like an idiot. R there others that can help you once you get home from the hospital? I have people stopping by every day that can wash my hair, empty trash, load dishwasher........I wouldn't be able to survive without it! (well I'd have dirty hair, a trash heap and dirty dishes!).",

If anyone has all the info compiled and can put it in a post, then I can update easily......my brain doesn't work well enough for me to figure it out myself! lol! Frustrating day.......doc did not take two remaining drains out. Starting Sunday I began to have much more coming out of right drain and last night I called the on-call nurse because I emptied 70 cc's, then 100 cc's two hours later, then 60 more cc's 10 minutes later. Doc not happy - said I wasn't wrapped right and was indented right above the incision on that side. So now I'm wrapped up with 3 ace bandages - wrapped around my chest and around my neck to keep it in place. UGH!! I go back to him Thursday morning so hope things will be better by then! Someone asked about being home after surgery aby themselves.........I had my sisters here for 4 nights after hospital stay of two nights. I could not really make food myself and could not initially wash under my arms with sponge bath. They plugged stuff in for me and such. I could do my drains, but a nurse came to wrap me almost daily the first week. So I'm very grateful that they were able to be here to care for me!!! Praying for all........hope to be in a more positive place tomorrow.",

Yes it is really weird how the different surgeons do different things......I WISH my ps would have done the compression bra rather than Ace bandages. These things are pains in the neck! I wrapped myself today, which was not an easy task and it has come lose. ;) I hope I can quit having to wrap my chest soon. Also my bs and ps told me to take it easy and not do exercises until I had healed some. Plus some people go home the day or surgery and I was in hospital for 2 nights. Lots of differences...... Reneemac I cannot imagine going to a convention and I am at the 2 week mark. I don't know how you did it! We had a surprise birthday party ffor my mom today and I am totally exhausted and very sore. I did nothing except ride the 45 minutes to get there and visited with people and ride home...lol! It was a fun day though....glad I could make it!",

ON another note: There may be something out there already about this, but I couldn't find anything. I had a BMX with tissue expanders 6/11/10. I will have my first fill next week. I was a DD prior to surgery and hope to be a D with exchange. What do I do about a bra(s) in between now and the exchange? The ps told me to get a padded bra.....well if there isn't anything in the padded bra it isn't going to look like I have boobs......lol! PS assistant told me to get a sports bra, but it still wouldn't look like I had boobs, unless I put something in the bra. Now I'm no seamstress but I suppose I could get someone to help put a pocket in a sports bra to put somefalsie things in. I mean going from a DD to NOTHING is not something I really want to do out in public. (It's ok to go to the doc that way, but not back to work, school or a social life.) Anybody got any ideas or can share what they did?????? Thanks!",

I had too many visitors today so now I'm exhausted again...lol. The shaving thing: my bs told me I had to use electric razor under left arm because all those lymph nodes were removed and there is a risk of lymphodema. With a razor razor there is a risk of cutting myself, causing lymphedema. I still have to buy an electric razor. Oh boy!",

Trying to scoop ice cream not only hurt but I swear it made my TE on the right side move - ugh! I don't like how that feels at all. I wish I could fast forward til after my implant surgery..........sigh! As far as nipple recon, my pssaid he could do it in his office and I would only miss that day of work. He didn't sayanything about wearing cones.....I hope I don't have to do that! I think I did too much today again, but people aren't visiting anymore and I hate sitting here by myself all the time! I went to the grocery and couldn't push the cart. I mean I could but it hurt in my chest, so I just picked up a few things. Grrrrrrrr! I'm going to have to have someone take me and help. I rode the motorized carts a few times when I was on chemo and suffering fatigue and neuropathy. Don't want to do that again. I am accepting of what I see in the mirror and I wasn't devastated the first time I looked at my incisions, but I don't like it. This evening I have felt very depressed and cried a few times; I am grieving the loss of my breasts. I know I will get new ones with the implants, but they won't be MINE. I'm feeling very lonely too. I guess I'm trying to find the balance between feeling sorry for myself and grieving. I don't want to get myself stuck in a poor me place. I just want my boobs back! I want to go back to a year ago and never have breast cancer!! (wah!) I'm overweight so right now I am flat with a big belly and butt and I look silly. I have been putting the falsies in when I go out now that I'm not wearing the Ace bandages any more, so that helps. My self esteem is pretty low. My hair came back in all gray so I colored it and now it is getting gray again so I need to color it again. It is about an inch or inch and a half long and I've been spiking it. Won't be able to do that much longer so then not sure how I wear it. Don't really want it this short. I guess I just want my life back. Sounds like I'm having a pity party for myself, so I guess I better sign off for now. Things could be worse.......",

She is going to a conference tomorrow with oncologists, radiologists and pathologists tomorrow and will bring up my case to see what they say. Then she will call me late this week. I was and am so upset as the breast surgeon had told me months ago that she didn't see any need for radiation. And I saw her 3 weeks ago and she never mentioned it. Also my left breast tested positive in one other spot for IDC in addition to the tumor and my bs never told me that either!! Not happy with her. Onco wants me to take Arimex since I had a hysterectomy. Need bone scan, have to take Vitamin D and calcium. Also my iron is still low so she wants to do some iron infusions to get it back up. That's the only thing I was happy about because it will make me feel better and not worn out. Of course if I have to get radiation I will probably get fatigue from that anyway!! Grrrrrrrrrrrr! Went to ps and got another fill; he actually drained 75 cc's of stuff out of left side first that was fluid outside the expander. My swelling went right down. I still have a long way to go on the fills. Sorry ladies no positive attitude from me today........I'm be okay tomorrow probably.",

That begins Thursday; Is anyone else having a lot of pain/soreness in chest area that has tissue expanders? I saw ps today and he said it is just because I have foreign objects in me and because we put a lot of saline in my expanders in the last 3 weeks. But I am experiencing more soreness and even some sharp pains now than I did early on or even a month ago. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this. Tomorrow is my cancerversary. I was told one year ago tomorrow that they had found some breast cancer cells in the biopsy. My life was forever changed in that phone call. Hard to believe it has been a year.",

I had surgery 16 days ago and still feel like I can't do a whole lot. I am very sore today after going to my mom's party yesterday. It seems like when I try to do stuff then I hurt later.

She said this still put me in an end grade one category. Not sure what that means....will have to ask questions when I go see her in two weeks. I guess I feel that these results reiterate that I made the right decision with the BMX. However, it doesn't seem like the chemo did very much........and why wouldn't the PET scan have shown a 1.5 centimeter tumor? is it too small? I am feeling more soreness in my chest and upper arms starting yesterday. I am thinking the numbness is finally wearing off so maybe that is why....does anyone know? I have ace bandages wrapped on my chest and we keep rewrapping but they seem to either be too tight or move around too much so have to be redone. Hope to get a drain out when see PS tomorrow and maybe won't have to keep it so wrapped up....... As you can tell I have a lot of questions this morning!

Okay Lizzy I want to know how you felt the morning AFTER you got up and cycled right after surgery?? Are you nuts...lol! Well I got my last two drains out today! Yay! Really happy about that; it did not hurt when he took them out, but I have been pretty sore ever since then and very tired. I've been sleeping a lot this week - it will two weeks tomorrow the 25th. I don't know if I just need the extra sleep or am not sleeping well enough at night or if it is the heat/humidity here in Ohio or if depression. Maybe a combination of all!

I am still fighting a sore throat and sinus headache....not sure if that is what is making me so tired. I took another 3 hour nap today. I took a percocet last night because I was swollen and hurting and I slept 9 hours straight without waking up. Yay! I have to go back to my internship Friday and back to school next week. I need more energy!!  And although I have been bored being home, I'm scared to go back to life. I guess I feel scared because I'm not sure that physically I'm up for it, but Friday it will be 5 weeks since surgery and I have to go to school when school is in. I already had chemo so once I recover from the surgery, I can go forward with my survival. :) I had 4 treatments of A/C and 12 Taxol. If anyone has any questions, let me know. PM if you need to!",

They give me pills for nausea that I had to take starting before chemo so I had little problems with nausea. Eat smaller meals more often was also good advice they gave me and eat yogurt if you can.

Sometimes I tear up just thinking about the fact that I have to have radiation! Today I have not felt good - I felt nauseous and worn out and my chest was itchy and sore. I had to take my bra off at 2 p.m. because it was irritating my skin under my left arm at the side not the armpit. The right breast (not getting rads) was pink all weekend, but better today, but I am pink underneath both breasts just slightly, plus I have a rash in the cleavage (been there since the simulation when they put sticky tape where a mole had been taken off) and a rash around one of the tatoos that was caused by a band aid! Whew - that was a long sentence of whining! Anyway sad the rad onc today and told him all this and he said (in a joking tone) I bet you think all of this is my fault and I said yes!! He said the pink right breast and pink under both breasts was not his fault and he doesn't know why it is like that. He said it looked like an allergic reaction. Then he said the rashes weren't his fault and told me that the my skin didn't look bad and to keep using the radia gel he gave me. Also told him I was having sharp pains in the left breast and he said that was nerves healing from the surgery in June. Pretty much he wasn't concerned about any of it, so I guess instead of whining, I need to puke on him or cry hysterically saying I'm in tremendous pain or so fatigued I can't walk before he will show any concern.

I think it makes sense to use lotion ahead of time to keep the skin moist, but I can't do it now anyway because they put tape over my tatoos so can't really put lotion on them. Ugh!",

So then 12 hours later I go to the pharmacy to pick it up and they have no record of anyone requesting a prescription for me today! ARRRRGGGGGHHH!! So now I guess I have to wait til Monday to call and see what is going on. Sigh....",

It is hard though because you can't put lotion on the spots you really need to, but I guess we all will just keep doing the best we can.

And remind him of the Family Medical Leave Act! People aggravate me - I actually had to quit a part time job I'd only had 2 months because the chemo made me so sick and they were stressing me out with their attitudes! (they were too small for the FMLA to apply).",

Looks like a sunburn and under my arm has been very irritated the past two days. A friend told me she heard to put chamomile tea bags on the burnt areas. I asked today at rads and they said they had never heard of it, but try it. So I put the tea bags in boiling water, took them out right away and let them cool to warm, then put them where I was feeling burnt. It took the burnt, hot feeling away! So I plan to do more of this over the weekend. :) I am so hoping I don't blister and my skin doesn't break, but I know that would be a rarity. Everybody rest up and have a side effect free weekend!",
