      "Content": "beeve wrote: It's been a month, so I figured I could take off the surgical tape.  When I did so, and actually examined the dimpled side (the one with the cancer so close to the chest wall, so it's a slit dimple I had what looked like two bad pimples.  Once I thouroughly scrubbed the area and disinfected it, they were two tiny abscessed on two subcutanious stitches.  My surgeon and I actually discussed that afterwards because I am a seamster and I know a whole lot about stitching.  Once the tiny abscesses were popped and cleaned I could clearly see that they were two little slits, like stitches but not right on the seam. Of course, I scrubbed them silly, disinfected them, covered them with neosporin and a big bandaid.  I called my doctor, but it is after noon on a glorious summer Friday.  Then again, she was still in the hosptial on the Friday I was there, working til 7, so I would think her assistant will at least check the messages by five and report. The now open wounds sort of ache but I think I got most of the crud out with a good washcloth, they needed to be popped.  I have some Amoxacillen on hand (from dental stuff, because you always get an abscess at Saturday after Midnight...).  I'm thinking since both little abscesses drained and I cleaned them out, it should be okay? I don't start chemo til the 30th;  I get my IV port installed on the 25th.  I was handling this like a champ but my steely resolve is weakening of late... I always wanted an interesting life, but this is getting ridiculous.

It's getting better but I'm not sure it will be a good idea to have surgery on the day after tomorrow when I can feel there's still crap in there.  I'm thinking the doc will push the IV installation back a week.  What I would love is if she drained the damn thing, but it is getting less painful. Thanks for your advice and I'm sorry for not posting an update, I'm new here.",

I'm glad to get an extra week of unencumberance in this beautiful summer weather; that, and we have three ripe tomatos from the garden for part of tonight's supper.",
