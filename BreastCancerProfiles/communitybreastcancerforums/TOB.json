We had a wake following the memorial service with private interment set for the next day.  I cannot tell you how many people told me that I was \"young and attractive....so you don't have to worry....you won't have any trouble catching another man.

Check out http://www.lymphedemapeople.com/wiki/doku.php?id=reflex_sympathetic_dystrophy for more information regarding this very misunderstood condition.   Good luck and let us know what you find out.",

I'll get off my soapbox with one additional comment.   I found your allegation that restless leg syndrome is a disease created by drug companies to sell drugs shocking.  Any competant neurologist or sleep disorder specialist will tell you that restless leg syndrome is a real neurological condition affecting thousands of people, including some on these boards with BC. It is not in their heads, they are not crazy and are not seeking attention. I would not have expected such an irresponsible comment from an RN.",

      "Content": "Oct 22, 2009 10:29AM - edited Oct 22, 2009 10:30AM by TOB I fully understand the need to try and find a reason for one's cancer.  I have been agonizing over that question since I was first diagnosed. I don't have ANY family history, I have always tried to live a healthy lifestyle, I've always tried to be a good person, etc. etc. SO...Why me?  What did I do to deserve this?  What did I do to cause this?  I can't find an answer for my cancer so I have reached the same conclusion as Athena-Lionness.  Being alive causes all kinds of cancer.  Cancer in humans has existed as long as humans have inhabited the earth.  Is there more cancer now or did many cases go undocumented and undiagnosed before the advent of \"modern medicine\"?  I think that both are probably true.  Many cancers are primarily diseases of aging (which obviously still occur in some children and young people) and we simply live longer now than at any time in history.  Some folks have strong familiy histories of cancer, but the majority of cases are not familial.  All, however, are throught to start with a DNA mutation in a single cell.  What causes such mutations?  I truly believe that science will eventually prove that many but far from all cancers are explained by the damage that human activities and overpopulation have done to the earth/environment, by carcinogenic natural or manmade products (often in use for years before being identified as such) and by \"modern\" lifestyles (stress, dietary factors, increased obesity, couch potato-ism, etc.)  Cancers like mine that can't be traced to any particular cause may simply be the result of good old \"S&%# Happens\" (or if I was trying to be more PC) \"when good things happen to bad people.\" Whatever the cause, all we can do is move forward, one step at a time, one day at a time, making decisions that work for us.  I went braless through my waif stage in the late 60's and 70's, but it is just plain physically painful for me now, and I find it to be age inappropriate now that I'm older, a bit heavier and much bustier.  So... I'm moving forward still wearing my lacy, underwire bras until the day of my surgery and resuming their use as soon as possible thereafter. (Yes, it is fine with my docs.) Small things make a real difference in the quality of life and lacy underwear makes me feel good. I'd rather risk another cancer than wear what I call \"orthopedic underwear\"!    ",

What I can tell you is that SNB in patients with DCIS continues to be a source of disagreement in the literature and in practice. The risk of complications from SNB is low, but complications such as lymphedema, seroma, infection and sensory neuropathy have been reported after the procedure. When I was just going to have a lumpectomy, SNB was not considered to be necessary unless the pathology revealed microinvasion. After reading the literature, I understood why. By definition DCIS is contained within the milk ducts, and cannot therefore, metastasize to the lymph nodes.  That can change, however, in those cases where DCIS has invaded or broken through the wall of the milk ducts and into the surrounding breast tissue. Neither of the path reports from my 2 lumpectomies indentified any microinvasion, so another procedure to do sentinal node mapping and excision was not performed.  Now that I will be having a mastectomy, they are going to do a SNB, primarily because sentinal node mapping cannot be performed after a mastectomy has been done.  The finding of lymph node metastasis in pure breast DCIS (without microinvasion) is not unknown, but is a very rare occurence if the primary tumour has been completely excised and microinvasion has been ruled out by a thorough histologic examination by an experienced pathologist.  It is done in conjunction with a mastectomy to insure that occult metastases are not missed.  The chance they will find anything is quite low, but if you have to go through such an extensive procedure for Stage 0 cancer, knowing that they got it all and there is no occult disease identified will help you sleep at night.    ",
