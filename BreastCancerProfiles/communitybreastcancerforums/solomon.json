The lady that did the sonogram could feel it with her hands and every time she moved the sonogram wand to get a picture. I received a call from my doctor today saying that everything was normal and that she wanted to see me back in 3 months. I'm a nervous wreck thinking about the what ifs. Should I get a second opinion? Log in to post a reply",
