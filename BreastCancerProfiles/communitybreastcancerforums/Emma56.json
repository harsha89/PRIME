And would like to turn to you regarding my own situation. I am scheduled for a mammo/us/biopsy next week and the anxiety over the biopsy and especially a possible bc diagnosis are causing me so much stress that I find it very difficult to function. There is a large mass in my left breast and also other visible changes and I am very afraid of having bc. I am 51 and my mother died of bc when she was only 50 years old and I am having flashbacks of what she went through and the fear is so difficult to cope with, especially since I live alone without family and lack a support system. Would you have some advice for me regarding the biopsy (can it \"spread\" ca cells??) and which type is safer than others? And could you share what has helped you with the anxiety? Thank you in advance. Emma Dx 2/20/2008, IDC, 6cm+, Stage III, Grade 2, ER+/PR-, HER2- Dx Log in to post a reply",

If there has been shrinkage, then perhaps only minimal and some days I think that the mass feels a bit smaller and other days when I don't. My onc. measured during the second treatment a week ago but wasn't sure either because the first measurement before I began treatment may have been more of an estimate. Is it \"normal\" to take this long? Have any of you had this experience that chemo didn't seem to bring you the desired tumor shrinkage? And what did you do then? Thanks.
