Are they doing any blood tests on your mom? TMs? There was a thread a few weeks ago, about Chinese remedies to be used during chemo. I can't find it right now, but will post the link when I find it. I remember they were simple mixtures, and they were called \"warm\" or \"cold\", to ballance the effect of chemo. With your mom's feeling cold all the time, it just came to mind. I'll go look for it some more. Hang in there, Michelle - lots of prayers coming your way. Lumi. Edited to add the link: http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topic/707540?page=1#post_963228",

From what I gather, sometimes the bone scan can be ambiguous (e.g. if you have osteoporosis or other bone conditions, there may be dye uptake in your bones, which may look suspicious if you are also stage IV). I had looked up the scientific literature after seeing my mom's bone scan (which looked absolutely terrifying, all those uptake regions lighting up) - there seems to be a consensus that PET is more specific. Most doctors prefer to have both, and a continuous followup to see if anything changes. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be an exact science, there is some educated guesswork involved. My mother's bone scan showed multiple mets, everywhere. After she arrived to the US she had a CT scan and an MRI, and there is only one region that looks suspicious (she'll have that biopsied next week). A question for the docs: why don't we have some tumour-specific dye that will show exactly which regions are mets, versus other benign lesions? Ugh .... sorry for whining....",

There are things that she can still do (she's bedridden with other ailments though), and she does them like noone else would do them for me. If her pain or discomfort are manageable, I want her to be around. I wouldn';t want her to be in continuous terrible pain though. She may not enjoy life as she used to, and most depressed people don't. Depression on top of another illness (and more so if it's cancer, I believe) makes it so much harder to battle, I think. I used to be depressed (when I had to go through a divorce that hit me out of the blue) and was bedridden, didn't want to do anything, there was no joy in anything, no purpose. Body was aching, although I had no disease other than depression. Didn't want to see anyone, not even loved ones. I was praying to die, I felt useless, a burden to anyone that wanted to make sure I was alright. Add any serious disease to this... and it's so much harder to deal with it.  It took me a couple of years (and lots of faith and therapy) to slowly come back to a relative \"normal me\". But I won't ever be the same. None of us will, every day that passes changes us forever. I now understand that, and try to cherrish the new me, it must be worth something. I don't want to compare my experience with depression, with anything you ladies have been going through.  I was just thinking, depression kicks one in the gut real bad, and noone should make critical decisions when depressed. I pray for you, Stephanie. Love -- Lumi.",

It took them years to figure out what was causing the on and off double vision episodes, but that was back in Romania. Here in the US there is a simple blood test (acetylcholine receptor antibodies, I think) that can confirm if it's myasthenia gravis.

Mix well. Roll the dough into a 10\" long log. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour. Working with 1/4 of the dough at a time, place it on a floured countertop, turning it over to coat well so that it does not stick. Roll the dough out very thin. Using a pastry or pizza cutter, cut the dough into 2x2 inch squares. FILLING: In a saucepan, place the butter, ground nuts, sugar, and milk and cook until thick, stirring to prevent sticking. Add the vanilla. Cool slightly before using on the dough. Place 1/2 teaspoon filling on each square, using the back of a teaspoon to spread it. Roll up the square diagonally, from one corner to the opposite corner, or from one side to the opposite side. Form either into a crescent shape, or leave it straight and place the filled dough on an ungreased cookie sheet. bake for 15-20 minutes in a preheated 350 oven until the cookies are light brown. Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar immediately. Let cool. More powdered sugar can be added later. You can make half the recipe, or the whole deal and freeze some of the crescents for later use (I always choose to make more and save for later). If you don't like walnuts, you can use pecan or fill these crescents with loukoumi (cut up in small pieces) or with a thick preserve. Bon appetit! -- Lumi.",

I am wondering if those tissues are discarded (which is what's happening in all likelyhood, especially in smaller hospital, where research is not emphasized) - they could be put to use. I don't have much experience with clinical research, but here is the little I do know: - you need an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval in order to be able to use any leftover/discarded tissues. Nothing can be done without the IRB approval, so this should be done first and right away by as many centers as possible. A simple research proposal should do in order to pass this hurdle. - you need a way to store these tissue samples. Either by freezing (some money could go to buying liquid nitrogen tanks) or by processing the samples right away and preserve them in paraffin blocks (some money could by a part time tech to do the processing and the respective supplies). - if the researchers who do the analyses/studies are located far from the source of tissue, some money could go to safely transporting the samples. These are all things that don't seem like much, they are just organizing issues, but at least the first one (IRB approval) takes a long time, and should be started NOW, in a concerted effort throughout the country.",

I know, I should get it checked, and I will, as soon as we get a plan for my mom. Anyways, back to adoption - I believe it is better to give that child my love for as long as I live, than not give it at all. The orphanages in Romania are not assaulted with requests, so chances are there may not be a healthier adult that wants to adopt them. I understand the situation is different here, but there are countries that may allow you to adopt internationally.  I am unsure about the cost of adoption, and other worries you may have. But I think you'll find it within you to take care of both yourself and that child. Until then, please take care of yourself - God bless! Lumi",

I have read posts about brain mets on this board, there are treatment options and I am sure your mom's docs are doing their best.

Like Tender said, scientists didn't put all the eggs in one basket. My colleagues use MCF-7, BT-20 and another BT-something line (I forget the number following the dash). In my line of research, cell lines are only used to test hypotheses that cannot be safely tested in animals/humans (e.g. if one wants to know what happens to a certain protein, 15 min after administration of a drug - one cannot start killing mice just to take some organs out and look at that protein. Instead, we put that drug on top of cells and see what happens - does this make sense?). Anyways, it's unsettling that the respective cell line has been mislabeled for so long!!!!

I am unsure of the reason why they want you off chemo for so long (is this a requirement for the oophorectomy? 6 mo?). A chemo break is a chemo break, but if there is progression, even slight, I see no reason to prolong the break. Can you get 6 months on chemo and then have another shorter break (1-2 mo) before surgery, if necessary? That would take precise scheduling, it's just a thought though, as I have zero experience.

Thus, I am hoping that if the doc fixes the low RBC (and prevents further RBC lysis), your ferritin levels will return to normal. Does this make sense? Lots of hugs -- Lumi.",

Survival though is a different story - it is hard to compare the groups, all it says is that the patients in both groups lived about the same amount of time. However, nobody can tell how long they would have lived without the drug, they just compare chemo versus no chemo (or sometimes versus another chemo). The patients are not the same in both groups, and at some level it is unfair to compare them. If you read the article, look for the selection criteria (sometime called inclusion/exclusion criteria) - you'll most likely see that the selection is quite relaxed, various levels of progression may have been included in the study. It is difficult to recruit subjects for such studies (especially if they're drug versus placebo - who wants to be on placebo?), so the docs have to be permissive in their recruitment. Bottom line is - while the effectiveness of treatment is quite objective and can be assessed accurately, survival depends on far more factors and it is difficult to make predictions (e.g. one patient may have poor kidney function while another has thyroid problems etc. and all these will factor in in their overall survival). Don't get scared, look at the bright side of the study - chemo works! God bless you and everyone else here - you are all awesome! Lumi P.S. One more word of caution - don't trust studies called meta analyses, usually they are incorrectly done.",

There is also a warning about the liver, so if you go on this tx, you'll have your blood calcium and liver function tested often. It is so confusing, so I hope your onc can explain better why he suggested this, and if other options are still available.

Sometimes a scare is just that, a scare, and nothing more, as you will read below. It's been ~ 6 weeks since my mom came to the US after being dx (back in Romania) w/ bc mets throughout her spine and ribs. She has been through a lot - blood tests, infusions, scans and biopsies and the good news is that she does NOT have mets! The onc was such a sweetheart, and very thorough in assessing her status, as far as I can tell. He kept calling me with updates whenever there was any news, and discussed everything with me, in detail. So here is the chronological sequence of events, in short: - first set of blood tests, the office calls us back in within a couple of hours, for a potassium infusion, as my mom's potassium was way low (turns out it was because of a first generation aromatase inhibitor she had been taking in Romania, which she had stopped when she came here). (The new AI don't have this problem with potassium, fear not.) - CT scan and MRI come back with a dx of compression fractures to her lumbar spine, due to osteoporosis, plus a suspicious region in her thoracic spine, and a suspicious node on her lung. - mammogram comes back clean, no breast cancer. - lung biopsy shows a Schwanoma (some sort of benign tumor?), onc says we shouldn't worry about it, and we shouldn't bother removing it since it doesn't give any symptoms. - bone biopsy to the thoracic spine shows no metastatic activity but raises the posibility of myeloma, onc wants mom to go back for another set of blood and urine tests (will call the office on Mon and schedule it). The onc was very uneasy regarding the fact that he had to disagree with the doctors in Romania, who had told my mom she has 3-6 months to live.... but in the end he did. I told him not to worry, noone will sue anyone, we're just glad that they were wrong. Now my only worries are regarding this myeloma posssibility, and regarding my mom's compression fractures to the lower back (issues which we barely began to tackle). My mom may not have mets, but she is a bc survivor and I have grown so fond of you all ... can't stop coming back here and reading your stories, crying for the ones who lose their battles or just have a bad day, crying happy tears for those that get a break, praying for you all.... hope you will accept my coming back here, you have become my best friends! I thank God for this miracle, and Saint Anthony who listened to my 9-week prayer and mediated this issue for me, in front of God... And thank you for all the great advice you gave me throughout this odyssey, you are an awesome group of ladies, THE BEST! Only a divine intervention could have brought me to the perfect place, at the most terrible time in my life. Love and prayers to all - Lumi Log in to post a reply",

Her blood vitamin D levels were low, and the blood test is simple indeed, nothing fancy. Tell your mother's PCP you want it done, or have your mom ask for it. I think it's crucial to help the bone regenerate. Moderate exposure to sunlight also helps vitamin D levels (my mother didn't leave the house in several months, before we figured her vitD was too low). I don't know if any chemo would interfere, hope not. Hugs and prayers -- Lumi.",

Normal cells from an organ travel to another organ, where they happen to become cancerous, and then spread further. A biopsy would show that the cancer cells are breast cells, for example, and they think that must have been a breast tumor that initiated the spread. This is soooo complex. So many variables, so many ways in which cancer can be turned on... Years back, a colleague told me that cancer is a probabilistic phenomenon (there is a certain probability that any one cell will become cancerous, at a given time), and as such we will need a lot more math involved in preventing it from occuring. If we could figure out how to prevent a cell from becoming cancerous, even after onset in a certain tissue, then there would be no more mets. If we could figure out a vaccine to also prevent any onset, then it would be goodbye cancer. Forever.",

Not sure what documentation you would need, or if the mfg of your drug would do that. I recently looked into Zometa and Novartis does offer to cover it for those in need. I didn't go on with the research, but I made a mental note to go back if I ever need it. Best of luck, girl, hang in tight!",
