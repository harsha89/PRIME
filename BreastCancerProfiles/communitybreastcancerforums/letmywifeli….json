End of the day as long as you are clinically doing ok and she is there to take care of you, thats all that matters. One of the TM tests for my wife came back and its showing a downward trend. Waiting for 2 more. That gave us some relief. If scan this month end confirms stable disease / shrinkage, we have plans for stopping Halaven and reconsidering hormonals / targeted therapy at that time. I think in your case if you continue getting significant benefit from Halaven, you may want to look for some promising TNBC trial (there are many).",

So it is for MBC patients and can be considered after progression on 2nd line of treatment. I have heard that they have treated ER+ patients but best to reach out to them and find out. If you are interested best to reach out now since these trials often have a long wait list. Kaayborg - The trial looks promising. Fingers crossed.

Would you mind sharing what treatments you have been under so far and from when ? The functional testing is something done by an institution called Rational Therapeutics (https://www.rational-t.com), led by Dr. Nagourney. Its an interesting approach where they take a tissue sample from you and test it with different chemo agents to see which has the most effect. No genomics involved. However, there are some caveats in my mind. First, cancer treatment is very much dependent on the cancer cells response when inside a human body and not in a petri dish. Thats why clinical trials are so important where real patients are tested for response. Second, they need a large tissue sample, meaning sample collected using a CT guided needle biopsy may not be sufficient. Third, I am yet to meet an oncologist who has high confidence on this type of treatment. Fourth, it is possible that they give you a chemo drug thats not for BC at all but they give it because it worked on your tissue sample in a peri dish. So, you need to really weigh pros and cons and they are not really promising a cure, just longer OS. We decided not to go for it. Foundation 1 is genomics testing where they look for gene mutations for helping current or future clinical trials. It has mixed successes in my opinion but it is something that most oncologists will not mind arranging for you. Good to have it in you in my opinion. My wife will be doing it.  ",

So when you pick one option you will not pick the other. Although all MOs are professionals, they are also humans. It may hurt their ego a bit but they have plenty of other things to deal with in a day. The important thing for us is not to switch too frequently and build a trust relationship with someone. Also remember that most of us have good common sense and real life experiences about this disease but end of the day we rally do not have the needed medical knowledge. At some point we need to trust a medical professional and not take treatment decisions just based on our gut feeling. Otherwise we may just realize that no doctor is really taking care of us.

Initially a member of non-MBC boards and then around March 2016, joined bone mets thread. From then onwards nothing really worked for her for too long and mets spread from bones to liver to peritoneal and then to kidneys. Earlier this month she was diagnosed with Leptomeningeal metastasis. I am afraid this is the end of the road for her. We tried chemo which did not do anything. Now she is too sick to take any more treatment. Our family and the doctors took a decision jointly to stop all treatment and instead doncomfort care. My wife is barely conscious and unable to speak or recognize anybody. Throughout my stay here at the MBC board I have met one courageous lady after another. I have seen many succumb to their disease and many continue to fight on with new hope and optimism. My hats off to this unspoken legion of soldiers that deserve way more credit for their fight than what they get. I will continue to monitor this board and participate even after my wife passes. We have a 11 year old daughter. I want to do something about this dreaded disease. I want to see that fundamental research is done with cancer care for finding a cure. I find it a sorry state of affairs for drug companies to spend billions of dollars to come out with treatment that extend life for a few months, potentially bankrupt families payingfor it and when things fail, no one has any clues about why it failed. I strongly believe it is possible to find a cure and want to contribute in that effort. Humans have solved far more complex and abstract problems that defy common sense compared to a visible enemy like cancer. We just need the right focus and investment in the right areas.

I know how you feel tired and frustrated now. Such is the nature of the disease. It breaks down a human being slowly, a little bit at a time. However, you are trying novel treatments while you are clinically healthy. Have patience, it may benefit you in coming days. To Miaomix - Thanks for the phrase \"pseudo breakthrough\". Except the development of Herceptin and other HER2+ drugs, I think most other drugs for BC has been more or less pseudo breakthrough so far. Remember, Tamoxifen came out many decades ago, and is still the recommended first line of hormonal therapy. It works for some, does not work for others, and when it does not, no one has the slightest clue why it failed. Same story with all the new CDK4/6 inhibitor. It's anybody's guess, who will benefit from it and for how long. I do not have much against the oncologists since I believe they are heavily controlled by big pharma and insurance companies. It is really frustrating that so little effort is being made on researching fundamental nature of the disease called metastatic breast cancer. To Kaayborg - Sorry to hear that you are not in great spirits. Years of chemo is hard to tolerate. But at least you have a plan. To Louis - Thank you for being a friend and being with me at this time. To NouzayO - Thanks for your kind words and for support. To everyone else who expressed their sympathies and prayed for Ranjta - Thank you. I am always there for you. To All - It is often said that the word cancer fills one with terror. Surprisingly I did not feel a lot of terror for the last five years. However, I felt a profound sense of humility. I realized that it did not matter if I was a CEO of a corporation or King of a country, it did not matter if I was rich or poor, young or old. Cancer reduces a proud human being to an insignificant helpless individual in an instant. An individual waiting for his / her own demise or that of their loved ones. It destroys a family in an instant. The fight will go on much after Ranjita passes. The fight for cure must go on. It is not an impossible goal.",

She had bone mets which are still stable but developed 10+ spots in the liver (largest 1.5cm). Stanford - Start with Xeloda UCSF - Go for Solar 1 trial which is a randomized (1:1) trial of Alpelisib and Faslodex combination. Alpelisib is is a PI3 Kinase inhibitor. Of course she needs to have PI3KCA mutation for which we are pending test result. If she does not have the mutation, she will start with Xeloda. We are thinking going for the Solar 1 trial is a good option since if she starts Xeloda now, she will be excluded from this trial. Would love to get some feedback / suggestions.",

With metastatic disease, eventual progression is inevitable, but the key is to monitor how much damage the progression is really doing and switch treatment only when you have squeezed out the max amount of time from the current treatment. That lets you buy time to get the next great treatment in development right now. Also, maybe during the next scan you will see perfectly stable disease. Since Dani is getting pretty frequent scans, I would also agree that CA27.29 probably won't matter so much for her. Hoping that you find some promising trial that benefits from Dani's mutations.

She does not have any infection (WBC count is good) but fever has been spiking up to 101 - 102 degrees before Tylenol is bringing it down. She also has been experiencing chills and body ache. She took her last dose of Tylenol at around 12 midnight last night which again brought the temperature down. Since this morning, her chills are gone and no more hot flushes but very week on her feet (still can walk). Temperature has been mostly below 99 till afternoon but then slowly claimed to 100.4 - 100.7 by evening and stayed there. Chills are gone and she is not feeling too sick (except weakness). Anyone experienced something similar ? I am worried if this is a viral fever or cancer related.",

Like you, we also blindly believed in her MO back then. Not any more. Our MO did hear about Rational Therapeutics but said not many people use it. We take that comment with a grain of salt but the reason we paused with RT are different. First and foremost is that RT takes decisions based on how tissue samples respond to different chemos in petri dish testing. That is a very different thing than testing of tumor cells inside a human body. A lot of times, successful petri dish testing (or even animal model testing) do not translate into successful therapy for humans. The other reason was that they needed a large tissue sample preserved in nitrogen. Most hospitals use formaldehyde in the US and a large sample means an invasive surgery. With all that said, will we ever consider it if we start running out of options ? Possibly yes, but depends on how long the patient wants to keep up the fight.",

Also they are dealing with a disease that is highly unpredictable. So I sympathize with them as well when their predictions always do not come true. As far as clinical trials are concerned, they are also often limited by what trials their center offers. Saying all that, I felt that UCSF is taking the right approach but only future will tell what was right or wrong. As non-medical professionals all we can do is to apply common sense but some times the complexity of cancer treatment is way beyond common sense. Unfortunately I have no knowledge about B12 test as it was never ordered for my wife.",

Since its just 2 lesions that are causing problems and rest are stable, can we use something like radioembolization or cyberknife to take out those 2 buggers ?

The PET showed uptake on those two spots (not good) but no uptake on the 10 other spots (thats good). The TM (27.29) has ben falling all along. Stanford determined this is a progression and suggested switch from Xeloda to something else. We went to UCSF for a second opinion. They determined that for the spot that grew larger, there are enough inconsistencies in measurement between the latest CT and PET and the previous CT. For the new spot they said there is no way to tell if that was there earlier. So they determined that this can not be confirmed as a progression and suggested that she continues with Xeloda for now and do a tumor marker test in 4 weeks. We are in an interesting position right now but inclined to believe UCSF at this point and continue with Xeloda.",

She already did a liver biopsy back in February and does not want to do it again. There can be issues with repeated biopsies. So if all but one / two spots are behaving okay, local treatment can be an option. However, the problem is that her onc at UCSF isn't convinced that this is progression. She is suggesting tracking it for now by measuring her TM after two weeks. Lita - What were the inconsistencies about your scan ? Can you share some details ?

So if COH is conducting immune trials thats interesting. Not sure what is motivating them to do so.

Those are little risky in my opinion. Typically trial patients are very very closely monitored and it is always better to go for trials while the patient can still take it. The more the disease progresses, the less like it is to qualify for a trial (and some of them are very promising). Hence the theory in support of trials is that, use it even when there are standard therapies remaining.",

I have been thinking for the last couple of weeks about updating you all about how life has been treating me and my family recently but did not want to add to the sadness and hardship some of you have been going through. My wife Ranjita lost her battle with breast cancer earlier this April. Her disease was progressing in her liver and peritonial, but we were hoping that a different combination of chemo will help us bring her disease under control once again. Unfortunately she was diagnosed with widespread diffused leptomeningeal metastasis in March and there was nothing much that could be done from that point onwards. We tried a chemo but she was too week to take any more treatment. Her condition started to deteriorate rapidly and she passed away during first week of April. She left me with our beautiful 11yo daughter. Together we now start a new chapter in our life. My daughter today wrote a card for her mom on Mothers' day. I wish you all the best. I hope and pray for all of you all the time. But I am afraid thoughts and prayers won't be enough for some. I am hopeful though that medicine is progressing rapidly and I think that day is not far when \"Cancer will be known to our children only as a a constellation of stars in the night sky\" (taken from a quote made by one former US president). I plan to stay engaged in this forum.",

My wife's Stage 2B cancer metastasized to bones on 29th Feb this year. Since then she has been been sick with bone pain. Now the pain is much better (with 10 rounds of rads) but the rads to her pelvis is causing her to have pretty bad diarrhea. Hope that will resolve soon and its nothing else more ominous. My daughter is 9 yr old and has no clue. My heart breaks looking at her and she is super close to her mom. I can not imagine a world where she grows up without her mom. It will totally devastate her. What happens if something happens to me too. All these thoughts are driving me crazy with fear. I have faith in God but I do not know why good people are punished this way. My wife is 40 yrs old and will be starting with Ibrance + Letrozole hopefully any day now. Prayers for all of you brave ladies.",

Have you considered the TIL trial (Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes) ? More details at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01174121. It is a kind of immunotherapy and unlike CAR-T, it is being offered to ER+ BC patients. Of course it is not for the faint of hearts but since you are getting resistant to quite a few treatment options at this time, I believe it is worth checking out. The timing is also right since you are now between treatments, which is a criteria for getting into the trial. Wishing you the best.",
