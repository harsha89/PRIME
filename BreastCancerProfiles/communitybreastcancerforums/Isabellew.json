    "Content": "Isabellew wrote: My Mother recently had a mastectomy and reconstruction. Over Christmas she did very well and was in very good spirits. However, for the last few days she has been in a lot of pain (she has nerve damage in her arm) and her mood/morale has been very very low. I am very worried about her, I am just about to go back to uni but really want to do something/ help in any way possible. Does anyone have any advice? Log in to post a reply",
