I am also worried about lymphedema on the plane and due to the weather. Can a preventitive compression garment hurt if done thru a qualified therapist? I also have the chance to go to NYC in Sept and the fear of lympedema seems to be replacing my other BC fears as we roll along here!  I have had some slight swelling at times already.",
