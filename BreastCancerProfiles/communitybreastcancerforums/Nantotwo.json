Viv, whats going on with you?  What is your time line like?  Do you have a date for surgery yet?  My wait for radiation was horrendous, the only complaint I have so far for OHIP.  Hope you have a faster team!

My breast was swollen for weeks after the lumpectomy and I thought wow, it doesn't look too bad at all.  Then during radiation I had edema something wicked, the bad boob was even bigger than the good one! Now, at one year out there is a noticeable difference between the two but really no one notices except for me.  My nipple is slightly displaced downwards and that does bother me but my choice was saving the breast for now and a mastectomy if ever I have a recurrence. I have thought of plastic surgery but not until I'm clear for at least a few years. Nan",
