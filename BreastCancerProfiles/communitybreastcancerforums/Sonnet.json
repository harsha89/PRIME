You and I were diagnosed on the same day, so I thought I'd introduce myself since we'll probably be seeing each other on these boards alot!  I've had core needle biopsy but not excisional yet - apptmt with the BS isn'tuntil next Monday (12/13).  I have two IDC tumors on the left (1.0 and 1.8? Still working from imaging measurements) and an architectual distortion on the right - they did stereotactic needle biopsy there but when they checked the placement of the titanium clip afterward, they siad that they had apparently missed getting the spot they wanted to get.  So that biopsy was benign but the jury is still out - supposed to get MRI when I see BS. I COMPLETELY understand your diagnosis posting of \"so far I don't know more about it\" - AAAAUUUUGGGGHHHHH!! Knowing that it's malignant is one thing, but it's all those other factoids we don't have yet that are going to make so much difference in what this news really means. I agree about getting out and staying busy - the first time I had to go somewhere with alot of people (some of whom know what's going on), I just knew that I would lose it and have to run to the bathroom to cry.  OR that people would act weird.  But I got through it fine, and now it's easier.  I also work from home, and I have to say that I welceom the time alone, at least for now - I don't have to worry if the imagination monsters creep up on me and I have a short breakdown because I can just go ahead and do that, get it over with, and get back to work instead of worrying about freaking out my kids or whatever.  Anyway, just do your best - I've been sleeping pretty well (actually, kind of exhausted from the stress), but then tonight I woke up at 4:20 am and have been up ever since.  So maybe I should be saying, \"Do as I say, not as I do!\" Hope the rest of your weekend with DH and kids is wonderful.

A little history - my initial mammo showed two masses in my left breast and an architectural distortion in my right. Had ultrasound biopsy on the left and stereotactic on the right, but they missed hitting the right spot on the right, leaving the architectural distortion undiagnosed.  On the left I had IDC, one mass measuring 1.0 - 1.5 cm and the other 1.5 - 2.0 cm. So then I went and interviewed surgeons and took all my films to the facility I chose, and those radiologists did a second read of everything (mammo films, ultrasounds) and recommended more imaging for the right. So then I did an MRI, very extensive ultrasound (3 radiologists in the room, all taking turns and staring at the screen and saying things like, \"Hmmmm\" and \"It's very subtle\"), and then the next day an MRI biopsy.  The final result of this was a finding of extensive DCIS on the right plus 2 \"small foci\" of IDC. This came 6 days before my uni mastectomy was scheduled,so we changed to a bilateral.  It was a pretty short time to process this, but on the other hand I'm glad I could do it all at once. But then today I got the final path and it turns out that in the right breast, I had 2 IDC masses, one of them 3.0 cm and the other one 3.5 cm!!!  How is this possible?? I know that imaging isn't perfect and that in particular the measurements aren't always quite right (my left breast ended up being 1.0 and 3.0, which didn't make me happy, but at least it was in a similar ballpark).  But I am just blown away that even after MRI, these 3 and 3.5 cm masses were basically invisible. I find this really scary in terms of future cancer surveillance. Then here's the other thing.  My original left breast biopsy (November 29) came back with Ki-67 scores for the two masses of 1% and 12%.  Well, the final path report shows Ki-67 for the one that was 12% to be 32%!! I've done some reading about this today and it looks like maybe this numbver can vary somewhat depending on what day of my menstrual cycle it is - but this took me from \"low\" (or low \"intermediate,\" depending on whose scoring system you use) all the way to \"high.\"  Of course, I do have really good pieces of information.  As I previously reported, margins were clear and all nodes were clear.  But I can't help feeling shaken up and that somehow my prognosis now seems much worse.  I'm awaiting Oncotype results - up until now, my guess was that my number would fall in the intermediate group, but now I'm really worried about a high score.  Anybody have any perspective to offer?

Those results should come in only a few days before my appointment with the surgeon, so I guess I'll just wait and take those results with me to the surgeon.  BTW, I am 48 & pre-menopausal, and nowhere in the vicinity of small-breasted.  Thanks again.",

Everything I've read says that I'll see the surgeon, who will discuss with me the various possibilities of lumpectomy plus radation, mastectomy plus chemo and/or radiation, etc.  But what about the option of \"have chemo first to shrink tumors, then have surgery\"? Because I have two tumors, the radiologist plus my OB/Gyn (who did the screnning mammo) both say that the recommendaiton will probably be mastectomy, but then I hear about people with multiple tumors who do chemo first and then are OK for lumpectomy instead.  So should I try to get in to see an oncologist before I see the surgeon?  The surgeon I'm waiting to see is very, very good, but my concern is that as with all physicians, they tend to play toward their specialty (a surgeon thinks \"surgery,\" an oncologist thinks \"chemo,\" etc.).  Advice?  Thank you! Oh - P.S. - How long should I expect to wait to get the rest of the info from my biopsy, like hormone receptor status, HER2, etc.?  The radiologist (not much of a people person!) gave me the truly helpful answer of, \"Later.\" Sonnet Log in to post a reply",
