Thankfully, a friend who had been down this path passed me her 2 vests that she used...they are soft cotton, snap in front, are very roomy AND have inside pockets that hold the drains. THAT WAS THE BEST thing I received during my journey that I am BARELY beginning. I slept with the vests AND I showered with them on because that enabled me to hold on to the grab bar with one hand and soap myself with the other without having to worry about the darned drains. Do you have anything like these vests? I just now saw them in the ACS catalog. Anyway, if you would like to have them you are welcome to them, as my dear friend (member of this group too) wants them passed down. I washed them and wrapped them in soft pink tissue paper and put them in a little white box with a pink ribbon to pass them along to anyone who might need them.",

Went on 6 rounds of Carboplatin and I, too, wanted to quit at the 4th round, I just could not find it in me to do 2 more. My husband, family and friends talked me into it, they told me that I had already gone through the worst, why chicken out of the last 2? That I should think I was giving up 2 more months of my life in exchange for YEARS of life. And that just to do THE next one and I could stop there! Somehow, I found the courage to do No. 5...and OF COURSE once I recovered from THAT poison shot, there was just one left so I sucked it up, girl, and finished the stupid thing. I have never regretted it, Christine. I am now at almost 8 years in remission. From Stage 3-B ovarian cancer. Tell yourself it is just ONE more. If you are at all spiritual (I am, very) offere it as a sacrifice so that someone you love so much will NEVER get cancer. Please talk to your Dr. about your wish to stop treatments, they may give you better side-effect meds. Good wishes to you, sister. Ana Maria",

Have had only one fill, 3 -4 weeks ago. Will have the second next week. I am starting chemo tomorrow, so very anxious and worried about it. The TE's are murder. But as you said, what are we going to do? I tell myself that so many women have done it, so can I. Good luck to you.",

Cant imagine HOW skin will stretch to make me a bit bigger! Am still trying to learn my way on this site, as well as learn about implants, what to expect, exchange surgery, chemo, etc. I will start chemo this coming Thursday the 10th, Taxotere and Cytoxan. Best of luck to you!",
