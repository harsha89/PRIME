Also, I am, am not, triple negative. No one really seems to be able to tell me. My oncotype came back of triple neg. but then the oncotype people said that the path results are the \"gold standard\" on ER status. My MO has not said anything other than hormone therapy won't be of much help to me...and that she does not understand how they could even run the oncotype test as they are showing me ER-. But of course, we all know they say that the hospital path is what counts. so it goes... I've decided on chemo as with a score like that I don't want to take any chances. Having a second opinion with the hope I can make a switch to this MO. It is funny, but I happened to read some of the posts from some of you about the struggles you are having with your MO, and beleive it or not I felt better. It is good to know that I am not the only one with MO issues. Sorry we are all having such challenges with our health care professionals, but at least we know it is a professional issue and not our problem. Small but some comfort for this woman. Wishing you all a good pre-Thanksgiving day.  ",

Living in Canada it takes about 4-5 weeks to get results. I need to start rads in the next week for the rads to be effective. Tumour Board is not sure how much benefit I will get from chemo...they think about 4% with a relapse risk of 13%, so they are saying the decision on recommending chemo is \"a dilemma\".      My radiation oncologist is prepared to do the rads and then if the oncoptype comes back that I would benefit or need chemo to get a MO to do that for me. Wondering if anyone here has ever had a similar experience. Thanks all.  ",

My MO has my Oncotype results but I most likely will not get them for at least 6 more days when I have an appointment with her. I called my MO office twice about getting the results. She only has voice mail. Left messages for a call back about the results. They have not even bothered to let me know they got my messages. Only silence...Thoughts or suggestions on how to change are more than welcome.          ",

Given the strength of this cocktail, they put in a PIKK line. Well, now the decision is do I keep the PIKK for the taxotere or not. I'd like to get rid of it. One less reminder of all of this, but not sure if that is the smart thing to do. Anyone have any words of advise. Wishing you all the best for 2012.    ",

I am looking at 3 infusions of taxotere into the vein instead of the PIKK. Wondering if I am setting myself up for trouble or if it will be alright. The PIKK is annoying and keeps reminding me that I am a cancer patient. Also interferes with things like baths and showers. I'd love to ditch it if that is safe to do. I've been told that I have good veins. But then so were you. What to do? Any information would be so helpful. Thanks again ladies for you thoughts! ",
