I don't know anymore than that yet, but feel like my world has been blown out of the water. I have to go for chemo for 4 months then a full mastectomy and reconstruction at the end. I am meeting the oncologist tonight so hope to know more then. Not feeling strong right now and the next person who says try not to worry is going to get slapped! Everyone tells me I can beat this but right now I just want to go to bed and pull the covers over my head til it all goes away. I am hoping my inner strength will return when the shock wears off. To everyone keep strong and I will be looking out for your results next week dreidteacher. The waiting is a killer.",

It's kind of hard to get your mind on something else when you have this constant pain. I've been taking 600mg of Ibuprofen every four to six hours for months now for the pain and it seems as if it has just stopped working for me. My doctor offered me something stronger, but I declined b/c I hate pain meds. I'm now rethinking my decision on that. I'm at the point now where I wish if it is something to really be concerned with, that I would get another symptom so I would know for sure. That may sound really stupid, but this is driving me crazy-- literally. I am sleep deprived because of this pain.  I did get a call from the breast clinic, but it will take 30-90 days to get in. I just really needed to vent.",

I mean, did you go from being fine to having all of this at the same time beginning in August? I ask, because my dr said I'm being referred on an unconfirmed diagnosis of inflammatory breast disease, but from what I read, if it were that, I would have some serious stuff going on by now. Like the discharge, hot, red inflammation, ect. instead of the itchy spots and worsening pain. I just don't know what to think. I have a history with cancer, so naturally, my mind gets stuck there.",

I know it's not hormonal b/c I had a hysterectomy 8 yrs. ago and I have been off of hrt since April. So I guess its just wait and see. It sure is nice to have some people to talk to about this though. It definitely helps.",

She says it is not a cyst, could be a lymph node, fibroadenoma, or something else. Whatever it is, she showed me that it has blood flow to it. Anyway, she's going to recheck again in six months. I'm feeling exceptionally blessed right now.",
