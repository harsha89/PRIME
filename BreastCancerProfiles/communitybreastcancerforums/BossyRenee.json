The second treatment I did not receive the Emend and I was extremely nauseous by the next day. In fact, I had my treatment on the Tues. before Christmas and did not start feeling better until the Sunday after Christmas. Needless to say I'll be asking for the Emend when I return for treatmet #3.",

Tthe other two stayed in a total of 6 weeks. It was weird because I had one in each breast and one on each side of my abdomen. The first two that were removed were rt. breast and left abdomen. Opposite sides. So I'm not sure if there was just more fluid in those areas or the suction ob the bulbs were just no good. The bad thing about the drains staying in so long is that I think the tissue had started healing around them so when they were pulled out it felt like I was being ripped apart internally. Hopefully no one else has had to suffer this excrutiating occurrence.",
