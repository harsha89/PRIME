I had a biopsy yesterday after my mammo last week showed some suspicious calcifications. When my oncologist called me today with results of ADH and told me I should meet with a surgeon, I knew in my heart and my head that I should just have the masectomy so I won't have to go through this again. She did mentione that the ADH tended to be \"the tip of the iceberg\" and that there is likely some cancer hiding somewhere nearby. What do you think of this response? ",
