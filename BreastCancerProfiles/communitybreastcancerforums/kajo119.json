But I'm concerned about my breast being swollen and red around the nipple. The rad dr. put me on antibotics last week, concerned about mastitis, but it hasn't helped yet. I want to go through this with others too. We can all help each other. I'm all for the February Rad Team.!",

I have taken 2 so far, and I have to say I have not flashed today, I am sleepy but not sweating. So if anyone is having those covers on, covers off, all night long, ask about this. It just may be the thang. Where can you find the aleo gel w/o alcohol? Ive checked walmart and cvs. no luck. This is the only place that understands what we go thru. ",

Maybe I need a chiropractic adjustment.  I am red and itchy, using the aquaphor and aloe. Got a prescription for the itching, said to use it about once a week? because it will thin the skin. ok.  I am getting those prickly spots that hurt now when touched. Sorry this is so down, geez!",

I have to say that sometimes I wonder if I made the right decision, sometimes I feel that a cancer cell is lurking somewhere else in my body and I should have had the chemo. But the odds are very much favorable that that is not the case.  I would suggest, if you haven't already, go to a Breast cancer support group, I went Monday and found it very comforting and informative. Gentle Hugs & Prayers to you",
