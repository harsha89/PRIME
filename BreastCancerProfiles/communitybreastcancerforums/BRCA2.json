I can honestly say I have never regretted my decsion. I was up and walking two days later, home in four days, back to work in 4 weeks. The reason I don't regret it? When the pathologist was examining my breast tissue, he found DCIS. So, I like to say I was treated and cured before I was diagnosed! To anyone wondering if they should have the prophylactic surgeries, I will just say I went from being terrified at the prospect to looking back and realizing how gosh darn lucky I am. And I can honestly say, I did not suffer any real pain. Yes, some things were uncomfortable & scary, but thanks to the Mayo Clinic and wonderful drugs, it wasn't as bad as my tonsillectomy!  My advice to anyone facing this? Go to a well respected major medical center, with a team of doctors who have been doing this together for a long time. Make sure they have done hundreds of these. Ask to be connected to a woman they have operated on to \"mentor\" you. You will need a team: Gyn/onc, general surgeon, plastic surgeon, radiologist, geneticist, psychologist and internal med to coordinate. Mayo Clinic was fantastic. Of my seven team members, five were female.That really helped. And when this is all over I'm probably going to look better than I did before the surgeries. I can even joke about it now, and you'll be amazed at the support you will get from female friends, and you may be surprised to find out how many other women have been through this.",
