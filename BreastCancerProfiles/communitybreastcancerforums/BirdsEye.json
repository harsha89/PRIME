I learned today at a follow-up mammogram that I have microcalcifications in a small cluster in my left breast and there is an area that looks particularly suspicious. The radiologist referred me for a needle biopsy and that is scheduled for Thursday. This came about as such a shock that I didn't even ask any coherent questions, or if I did, I can barely recall them. On my appointment sheet, the line that is checked for my condition lists both B4 and B5, although I am assuming that with just the 2 mammograms and no biopsy yet that it would be a B4? Has anyone here had microcalcifications that did not require surgery or hormonal therapy but only follow-up? I don't even know why one area of the cluster looks suspicious and not the whole thing. Has anyone had a radiologist tell them that? I am so frustrated at myself for not asking more questions; I was just stunned silent. I am worried and I don't know what to think. It seems like microcalcifications are such a risk factor that there is a high likelihood of me needing at the very least a lumpectomy and maybe radiation to go along with it. I don't know my family history because I am adopted. I have scheduled genetic testing for Wednesday because I'd like to know if I carry the BRCA1 or 2 gene. If so, I would consider a mastectomy instead. This all only started a little over a week ago when I went for my first ever mammogram after my regular OB-GYN appointment, and now I find myself googling breast cancer types and stages, treatment options, and genetic testing. Thanks so much and sorry for the rambling! Log in to post a reply",
