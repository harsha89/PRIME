Anyway, he took them out even though I was still putting out 75 to 80 cc/day.  Now I have a suspected seroma ... which he probably drain tomorrow... so slow down as much as possible and hopefully you will be drain and seroma free soon!

Note that both of these remarks were made by well meaning male surgeons. I think that you should do whatever you feel most confident with.  No one can make this decison for you, and you are the one that must live with the decisiion - once made. Whatever you decide - the ladies of this board will offer support and encouragement.",
