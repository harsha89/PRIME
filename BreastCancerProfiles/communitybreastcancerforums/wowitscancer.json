    "Content": "wowitscancer wrote: I've been recently dx with IDC-  My breast are so small that I will have a masectomy since there won't be much left after the tumor is removed anyway.  My biggest decision is whether to go ahead and start chemo now or wait a few weeks for all of the test results and then schedule the surgery first.  Any thoughts? They tell me chemo is a must because of my age- 30.  There just seems to be so many side effects.  Why have some not done chemo?  Kristin Log in to post a reply",
