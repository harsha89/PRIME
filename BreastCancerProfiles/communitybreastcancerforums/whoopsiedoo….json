Tender, if I am scheduled for U of C after they have looked at the initial scans, will they direct me to a radiologist, or do I need to speak up?  Also, what is your thought on how the it feels smaller and less painful now?  (I had a flare-up of pain and swelling after picking my son up after he fell two days ago).  What are the symptoms of Lymphedema?  The Lymph therapist at my son's therapy office took a peek at my arm and said that the left side is definitely \"puffier\" than the right.  I never noticed.  We (hubby and I) measured and it was pretty consistently a quarter inch bigger all throughout my arm from shoulder to wrist.  Also, is there any probable connection for me to bring up regarding my...bum issues, and bleeding ulcer?  Could my lymph node swell from that? Just wondering what to ask the docs.  Still no answer on rotator cuff.  Doc wouldn't do anything on that because he \"wanted to take care of one thing at a time.\"  PS-Tender, in my perfect breastcancer world, I would want either you, a Tender clone, or a collection of the obviously medically inclined people on our site to be my doctor.  Let me just tell you about an angel I found.  I had found an angel at U of C the first day I went there in 05.  They were sitting next to me, and when they saw me crying, I have no idea what they had told me (I blocked a lot of memory from that day), but it was the most uplifting and wonderful thing I could have heard.  My best friend remembers my telling her about that story, but she, too, doesn't have a clue what the story was about.  That angel got me through that terrible first day of life with Cancer.  Now, let's fast-forward to today.  The assistant to the breast surgeon just called me and said that they weren't going to schedule me until they receive the reports and look over them.  I burst into tears,and she paused.  Very quietly and very gently, she said, \"I can meet you and get them from you tonight.\"  I wailed at that point.  \"ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?!?!?!!?  I LOVE YOU!\"  She made arrangements to meet with me in South Holland.  She will get the reports to the doctors tomorrow morning, and I will have an appointment scheduled.  She is my angel.  I am bringing her a present.  Seriously. ",

      "Content": "May 30, 2009 11:31AM whoopsiedoodles wrote: This is from a friend of mine who is a zookeeper.....I hope you like the story!  She mentions a book \"When Elephants Weep,\" if you are curious.... Hannah-how are you feeling?  Your Mama Elephants are here for you.  The authors of the book are Jeffrey Masson and Susan McCarthy. It's got quite a bit about elephants, but also about lots of other animals. I am not a wild elephant specialist by any means--actually I'm a giraffe and rhino person. :) So like I said, I probably know the same things you do about wild elephants--how they circle an injured or sick elephant and prop them up and protect them. I've seen some cool videos of elephant births in the wild, where all the females gather around the female in labor and touch her and shield her from any other animals. But other than that, I can't tell you much about wild elephants. When I started at the zoo I'm at now, though, we had two elephants, Lucy and Brittany. They were not a real good match--Lucy was wild-caught as a baby, and we only had an estimate on age--she was between 46 and 50. That's old for an African elephant, and she had really bad arthritis as well as suspected kidney problems and an unpredictable, troublesome digestive tract. Also, because she'd lived through the \"bad years\" of the zoo industry, she was nervous and moody around people she didn't know well, and was a bit senile besides. (During the 80s, it was commonly accepted that elephants should be beaten when they were \"bad\". This is NOT accepted any longer, and hasn't been for years, but Lucy had lived through a lot in her time. Just wanted to explain that--I am seriously shocked when I read some of the stuff about how elephants used to be trained. In the system I've been taught, we use a cooperation method of training in which treats are traded for behaviors. I can't imagine inflicting violence on any animal, much less one that could easily squash me.) Anyway, the other elephant, Brit, was 26, a roly poly \"retired\" circus elephant who was extremely outgoing and had no problem interacting with people. Brittany had come to live at the zoo when Lucy's former companion had died. Like I said, they were not a great match. Brit would try to play with Lucy and Lucy would just get scared and then they'd both be upset. Brit would steal Lucy's food. Brit would steal treats, she would steal toys, whatever she could get away with, because Lucy was so old and passive. And Brittany couldn't have many toys to begin with, because most toys scared Lucy too much. Anyway, Lucy's health wasn't good when I met her, and within a year she was going downhill fast. She fell in the yard one day and couldn't get up. Healthy elephants lay down and get up all the time, but old and/or sick elephants often don't have the muscle strength to heave their own weight back up if they lay down or fall. Anyway, Lucy fell in the yard. The keepers (I was off that day, so I only heard about this) spent over half an hour trying to get Brittany to come into the barn (usually a 30 second process) because Brit wouldn't leave Lucy. She was hovering over Lucy, touching her and trying to protect her, and Brittany's energy was sky-high hyper, just flapping her ears and waving her trunk and all riled up. Whenever the keepers would get Brit to even take a couple steps toward the barn, Lucy would move or groan and Brit would rush back over to her and stand over her and touch her with her trunk and flap her ears, all wild-eyed. Anyway, the keepers finally got Brit to go in the barn, and they picked Lucy back up with a crane. It was on the news and everything. Lucy never seemed to get completely over that, mentally or physically, and Brittany started being more careful around Lucy. She didn't steal food and always seemed to be watching Lucy. She didn't touch Lucy a lot during that time, but I wonder if that was because their relationship had never been super-solid in the first place, or if she knew Lucy was hurting. (Or both?) In any case, a couple months later Lucy fell again, in her stall. The decision was made to euthanize her--actually the decision had been made earlier that if she fell again, she would be euthanized, because nobody wanted to see her go through the agony of being hoisted up and forced to go on with all the health issues she had. Brittany was in another stall during the euthanasia, but after Lucy was gone Brittany was allowed to come in and be with the body. She stood over Lucy for a long time, but you could tell she knew Lucy was already dead. She would touch her gently with her trunk and then just stand there, kind of drooping, and then she'd touch her really gently again, like she was sniffing and petting her at the same time. Then she'd just stand there and stare at Lucy and her trunk and ears and whole posture just sagged. (This was the point at which every human in the room was crying, too--Brittany's posture was more expressive than anything anyone could have said.) Anyway we let her stay with Lucy as long as she wanted, which ended up being about 45 minutes. Then she wandered back into her own stall, and then we sent her out into the yard, since Lucy had to be necropsied in her stall and that would've been way too traumatic for Brittany to see or smell. Brit lived by herself for three months, and during those three months, she was the most needy animal I have ever met. She solicited attention CONSTANTLY from all of us, and threw tantrums randomly and swayed (a lot of elephants sway as a self-comforting gesture when they're bored or anxious) and was generally pathetically needy. I felt terrible for her, but I have to admit that after awhile she was getting on my nerves, too, which makes me feel bad to even admit, but oh well, it's true. In any case, after three months we found out we could get another elephant from a zoo in Texas. Her name is Ruth and her only companion had died a year or two before. Ruth is the same age as Brit and can play and interact with her on her own level. Ruthie and Brittany have been together now for two and a half years, and I have to tell you, even though I adored Lucy, it's so much fun to see the relationship between Brit and Ruth, because it's so much richer and I would think, more satisfying for Brit than what she and Lucy had. Brit and Ruth do almost everything together, and sometimes they bug eachother, and have their little tiffs, and then they're leaning on eachother and sharing food or playing in the mud together or whatever. It's really nice to see. But if Brit could protect and comfort and mourn like that for Lucy, who she didn't even get along with too well, what would she be like if anything happened to a companion that she loved? Anyway, that is my elephant story. Not sure if it's what you had in mind, but it's some of the most striking animal emotions I've ever witnessed.",

It is insane, not the same color, and certainly not the same texture.  I spent way too much money getting it straightened and was delighted with it for about a week.  Now I hate it again.  It's chemo hair, and it is like a scarlet letter emblazoned on my head!  Oh, you've all brought me back.  I salute you, my sisters!  Love and prayers, Deb",

(It dropped below 0 last night & was about 8 degrees at walk time (1:30pm).  Time to get out my winter boots & wear gloves.  I also got a copy of deb's blood work numbers.   She is due for a week off next week but I wanted to make sure things were not getting too low.  I have not kept up on these things as much as I probably should since when I scanned the numbers a curious number jumped out at me.  I never knew that they actually rated \"BUN\"(s?).  This begs the question. How do you improve your \"BUN\"(s?)/\"CREAT\"(ive?) ratio???????????  Is this a dance move?   Oh well, I'll just keep walking.......as Deb alway says, John's Ignorance is Bliss.    Also, Deb's appetite came back the last couple of days. She's been eating very well.   This afternoon, she had just finished her lunch. A sandwich, milk, her favorite chips, fresh veggies, and some orange slices....Well rounded I thought.  I then gave her some more chocolate milk & went into the other room to change the laundry.  I came back a minute later & she had one chipmunk cheek.  A week or so ago she was not swallowing without being told so I naturally told her to swallow.   She refused!  So I told her to open her mouth & there was the plastic lid to the milk jug. I paniced & got her to spit it out.  Naturally,  I gave her more to eat!   All in all though,  I think it's a great sign!  Blessings to all & Thanks again for the Prayers & Well Wishes! John        ",

Look, that man has no hair.  You used to not have hair!\"  The observations just keep coming.  My heart breaks when he asks about death and \"when\" I will have cancer again.  I had hoped I shielded him from the terror in my eyes, the worry in my voice.  Nope.  Our kids hear and absorb so much more than we could ever expect-at any age.  I know we all handle it differently.  I know some Mommies here choose to NOT tell their kids.  Others feel it is a necessity.  My feeling is that either way, they will know something isn't the same in their lives.  Now that you have hit this point, it will get easier.  Not EASY, but easier.  Now that you have told them, you can share this experience honestly.  Fitz (as always) really hit it on the head when she said that even under the circumstances they will still make you mad.  SO TRUE!  My son can make me insane, and I stop and remind myself that I need to soak in EVERY moment with my baby-even the crappy ones when he is screaming, crying, and yelling, \"You're a BAD Mommy\" (like today, when he didn't get to play for 5 more minutes as he had hoped).  It does get easier, honest.  We are all here for you along the way.  Love and prayers, Deb",

I know this is so scary and stressful for you.  Try to take a deep breath and slow down a bit.  Nancy gave a very nice answer-I'm just going to add a few of my thoughts..... The straightforward answer to your question is yes, the cancer tumor may be tiny, but still have been able to spread.  If you look at most of our \"tag lines,\" it will show our diagnosis.  Even almost three years later, I still marvel at how some of us have rather huge tumors, but are only classified at stage II (my diagnosis),and others have teensy tumors and are stage IV.  Cancer is so ruthless, it doesn't care how it affects each of us, and unfortunately, we are all different as a result.  I always would have preferred a straightforward answer like in the \"What to Expect When You Are Expecting\" books.  It could be \"What to expect with Cancer\" instead.  Ugh.  Of course, there is no way to know it until the docs step in and do a multitude of tests.  Nancy was right with the CT and PET scans as something that is done.  In addition, there can also be a chest x-ray (to check for lung mets), a bilateral breast MRI to see if the other breast is healthy, a bone scan if there is thought that mets are present in the bones.  You and your Mom will be dealing with test after test after test for a long time, and it will be hard.  However, these are the tests that monitor your Mom to be sure there were no stray cancer cells that broke free to travel elsewhere in your body.  Chemo isn't a walk in the park, but it isn't impossible.  Don't worry if she has to do chemo, because it isn't like they make it look in the movies.  Look at Robin Roberts, she worked through her chemo, like so many other women.  Radiation was better tolerated in my situation, but again, we are all different.  Hang in there, and please come here whenever you have a question or worry.  Chances are, someone here will have gone through something just like it and can help you out.  Love and prayers, Deb",
