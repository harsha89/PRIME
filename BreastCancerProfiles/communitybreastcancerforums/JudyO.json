I will be 5 years out next month and thought maybe he would change the schedule to 6 months. He said no I will continue on 4 month follow ups. I really don't see a need for such frequent follow ups. The nurse does a quick questionaire and take the vitals. He hasn't done blood work in about a year now, all he does is a quick examine of the breast area. He feels since I had so many lymph nodes positive (7) I am at a high risk and need to be watched closer than some. I wouldn't argue with that but don't feel his examines would find anything anyway. Just curious what the follow up is for some of you. ( I live in the USA) Log in to post a reply",

If you go under treatments and then under chemo research the latest article is about taxol. It talks about chemo not working for the different types of bc. It looks like it works best on the triple negs that are basal cell....doesn't work on luminal a (which are ER+) and also doesn't do anything for triple negs that are non basal. It does work on luminal b (which are ER+, the more aggressive of these)...Read the article, it gives some percentages. I had read about the ER+ also on the american cancer sight where they said they were looking into chemo for ER+ and also adjuvant on line has information that states there is some questions regarding this. The information on this sight about taxol was published recently. The Her+ info I can't remember where I read that but I did see that. I know I read it in more than one article. I think there has been a question about the a for some time. I see that many clinics are now doing TC instead of AC then T. If I think of where I read this I will get back to you. Bev...since you are grade 3 you might be a luminal b so taxol may work for you....that is where I think they will start screening the biology of the tumors more.",

He said if you had one side of the study with only a few her + and then the other side had a lot of the her + it could have totally negated the study. At least now they can separate this out but I am sure another thing will be discovered that will also make the stats off.....that is why we need to develop more towards individual biology. That would probably explain why a stage 1 will hit stage 4 and a bad stage 3 will never get there.",

I was surprised to see stage 2 has 70% and stage 1 has 90% for 8 years. People right away said this must be old data. I don't know if it is old data but I sure wish I knew where all of the different numbers come from. My onc gave me 50%, if you use adjuvant on line I get another number....then I ran cancer math got something else...and then I found a mayo clinic calculator and still another number. At least these last 3 were fairly similar. The biggest problem I had with these is the treatment. I had dose dense a/c and t but have now read that a/c works for herceptin positives not negatives which I am and that taxols don't work for most of the ER+, which I am. So does that mean I don't put them into the calculator and figure that they did nothing for me. I know many of the stats I read are from the late 1990s or early 2000s. Often they will tell you what time period. I also know some but not most don't do an age adjustment for mortality....most do though. The American Cancer Society does an age adjustment but doesn't go into stages...just regional...which is stage 2 and 3 combined. The 5 year survival is about 85% and the ten year is about 70%. Most dx are stage 2 so us stage 3 may be below this number. That stat just came out in the last month. It use data from 2000 to 2005. Only change from this would be more use of herceptin. That could bring the numbers up a couple of points but not many since under 25% are her + and if 70% of the 25% has an increase in survival of 50% it would only bring this number up less than 4% to maybe 74%. My onc nurse said they were using herceptin in so many clinical trials before 2005 that most people had it long before it was approved in 2005. So far no one has said the AIs impact survival just recurrence. The 8 year figures on arimidex does not show less deaths. I know zometa is hot but other than the one Australian study no survival stat has been given for this. Another sight I reviewed is the cancer survival by stage in uk breast cancer. They just updated this last fall and added 2% to the survival rates. Their data is from 2005.....and from what I see not much has increased since then. Another problem with the stats is that they changed the staging criteria during the time some of this data was collected. They took out the better prognosis and put it into stage 2 so that stage may have a better stat than what is shown. My onc said that lymph nodes is the biggest factor in survival. That is what the new staging is trying to address. I think the biggest problem is no one has a handle on the stats. You would think with data collection and current computers they would be able to get better stats but from what I see this isn't the case. I look at my stats and get sad ...but I also pray and cross my fingers I will have some time so maybe something will come out to help me when I need it.

If 50% get mets why is the current survival rate for breast cancer at 90% for 5 years, 82% for 10 years and 75% for 15 years. These are the current stats from the American Cancer Society and it also states not to look at the figures that are years out because they do not reflect current treatments. If 50% get mets you would think at least by year 15 the stat would have a survival of only 50%. Also I can't understand if 50% get mets what are the figures we get from adjuvant online, they are usually much better than 50%.",

I think as well as finding a cure they need to find a way to tell people if/when they are cured. Most stage 1 are cured, many stage 2 are cured and a lot of stage 3 are cured. Often the surgery is the cure. But right now they can't tell who is \"cured\" so they push treatments on everyone. At least at stage 1 and 2 the onco test is starting to give them an idea of their status. But us stage 3 women are always in limbo. I also think they need to develop something that better tells us at what year we can breathe a little easier. A recent study out of MD Anderson had the stage 1, 2, and 3 recurrences about the same in the 5 to 10 year period. They said the bad stage 3 women occur in the first 5 years. The biggest recurrence in the 5 to 10 year period was stage 3 grade 1 tumors. That made sense to me since grade 1 tumors are slow growers and probably take longer to present as stage 4. The grade 3 fast growers no matter what stage will go to stage 4 quicker usually.",

I wasn't about to get into adjuvant online since I am not a doctor but found a research site on the internet that is open to anyone. It is being developed at Harvard. It lets you put in your statistics and gives you the outcome depending on the treatment you select. Thnigs that affect your outcome...age ( younger people respond better to chemo), size of tumor (you enter each mm), number of positive lymph nodes, ER, PR and HER status (interesting that ER/PR have a better prognosis but they do not respond to chemo as well), type (lobular is a little better than ductal!) and grade. You can enter the different treatments and see you outcome. This site is researching the use of math statistics and is different from adjuvant online which is more based on actual case numbers. I found it very interesting. If you do a google search for breast cancer mortality or for breast cancer life math you should find this sight.",

I think part of the down feeling right now is do to the fact that I am going to have the other breast removed. I am happy they are doing it but it does bring back the memories. I also got an invitation to my class reunion. We all like to go to those looking our best. All I thought of was my 2 missing \"boobs\" and the little gray fuzz I have that replaced my hair. I get mad at myself for being so vain. During my chemo I got 2 surprise letters from grade school friends I hadn't seen in probably 30 years. That had heard about me from my father.

This week it will be one year for me. The last couple of months I had a scare that turned out okay but it has caused me to have my other breast removed next week.

I never missed a mamo or any physical and I ended up stage 3. I cry every day over this...the why me? is so great sometimes. The unknown we all face is so scary. I hope they find a better way to find this monster. I hope that they find better tools to let us know what treatment will work best for us and what our survival statistic really is. And I hope and pray hard for a cure. I am very thankful for one year and hope for many more.
