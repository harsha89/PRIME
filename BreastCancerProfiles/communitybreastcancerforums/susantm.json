It is usually two hours before I have treatment, and it hasn't been a problem. Then I put it on right after treatment and again before bed. (and a midday application on weekends) They said 2-3 times a day is good. I have had very few problems so far, and I have had 23 treatments so far.",

It does help to have the whole schedule ahead of time. I finished the regular whole breast rads today, and now have 7 boosts to do. So far I feel very fortunate. My breast is pink all over, reddish in places, and starting to turn to tan in the red areas. However, I have had no fatigue so far and only occasional minor discomfort. I did switch this week to wearing the camisole I got before surgery in case of drains. (I didn't have any.) It is more comfortable, being looser than the bra. Also it offers another layer to keep my midsection warm in cold weather--a little side benefit. I am getting where I can see the light at the end of the tunnel, and it's NOT a freight train--might be the tammy train, however. (Tamoxifen; from another thread, for the uninitiated...)",

Everyone is different, and I think different creams may work better for different people, so you may just have to pick one that sounds good to you and see how it goes.

Oh, and I had to be careful of lifting the first few days.) I found my sentinel node site was more uncomfortable than the main incision, probably because it gets stretched more as I do things. However, once the steristrip came off, it was much better. It did remain numb in that area for quite some time. However, last night--6 weeks post lumpectomy--I noticed the site was aching just a bit, and I realized that the numbness was gone. Apparently the nerves are repairing themselves! so a bit of discomfort is probably a good sign, in this case. Hope your recovery goes well! Hugs to everyone else, too!

This is getting to be the first site I visit when I go online, so it must be addicting! I've also had a lumpectomy, although I have ILC, rather than IDC. (stats below) I start 33 sessions of radiation on Monday. It's a one hour ride on light rail to the radiation center, so I plan to get a lot of reading done in the next few weeks. I will also likely have hormone therapy afterwards. I am also beginning to discover that nothing ever goes quite like planned, so I am fighting the disease as best I can and waiting to see what comes next. I plan to do most of my shopping online this year--already have what I need for husband, so I'm making a good start. Blessings to all!",

My oncotype score came back 22, which is in that \"gray middle area.\" The doctor left it up to me whether or not to do chemo, regardless of what the score was. I had decided ahead of time that I would only consider chemo if my score was in the high area where they knew chemo would help the odds. If they don't even know for sure that it will help, I couldn't see a point in going through all that.",

That's what my health plan recommends after age 50 or 55--can't remember which, rather than a colonoscopy. It wasn't a big deal. The worst part was the enema I had to use ahead of time. The procedure itself was quick and pretty much painless. I was totally clean, so that gave me one less thing to worry about.",
