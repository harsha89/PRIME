She was so kind to me while I was waiting to find out if I had mets or just a severely collasped T-12. She helped me try to recover without surgery which I did. I was not a good candidate for the surgery so so glad I had her help sorting out what would help such as using a back brace, having good pain control and just waiting it out. Knowing it was possible to heal helped me deal with it all. Condolences to her family on their loss. Kathleen",
