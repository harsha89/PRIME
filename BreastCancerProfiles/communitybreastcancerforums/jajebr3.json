Now on to my pressing question, I was really excited, so to speak, about going out and buying a few wigs and had a ball doing it, this was with my hair in place and they seemed comfortable enough.  Now it sounds like maybe I jumped the gun about comfort, in looking at them I think I might be miserable. Is there anything you can were under them that makes them more comfy.  I am taking my younger son to get his hair cut this morning (which he can not stand) and am considering shaving mine while we are at the barber shop so the adjustment to mom having no hair may be easier on him and maybe he will think getting a hair cut is not so bad.  Good Idea or not divas, any suggestions are welcome.  Just plenty confused right now over the whole thing. ",

Cinda, I am so sorry to hear of you and your families loss. I wish I could come up with some words of encouragement, just know my thoughts and prays are with you. And while I was in the hospital my hats from cjhats came and she sent along a very nice note,  in a wierd way I am excited to be able to wear them cause the look so comfy but am not looking forward to why I will be wearing them. To all of you have a very Happy New Year, I can say that me and my 3 yr old will not make it till that time. A cup of juice, a good book, and the insides of my eyelids are what are instore for us.  Cebula before I go, decadron is an anti nausea drug that is givin with chemo, I believe it stays in your system for two days to help fight it off, it can also be used for allergic reactions in some cases.",
