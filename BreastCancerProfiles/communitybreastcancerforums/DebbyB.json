Thank you all for the kind words and just being here.",

Even though I've read so many posts about others journey through this (which has really helped me), I don't know what I am going to face.  I've got my book, my ipod and journal ready to go with me tomorrow for the 5 hours I'm told I'll be there.  I pray every night that God will be right there helping me as well as everyone that's going through this.  I know that something positive has to come from all of this, I just don't know what it is yet.   I'm so glad there is a forum such as this that we can all connect, vent, talk, pray, whatever each other needs to help get through this. ",

Because I called the insurance company so many times to find out what was going on, the ladies in that office all knew me and were very helpful to me in explaining their process and what was being done.  They appreciated the fact that I was nice and respectful to them and understood the stress that waiting was putting on me, so they actually did more than was required of them, which I believe got things approved quickly.  In our situation the last thing any of us wants to deal with is insurance problems!  Good Luck and I hope that all is approved very quickly for you!",
