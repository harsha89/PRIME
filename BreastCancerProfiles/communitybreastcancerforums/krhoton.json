My surgeon says he has never heard of anyone itching after a mastectomy, but obviously he is wrong! Nothing seems to help. One night I was so miserable that I put Hot and Icy on them. It helped a tiny bit just to have that area burn instead of itch. My surgeon tried Botox injections around the implants to help relieve the itching, but it didn't work. He said that burn victims have a lot of itching and Botox injections help with that. I also itch at night. They don't seem to bother me much during the day, but at night it drives me crazy, especially between my breast. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",
