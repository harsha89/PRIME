I still actually have stubble and have just 2 more treatments to go so I am wondering if I will ever be bald all the way (I am 90% bald dont get me wrong :) ) I have a very very young daughter who really hasn't een affected by my crazy hair changes....I say do whatever is going to be easiest for you.
