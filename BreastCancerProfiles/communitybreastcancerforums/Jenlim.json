Does that mean they found something? I am a wreck right now worrying about it. Any ideas from anyone would be greatly appreciated.",

      "Content": "Feb 12, 2016 11:04PM - edited Feb 12, 2016 11:05PM by Jenlim Thanks a bunch for clarifying about the reports and it does sound like both of you are correct and thorough as to how many reports I should be getting. I actually called the radiology clinic where I got my biopsy done and talked to the receptionist there and she did tell me that what my doctor's receptionist was telling me was the \"procedure report\" outlining what was being done to me during the core biopsy...ie. what tissues were taken, what was sent to the lab, etc. Every patient gets that report sent to their doctors and that IS separate from the \"Pathology report\" which is the one I'm anxiously waiting for right now. I'm glad I got that clarified by the both of you and the radiology department....so a little sigh of relief...for now...before my next doctor's appointment where they will go over my results....at least I don't have to keep thinking about it and have it go over and over in my head this weekend.",

      "Content": "Jenlim wrote: I am new to this discussion board and have just joined this forum. I am currently waiting for my core needle biopsy results. A little about my history. I am 39 yrs old and I was having some pain on my left breast so i went to my doctor and she scheduled me for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. The mammogram was negative but the ultrasound showed a complex cyst that has internal echoes and debris in it and so I needed to do a core needle biopsy. While doing the biopsy, my radiologist did reassured me that it looks benign and shouldn't worry and they usually could tell if it was cancer and she said she'll be shocked if it was cancer. While taking out about 3 tissue samples, she said she'll stop and said it collapsed. I was just wondering what that means? If it's truly cystic and if there's a high chance it is benign? I've done the biopsy on Friday, Feb. 5th and the tech said it will take 7 to 10 days for results usually sooner. Ive made an app for next thursday to see her which is more than 7 business days but was wondering how soon can they get the results if it was malignant. Should i call my doctor to see if is there yet? Just wondering if anyone out there know the usual wait time for pathology because during the meantime, I am a wreck worrying about it.
