I know all will be okay, I jsut can't get those thoughts out of my thought process.  I think I have everything ready, well, as ready as it can be.  I still have lots of fear, I know I am going to be a basket case the morning of but I will do my very best to be strong and hold it together. ",

I have a strong family hx of BC so for me I chose to have bilateral mx.  I had DCIS in left breast with questionable areas in right breast.  It was a very early dx.  I did not want to have to go through all of this again in 5 years, 10 years etc.  And... there was no way of telling how long it had been there already.  At time of surgery, my BS did find a very small amount of invasive cancer in my left breast... very very small but it was there, so I am glad I made the decision I did.  I am now in reconstruction phase, I have TE in and my exchange surgery is scheduled for May 18th.  I am counting the days.  You just have to make the best decision that fits you.  Hugs to you.",
