Then July 2017 found out it was in a cluster of mediastinum nodes (subcarinal, under my trachea) and hilar nodes. MO also wondered if they were a lymphoma. bronchoscopy confirmed ER+ HER2- same as before. I had both areas radiated in Sept and they are back to normal size. On Ibrance and Letrozole since Oct. Lung mets stable after 3 months. Starting cycle 8 next week",

I was dx lung and mediastinum mets in July on my 34th bday, 5.5 years out from stage IIb :( Stopped hormone therapy to become pregnant. Sadly CT showed the crap in my chest. I started out with one single 1.5cm lung met and subcarinal and hilar lymph nodes. But two months later while waiting for my ovaries to shut down before starting Letrozole and Ibrance both lungs had tiny micro nodules starting. I ended up having rads to the lymph nodes at the time cause they were impeding my air way. The lung nodules were not radiated. I have had nerve like pain and chest heaviness periodically since DX. When my counts are really low on Ibrance I notice it is more frequently. No way to know if our pains are the same of course, but I think mine have improved since I started Ibrance. I'm on my last week of cycle 3. What cycle are you on? Have you had a scan since starting? I will be having my first CT since mid September at the end of the month. Hopeful but also pretty flippin' anxious.",

I definitely was feeling better the last month on ibrance. I had a feeling things were working for me. I'm really hoping others with lung mets are doing well. Sometimes I worry that there aren't as many people who post how they're doing with lung mets. I like to think they're all stable or NED and living life, not hanging out here. Hehe. This tread isn't as active but wanted to cross-post my good CT results from this week... As shared on the Ibrance thread... Very relieved to share that I received good news CT results yesterday! After 3 cycles of Ibrance, 4 months on Letrozole and 10 radiation treatments to lymphnodes : - mediastinal and hilar nodes have resolved (thank you radiation!) - main lung nodule went from 18x18mm in September to 10x15mm now. - several 4-5mm nodules in lungs are now 2-4mm. - several 2-4mm nodules are gone / resolved. - no other malignancies anywhere else The word stable was used in the report. And others have shared they think it's better than stable which I'll go with! Grateful for this space to share and feel hope each day. ",
