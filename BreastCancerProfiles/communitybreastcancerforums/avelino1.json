I am negative for the estrogen and progesterone receptors; need lab results back on the 3rd test yet but the doctor is pretty certain it will be negative also. 1 lump is 2cm; other lump is about 1cm. He says he is about 70%/30% on chemo and double mastectomy for the treatment plan. I meet with the surgeon on Wednesday and really have no idea what kinds of questions to ask him!! Any guidance you could provide in this area would be most helpful. I'm heavily leaning toward no reconstruction. I'm 49 and have no children. Other than trying to wrap my mind around not having my breasts, I think I'm ok with no reconstruction. Appreciate your insights. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
