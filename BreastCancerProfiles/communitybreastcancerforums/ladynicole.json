I'm absolutely dreading this myself but hearing your recent experience I\"m a little more settled. I go in Sunday afternoon for my injection then surgery first thing 7am Monday morning. I'm first cab off the rank due to a latex allergy. Yay me. Slightly nervous, more for the SNB shot than the actual surgery. Thinking of you all. xxx",

I'm lucky in that I'm not nervous at all about the surgery, all I wanted to know was when he wanted to do the surgery and how soon would I be able to get back to work (photographer). :)  Hubby has organised to work from home for a couple of weeks to help me do whatever I need help with when I come home which is a real blessing. Not knowing how much pain will come after the surgery is the only thing that gives me slight worry. With multiple surgeries under my belt for other problems and currently sporting pars fractures on my spine which is compressing my sciatic I think pain has become a life long friend.  I'm not choosing reconstruction at this point so I hope it all goes well and recovery is quick.  ",

Unfortunately I've picked up a virus during my overnight hospital stay. I'm sneezing and coughing like an old steam train. Gosh the coughing hurts the surgery scar. My only pain that makes my eyes water is the damn sinus headache. Strangely the surgery site still doesn't cause me grief. I have a bit of muscle soreness, it feels like I've gone to the gym and done 100 push ups and pull ups. ROM is pretty damn good, even Doc is surprised at how far I can move my arms in all directions. Strangely enough too my SNB side is less tight than the other side. All in all I'm feeling great. Doped up on panadol for the virus but no other drugs.",

Surgeon got my SNB done through my mastectomy scar so it's not my scar hurting. I asked Hubby to have a look yesterday and he can't see a rash, Doc can't see one either, but it feels like gravel rash! Annoying me a bit. I've been advised to start moisturising the area's above and below my scar to see if it's dry skin causing the irritation.",

Today's my 41st birthday. :) I'm just starting to get that tight feeling back across my chest and in my arms. My right side is still a lot more swollen than my left, funny because the SNB was done on the left side so I figured that would cause me more grief. It's just tight and swollen above and below the incision just in front of my armpit. I do notice now after my BMX that arm movements in an upward direction actually pulls on the lower rib cage, I never noticed that when I had boobs. :O Otherwise I'm absolutely fine. Now sleeping a little on my side so not just my back (my bum is thanking me for this one). Still napping during the day for 2-4 hours. I worked all day Sunday photographing and lifting that 6.5kg camera up and down several thousand times. Thankfully my body tolerated it though I slept like the proverbial dead that night. Goodluck ladies with your upcoming surgery dates. <3",

Left drain came out swiftly and I didn't even notice it was done. Right drain was a whole other story. Felt like massive rope burn the whole way out. All 6 damn inches of it. I think maybe that side was very dry as it was only putting out 5ml of fluid prior to coming out. The left side was still producing 15ml of fluid. Tomorrow I see the surgeon for final pathology results. I feel good! A little tightness under the arms but otherwise amazing. We can't post photo's here but if anyone is wondering what I look like if you pop over to my Facebook page niclockyer there are recent public updates of my progress with photos in the comments. For those that look, yes I have a huge scar, but I did ask for no left over flaps or lumps of skin after surgery as I will not be doing reconstruction. Surgeon didn't let me down on that one. I think it's going to look amazing when the scars fade. x",
