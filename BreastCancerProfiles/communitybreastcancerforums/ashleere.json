I did go for my simulation and am scheduled for a \"dry run\" on 9/7.  I am so sick of dr's. and people treating me like I am dying, which I am NOT. I have always been a care giver, dealing withthis disease for 20 + years with various family members, so being a patient really Sucks for me. I don't want to be touched anymore, I feel like my life belongs to my dr's not me.   I will go because I know its the best thing and I will keep positive thoughts. Hang in there and if you want to PM me I am here. Good luck. Clelia",

I have a 2\" incision on the side of my breast and sometimes if I wear the wrong bra it is still painfull. Hope you start to feel better soon.",
