He said dog ears were from the fat on my sides and back and said \"I'm not going to go around your back!\" And yes, now I have dog ears even though my chest is relatively flat. ☹️ So at some later date I'll have to see a plastic surgeon about them, hopefully they can be fixed in the office. I am 3.5 months post-op.",
