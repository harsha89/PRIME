Luckily, the people I work with are great and I love what I do. Unfortunately, my husband has been laid off for quite a while, so I had to keep working. Honestly though, I think I would have much rather taken more time off to recover and sleep. I would work my hours, come home, and play zombie until bedtime. It does get better. I'm still recovering, but I do have some days where I feel normal. It's slow going though. I still can't help but think that I would be further along in my physical recovery if I had just stayed at home...",

      "Content": "PhunkyM wrote: For the past 4 weeks, I've noticed a lump in my left breast. Didn't hurt, but didn't go away. I've been incredibly exhausted and terrible headaches have made a permanent home in my skull. Finally, I made an appointment with my OBGYN to check out the lump. So on Wednesday, 9/28, he examined me, said he didn't think there was a problem, but referred me to a radiologist that specifically works with breast care. On Friday, 9/30, I left work to go get a diagnostic mammogram. My mother was diagnosed with BC at about 40. I am 35. I had the mammogram done by a very gentle, knowledgeable tech. As she finished up, she said to wait for the next person who would perform an ultrasound. Ultrasound? I didn't know that was even part of the deal! Another very gentle, very kind woman led me into the ultrasound room. It was dark, warm, and very relaxing music was playing. She began the ultrasound examination and I could see her begin to get a lot more serious. At one point, she left the room and came back with the official doctor. This lady was very kind too, but looked me in the eye and said that she was very concerned. She went on to say that they would work me in for a biopsy right after lunch. She rubbed my leg, held my hand, and again mentioned her concern. When the biopsy began, she told the ultrasound lady that she was going to biopsy the \"other mass\" first, since it was hard to get to. Other mass? What other mass? She examined that there was a larger mass behind the nipple, but that she could get to it and the palpable mass with one incision. they gave me the numbing shot and began the biopsy. I was really holding it together at this point, but suddenly, one of the samples (the loud, gunshot thing) turned into a \"pain grenade\". It hurt and kind of burned and then began to throb relentlessly. That's when the tears began to flow. The doctor said that she was so sorry and asked if I had anybody with me. I said that I was alone and then I said, \"I've really been a big kid up to this point, right?\" She was still so kind, actually rubbed my head and acknowledged that it wasn't just the pain, but that it was the gravity of the situation. When it was over, she said that she would push my test through and hopefully have something by Monday morning. She held my hand again and said that she believed in being honest with people and that she needed me to know that she wasn't feeling positive about this. I guess I'm kind of lucky since I don't really have that long to wait, but it's so hard to wait. I'm also undecided on whether I should go to work tomorrow. My first instinct is to stay home since I am an emotional wreck. On the other hand, maybe doing something normal would help. My dad passed away in February and up to this point, I would consider that the hardest thing I've ever experienced. But this is different. Scary, depressing, and that incision area hurts. The good news is that writing is very cathartic. That's for the venting space. :) Cancerpurse.wordpress.com Dx 10/3/2011, IDC, 1cm, Stage I, Grade 3, 0/4 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 11/2/2011 Lymph node removal: Left, Underarm/Axillary; Mastectomy: Left, Right Chemotherapy 12/26/2011 Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), Taxotere (docetaxel) Radiation Therapy 3/14/2012 Breast Hormonal Therapy 6/21/2012 Log in to post a reply",
