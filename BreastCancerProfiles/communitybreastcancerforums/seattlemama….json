All I am saying is, I don't like the \"touchy\"\"feely\" diagnosing - I want to see and want the docs to see what is going on instead of presuming anything.  BTW, both initial and the other new mass were very fast growing.  I had symptoms from the first, 3 weeks before I went in.  The new mass, after remaining stable/unchanged from 3 chemo treatments, blossomed after the 4th - took about 2 weeks to reach 9cm. Wishing you all the best :)",

I ended up having to \"order\" my own ultrasound to compare how the neoadjuvent chemo was working.  Noone else seemed to think I needed it. I did have the ultrasound, 4 out of 6 cycles in, and the initial tumor and involved nodes had shrunk in HALF! That was nice to see and know. I had a new mass blossom and that is why neoadj chemo was stopped and surgery moved up.",
