I have lived my life eliminating stress, never getting caught up in others drama (well after I learned better) the person people could count on and never ever complaining. Since being diagnosed with BC in April my life is drama, stress and if I don't complain I just end up with bigger problems. I thought I could deal with anything on my own, but LE has changed me. I'm still avoiding getting measured for the custom sleeve because I don't want to deal with the rudeness I dealt with before. I know I'm messing up but I'm really tired of this sh*t . I hate the fact that my family and friends keep asking, \"how are you\". The answer has always been \"I'm fine\" until yesterday when the answer became \" I'M F*CKING FINE AND DON'T EVER ASK ME AGAIN\". I was so surprised at the volume and intensity of my own voice that I just started laughing luckily my sister, who was the recipient of my response, started laughing too. At least we can still drink. We can still drink, right?",

Thank you for your response, it really helped me figure out what was really bothering me! I have progressed, I'm past the suicidal feelings but not with the help of my Doc or her staff. I really lucked out, My Lymphedema Physical Therapist also has lymphedema. I can't tell you how much that has helped me. Being able to ask questions and get real answers instead of overly optimistic platitudes is very calming. Everyone should have someone who has the condition to talk to, to look at, and to get honest answers from. I now know that if I do the things I'm told to do, the way I'm told to do them, I will eventually get some if not most of who I am back. Now, if I could just become one of those people that does what they are told, when they are told, I'll nail this. Thanks again",

Useless for someone with LE in the breast, I can't even figure out what it's for. The only place it was compressing was the bottom band and it actually hurt. I bounced with every movement.

You didn't mention if you have swelling, but, A properly fitted sleeve should actually relieve discomfort from swelling not cause it. My experience with sleeves: took 3 tries to get it right, and when it was right (a custom sleeve) I only felt slight discomfort. As soon as I was using the arm while driving that discomfort went away. I am not an expert but if it hurts it's not right and you shouldn't wear it until you meet with your fitter or your LEPT. It wasn't until I asked the right question that I found out that my sleeve was to short. My first one had no compression on my wrist where it should have been tighter and was squeezing my upper arm. I had to learn to advocate for myself and trust myself enough to say \"this isn't right\". When I put the 3rd sleeve on I knew it was right, it's really hard to put that into words that will help you figure this out, but, I just knew sorta like Goldilocks and those beds. Many of the woman on the board had similar experiences, several sleeves to get it right, and it sucks I have breast, truncal and upper arm LE. I only wear my sleeve when I'm going to drive over 20 miles, the grogery because I seem to forget and use the wrong arm to pick things up, gardening and any other heavy work. After driving more than 150 miles I wear a night sleeve. If you have swelling in your hand and arm you may need to wear it and the glove all day. Your LEPT should help you figure that out. The beginning of dealing with LE is the hard part, it does, eventually, get easier.",

MY cat accidentally got her claw stuck in my finger on my side effected by LE.  I had to rip my hand away because she was starting to freak out and I thought the damage was going to much be worse if I didn't.  I yelled at her, I've never done that before, I felt awful, and she slept on the chair instead of right beside me last night.  I usually get her claws trimmed but had put it off. I have washed with dial soap at least 6 times since late last night. I've emptied a tube of Neosporin, and gone through half a box of bandaides.  I am completely over the top freaked out, I'm thinking the Flair is coming and when will I see it.   Honestly I thought I felt it happening earlier and it was an ant crawling on my arm, which then sent me over the top thinking about all of the biting bugs I was exposing myself to sitting outside. So now I'm inside and going to wash my hands again.  After that a drink!  because there is nothing I can do to fix this today, and the likelihood that it's ok can't seem to settle in my brain. I imagine that all those diagnosed with LE and  have become informed about our condition have these moments just like you and me. Maybe this is one the conditions that Medical Pot should be available for.  I'd still be washing my hands and you would still be looking in the mirror but we would be laughing about it.  And we all know that laughter is the best medicine of all.",

That's frustrating, there are people on these boards saying that they have had good luck with a variety of makers. I haven't really started to swell yet I have truncal LE that is more than likely moving to my arm. I see a difference in one finger now and then. My arm is still slightly sore and my thumb is a little tingly, I'm afraid wearing that sleeve for 2 hours has hastened something that could have taken months or even never occurred. I've been waiting for my LE PT to call, but it's looking like Monday now. LE is constant frustration, shopping, frustration. @crystalphm, in one of these threads, and it could be further back on this one, someone mentioned a manufacturer that made a lined sleeve to help with skin irritation. You might want to look back on this one because the person said it worked. As soon as I think I've gotten to a point where I know what I'm doing about LE something else happens and poof, I'm starting all over again.",

I agree, totally this should not be an acceptable side effect. I can tell you that you are not alone, the shock of LE after being told it wouldn't happen blew me away. I am still pi$$ed at the Nurse practitioners that told me it wouldn't be a problem, because they had no right deciding that I didn't deserve to know the truth. It can happen to anyone, and there isn't any data known that can predict who that anyone will be. If you have googled images of LE you have seen photo's of the very worst cases. Cases that went untreated for years. Those images are not you. You've been diagnosed and will learn how to deal with LE. After 18 months I have no noticeable signs of LE. I do everything I'm told to do, I have become very aware of my body and know what I need to do. MLD has become routine and less time consuming, and I have finally become used to putting my purse on my unaffected sides shoulder, however stupid it sounds, that one was very difficult for me. Take some time to be angry and then start reading. Binney posted a very helpful link, it's a good place to start.",

There's limited info. I had only 1 node removed I was fit, not over weight, and followed all of the recommendations according to my RO I had little to no chance of developing LE, but I did develop LE. There are woman that have multiple nodes removed, are over weight, sleep on their sides etc who never develop LE. Small cuts will not hasten or cause the development of LE. If you have LE even a small cut can bring on a serious illness, cellulitis, but that seems rather random. People on this board have had serious burns and cuts and have not experienced cellulitis and others can't shake it. Like doxie, I've had cuts, scrapes and some pretty bad cat scratches but did not experience an increase in swelling or cellulitis. There is a new study that says it's Ok to get needle sticks after BC on the effected sides if you don't have LE but I would avoid it if at all possible. If you have LE and even if you don't it is a good idea to treat cuts and small punctures as soon as possible by cleaning and using some kind of antibiotic cream. Avoid poison Ivy and insect bites but that, again, is kind of standard for most everyone. I hope if you don't have LE that you don't develop it, but if you do, just know this, it is manageable. ",

I was poorly informed of the side effects caused by rads.  In my case, the Doc seemed to be disconnected from the side effects, sort of like \"not her responsibility\" to deal with.  Maybe there should be an after care Doc that takes care of all of this. Getting over breast cancer treatment was, for me, a very different experience than the overly optimistic description in the little hand outs I received at the hospital! That said, I would, if I were you, call your Docs office and ask the nurse LOTS of questions. If your doc has sent you for LE therapy without diagnosing you or examining you, you should see the doc or a doc to find out if you should continue treatment.   ",
