Her words were \"I was surprised not that there was more DCIS, but that there was invasive cancer.\" I have been referred to an oncologist whom I will meet on Friday, who I asked about her disposition, and the surgeon said I would like her and she was smart - two important things in a cancer doctor. That being said, it looks like it is a small spot of IDC - maybe 4-5mm. It also looks like it is isolated to my left nipple - Stage 1. The current plan is a skin sparing mastectomy to allow for reconstruction later. I will do that December 14. Following that, we will wait for the pathology report. If it is what everyone thinks it is, I will do chemotherapy after the baby is born and then be on Herceptin for a year because of the IDC being HER+2, which the surgeon said was also a shocker. If there is more IDC, I will start chemotherapy before the baby is born... and then Herceptin afterwards. If I wasn't pregnant, I would do chemo first, but for such a small spot, the oncologist and surgeon seem comfortable waiting. For the record - I didn't have a lump.. the only thing I had was a nipple ulceration - that is the invasive cancer. That small thing was it. I think about the series of events - nipple sore... OBGYN sent me \"just in case\" for a mammogram... then just in case for a biopsy... then a lumpectomy and the surgeon (just in case) did the biopsy on the nipple... and because of that, I have a good chance that this is curable. Young women need to be vigilant for this. Thank you for all of the messages of support.",

It sounds like the tumor size is relatively small. I had a feeling that this was going to be an issue, but I have a great surgeon. Just hearing stories from other women is encouraging. I want to make it for my husband and baby.",
