Those test came back with findings of micro-calcification clusters and and a palpable lump with no focal mass.  So now I am waiting to have the biopsy. Has anyone had  this happen? and should I be concerned? When I asked my surgeon could this be nothing, he said it's definitely something. What does that mean? Log in to post a reply",
