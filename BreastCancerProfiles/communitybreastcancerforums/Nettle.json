I am so reassured by all the talk of itching as I am 10 weeks post reconstruction and last night was the first time it happened to me (maybe after wearing an under wired bra) and it was UNBEARABLE!! Scratching just made it worse and the intensity took my breath away. Had it again today and tried antihistamine tablet and cream, analgesic skin cream and ice pack!! Just praying it's going to go as quickly as it came but the threads from other people's stories are a bit daunting!",
