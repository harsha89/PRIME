After my lumpectomy 3/7/13, I saw a rad onc who I really like and scheduled my mapping for 4/2/13. Then saw my med onc and she is sending my tumor for oncotype, which will take 3 wks. Didn't know I could possibly need Chemo 1st, depending on the results. Now I am back to the waiting game. I have been thinking positive but it's all still so new and my emotions along with fear are kicking me hard. I do know I can beat this!",

She had mets to her bones and after herceptin/perjeta/taxotere got her to NED, she was on Herceptin/Perjeta maintenance for about a year before she found out about mets to her lungs. So now it is on to TDM1. Does anyone know how long it can take before we can tell if it is working or not working? Her tumor markers went up after her first round. I've read that this is not necessarily a sign that it is not working as this could potentially indicate cancer cells dying off or that TDM1 just takes longer to work or build up. I was wondering if anyone else had similar experiences. Thanks.",

Once we found out her current treatment wasn't working and she had to switch to TDM1 it was very scary and then hearing the first round didn't help with the tumor markers we couldn't help but wonder if if it was working or not. We know we shouldn't jump to conclusions after one round, but it can be difficult not to. I will be praying for good scan results for you!",
