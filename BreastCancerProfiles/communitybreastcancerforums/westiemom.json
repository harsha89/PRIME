I'm not trying to candy coat here, but it honestly sounds like things are going to be okay. If you have to go thru surgery - do it, medicine is so advanced now, you will have options. I'm wasn't happy with my diagnosis, but my prognosis is excellent and I'm going to live. I'm not going to die from breast cancer, not just because I refuse but because its treatable. So many strong women on this board have a much more advance stage/diagnosis and they are going to live normal happy lives once this is all behind them.   I'm really worried that you are worrying yourself sick and you children might sense it. Take care and let us know. I've been thinking about you since the other day I read your post. I only give advice about trying not to worry (easier said than done) so much because I've been there and it turned out creating anxiety and loss of sleep and you really do need to rest. Don't own the unknown.",

But Traci when you think about it, no matter what - sounds like it was found in time to be totally treatable. As others have posted, you're not going to die, you are going to be fine, luv your life, squeeze your kids tight. Please post when you get results.

I chose not to shave my head. While undergoing treatment I didn't experience any new growth or 5 o\"clock shadow. Around 6 weeks after my last treatment I started seeing new growth. I've read where others experienced hair growth during treatment. Based on what I've read it seems to be different for everyone. Part of that might be based on the chemo I'm thinking.... ",

Once the hair started to fall out I went to Supercuts and had it cut above my shoulders, made it easier for me to cope with shorter hair as it fell out; but the hair around my hairline stayed too. Once my new hair started growing in I cut it. MBJ you totally inspired me! I started Nioxin and I really like it. I'm using the System 3 because my hair has color in it, in addition I bought the follicle booster (pricey) it does thicken up my hair nicely. I also bought the Nioxin vitamins, has good stuff in it. I'm pleased with the hair purchase, makes the expense worth it. I'm going to see a menopause and osteoporosis physician next week. I'm feeling lethargic and just blah, although I have the utmost respect for my oncologist, I need to see what options are out there for me since my oophrectomy in addition to the arimidex and calcium. Want to be sure there isn't anything impacting my hairgrowth, lack of weight loss (ugh!), etc.",

I'm BRCA 1 positive, this pretty much made the decision for me of having a bi-lateral mastectomy, then I went thru chemo. Oncologist allowed me a month after chemo to recover and build up a strong immunity, then I had a bi-lateral oophrectomy - trust me - I fought against it but my onc said based on the genetic testing it was the best course of action, turned out I had cancer starting on both sides of my Fallopian tubes, very rare. Breast cancer runs in my family but ovarian does not. I say all this because like you,  I didn't want to be placed in to medical menopause and really felt an oophrectomy was not necessary or I could put it off for a year. I'm glad I had the surgery,  but good lord menopause sucks! I had hot flashes for about a year, got really bad at night, melatonin and remaining calm when having a hot flash really helped. I only had mood swings for about a month, nothing too bad, still married Lol! I have no regrets with my decision, it saved my life. Keeping you in prayer Alexa and sending positive thoughts.

The onc said some people benefit from the shot, others don't but that I needed to lay low and not really be around anyone for fear an infection will push back my next treatment, he seemed very concerned. Is there anything I can do? Im starting to go a little koook-a-doodle-doo in the noodle being in the house all day. My dog has even learned more english since I've been home. Just venting I guess.",

The removal of the drains was not painful at all but I didn't want to work with drains. My doctor recommended that I take 5-6 weeks off which I'm glad I did. I needed the time. You have to listen to your body to know when it's right to exercise but I encourage you to stretch as soon as your surgeon gives you the okay, stretch by raising your arms (slowly and gently) as to not get stiff. I now have full range of motion and it feels great! I had sentinel lymph node removed under one arm. Please take time to allow yourself to heal, this is such an important part of recovery. Take care, sending prayers and positive thoughts your way...... ",

I was told yesterday that the best treatment is a mastectomy, needless to say I'm devastated. The main lump is ductal carcinoma in situ, but when they took tissue from around the lump they found another spot that was invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 3. The surgeon told me this wouldn't have shown up on the mammogram, she is concerned that the probablity of it recurring is high or even other areas of my breast could be affected. Radiation is not an option at this point. She stated at the time of the mastecomy, lymph nodes will be tested. I meet with the plastic surgeon today, oncologist next week. I'm confused, angry and sad. Based on everyone's experience, does this sound like the best treatment?",

I couldn't sleep after the 1st treatment, spoke to my onc about it, he prescribed me ambien 5mg and it works great for me. I absolutely hate treatment but it sounds like we have two more to go.
