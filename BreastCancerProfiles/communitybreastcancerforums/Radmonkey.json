I've done all the research that I can and I'm going to try to enjoy the weekend with my kids. I'm going to be in warrior mode next week. My appt time is Wednesday 12:15 pm. I figure I will be done just in time for rush hour traffic. I'm bringing a bucket for the car ride just in case. Parakeets rule - my port access is below my collarbone, but there is a small tube that connects from the triangular portion that runs over the collarbone that you can see and feel as it dives down into the jugular vein in the neck. It's like a tiny worm under the skin. I find myself rubbing it all the time. Is that what you are referring to? I also asked for Ativan for home based on suggestions here. I took one for the first time last night (because I didn't know how it would effect me on chemo day). Oh, it's so nice.... L",

I get an echocardiogram on Monday. I scheduled my port for this Tuesday. I'm worried about the SE, especially the nausea and vomiting. I throw up with most antibiotics. I'm hoping the port will be healed when I puke my guts out. Sorry, I'm really sad today. I tried on wigs yesterday and they were very \"wiggy\" on me. Plus, just having it on for 5 minutes, it was really hot. I don't think I will be able to go to my kid activities with one on. Privacy is so important to me. I got that \"sad look\" from another mother and just started bawling. I am glad that we have this forum. I don't feel so alone in all of this. Is Biotene mouth spray over the counter? Getting Ginger tea today. *HUGS* L",

I guess it will be a lazy day. It's just one step closer to chemo... Ok update. I think the lidocaine and versed are wearing off. I'm not feeling the greatest.",
