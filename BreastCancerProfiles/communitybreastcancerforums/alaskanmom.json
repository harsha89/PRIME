    "Content": "alaskanmom wrote: I am 53 and just had a mamo. The report said suspicious mass at 3 oclock measuring .5 by .5 by .5 and they recommended additional studies. I came back to Alaska and went to my gyn/np. She couldnt feel it and neither could I. She thinks we should just do a biopsy to rule out cancer since the report said suspicious. I have to wait till the films are fed exed here. Does anyone have experience with finding it on mamo and not feeling anything? The only marker I have is having my first child after 30. I am done with menapause and choose not to do HRT. Log in to post a reply",
