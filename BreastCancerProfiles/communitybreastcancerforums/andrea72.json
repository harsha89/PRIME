What if your breasts are already painful? I'm 37 and have discovered a small lump on the bottom side of my breast but both breasts are painful. ( I'm thnking they are fibrocystic)Â  At this particular moment there is NO WAY I'm getting a mammo, at least until this pain subsides. Any info is much appreciated! Thanks......
