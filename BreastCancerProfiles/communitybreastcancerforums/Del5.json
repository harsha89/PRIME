      "Content": "Del5 wrote: I had a screening mammo in January and a follow up diagnostic mammo the following week. I have regular mammos since I had cancer in my other breast two years ago. The diagnosis was appearance of increased density due to tissue summation artifact. A few months later I felt something different, possibly a cyst? Another month later I went back to my BS for an ultrasound. She found a 2 cm mass that looked suspicious. Biopsy confirmed cancer. That was the end of June. I have since had mastectomy surgery. That was the end of July. Pathology: IDC 4 cm ER+PR+Her- Positive Nodes 10/14 with extracapsual extension, Grade 2, Stage IIIc I'm having more tests done the first week of Sept. to see if there are mets. So, in seven months I went from no worries to this place. Has this happened to anyone else? Are we still this vunerable? What do I tell my daughter about screening? Log in to post a reply",

If I had another chance to change this, I would have pressed for more explanation regarding the mammogram diagnosis seven months ago. Something prompted the dr to call me back. I guess I'm looking to see if more of us have experiences like this and what can we learn from experience with imaging. It seems self exams are just as essential.",

Does that mean insurance companies are mandated to pay for MRI screening in those states? I did go to an accredited facility but they rotate radiologists periodically. After viewing my films, my BS said she would not have sent me away without more tests. There is a good website that explains some of the things radiologists look for (www.radiologyassistant.nl/) in breast cancer. In my case, I had architectural distortion which is a real warning sign. I can't go back and do this over but I can learn from experiences so my daughter knows how to be proactive in her healthcare. Thanks for the feedback.",

The discussion boards are a great place to tell your story and receive support from people who understand. The general public is looking to watch a train wreck in progress and the papers know it. I don't believe this is something you want for yourself and your family. I did see your blog and it is well written. The orange segment story is adorable and all of us mums can relate to it. Seeing your children in picture and their names caused some concern for me. Do you really know who is out there? What will your children feel when they are teenagers and adults? Are they ok with the public scrutiny? I'm not stage IV but cancer is scary at any stage. I may receive some criticism for not supporting you unconditionally but you may want to talk with someone about your need to go public. Is it awareness or a need for attention. We all need support and attention but be careful what you ask for. You asked for advise, hopefully I gave it in a kind manner. It is what I would tell my own daughter.",

I thought I was the only one since I did not hear about this side effect. Up to this point I have been using Miaderm and that has been working ok. No appetite and a little tired other than that. By the way, I am doing Tomotherapy and hopefully I won't have any more side effects for the next 15 treatments. Everyone have a good weekend and stay safe.",
