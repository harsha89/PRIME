Don't forget the sunscreen.  I wore a UV sleeve over my compression sleeve and it helped to keep my arm from getting too hot.  I got it from Coolibar. The first year I was wearing off-the-shelf garments and I wore them for the swim, now I am wearing custom ones and they feel too tight when they are wet. I do end up wrapping my arm a little more often during tri training - I'm sure the humidity doesn't help.  This year I was able to really keep my LE under control.  Enjoy the experience of your first tri there is no feeling like crossing that finish line for the first time.  Are you training with any group?  I trained with Heart Zone Training and it was great.  Let us know how it goes.  ",
