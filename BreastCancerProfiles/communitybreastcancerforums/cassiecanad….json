So now as the clock ticks, i wonder if i made the right choice-more time for rogue cells to activate etc.... or if i just need to calm down and believe the people who are obviously the expert",

I chose to do the test but now the wait is killing me and i envision rogue cells exploring and dividing etc as i wait",

The non stop oc-ing over my perceived self neglect drove me crazy. Looking back, the fact it was caught eventually...and dealt with...is the only way forward. You did the right thing by being proactive and although the lump may not even be cancer, it sounds like you are on right path! Put the guilt to rest! I know its hard- but the reality is- many of these lumps are just not palpable- in fact , my radiologist told me self exams are actually discouraged now. Still hard to believe that, tho. I am sure you are in good hands now- take each day as it comes and try not to let your head do the \u201c what if\u201d game. Theres no winning that one! ps.. Alice- you crack me up- reading these posts can be scary and worrisome, but your spunky wit brings much needed levity and smiles to these forum",
