There is a hole in the table that your breast will go through. Under the table there is a mammogram machine that they will use to locate the calcifications. They will give you a local anesthetic which will burn a little. After that, you shouldn't feel any pain, maybe some pressure. The clip they were talking about is about the size of an ant, and no, it will not set off any alarms. It will cause you no problems. If your biopsy comes out benign, consider the clip your souvenier :) if the biopsy comes out as something that needs to be removed, then the surgeons use that as a marker to know what tissue to remove to ensure they remove the correct area. Hope this helps, and best of luck to you...",

I felt exactly the same way as you.....tired of wondering if and when the other shoe would drop, AND wanted \"a matching set\" :o) I was 30 when I was diagnosed and had breastfed two children. I had one standing at attention and the other not paying attention! I had the BRCA testing done (no family hx but why does a 30 yr old get breast cancer?) and it was negative. My doctor supported my decision and I went with it. That was 1 and 1/2 years ago and not one minute have I regretted my decision. It was more surgery, but now I'm done with ALL of it! Good luck to you, it is a big decision to make, but you will make the right one. Take care.",

You could have the biopsy done and results back before you even see the breast surgeon and then he would be able to have a plan ready for you when you go see him. Waiting is the worst part of it all and at least this way you could get something out of the way. JMO.",

I found my lump 1 month after I weaned my 15 month old son. My oldest was 4 1/2. It is not easy going through surgery, chemo, radiation etc when you have little ones but it definitely is do-able! I am now 3 1/2 years out of diagnosis and have an 8 month old little girl to boot! She was definitely a surprise to all as I was receiving hormone therapy when I got pregnant....definitely a little miracle. It is so good to see that you two found each other and it sounds like your treatment paths might be pretty similar.  Good luck to you both!",

Thank you for taking me seriously and sending me for a mammogram and ultrasound at age 30 to check it out. But please, in the future, send your patients to a breast surgeon, not a general surgeon for consultation. Had I gone to a breast surgeon, maybe they would of actually removed the lump instead of tissue just lateral to it. Then they would have know I had invasive cancer in addition to the DCIS he found.
