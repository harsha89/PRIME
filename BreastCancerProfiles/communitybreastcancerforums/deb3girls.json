I think it is absurd that with all we have to deal with that we have to deal with obstacles like this. Where  do we get the strenght?                        Thanks...Debbie Log in to post a reply",

I will be having it May 2nd. I sure hope this avastin/abraxane has worked its wonders...happy to be going,scared to find out results. What is the \"rule of thumb\" do they generally keep you on the same treatment  if it is working??",

She has given me a lovely grandaughter who will be 1 this march.  I had stage 0 -15 years ago..and this november had my second bout with bc ..only this time not so \"lucky\". I have mets to the bone and lung. What worries me the most is my daughters now. As I said the oldest had the bracca testing. My two other daughters 25 and 28 ...not married are scared to death to have it done...and I am sure when they are ready they will. It was recommended that the oldest after having her next and last baby have her ovaries removed since I am er and pr + and then a propholatic mastectomy. She is going for another opinion to a large cancer institute in NY. I am rambling but I am so scared for my three girls and now worry so much about the two unmarried...I am thankful they have this bracca testing...and now MRI's for the young girls...",
