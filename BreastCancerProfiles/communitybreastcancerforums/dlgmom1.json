Ok soooo- if I've already had two mammos, two diagnostic mammos, and both left and right ultrasounds done BEFORE surgery, wouldn't this have been seen?  I guess my question is do they think it's new?  Also mentioned scattered foci enhancements across both breasts.  Are these foci potential masses?  The one they are looking at is BIRADS 4.  I guess they just want to check again, but it's only been 3 months since surgery...could they have popped up that fast?  Just wondering with all the experience out there what yall think?  Thanks for your help in advance, this is all so confusing! I know I may sound completely ignorant and I really feel that way, so help a girl out! :) Log in to post a reply",
