Got the oncotype result I was hoping for (low risk, score of 13) which means I start radiation on Wed 10/7. Looking forward to joining this club.

I've started to notice what looks like an AWS \"cord\" developing from my affected armpit extending a few inches into my upper arm on the affected side. But it doesn't hurt at all, or feel tight. It's definitely there though. Is this the early stages of AWS? I don't even know which dr to ask...my surgeon is 2.5 hours away at a major cancer center and I'm not scheduled to see him for another 2+ months. My RO and MO are both local...I'm 3 days into radiation, so I guess I can ask my RO on Monday. Thanks for any insight...",

Surgery was uneventful, got to skip chemo, and had radiation in Oct/Nov 2015. Now, 8 months after surgery, I went back to my surgeon because I felt a hard painful lump along my lumpectomy scar. I didn't get too worried (although all symptoms are worrisome, now), and was relived to learn that the lump was fluid-filled. The doctor aspirated it and the fluid that came out was blood--a hematoma. The relief was short-lived, as it began to re-form within a few hours. The newest development, though, is that after I showered this morning, blood started leaking out from the hole where it was poked with the needle. It's been bleeding all day (fun!). So my question is whether this has ever happened to anyone this long after surgery, and if so, how long did it take to go away? I'd like to have a sense of when I can stop putting a maxi-pad in my bra! Thanks!
