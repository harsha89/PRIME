I called my psychiatrist to make sure I have enough medication until I see a new psychiatrist. I'm been in and out of therapy for about three years as well. I'm hoping the medication helps keep me get through this difficult physical experience to come.",

I'm still not sure what the treatment plan is, but my mom continued to work three days a week while also going through chemo. It was also her last year before retiring. This is my second year teaching art, and seven years altogether teaching. I will set up my classroom, but I'm sad to not be able to finally clear my credential this year. I've been seeing therapists on and off for three years and I'm hoping to strengthen my mental health through this difficult time. I think it's great that you'll be back in your classroom in October. Best of luck with everything, and I will keep this forum updated. :)",

My mom had cancer 7 years ago, but it was hormone induced and she did not have the gene in her DNA and she did not pass it on to me. Did you read any books to help you through chemo? What kind of medicine is Tamoxifen? I really appreciate your feedback. It means more than you know.",

My dad suffered from anxiety and mild depression and did speak of some anti-depressants that potentially make you suicidal. I know I'm just trying to recover from the shock of it all, but I'd like to keep my mental health treatment plan the same as I go through my cancer treatment plan. It's hard to stay optimistic when my treatment plan is up in the air, but I know I have to try.",
