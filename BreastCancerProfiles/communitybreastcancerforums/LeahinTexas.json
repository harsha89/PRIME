My first mammogram was at the end of September and my MRI was yesterday, almost a month later. And I won't get the results until next week, maybe even the beginning of the week afterwards. I keep telling myself that the odds are in my favor that my outcome will be benign and that I will be really mad at myself if it is benign and I spent a lot of time and energy worrying. So I have spent some time getting educated, and that will be good no matter what (it will give me sensitivity to others going through the same thing) and then tried to keep my mind off it.  Hoping for benign for you!",

It seems that for most of us the amount of time to get to diagnosis is measured in weeks, not days, and sometimes months and fractions of months. As much as I wanted a report after each test, what has happened is that the test didn't confirm or deny, but only pointed to the need for a more sophisticated test. There really wasn't a result to report. But...the most sophisticated test is far too expensive to be used as a screening test. That's why we don't start there. Screening is just that. All the \"girls\" who are fine fall through the screen and are done til next year.  Those who don't fall through, get the additional attention (testing) that they need.  I am the referring doctor's patient and she or he will probably be the one to give me the results, not the doctor reading the film or making the report. (Maybe this varies according to practice?) I should call the first doctor I saw to find out how she or he likes to give results: in person at an appointment or over the phone.  That waiting is, literally, an exercise in patience. I get to practice the virtue of patience. The breast is a complicated, amazing thing!

Thank you! My first appointment with the breast surgeon is Thursday and my ob-gyn gave me copies of the three reports, but not the original images. I thought a breast surgeon would look at the images, but perhaps not.  Would you mind telling me what your first appointment was like? Was it just talk? And how does he know where the duct is to take it out?  I guess I'll find out soon enough, but I wanted to ask here!  Thank you for your interest.",

So sorry it is taking so long.  It's funny because sometimes I think I have cancer and I try to prepare for that and other times I am sure it is benign. (I try not to think about it too much one way or the other and of course, trying to figure it out is futile because if I could figure it out, so could they, and we wouldn't need these tests!)",

      "Content": "Nov 5, 2010 04:19AM - edited Aug 20, 2013 12:06PM by LeahinTexas Okay, here is some lingo from my reports: From the mammogram: tissue of both breasts is heterogeneously dense. (I researched and this means looking for stuff is like looking for a polar bear in a snow storm) No other significant masses, calcifications or other findings. BI-RADS 0 Indeterminate. Ultrasound: Ductal ectasia without evidence of intraducal mass. No abnormalities were seen. Impression: incomplete.(From the link, Mayo Clinic definition: Mammary duct ectasia occurs when a milk duct beneath your nipple becomes dilated, the duct walls thicken and the duct fills with fluid.) Ductogram: a few of the duct branches have blunt ends, however, no intraducal mass or masses are identified. Cannot explain brown/black discharge, recommend MRI. MRI: Impression: proteinaceous duct ectasia bilaterally. Advance to definitve surgical management of the right pathologic nipple discharge. Duct excision is recommended. I think this all sounds pretty good! It sounds like they just want to be sure, so they want it out.  If you have a different take, I'd love to hear it. Thanks...",

      "Content": "LeahinTexas wrote: I just got the call from my ob-gyn's nurse. They are referring me to a breast surgeon. So, still no diagnosis, but more procedures. I asked and she confirmed that this means they cannot consider it benign, but they also do not know that it is cancer.  I have an appointment with the breast surgeon on Thursday, exactly two weeks from today.  The nurse is going to put all my records together and I am going to pick them up to take to the breast surgeon. I think I will go this afternoon. I won't understand the images, but I imagine that there is a radiologist report in there and a report after the MRI (do radiologist interpret MRI's?) So that will be interesting and maybe give me a little more information. I'm not that worried. I think that since they couldn't see anything conclusive in the mammogram and ultrasound, that at least means that it is in early stages, if I do have cancer.  Sounds like the duct excision is an outpatient procedure and that some of you, at least, go back to work the next day. I'm a stay at home wife and mom (tried to get a job this summer, but couldn't), so I don't have to worry about getting to a job, but we are very busy around here. This community has been wonderful! I haven't talked to many friends IRL (in real life) because I didn't want to worry them needlessly. (And I am so busy with the kids that I really don't have many close friends.) I do need to tell my sister. She had colon cancer over five years ago. I hadn't told her cause she is dealing with some issues in her marriage, but I think I will now.  Leah (Spontaneous discharge in mid-September, have had mammogram, ultrasound, ductogram and MRI.

One thing I have learned on here is that there are a lot more mastectomies than I realized. I just had no idea... I guess I thought that they were rare because of lumpectomies, chemotherapy and radiation. I hope I don't sound too dumb or insensitive. Thanks for the good wishes!
