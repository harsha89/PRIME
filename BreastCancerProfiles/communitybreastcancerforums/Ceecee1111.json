Reading everyone posts is comforting and helps me learn what I may go through soon and long term. Speedy4- lumpectomy: I was told to ice it after my biopsy, but not after the lumpectomy. No real exercise, just told to stand by a wall & walk my fingers up (to get the shoulder working?). Laurie- I just read about your staph infection. I hope you get better real soon. I just got out the hospital today, I had a staph infection at the incision sites. BS wasn't concerned with my rash there last week. This week my breast swelled to twice the size, bad pain & fever, my PS was very concerned. Admited to hospital for strong IV antibiotics, then they cut it, drained the fluid & put in a drain, for just a few days. I feel much better.",

The pain meds gave me a terrible headache, neck ache & fever, so I had to stop taking it on the 2nd day and only used Tylenol. Have fun in TX!",

I was shocked to find out I had BC, 01/15/13. Living alone is hard and I was freaking out. I had a lumpectomy 01/28, the Good News the margins are clear, but the Bad News I may have to have a re-excision, cause the margins were too close. I'll find out more on 01/11, including the radiation & Tamoxifen. Reading everyone's experiences & advice has already made me feel a little better. Wish I had known about this site earlier, it would have relived some of my worries.",
