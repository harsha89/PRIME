I have to keep busy to keep from going crazy. And anti-anxiety meds are a big help during the waiting game. I will be checking in to see how you are doing!   I just had my lumpie and I m waiting for my path report",

(You have to pay what it costs, there is no cap. The income percentages only let you off from paying the annual penalty on your taxes for not buying insurance).The best way to deal with it is, first, get a free mammo. Check with the county. It's usually called \"Every Woman Counts\" or something similar. Then there is a federal program available everywhere for breast and cervical cancer treatment. Local hospitals and the Cancer Centers of America have social workers on staff who will help you through the maze. Social Services can help too, but the wait can be long so try the cancer centers first. Sometimes it actually is better to not have insurance as in the long run, you won't have to file bankruptcy. When I found my dimples, (more like bite marks),I wondered if I would just die because I didn't have insurance, (but I DO have student loans, LOL)!  There is help and hope. PM me if you like. ",
