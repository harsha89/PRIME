    "Content": "SunflowerJane wrote: Im realizing waiting is part of this process... In October 2017, my nurse practitioner found a lump in my left breast. After a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound the radiologist saw some micro calcifications and then recommended that I follow up in 6 months with another mammogram. So, I waited... and then in Feb, I began experiencing some pain in my left breast. So my arnp ordered a mri, which I had last week. The mri results showed there's a \"clumped nonmass enhancement\" in my left breast, which corresponds to the micro calcifications seen on my mammogram from November. Then I waited some more... I had mri-guided, vacuum-assisted biopsy yesterday. Now, I'm waiting still... the BIG wait- for the biopsy results. I'm not very good at waiting. What has been helpful for you in the waiting?
