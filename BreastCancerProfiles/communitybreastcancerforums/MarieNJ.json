I haven't needed it since.  I am a little nervous about the start of my treatment on Monday, but I will get through it.  This site has plenty of us ladies that will be here for you as you move along this journey.  What worked for me is reading and researching as much as I can from reputable resources e.g. cancer.org, cancer.gov etc.  Bring a pad with you to your doctor and take notes.  I made a binder to put my reports in, as one of the supporters suggested and it works for me.  If you go to MSK, you can download your lab and radiology results etc., confirm appointments etc. on mymskcc.com.  You should check out the other forums on this site as well to be more specific to your situation. Best of luck to you. Mary ",

I had bald spots and wispy long ends. Before treatment, I had it cut in a very short pixie since I knew what was ahead of me. My oncol told me, by the 8-9 treatment, I will probably need to wear a wig if it bothers me. I sure did. My last treatment for taxol was Aug. 25th. So I am over 3 months post taxol. I started to notice my hair filling in the bald spots around a month post taxol-very slowly. After 2 months post taxol, I went to the hairdresser and had the wispy ends cut off. It looks much better. I use an organic shampoo which I bought at Wholefoods and noticed my hair is much softer. I used to dye my hair but decided to go natural - salt and pepper. Not dyeing it and the new shampoo is probably what makes my hair feel much better. I'm not ready to go topless yet, but hoping to by Christmas. My husband measured it last weekend - it's 1 1/8\" long. Oh well. I do have to tell you, the wig looks very much like the hair I used to have. It is going to be a shock for people to see me with this very short salt and pepper hair once the wig is off for good. Another - oh well. I love the pictures that were posted You all look great! You all seem to be ahead of me. So I am looking forward to looking as good as you! Hang in there - It does grow back!!! Marie ",

I don't want to be a slave to the hairdresser anymore getting my roots colored every 5-6 weeks.  Plus, I don't want to subject myself to the chemicals anymore. I'd rather buy a piece of clothing with the extra money! LOL I am a little over 2 months PFC. I cut the long stragglers and it looks much better.  However, as my hair continues to grow, the stragglers are following.  Will need a little trim next week.  I'm still hoping I can go topless to my uncle's 80th birthday.  Even though I never lost my eyebrows fully, they did thin out.  They have now filled in fully.  I will need a waxing before the party.  I was so surprised about a month ago when I tried putting on mascara.  It went all over my eyelids - UGH.  Never realized that I lost some of my eyelashes.  They have caught up nicely too.  Looking forward to putting on mascara for the party, too.

They grew back in about 1 month. I needed an eyebrow wax in early November including a waxing on my upper lip. The hair grows back fast where you don't want it to and it seems to take longer on my head! Can you believe, before chemo, I had very little hair on my legs. Now I have to use my electric shaver! As far as the gray, it's staying. These are my new \"highlights\". I love the way the salt and pepper looks and I'm keeping it very short. Everyone, have a wonderful weekend. Marie  ",

Also, I noticed a lot of you gals are talking about protection of your heart and lungs while receiving radiation.  I'm not sure if you need to qualify or if your facility doesn't have it, but I had radiation lying on my stomach.  My breast dropped down below the board and radiation was given to the breast only.  This method is to protect the lungs and heart from the radiation beam.  Maybe not everyone qualifies for this method, but you may want to ask if your facility has this machine. Have a great day all! Marie",

Has anyone experienced this rawness. UGH Marie",

LOL  I was told to put Eucrin on after the radiation and put a cream on that the Dermatologist gave me at bedtime.  Also to make sure their is no residue of cream before radiation.  It is all working out fine.  Is anyone on this forum getting only 16 treatments and lying on their stomach?  Just curious.

LOL  I started off with edema and a pinkish color on my breast. My BS said it will take time before it goes away.  Unlike some of you gals, my breast is a little swollen.  However, I do see an improvement. It's probably from the Eucrin in the morning and the antibiotic cream at night that the Dermatologist prescribed.  It's been 2 1/2 weeks since my last rad treatment and I'm feeling pretty good. Blessings to all! Marie",

No peeling or itching. Then after 2 weeks past radiation, only put it on at bedtime.  I had a Dermatologist appt on Oct 20th and he prescribed Silvadene (same as you).  I now have under my breast (by the crease where I had my surgery) a raw patch!   I stopped the Silvadene.  I have a feeling it's from that.  Tonight I just put on the Eucrin.  I'm happy that I see my MO on Monday.  It is so raw and pink.  I didn't have this problem during radiation.  I can't understand why I'm experiencing this almost 3 weeks post radiation.  How frustrating.

Last Monday when I saw my MO, she said I needed to see the Dermatologist that day. I did and he added another cream (cortisone) in addition to the antibiotic cream and I can actually say this is clearing up nicely. It turned brown and then peeled off to leave a new skin underneath. I kept a bra off all week and that probably helped. There is a light at the end of the tunnel! Good luck all.... Marie",
