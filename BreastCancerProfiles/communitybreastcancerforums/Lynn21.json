Also, my armpit won't stop itching. There is a lot of cancer in my family, but not breast cancer that I am aware of. After the holidays, I was in the bathroom and while getting into the shower realized my left breast was wet on the nipple. Kinda like when I breast fed years ago and would leak. I then made an appointment after the new year. Unfortunately I woke up with flu like symptoms and had to cancel. Recently I have started having back pain that is consistent. One day it was so severe that I thought I had pull a muscle and it was taking my breath away. This past week my left shoulder has been aching even while sitting with no movement. I went to the Gyno yesterday. She agreed that the lump needs to be checked out. She then proceeded to press on my left breast and seen the clear discharge. Saying \"That is thick and quite a bit.\". I am scheduled for a Mammogram and a Diagnostic Ultrasound together this coming Tuesday morning. I have to be honest. Up until this past week. I haven't been concerned, now I'm losing my mind. I'm 37 with four children 10-3. I was wondering if anyone else could advise if they experienced these same symptoms and what the results were! Log in to post a reply",
