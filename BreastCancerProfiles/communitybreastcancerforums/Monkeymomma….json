I am awaiting my appointment for diagnostic imaging but I find myself arguing with my inner voice that I already know what they will say. Just as I knew what the doctor was going to find when I went in for my appointment. I found the first mass almost two months ago up in the tail of Spence mixed in with the handful of other things in that area of my left breast. I chalked it up to irritation or damage done from the physical labor I just did. Fast forward a month and half later I felt a 2.5 cm mass in my breast in the upper outer quadrant of my left breast. It isn' tender, it was firm, odd shaped but mobile. I had my gut tell me it was not something to ignore. My boyfriend of 6 years had to talk me into making an appointment. My doctor felt both masses, both 2.5 cm or larger, one feeling lobular. (Ican not remeber all that was in her notes...i kinda went numb minded when the nurse was reading it to me.) My doctor ruled out cysts and many others. And her demeanor changed immediately after the exam. (Did not help my anxiety lol). Through confirmation of my boyfriend, my left breast is starting to show swelling, new lumps or growth to the one is palpable. The one in the tail of Spence is now fixed as well. The other is now hard and no longer firm. I see swelling up near my shoulder/collar bone (guessing lymph node) and other lymph nodes are becoming more palpable, fixed and hard. My nipple also appears to be changing. My gut supports the research ruling out so many benign conditions. Neither are round, soft, clear boarders, no pain, one fixed and the other slightly mobile (though a positive sign), and I feel tired and it is getting worse. I mentally feel the evil of these invasions branching out to my shoulder, under my arm and through my breast. I still have until the 6th of December to have the dianostic mammogram nd ultra sound, plus my doc suddenly wants yearly testing and imaging of my ovaries (had a hysterectomy 2.5 years ago and y mom passed away young from ovarian cancer) which also didn't help feeling though she feels they are benign. Did anyone also know instintively that they were cancerous or anything? Can someone help me with what is going on is benign or do they truly point to a greater chance of me really facing the battle of breast cancer? I am 35 with four beautiful daughters...never in my life did breast cancer come as an option or as a thought....i need guidance and help. Log in to post a reply",

If you picture your breast as a clock (noon being the top of your breast, 6 the bottom, 3 o'clock being center of chest and 9 being near your armpit since it is your right breast). How does the lump feel? Firm, soft, round etc. Does it move or or stay in place? Is it close to you nipple? As I have read on so many threads on this site and from my personal insight, all lumps should be checked out starting with an ultrasound and diagnostic mammogram. If anything ask you doctor to schedule it for peace of mind and if there is still concern you can request to have it biopsies. If your doctor will not do it, then try to see another doctor. Did you doctor feel it as well? As I have to keep reminding myself, 80% of breast lumps are benign. But I would listen to your gut, not the panic voice but the true inner one. You know your body better than anyone and you know when something just isn't right. Your not alone through this \"adventure\". Everyone of us here has either been exactly where you are (I sure am right now) or has a family member who has. The waiting and unsurity sucks. You will be okay no matter what it is. Tell yourself your strong, amazing and determined to do whatever is needed for your babes. Fighting for them will give you all the strength you need.",

I had a biopsy yesterday and that was a nightmare (in my opinion). First the GS (I was quite upset he wasn't a BS), did not even do a full breast examination. He refused to even make a game plan to biopsy the area of thickening that concerns my doc and me (plus it has grown/spread). Just brushed us both off there. Then he did a core biopsy of the lump, three samples. One he said he felt like he went through it and got breast tissues out side it, said he thinks he ruptured a cyst that may have formed around/near it, and then said here is a band-aid and you should find out results by Tuesday or Wednesday, I will send them to your doctor to review and she can tell you them. I do not know if this is typical or if I truly got brushed off and pushed out of his way due to my age and having 4 kids. I also had a pelvic US done on Wednesday which showed a possible solid mass in my right ovary and then after I requested the report, I found out my left ovary may be attached to the near by intestine and a bowel blockage appears to be forming...ughhh...oh well, one thing at a time and one day at a time. I am thinking of meeting with my doctor to find someoe else who will actually take my doctors and my concerns into account and treat me with some good bedside manner and respect. I feel our concerns should be acknowledged and addressed. Sorry for the long rant ladies, I am very stressed and irritated with the whole thing.",

My best guess is that it is about 3-3.5cm right now, my doctor labels it as more of a ductal \"feel\" to it I understand why he could not biopsy the other spot as more imaging or a different process to biopsy would be needed since ultrasound guided biopsy could obviously not be done. Yup you are correct that currently I cannot do much until I see my PCP again. I would like to see if an MRI is an option in the attempt to get a good look at what is there. From what I have gathered even ilc has a good chance of showing on the MRI, though I have read that many woman didnt have anything shown on all 3 and it wasn't until surgery that their ilc was found or others that their staging changed for the worse once surgery occurred or their mastectomy. Breast cancer sure is a tough one to diagnose. All you woman I have great admiration for and endless respect. I hope that if I find myself truly facing the same battle, that I can stay as positive and determined as everyone of you. Thank you all for such great support.",

Did either of you have a natural instinct that screamed at you as to it being something of concern? I found the thicker area (near my armpit, about 1 o'clock) over 2 months ago but thought it was due to the physical labor I just completed, then a month and half later I felt the lump near my nipple at about 3 or 4 o'clock. No visual changes at that time, but it was instant instinct kicking in saying get it looked at now. My doctor felt both areas of concern, both the area of thickening (She says lobular concern) and the mass/lump were 2.5cm+. Since then (now three weeks) the mass/lump has spread in two directions and just funky in shape, the area of thickening has grown as well. This is also when there have been the visual changes, those are what really make me less hopeful for benign results. But I am surprised neither showed on either imaging since they are not small. But I know neither are perfect and many woman have only reached diagnosis after biopsy. I am also carrying more concern since they have such different palpable presentation. I have yet to find a benign condition that presents in such, but as most have found from Dr. Google, many cancers that fit every change and angle of what they feel and see. I find I learn way more from you amazing woman on this site. Those experiencing such a battle have way more to offer than any site or text book out there.",

So on to biopsies for both areas as I feel it is the only way I will get answers and It had to happen no matter what. Quite anxious since there are undeniable visual changes in my breast (larger and drops easily an inch lower than my right, nipple changes, dimpling (can not spell today) etc). Well my doctor had also scheduled a pelvic ultrasound to give us baseline images to compare any changes (my mom was diagnosed with stage lV ovarian cancer and 48, they guessed it was spreading for over 10 years before diagnosis, she passed away at 52). Well they found a solid mass in my right ovary that was attached to part of the ovary wall and possible growth past the ovary. So now been referred to a GYN, out of town since we have no specialists local. It was supposed to be a routine and normal images...very frustrated. Though I am very grateful my doctor scheduled the US. Not jumping the gun to say I have breast cancer or/and ovarian cancer, though it explains a lot. I have dropped 55 lbs in the past two years without any changes in my life or diet, have been becoming more and more exhausted over the past year and increasingly so the past few months, haven't had an appetite in ages, I catch every cold or virus and go months having new colds or illnss back to back...and ughhh lol I really do not have a question as I know no one but results from biopsies and whatever else is to come, can give me answers. More or less venting. I am just in shock that there is even the smallest percent of chance I either have two cancers or spreading of one. Log in to post a reply",

I avoid the internet for this besides this site, as others all give fear and this one gives hope. I am holding onto as much hope as I can find right now. I am quite optimistic that the mass in my ovary is benign but I think i will push just to get that ovary gone. My other ovary has never given me issue this far. As for my breast mass/lump (I do not know what to call the area of thickening, as using the wrong term seems to complicate explanations) I am not so optimistic. Every week that breast seems to swell more, drop more and the auxiliary nodes seem to be changing but I am not an expert my any means. Gut tells me to worry more about the breast issues and not so much the mass in my ovary. So I am going to listen to it and let some worry go. I cannot handle anymore changes, new things found, or delays. Thank God for my biopsies today. It is wonderful to be so close to answers finally.",

He did not do a breast exam or feel where I said there is growth or other areas that can be felt, (I was wanting those looked into as well). I felt I had to force him to biopsy at least the lump. I understand he is a general surgeon and not a breast surgeon, but bedside manner and respect should have been observed during the appointment. He took three samples, one he said he felt like he went right through the mass and got breast tissue, then he said he thinks he ruptured a cyst or something like it, and then gave me a band-aid and told me I should get results Tuesday or wednesday. I don't know, this whole situation is frustrating and I can guarantee, almost everyone on here can relate to.
