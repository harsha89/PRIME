She is 19 years old now, her history was when she was 17 she had a surgery removing a lump on her left breast with a white colored lump with a size of a golfball with roots looking veins attached to it. It was a success. But after two years, the lump reappears and recently she had done yet another surgery to remove the lump. Now, its near the nipple. It has blood discharged from her nipple at some point and then it got removed immediately. The lump is also a growing lump. It was smaller 4 months earlier and it got bigger. She's now in her recovering stage. But Its such a sad situation when she checks herself and yet to find another lump, a small one on the right breast and it is near the nipple.   Now, the question is. 1. I was wondering is there any kind of method to permanently remove these lumps and preventing it from getting back? She's also afraid of telling her doctor nor parents because she just had the operation and her breast is still in pain and also she's so young to handle this.  2. Does she has the potential to get another one in near future after removing her lumps? 3. Are the lumps potentially to be cancerous?  That is all and Thank You in advance as any comments and ideas or methods will be appreciated !   EDIT : The lumps are benign.   Log in to post a reply",
