I was feeling a little heartburn-ish with a little burping last night and a bit of nausea but not bad. I took an adivan which really help me to sleep and a compazin early early this morning. I am taking the emend along with it and I go in for my neaulasta shot this morning. I'm a bit nervous about the side effects of the neulasta from what i've listened of you(this forum) talking about it. Is is mostly just joint pain? Anyway, I'm sure the fun side effects are yet to come, I am just relieved to not have an immediate allergic reacation, etc...plus it is really a mental battle ground in anticipation. At least now I know what to expect. My hopital was really nice. They gave me a massage to help me relax through the first one. It really made a difference for me.",

When should I shave my hair off? This is going to be difficult on me since i have long hair.",
