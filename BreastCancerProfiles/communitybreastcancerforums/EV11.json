Odds would be greater that you have ovarian ILC mets and NOT a new primary ovarian cancer. Also know that lobular mets to the peritoneum/GI tract can also cause a rise in CA 125, so if you decide to check that tumor marker it might not be very helpful in distinguishing primary ovarian cancer from ILC mets. It can be very difficult to see ILC mets in the ovaries and peritoneum or GI tract; if extensive, they might appear as \"thickening\" or \"stranding\" or \"caking\" on CT. If you do decide to get a CT scan, I would have your oncologist write a note to the radiologist who will be reading your scan and alert him/her to the fact that you are trying to detect possible ILC mets (which usually don't from discrete tumors or masses) and for them to be very diligent inn looking for thickening or stranding. I had ILC mets to ovaries, fallopian tubes and peritoneum, and none of it showed up on CT or MRI, even with the radiologist being very agreeable to look particularly for that. Those mets were only found during surgery when I had a BSO a few months after my de convo stage 4 diagnosis. I only had the ovaries removed because I was not having my ovarian function fully suppressed by goserelin injections. It was quite a shock to get the pathology report back! A few months after I started systemic treatment my sense of abdominal fullness went away, and things have been quiet and comfortable since then....which correlates with my up-til-now great response from my treatment. (I now have 2 new lung mets and an unusual genetic mutation to deal with). But that's a different story! I hope that you can get some answers from careful imaging; perhaps it's time to try a different treatment or a liquid biopsy to see if there is anything new or informative lurking. Good luck figuring it out. Lobular is a pain in the ass to deal with, especially with regards to imaging and detection. Let us now what you figure out. Elizabeth",

I had two small (sub-cm) lung lesions appear when I was on Ibrance-- they grew over three months, and we interpreted that as progression. I went off meds for 5 weeks to get into a trial, and because >4 weeks had elapsed from my last scans by the time the trial was ready for me I had to have another CT-- and the lesions were GONE...no trial, but also no progression....  I just share this to say that if your other indications (labs-- how's your alk phos value trending??) symptoms, etc are stable perhaps a bit of cautions watching and waiting might not be unreasonable...nor is a second opinion in the meanwhile!  Best of luck to you as you try to figure out a plan. It is so difficult when things are ambiguous... Elizabeth",

IF not very highly + (ER especially) than it is more likely that your cancer has evolved to lose receptors. If this is indeed the case, your treatment options would include chemo, and immunotherapy, and depending on which other genomic alterations you have, other treatments like PARP inhibitors if BRCA+, etc. Can you get a second opinion pathology testing on your bone tissue?

My onc and I started having the CTC test done along with the CA27-29 to see if we can find another way to evaluate my treatment response or feel more confident in calling something \"disease progression,\" since my lobular MBC doesn't show up very well on CT, PET, MRI scans. My very extensive bone disease does show up on bone scan and the other scans, but there is such extensive small metastatsic lesions scattered throughout my skeleton it is difficult to monitor bone response/progression. I have known peritoneal/omental/abdominal found during BSO surgery in 2015, a few months after my de novo stage 4 pleomorphic lobular diagnosis. And intra-colon mets were found very unexpectedly during a routine screening colonoscopy last spring. Last summer my CA27-29 jumped from the low to mid 40's (where it had basically stayed for the past 2 years) up to the high 50's and stayed there fro a few months. At the end of the summer we switched to Xeloda from Ibrance/letrozole and started the CTC testing. My CA 27-29 has risen over a few months to 70 after starting Xeloda, then has started to fall the last 2 months to the low 60's...My CTC values have been 2 at the start, then 2 again, 3, and 4 in late January 2019 (no direct correlation to the CA27-29) and then, surprisingly, 0 two weeks ago. I am very curious what the next round of testing will show, especially since a CT scan I had done the week the CTC test resulted 0 showed thickening of the bladder wall for the first time. Go figure.... This is the first time any of that has shown up on a scan... last scan was a year ago, so don't know if the bladder thickening is stable, better or worse over this year of rising TMs. I am very interested in hearing from anyone who uses the CTC test, and if it correlates with other TMs and or disease response on scans. What value do you find from it? How else is it useful for you? Or, what other test(s) do you use, especially if your disease doesn't show up on scans....

I am especially interested in the CYFRA21-1, as it tests for cytokeratin 19, which is one of the markers that the CTC test uses to separate out epithelial tumor cells from progenitor blood cells (which can confound the test results.) Next CTC and Ca27-29 tests are in mid-April.... will see what they show. I have been in touch with scientists at bth CellSearch (very disappointing reception from them...most unhelpful answers to my query) and from the makers of the Shingrix vaccine, which I received about 8 days before my last CTC test draw. That vaccine can significant stimulate production of IL-2 and INF-gamma, both of which can have pronounced anti-tumor activity. I am trying to discover if this can either have confounded the test validity, or perhaps be a true anti-tumor response. If it is the second, I will have to consult with an onc I know who is very active in immunotherapy research and get his inout about when it might be best to schedule the booster dose (typically recommended 2-6 months after the first dose) and also to see if it is worth pursuing IL-2 or other types of immunotherapy. Lots of unknowns and things to try to figure out. I am grateful that I have a receptive and openminded onc. Thank you both for your input. Elizabeth",

I have MBC mets in my colon (seven 3-6mm lesions scattered throughout my large colon), also found on routine colonoscopy this spring...I was not having any GI symptoms at all, but I do have a strong family history of colon cancer so I get a colonoscopy every 5 years. I have lobular CA, which not-too-uncommonly metastasizes to the colon and abdominal region. None of these lesions show up on CT or PET scans, so we are not certain how long they have been there, but my onc asked the radiologist doing the pathology to also check for mitotic rate and found that it was <1% (my original mets discovered 3 years ago had mitotic rate of 19%) so we are assuming that those are \"old\" mets that are being held at bay by my regimen of Ibrance/letrozole. As long as the polyps are \"just\" MBC and not a new primary colon cancer they will be treated with systemic MBC medications, just like mets to any other organ would be treated. If your polyps end up being MBC, and they are suspected as \"new\" mets, you most likely will need to change treatment a new medication; it will be good to know the pathology (ER/PR and HER2 status) to help guide that decision. I am sorry that you are having to deal with this-- I hope that you get your path results soon and that you and your onc figure out a treatment soon. I find that the waiting and uncertainty between test results and the next plan is a maddening time. My head gets into a better space once I have a plan. Let us know when you get your results...

Also, do you have a BRCA1 or 2 mutation? Or a PALB mutation? If so, adding a PARP inhibitor could help greatly....if you haven't done testing for BRCA/PALB or other mutations, I would suggest that you consider it. Lobular BC that metastasizes to the LM space frequently is BRCA mutant....and also sometimes HER2 MUTANT--not amplified...it takes gene sequencing to see that (it's not the copy-number amplifications that histologic HRE2 testing checks...) You can be HER2 mutant and HER2 negative--and while only happening in about 10% of all MBC, it can occur in around 30% lobular MBC--so HER2/HER3 mutations are good to look for...they can be treated with anti-HER medications even if histologically you are HER2 unamplified (negative.) I had a very dear friend with BRCA2 pleomorphic lobular disease who developed LM and brain mets as her first and only metastases...she had good results from IT methotrexate after a few doses and then great results when she added a PARP inhibitor. Unfortunately she died last spring (about a year after her LM diagnosis) from complications of a rare paraneoplastic syndrome (Limbic encephalitis)...it had nothing to do with her treatment, nor was directly related to her cancer activity, according to her neuro-oncologist and seconded by a consultant who specializes in paraneoplastic disease at Mayo...it was just one more thing in a string of bad lucks for her.  I hope that you have a great oncologist to guide your care, and can consider a referral to a neuro-oncologist. I definitely suggest being open to using Xeloda for a few rounds..And note that the 7 days on/7 days off schedule at 3000mg-- or even 200mg--per day greatly reduces side effects and has very similar outcomes to the more traditional 14/7 regimen...it's just far better tolerated!  I hope that you find a manageable regimen...I have another friend who has been dealing with LM mets for almost 4 years (she is HER2 positive, so has other treatment options than you at this point). She still is able to be very involved in her elementary school-aged son's life and says for the most part her treatments are manageable. I wish the same--and for a very long time--for you.
