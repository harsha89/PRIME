This lead to a tomo mammogram and diagnostic ultrasound. The asymmetry was a non issue confirmed by previous mammograms since 2015. However, a tiny, less than 3mm mass was detected. I was given a birds 3 score and a short term follow up of 6 months. All of this caught me off guard and I struggled with what this could mean going forward. I did get a referral to a specialist so I could unpack a lot of the terminology and ask all the questions I had. That appointment really helped out my mind at ease. It also was very informative in terms of knowing that I would be followed to 2 years in 6 month intervals. It is suspected that my mystery mass is a fibroadenoma. Today was my 6 month follow up scan. I am relieved to say that the mass was stable. No change. They will see me again in 6 months for a repeat ultrasound scan and my annual mammogram. I\u2019ve only begun the journey but I hope that sharing this helps. This site has been a fabulous resource for me.",

Findings are compatible with superimposition of fibroglandular tissue. Due to dense breast tissue, targeted right breast ultrasound was performed. Ultrasound: Targeted right breast ultrasound of the inferior half for the mammographically detected finding was performed. No suspicious solid or cystic masses are identified. No sonographic correlate for the asymmetry seen in the inferior right breast. Incidentally identified at 8:00, 6 cm from the nipple is an oval, circumscribed, hypoechoic mass with no internal vascularity and parallel orientation measuring 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.3 cm. This is a probably benign mass. I've talked to my gynecologist, she said she'd be fine waiting 6 months if it were her mammogram but will give me breast specialist referral if that will help me with anxiety. Dr also said nothing she sees in radiologist report jumps out as concerning to her. I'm not sure what to feel right now about this.
