I requested an rx for metformin. After all the reading I've done about it and discussing the drug with my doc, it seems worth a try. I'm on Medicare and doc said they require I have an A1C blood test before he could prescribe it. My blood sugar has always been borderline high so I don't think I'll have a problem getting it approved. I haven't discussed it yet with my MO but will before I start taking it. Waiting for the test results now. Sandcastle: I hear what you're saying but I'm willing to try anything at this point to increase my odds against recurrence. My ER+ percentage is only 25%. Although I'm taking Arimidex, I feel something else must also be fueling the cancer cells and the research about blood sugar makes sense to me.",

I was 65 when I was diagnosed. I went through chemo first, then had a mastectomy and then did 33 radiation treatments. I'm now on anastrozole. I was relatively healthy before starting treatments. I had a bit of high blood pressure and was about 10-15 pounds overweight. Before beginning the Adriamyacin I had a heart test called MUGA. It tests how well your heart pumps blood. If that test had not come back within normal ranges, I would not have been able to take the Adriamyacin. I came out of the Adriamyacin ok - no permanent damage. Main problems while going through it were fatigue, no appetite and when I did eat, everything tasted awful, some nausea but controllable by meds, constipation, etc. I slept a lot. After each treatment I was given a shot of Neulasta. It helps to fight off infections. Neulasta can cause some bone and joint pain for a couple of days. I had blood work done prior to each treatment and if my counts were too low, they would not have given me the treatment. That happened one time. I had developed a fever and a lung infection. I was given a blood transfusion and antibiotics and was well enough the following week to have my treatment. Like I said, not easy but I got through it and I'm glad I did. I had to do everything I could to fight the cancer. The taxol was easier overall but I was always fatigued. Also developed some Neuropathy in my fingers and toes. Do some reading on one of the monthly chemo threads. You'll find lots of women going through AC/T and might get a better feel for what it's actually like reading their first hand accounts. Best of luck to your mom whatever her decision.",

Also a good tip for the drains after surgery is to wear a lightweight (cause of summer) hoodie with pockets. It was easy to get on and off with the zipper and the drains fit well into the pockets.

Rather than taking just the sentinel node to see if it is cancerous, they take a group of nodes and test them all. The nodes are in clusters so the total number of nodes taken just depends on how many are in the cluster the surgeon removes. Since you already know you have node involvement,I'm surprised they are doing a sentinel node biopsy rather than ALND. But that's good because the more nodes you have removed, the higher the risk of lymphedema developing. I've been lucky and haven't had much of a problem. I saw a physical therapist who was certified in treating lymphedema. She took my arm measurements before and after surgery to see if there was any change in size. I also had massage therapy from her after the surgery as well as physical therapy to help get me ready for my radiation treatments. I get swelling on my side once in a while but my arm seems ok. i was told not to have blood or blood pressure taken from the arm as it could trigger a swelling episode. There's several threads on this site dealing with the topic. Definitely take your sister up on her offer. You just won't have enough arm movement in the first few days to do much for yourself.",

At that time, my doctors decided to remove only the cancerous breast. I had a very aggressive cancer that was already in my lymph nodes and they didn't want anything to interfere with treatment (like a possible post-surgical infection in the non-cancerous breast). I wanted both breasts removed all along but deferred to my doctor's opinion. Anyway, this past January I had a mammogram, ultra sound and MRI and all the docs, including the radiologist, agreed it's time to remove the breast. The tissue is so dense that it's hard to spot a problem. The MRI showed areas of enhancement but not considered to be cancer. So, I'm about to undergo my second mastectomy. The good news is that I won't be having any lymph nodes removed this time. I already have one arm that can't be used for blood draws, blood pressure readings, etc., and the docs want to preserve my good arm, if possible. If anything shows up in the pathology, however, then they will have to go back in and take some lymph nodes. For those of you going through your first surgery, it's not a fun experience but definitely not as horrible as I had imagined. I think the drains were my biggest complaint. It's very weird having these tubes coming out from your insides, LOL. As far as pain, it was tolerable - just take it easy and don't try to do too much, too soon. Most of my pain came from the underarm area where I had the ALND. I had to go to physical therapy in order to raise my arm above my head which was required to do radiation therapy. Wishing everyone the best. Kaya",

Not as much pain and can actually move my arm pretty well. I'm heading home this afternoon. I had IV antibiotics in the hospital and will be taking oral antibiotics at home for the next 10 days. I only have one drain (2 last time) and the fluids are not accumulating as much as they did last time. I had morphine to control pain yesterday and Nocor today.

Their main concern was the possibility of an infection in the breast that had no cancer possibly holding up treatment of the cancer. I really wanted both removed at the same time but accepted their opinions. In January of 2017, I had a mammogram on my remaining right breast. The radiologist suggested an ultrasound because of a suspicious area. The ultrasound led to an MRI. The MRI showed only some areas of \"enhancement\" but not cancer. Needless to say, I was a basket case of anxiety during this whole time. Just being back in the breast imaging center was difficult to bear. I literally begged to have the breast removed so I wouldn't have to go through that testing again. Both doctors agreed it would be in my best interest to have a prophylactic mastectomy of my right breast. Due to some upcoming family obligations, the surgery wasn't done until July. But it is done and I don't regret having it done one bit. In fact, it's been a great relief. It's always a difficult, personal decision and I wouldn't advise anyone either way.
