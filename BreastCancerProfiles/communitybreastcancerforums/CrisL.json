I am new here too and not diagnosed, I had 2 mammograms last week and they're sending me for a stereostatic biopsy on Jan 3and I am very scared and been very anxious and stressed out. I was told they compared to last years mammogram and there's a difference and several calcifications showed up. I am very nervous of the stereostatic biopsy and whatever the results may be... can I take any anxiety pills before and during the procedure? Please help me sort this scary time in my life. Praying for you Brooke and everyone going through this...Thank you!",

I pray all of us here will have a healthy body and mind! Amen!!! No, no reports yet. I logged in to my radnet and it says it should be available today. My doctor and medical assistant said it\u2019s just a precaution. I\u2019m so sad and anxious having to go through this... after they said I need stereostatic biopsy, i immediately stopped eating anything with sugar on it. Now I think I Im being too paranoid about what I eat or put on my body. My biopsy is on jan 3.",
