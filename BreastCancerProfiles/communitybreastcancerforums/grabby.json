Hopefully this means that the change in shape and size was hormone related but there is still a definite difference in size and shape that wasn't there before.  I would say it is even more noticeable now my boobs have got smaller. Going to the clinic next week, hope its not too bad because i am still really suffering after my op, do you think it will just be a mammogram? ",

I went to the dr and had to go back 3 weeks later to check it wasn't hormone related and I have now been referred to the breast clinic. Has anyone else had this problem?  Have never heard of it before, should I be worried?   Log in to post a reply",
