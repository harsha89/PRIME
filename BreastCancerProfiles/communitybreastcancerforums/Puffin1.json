I saw a consultant about my family history this Tuesday and had the same GAIL as you did. I was given the options of screening, surgery or an experimental drug. They steered me clear of the drug and I know how aggressive the cancer is in my family so yearly screening wouldn't help me. I've opted for the surgery even though they have referred me to genetics first - the only person in my family to be tested came back inconclusive and there wasn't enough sample to run the test again. The consultant was wonderful but the fact she said I could follow any course I chose regardless of the genetics told me everything I needed to know. I was surprised how alone I feel and how I need to reach out to other people who are going through this or who are on the other side of it. Please add me to the list of people you can talk to and feel free to contact me whenever. As you can tell by the time of this post my sleep has gone out of the window! All the very best to you and you can pm me if you like.",
