Well today i had a phone call from the hospital asking me if i could go in for a biopsy on thursday morning it was a complette shock to me as i have not heard from my BS ,They put me through to the BC nurse who explained the results had come back from the 2nd mamagram they were concerned  and that i had to have the biopsy done while having the mamagram they had sent a letter out and had tried to phone me last week but couldnt leave a message on the anwerphone they  think the letter has been held up in the xmas post.I am so worried as thought from what my BS said it was all over and done with . Im worried about this being done, about waiting for the results  about everything, christmas wont be the same now with this hanging over me Big hugs for everyone snoozles Log in to post a reply",
