Saw the oncologist yesterday and I'll be starting chemo either next week or the week after, FEC x3 then Taxotere x3. I don't think FEC is used much in the US, if at all so I can't compare it to what most of you are having. I've got bone & CT scans next week for staging, so depending on those my regime might be changed. Just waiting for the phone call for a date! My hair is very long, thick and curly so I really think I'd better get it cut shorter before I start - I haven't had short hair for over 25 years so that's going to be a shock!",

My hair is very long, thick and curly so I'm donating it to a charity we have over here that takes donations of hair to make wigs for children who have lost their hair through cancer or alopecia (it's called the Little Princesses Trust). I don't know if there's anything similar in the US but they can take take donations from anywhere. It makes me feel better knowing that someone else will benefit from it so it won't be wasted. The hardest  thing was actually picking up the phone to make the appointment as part of me thinks that maybe they've made a horrible mistake and I won't really have to have chemo anyway, but then common sense takes over again! My hairdresser was really lovely and is going to open her salon after hours for me so we can be private as I was in tears just speaking to her over the phone. I'm not a very image conscious person and never do much with my hair other than tie it up or leave it as a big curly mane, but I've had it long for 27 years and it's just part of me.  Ah well, maybe if I go back to the hair cut I had when I was 18, maybe the rest of me will look 18 again as well... What do you think? Jane xxx",

I had mine cut very short from being very long and curly just before my first chemo last week. After reading these posts I don't think I'll shave it but might get some clippers on it if it gets too annoying.  Jane xxx",
