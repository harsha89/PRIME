Papilloma , then his boss came in and did some blood flow scan thing (???)  and said he felt like it could be something else.  He reassured me that women of my age seldomly have problems and sent me for a mammo.   The mammo didnt show the area at all (he didnt believe it would due to the dense tissue.        I am the \"strong\" one in my family.. the one that holds it all together.  My husband returned in December from a 7 month long deployment.  I consider myself a pretty strong person.. but I am having a really hard time with this.          I am more worried about the procedure than anything else.. LOL.  I HATE HATE HATE needles and having a needle poked into my boob is scaring the hell out of me.           Can an anti-anxiety med be taken before the procedure?  I am thinking of calling them to ask if they can give me something to ease my nerves a little.           THe biopsy is the 16th and I will get the results on the 22nd (of Feb.).
