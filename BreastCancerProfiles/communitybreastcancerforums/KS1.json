My New Year's resolution was to get new garments, but calls to almost 100 DME companies failed to find a NJ Horizon BC/BS in-network provider that will order custom garments. An odd loophole in my BC/BS policy allows me to go to non-NJ BC/BS companies and get in-network DME coverage but ONLY if the garment is delivered to an address within the catchment area of the non-NJ BC/BS. I have relatives in NY, NH, CT and MA who I could have garments shipped to. Does anyone know of an in-network BC/BS providers in NY (Empire or Excellus), NH (Anthem), or MA who does custom lymphedema garments (Juzo glove & sleeve and/or Tribute)? KS1",

Now for my questions  1) if you tape your arm, what is the layout of your taping?   2) On the stepup/stepout site, the kinesiotape is cut into a fan.  Do you do fan the tape and, if so, do you find it more effective than a solid strip?   3) Any suggestions on how to improve the pinky?  I tried a thin strip of kinesiotape anchored on the kinesiotape on the back of the hand, but it came off in a matter of an hour. 4) Do you have any tricks on how to get a night garment on and off without pulling off the tape?  I am curving the edges of the tape and this helps, but it still pulls up. 5)  I have been using small pieces of kinesiotape to tack down the edges of the kinesiotape when it starts peeling off.  Does this seem reasonable?

When I unbandage,  fluid has always accumulated at the spot where the nodule was, and when I MLD (can MLD be a verb?), I really work to get the fluid out.  I have no idea whether this kind of fifbrotic nodule is common, but figured it was worth sharing my experience.  KS1",

Though the garment is big, the fit isn't horrible, and so I've worn the day garment for 10-12 hours the past 2 days.  Both nights when I took it off, my hand was quite a bit bigger then it is when I unwrap or take off the Tribute.   However, wrapping for 12-14 hours reduced the hand back down.   So here's my question:  Do you think it is ok to continue wearing the day garment for 3 weeks until it is altered?  I love the freedom (and coolness) of a sleeve, but I don't want to undo 6 months of 24/7 wrapping KS1 ",

You are so right about returning garments.  I called the DME rep to tell her that I was going to need longer than a 14 day window for returning the garment since I couldn't get an appointment with my LE therapist for 3 weeks.  She said that her company has no specific time limit on returns of custom juzo garments -- just to make sure I wash it before returning it.  I think she feels bad about all of the ordering snafus, but she also said that her DME company is a huge Juzo customer and that they never have trouble with Juzo.  Interestingly, she said that, if a garment is too big, Juzo may be able to alter it, rather than starting from scratch, and alterations only take 3 or 4 days!  On the fitness side, I got out walking early enough to beat the worst of the heat.  I gotta say, even though it is ridiculously warm walking in my Tribute sleeve with gauze wrapped hand, my hand and arm look great when I am done (and much better than the two days I walked wearing the day garment).  Too bad no one makes day garments that work as well as wrapping.

One of the resident experts (Binney, Kira etc.) will probably be by soon, but in the mean time, here's my take: 1) The more lymph nodes that are removed, the greater the risk of LE.  Receiving axillary radiation also increases the risk.  Data are also beginning to come out that chemo may increase the risk.  So you are at high risk for developing LE.  That said, not everyone with these risk factors develop LE 2) There are data that suggest that there may be things that one do (and *not* do -- like excessive stretching early on) that reduces the risk of LE in high risk individuals.  If I were you, I would ask one of your docs to write an RX for a LE consultation.  S/he can get measurements and educate you on these things. 3) Exercise can be both a good thing and a bad thing.  Many experts say that people at risk for LE should wear compression garments while exercising, and some would say that walking counts as exercise.   Lebed (aka HealthySteps) is one particular type of exercise designed for people with LE.  Here's a link www.gohealthysteps.com/  It sometimes takes a while to get an appointment with a LE therapist, so in the mean time, check out the excellent step up/speak out website on things you can do: www.stepup-speakout.org/  Good luck - KS1 ",

Over the courses of 6 or so sessions, the PT was able to \"snap\" 2 cords.  She told me to hyperextend my wrist against a wall to break up some more.  Instead of breaking a cord I tore a ligament in my hand! Arggh. After that I stopped seeing that PT, I just did a lot of gentle stretching on my own several times a day.    6 months post 1st surgery, 4 months post 2nd surgery,I still had cords running from my thumb to my axilla (where they all coalesced into one thick cord  about 1.5 inches across).  After reading all of the papers (a pitiful number!), I decided to rent the Rian LTU 904 laser.  The very first time I used the laser, the huge thick cord diminished in thickness by about 50%.  No popping sound or anything.  It's just when I was done zapping, the cord was half as thick as before I started, and my pain-free range of motion (ROM) much improved.   It could have been chance that it happened right after using the laser.  However, given how much effort had gone into reducing the cords with minimal results, my hunch is that the laser was somehow responsible. I still have cording.   But, as long as I stretch every day (gently!), my ROM is almost normal.  -KS1  PS My surgeon didn't tell me about cording before my surgeries.

All I had to do was throw on some sneakers and go! It was only 50 degrees when I left for my walk, so the warmth of the tribute was welcome (other arm was bare). Not viable in the summer, but it was great to be out. I wore it for 2 hours post exercise, partly to play it safe and partly because I was afraid of what my hand would look like.

The deal breaker for me was that even the small was way too long (much longer than the small Juzo soft off the shelf sleeve, and somewhat looser). I'm petite (5'3\", 105 lbs), but I don't have ridiculously short arms and I don't know if they changed the length, but I would call and ask how LONG the combo is in the size you are considering. Brightlife staff are very nice on the phone (Nancy literally took gloves out of boxes and measured the lengths of each fingers for me), , and they have an excellent return policy. KS Here is the review I wrote for BrightLife. \"Here's my take on the \"in house\" sleeve you sent me. Overall, I would give it a 3 out of 5. The fabric is quite nice. It's a bit softer and smoother than the juzo soft and clearly nicer than the off the shelf or custom jobst class 1 or 2 sleeves. Because the sleeve's fabric is smoother, clothing doesn't cling to it as much, so clothing drapes better. For me, the small sleeve is much too long and somewhat too loose, especially at the wrist. Also, I don't like that the knit changes at the wrist to a ribbed knit. It's hard for me to say whether the sleeve would stay up because it is too long and loose. I personally like a silicon band, which this doesn't have. On the other hand, there are times when a silicon band can irritate (hot days, swimming). It would be nice to have the option of a silicon dot band (like juzo has). To me, one of the real selling points of this sleeve is its affordability. For women who pay out of pocket, this matters. It would be nice to have an inexpensive sleeve that one didn't have to worry about for swimming or doing messy jobs like gardening.\"",

Am I missing something about the SlipEase? I figured out how to don a axilla-to-finger tip Tribute without the SlipEase, but my techniques won't work on a floppy day garment. Any donning suggestions would be greatly appreciated. KS1 Log in to post a reply",

My hand really likes the opera length glove (probably because no double compression at the wrist), but my upper arm gets sore.  I've tried a combined sleeve/glove (basically a glove that extends to the axilla), but it is a real bear to get on.

I had 7 or 8 surgical procedures, more seroma aspirations than I can remember, and high dose radiation to my axilla & arm. I ended up with a very thick cord in my axilla (2 inch in diameter), a golf-ball sized inflammatory mass and a non-healing wound in my axilla (and BPN and LE). The mass/wound was treated with 4 or 5 incision & debridements, antibiotics and high dose anti-inflammatories. It took almost a year, but the mass slowly subsided, and I didn't need a skin graft. With time, stretching, kinesiotape, a lot of work by LE therapists (myofascial release, stretching, deep massage), the thick 2\" cord \"broke\" into many smaller (1 cm) cords that later broke into even smaller cords. It's been 2.5 years, and I still have the smaller cords, but they don't limit my ROM too much.

The old EMG abnormalities are stable.  He didn't test the nerves to my index finger 2 years ago so he has nothing to compare the new index finger results against.  He doubts the index finger problems are caused by BPN progressing because the old abnormalities are stable, and he says the distribution isn't consistent my cervical herniations.  (He said it didn't really matter since the treatment (OT) is the same regardless of the source.)   I've had mild swelling in my hand for 2.5 years, but three weeks ago, it suddenly got much worse, and I haven't gotten it under control despite best efforts,   Finally to my questions. 1)   No matter how gently I do it, after MLD, the hand swelling is worse.  Do you do MLD differently if you have BPN? 2) After MLD, my hand is warm and red.   Is this part of BPN?  (2 years ago my hand would suddenly go from cold /bluish to warm/reddish for no reason, but it got better). Has anyone experienced  the sudden changes in temperature/color with MLD?   3) When I first take off my Tribute (or my DH's newbie attempts at wrapping), my hand looks a bit better, but the swelling returns within minutes. Is the fast re-swelling associated with BPN?  Any suggestions on what to do? 4) Despite heroic efforts by my LE therapist and well-fitting garments, I have yet to find a day garment that doesn't make my hand look worse.  Is this associated with BPN? If so, has anyone found certain day garments work better than others? 5) I'm scheduled to start OT in a week, but to do the exercises I probably will need to take off my Tribute/bandages.  Unless things change, I will puff up fast.  Did OT work for you?   Do you think it is worth the swelling? 6) Lastly, I find wrapping challenging due to limited use of my other arm for non-CA reasons.  For a while I used the farrow glove & gauntlet for daytime compression, so I am intrigued by the farrow wrap for arm. For nighttime, do you do finger  wrapping under the farrow gauntlet?  KS1",

WRT Reynaud's, when I was first diagnosed with BP neuropathy, my doc said it was a \"Reynaud's-like\" phenomenon.  Strange to me that it should come back. You might be right about rebound swelling - I've tried looser finger wraps the past two days and my fingers don't seem to be any chubbier for the change.  Yesterday, when I took off the wraps, I looked good initially, then looked and felt terrible (thought my fingers would burst), but then after about 20 minutes, it looked better again.  Not as good as when I first took off the wraps, but maybe better than I did when this whole mess started 3 weeks ago.  Does this sound like rebounding? I'm not worried about having the bandages off for the eval -- I'm worried having them off for hand exercises.  Part of me thinks the hand flare might be related to the theraband exercises I was doing for my neck.  Holding the band was hard (and tiring)! I saw a very-well-regarded LMT last week who says I have a lot of fibrosis in my wrist.  Maybe it is not only causing the lymphatic fluid from draining from my hand, but also causing the index finger weakness.  I know I speak for many when I say that your help makes LE/BP less difficult to live with.  Thanks & brownies.

It is a disposable single-use system that is cost-effective and eliminates the time and expense of washing and re-rolling bandages while minimizing the risk associated with potential contamination. Additionally, new application techniques make wrapping sessions less taxing for clinicians and patients. The materials used in the two thin layers of the system are safe for skin and were developed with unique stretch and cohesion properties to provand when you have a minute, ide ideal compression and help patients overcome the challenges of wearing bandages during lymphedema intensive therapy.\" If you go to the website given below, there's a link to a long brochure. www.3m.com/intl/ca/english/mar...

Perhaps making a unilateral with back coverage would mean that the unilateral sleeve wasn't ambidextrous, and the company doesn't want to have to make two versions.  Maybe if a bunch of us asked, the company would make a unilateral sleeve with back coverage. (Or a sleeve with two long arms, only one of which has compression - I would love to have matching arms in the winter months.)

If you have a glove that you absolutely cannot wear because the wrist is too tight, if it is too late toreturn the glove, you might consider ripping out part of th seam One other thought .... The default wrist length on custom juzo gloves is 6 cm. This means that there is 6 cm overlap between the glove and sleeve. For me, this is way too much overlap and my hand swells . I have juzo make my custom gloves with a 3 cm wrist length and the result is much less swelling",

I have got to say, for me, one of the most discouraging and depressing parts about LE has been the hunt for THE glove.   I can't count the number of times I have expectantly waited for a glove, hopeful that it would be the one that would make my hand LE manageable, only to try it on and discover it was mismade, mismeasured, or just not right for me.    It took me 4 years and many many attempts with 9 or 10 different makes of gloves, but I think I have finally gotten a glove that fits like a glove.   I am so very very grateful for the folks on this board who gave me encouragement, advice and moral support that I needed to keep trying.  To the folks reading this thread who are struggling to find the garments (especially gloves!), don't give up!   KS1",

If you snag a glove so there is a loop of thread that hasn't broken, turn the glove inside out, and using a needle (or maybe a crochet hook if you have a really fine one), coax the loop so it is on the inside of the glove so it won't be as likely to catch further. You can also use the needle to distribute the pulled loop over a few inches of the fabric. It's painstaking and work, but it looks pretty darn good and can't catch anything.

I've had trouble getting a glove (including custom) that gives compression without turning my fingers funky colors.  (My physiatrist says that this may be because I am thin and have autonomic nervous issues secondary to brachial plexus neuropathy.) My skin seems to be a bit fragile, and I have gotten blisters from some gloves. My hands are a bit weak, and so I find it difficult to move my fingers with thick/firm fabric gloves. With those things in mind, here goes ... Jobst Elvarex Seamless Glove 20-30mmHg.  Material very rough (not as bad as custom elvarex), size 1 too small overall.   size 2 had little compression of thumb and wrist.   Juzo 1101ACFS Glove w/Fingers 20-30mmHg.  Inexpensive. Soft fabric like Medi 95, but fingers very short on both the small and medium (ended at PIP joint).  Overall shape didn't seem anatomically right.   Juzo Expert 3021ACFS Gauntlet w/Finger Stubs.  18-21 mmHg.  Fabric firmer than Juzo1101.  Fingers longer, and seemed more anatomically correct and fingers considerably longer than Juzo 1101ACFS.  Size 1 overall too tight, especially in thumb.   Size 2 a bit generous in the wrist and fingers (no compression from PIP on), but thumb just as tight as size 1.  Note, though this is said to be compression 1, it is listed as 18-21mmHg. Juzo Helastic 3022ACFS Gauntlet with Finger Stubs 23-32mmHg.  Fit and fabric generally the same as Expert 3021ACFS.  Oddly, the 3022ACFS seemed to provide LESS compression than the Expert 3021ACFS.   Medi Glove S8427 3-4 w/FING.  This is the Mediven noncustom.  The material is rougher and not as supple as the Medi 95.  The seems are more prominent. Fingers are longer than on the Medi 95 and the material is different than the rest of the glove.  (Someone on the board and the description says the fingers have 50% compression.)  Generally, the Mediven sizing is a bit more generous than the Medi 95.  The size 2 was a bit too small, and the size 3 a bit too big. The thumb was too loose on both the size 2 and 3.     Medi 95 Glove 30-40mmHg w/Compressive Fingers.  In the past, I've tried the 20-30mmHg in size 2, but it was a bit small.  My fitter suggested trying the class 2 in size 3.  It is too big, with little or no compression in the palm or fingers past the PIP.  The fingers are shorter than the Mediven described above Microfine Farrow.  So far, this is the hands down winner. The fabric is wonderfully silky, supple and the seams very fine.  The fabric is thin enough that don't have to \"work\" to move my hands.  Supposedly, the fingers can be trimmed without the fabric fraying.  Untrimmed, they go to about midway up my nails with the exception of the ring finger which ends at the nail bed.  (For me this is wonderful because my finger tips don't turn as weird color when gloves end at nail.)  Given the material I am not sure how they manage it, but I get good compression.  Sizing - the \"small\" is quite big -- no compression at wrist or some of the fingers.  The extra small fits me well.  I pray the microfine glove is the solution to my 18 month quest for a glove ...      Log in to post a reply",

I would definitely not wear your sleeve without hand protection.  If you are feeling overwhelmed with wrapping the whole hand,  how about just doing a gauze wrap on the fingers, skipping the short-stretch bandages. Keep the gauze on for a couple of hours, and take them off and see what your fingers look like.  If Kira's pics don't work, there are some  YouTube videos of bandaging that you can check out between now and Tues.  When you do see your therapist, ask him/her if you can videotape her bandaging you.  Good luck!  KS1",

For the dorsum of your hand, have you tried extra dorsal compression either built into the glove or maybe a Farrow gauntlet that you wear over a glove? http://www.brightlifedirect.com/farrowwrap-lite-hand-gauntlet.asp http://www.brightlifedirect.com/farrow-basic-hand-wrap.asp (If you haven't already tried it, you might consider a Farrow off-the-shelf glove with the Farrow gauntlet to give you a couple of hours off a day from bandaging.  The Farrow doesn't give a lot of compression, but it is ultra-comfortable if your skin is a mess from bandaging for so long.) http://www.brightlifedirect.com/farrow-microfine-compression-glove-20-30mmhg.asp Here's some suggestions on gauze wrapping under the Tribute.  Wait until your Tribute is a bit stretched out (maybe 3-4 days post washing).  Use 4 cm gauze, rather than 6 cm gauze.  Tuck each piece under where it ends (almost looks like \"basket weaving).  Most people probably use 2 rolls of gauze on their hand, but I use 3 rolls of gauze:  1 roll for thumb & index finger, one for middle and ring finger, and one for pinky and a loop around the base of each of the 4 fingers.  The extra roll give a tad of extra, gentle, dorsal compression, but I also sneak a custom dorsal swell spot in after I put the Tribute on.  Gently ease the Tribute on using a donning glove.  Sneak your finger in to smooth out any bunching that might have occurred.   With respect to drying the Tribute, it takes forever.  I dry my on low/gentle setting using the timer:  usually takes 240 minutes for it to be really dry on the inside.  KS1",

I think the secret to getting Juzo to acknowledge incorrectly made garments and remake them quickly is sending them a very thorough explanation and photos explaining exactly how a garment is wrong.   In this case,  the photos comparing the mismade garment and correctly made garment (using the same measurements) made the mistake so obvious that Juzo started the \"remake\" process before having received the mismade garment. In summary, in the past 10 months, Juzo made 5 custom gloves from the same measurements:  3 fit perfectly, 1 was a tad loose overall (but acceptable), and 1 was completely wrong.  80% success rate.  KS1",

(The links I am giving are just so people can see what I am talking about -- no endorsement of sites intended.) Barely there Gotcha Covered Wirefree (#4546). This is the best bra I have found so far and it is not expensive (about $25). The straps are standard, adjustable straps. The band is very wide and stretchy. It has soft stetchy cups and no seams or tags. It isn't marketed as a post-mastectomy bra and I don't wear forms or equalizers so I can't say for sure, but there are slits in the cupts that look like maybe one could put breast forms. It comes in XS-XL. I am very small (< 105 lbs), especially on top, and the XS fits me well. www.herroom.com/Barely-There-4... Memoi Bralette Anti Bra-Bulge Shaping Support Bra. I was well within the weight guidelines for extra small, so that is what I bought. When it came, it looked like something a 10 year old might wear. It did stretch a lot and I guess it technically might fit, but it was way too tight for someone with LE. I can't decide whether to reorder in Small or Medium. www.legluxe.com/product/womens... Memoi Shaping Bra Tank. Again, the design looked good, but is runs really small. The big advantage it has over the ControlIt or BarelyThere camisoles is that it is a little lower cut in the front so it wouldn't show under V-necked shirts www.legluxe.com/product/womens... Still you lace camisole. This is meant for post mastectomy/lumpectomy. It's pricey($70) but very attractive and can be worn under a jacket. It has a very loose shelf bra. I'm small so the shelf bra is adequate, but there are also slits to put in breast forms.) The straps are narrow, but the camisole comes up pretty high under the axilla. There is a seam running along the side, but for whatever reason, it doesn't irritate me. www.womanspersonalhealth.com/s...

      "Content": "Jul 9, 2011 09:39AM KS1 wrote: Since my 5/18 post, I tried the Memoi Bralette Anti Bra-Bulge Shaping Support Bra in Medium. The medium was still way too tight even though I weigh < 105 and my bust is < 32\", and the medium size guidelines are 130-165 lbs and bust 34-37\". I reordered the Memoi Shaping Bra Tank in medium (size guidelines 4'10\"-5'6\" tall, 120-150 lbs). It wasn't too tight, but the top part was way too long (I'm 5'3\"). I'm returning both and won't reorder in another size. Since my 5/18 post, I also tried 3 other bras. Here's my take on them: 1) Beyond Bare® By Barely There® Womens Invisible Seamless Wirefree Bra (#4108) http://www.tiffanysbras.com/detail.asp?cat=&s=4108&styleno=4108 Sizing: The 34A fit me. Pros: Available at target for $15. Nice and light, lined just enough so no nipples show. If you are looking for a bra to wear under a t-shirt, this is a great option as there are no outward-facing seams. Convertible to a racer back. Cons: The band and bra straps are narrower than the Barely There Custom Flex Fit Wirefree (#4546). The band is also not made of the same soft super stretchy material, and unlike the #4546, there ARE internal seams on the sides. They are low profile and nicely finished, but they are seams nonetheless. All in all, I much prefer Barely There's #4546 and gave this to my daughter (who loves it). 2) Barely There: Custom Flex Fit Light Lift Wire-free Bra (#4028). http://www.tiffanysbras.com/detail.asp?cat=&s=barely+there&styleno=4028 Sizing: The band of the XS fit me, but I didn't like the cups. Pros: about $25. The band is made of the same nice stretchy material as the Barely There #4546 bra. If you are wearing a lower cut top, this might work better than the #4546 which comes up higher. The padding on the bottom (the lift) which gives a slight \"pushup\" affect that might be desirable to some (I didn't like it). Cons: Doesn't go as high up on the side. The band was narrower. I found the #4546 gave more support. 3) Wacoal Pure Intimates Bralette (#835196) http://www.wacoal-america.com/shop/bras/bralette/pure-intimates_835196.html Sizing: The 32A fit me well. Pros: Nice stretchy band, nice stretchy soft material. No seams of any sort. Pretty detailing on top. There is no padding, which makes it very light weight and cool. Cons: The band is very narrow (just one hook), as are the straps. The lack of padding means nipples would show. There is a narrow band of lace along the top of the bra. I could imagine that some would find it irritating. This really is a bralette -- the material going straight across the bust with no shaping, stiching or soft cups or of any sort. This means it tends to flatten the bust a bit. If you are bigger, it probably won't provide enough support. Barely There seems to make several wireless bras with the customflex fit band. The following site seems to carry a large variety of Barely There bras. I haven't tried the company so can't speak to their service, but the prices seem good. www.tiffanysbras.com I just noticed a cotton bralette (Barely There X570) that looks like a cut-off version of one of Barely There's shaping camis. http://www.tiffanysbras.com/detail.asp?cat=&s=barely+there&styleno=X570 Maybe my next target on the Great Bra Hunt!

A while back, someone asked how much custom sleeves & gloves cost.  With respect to sleeves, I only know about the Juzo soft sleeve, since that's the only sleeve I have ordered more than once (I love it!).  SunMed charges my insurance company about $110 for a custom beige, Juzo soft sleeve with silicon border, but when I paid out-of-pocket (i.e., NOT through insurance) about 8 months ago, SunMed only charged me about $90 .  (On their website, they say that they have special prices for self pay clients.)  About a year ago, BrightLife charged for $112.50 for an identical garment.   Last year I got a custom juzo expert silver sleeve with attached glove and pocket for swell spot.  SunMed charged my insurance a whopping $900+. I just ordered through SunMed a custom juzo expert glove (not silver, no bells or whistles) and a custom juzo soft sleeve.  The total price was about $330, so that means the custom glove was about $220 when insurance is involved.  KS1",

Binney says that this is not uncommon and is called \"rebound swelling.\" Gloves are really tricky, and I think many people  go through a  long period of trial and error before they get a glove that \"works\".  Of the custom gloves, I have tried Jobst Elvarex \"classic\" (the worst), Jobst \"seamless\" (bad), Mediven (ok, but not fantastic), Barton Carey (not enough compression), Juzo silver expert (second favorite) and Juzo regular expert (my favorite).  I have been using the same Juzo measurements since Sept 2012, and am very happy with my Juzo class 1 expert glove (at least when it is manufactured correctly ... there have been a few I had to send back because of manufacturing glitches).  With respect to wearing a night garment during the day, if you are talking about the Solaris Tribute, I think the problem is three fold.  First, you don't have much use of the hand, second, the hand isn't protected enough, and third, it's very hot!  I took the finger \"spacers\" out of my Solaris Tribute and wear it with my fingers gauze wrapped every night.  It works like a charm and it's much easier to just wrap the hand than to do the whole mummy treatment!  When I was making the transition from wrapping to day garments, I would often wear the Tribute with gauze wrapped fingers during the day.  I still sometimes wear Tribute/wrapped fingers during the day for long drives, plane rides. I've never tried it, but Jovipak makes a \"combi\" garment.  The combi is kind of like a night garment, but it can be worn during the daytime.  It's on page 7 of the following pdf: http://www.jovipak.com/2012_JoViPak_Product_Guide.pdf KS1",

The fabric looks a bit strange (cup half empty:  looks like chain mail; cup half full:  a grey/gold sparkly thing), but I find it to be a little easier on the skin.  They are very expensive:  my custom opera length (finger tip to-elbow) glove was over $400, and my custom finger tip-to-axilla was over a 1,000!   If I recall correctly, your main problem is your hand and lower arm, right? Once you find a fabric that your skin can tolerate, if your problem is mainly your hand/lower arm, you might try an opera length glove.  Opera length gloves are much easier to get on than fingertip-to-axilla glove/sleeve combo, they don't require a silicon band to stay up and they eliminate the double compression at the wrist problem. When I am just sitting around typing with arms relaxed and not dangling, I can wear an opera glove for several hours and my hand does fine.  KS1",

My DME company just told me that BC/BS is demanding a letter of medical necessity (and not just an RX like in the past) for compression garments that are < 30 mm Hg. The DME company said that BC/BS is now arguing that < 30 mm Hg is not \"medically necessary or therapeutic\" and so the letter has to say specifically say why I need lower compression (and not 30-40 mm Hg). My understanding is that 20-30 (i.e., class I) was very commonly used for upper extremity LE and was considered \"therapeutic\". Has anyone had a similar experience recently? I'm sure I can get a letter from the doctor who I have seen in the past for LE, but it's going to be months before I can get an appointment. Does anyone know of any articles that say that class 1 is appropriate for (at least some cases) of LE. I could probably convince my PCP to sign a letter for me, but I am going to have to draft it, and I'm going to have to cite studies. KS1 Log in to post a reply",

Is putting fluff in the palm a bad idea? 3) The garment slips down a bit as I sleep and I do get some crease marks at the elbow.  Is this normal?  Do you think I should get the fit checked? Despite the above, I love the solaris -- except for 1 region, when I take it off, my LE looks basically the same as my other arm and my arm feels smooth and the skin loose.  In fact, yesterday, I didn't put my daytime garment on until 6 pm, and my arm didn't ache at all until then and it looked pretty darn good (though the skin maybe was a bit tighter). Which leads me to my 4th question ... 4) Long run, is not wearing a compression garment for part of the day bad for LE?  I have mild LE and I really don't want to do something that increases the chances of it getting worse.

Another thought is that maybe you are responding to double compression where the glove overlaps with the sleeve.  How big is the overlap between the sleeve and the glove?  The standard wrist length for a Juzo custom is 6 cm, but I find that when the overlap is that great, my hand swells, so my therapist tells them to make the glove with a 3 cm wrist length.  If they did a 6 cm wrist length, you could ask them to cut the length down.  (Juzo will alter the length of garments, but if the problem is circumference, they remake the whole garment.)   You could also ask your therapist to add a cm or two to the circumference of either the cuff of the glove or the sleeve so you don't get as much compression at the wrist. If your arm LE isn't too bad, maybe you can try just wearing the glove and see how it goes.   If your hand does ok, it suggests that double compression might be the culprit You might also try wearing the glove UNDER the sleeve.  Not sure why, but I get less prominent indentations when I wear the glove under the sleeve instead of the more standard over the sleeve. A final option is to ask your therapist for an all-in-one sleeve/glove combo.  That eliminates the double compression completely, but  the all-in-one glove/sleeve combo can be a bear to get on!  If your problem is mainly your hand and forearm, you might be able to get away with an opera-length glove (that ends at the elbow).  I have had finger tip-to-axilla sleeve/glove combo and an opera-length glove, and the opera-length glove is MUCH easier to get on..  KS1",

In the second case study, a woman who has been wearing compression garments for 5 years has a normal L-Dex and is told she no longer has to wear garments all of the time.   Here's my question -  if a person has well-fitting garments, and has a bioimpedance test done immediately upon removing them, won't the L-Dex scores look pretty good (perhaps even normal)?  If a clinician is deciding whether a patient needs garments, it seems like the test should be done when garments have NOT been worn for several days or weeks.   More generally, I share Binney's worry.  if a person is doing a good job managing their LE and is compliant about wearing garments, the person's L-Dex score might be normal and insurance could  refuse to cover the very  compression garments that are keeping the person's LE under control.   On a possibly related note, I have noticed that touch sensitive devices sometimes don't respond when I use my LE hand.  I'm beginning to think that this happens more often in the evening (when I tend to be more swollen) and on bad days.  Most modern touch sensitive devices are capacitance based, not pressure based.  I wonder if the capacitance of an edematous hand is less than of a normal hand.  If so, we could use our cell phones as a  poor man's bioimpedance device for monitoring LE ...  Now there's a specialized ap!  KS1",

I have done pre-and post-MLD measurements, and there is absolutely no difference.  While MLD seems to do nothing, I think deep breathing may be beneficial.  I had a level 1& 2 AND with 22 lymph nodes removed.  The surgeon missed a node.  This node is always enlarged (biopsied and benign), but when I do very deep breathing for 5+ minutes, the lymph node gets noticeably smaller, softer and less tender.  I guess I am looking for \"permission\" to just do deep breathing and skip the MLD.  KS1",

The material and the seams on my juzo silver expert gloves seem to be much fragile than on my regular juzo expert gloves.  After < 2 months, my juzo silver glove is pretty shot.  I'm hoping that with the cooler weather my skin will tolerate the regular fabric juzo because replacing gloves every 2 months is mighty pricy!  KS",

The criterion for the diagnosis of lymphedema was obtained by perimetry with the use of a measuring tape, with measurements obtained after adjustment of the dominant arm and time since diagnosis [7,14]. Measurements were taken at seven points: at the inside of the elbow in the supine position (taken as the zero point), and three measurements above and below this point, at intervals of 7.0 cm. Lymphedema was characterized as when the difference between the affected limb and the contralateral (control) limb, using at least one measurement, was equal to or greater than 2.0 cm [7,12,14,17].\"   KS1",
