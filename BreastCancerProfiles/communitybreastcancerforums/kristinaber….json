Hope you are doing well!  TheOu ~ what an exciting birth story! I know Stanford is a world-class hospital with all the latest technology. Let's hope I don't need it (but if I do I'm glad you are around). Take care! ~Tina",

My breast looks ok, but it just feels weird & painful. SO I will get it checked out. I hope I get tested as rapidly as you! The waiting is the hardest part (that's a Tom Petty song too). My OBGYN has been on vacation so I've already had to wait (I trust her so no one else will do). I'm glad you are fighting the good fight! That's what I will do too. No choice! At least we are in it together. ~Tina",

I think I wll request a genetic test no matter what this outcome. The other thing is that I have been dealing with a hip injury (broken January '08, then surgery & recovery ~still limping after 9 months on crutches) for so long & now this. My poor body! I feel as though I willnever get my life back on track. But you are an inspiration! I am relieved to be able to meet you ladies here & express my fears. Thanks so much!",
