I am having my notes faxed to me and a friend of mine (who has family history of bc and had a double mastectomy last year) is coming over this afternoon.  I am begining my education on this journey, I'll fill you in as I find stuff out. Thanks for your reply-- I know I'm not the only one, it's just nice to  'know' it for real.",

(The reason I found it was because it was sore) It was also the week before my period. I waited til after my period to let it concern me... I felt encouraged because of the stats that I found.... 80% not cancer... cancer doesn't hurt... Saw my OB Jan 4, 2008. Had a sono done Mon Jan 7,2008.  Had an appt with a surgeon on Thu Jan 10, 2008. Had a needle biopsy... got results Fri 1/11/08.  Had decided that we would have it removed regardless.. Results were benign, with some suspicious or abnormal cells... Dr felt they were probably just cells damaged during harvesting process, no major concern. Scheduled surgery for 2/1/08. Today on 2/4/08 lab results show cancer...  Plan is to go back to surgery get more tissue and a lymph node and follow up with radiation.  I wonder if the lump is a blessing in disguise... wouldn't have found this with out it... has anyone ever had similar experience.  I'm still in shock, also have strong faith that I am in God's hands and he will see me through this. I feel that he put the lump there so the cancer could be found...before it was too late. I've been on the phone with family/friends--sounding more like a news reporter than a cancer patient..... any coments appreciated thanks God Bless Dx 2/4/2008, IDC, <1cm, Stage I, Grade 3, 0/2 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
