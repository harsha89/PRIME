I'm having a unilateral mastectomy on 7/14/16 and ordered knitted knockers after seeing the site on here. I got them and they are very cool. I'm not picturing myself spending a ton of money on silicone inserts to match my right side which is a B. I think I'll be fine just going with something light weight to fill out the other side of a regular bra. I have read that Nordstrom will sew pockets free of charge into a regular bra, so I may try that if the knitted knocker moves around on me. Around the house, I will definitely be bra-less!",
