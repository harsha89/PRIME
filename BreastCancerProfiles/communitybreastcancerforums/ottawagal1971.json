    "Content": "ottawagal1971 wrote: One lump under left armpit is really painful and is getting bigger but doesn't feel like a cyst, it is more like an oval shape or shape of an eye.  I can barely lift my left arm up because of the shooting pain The other lump is under right armpit, this one is size of a pea and doesn't hurt or anything, just feels weird No other symptoms, am going to see doctor tomorrow.  I am used to having cysts as I am prone to them, but the one on left doesnt feel like cyst, it is more hard to the touch, but it is painful I read that breast cancer lumps are not painful, but a cousin got diagnosed with an aggressive form or breast cancer in her 40s, so I am a little freaked out.
