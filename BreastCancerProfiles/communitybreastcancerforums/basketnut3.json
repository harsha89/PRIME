My skin broke down the last week during the boosts.  It was oosing yellow stuff so put on antibiotic cream.  It just kept getting worse after rads were done.  Finally called the nurse who told me to use aquaphor and it cleared up and healed.  Thank goodness for my surgical cami that would hold my prostetic.  I was too big to teach lopsided even though I know no one would have said anything to me.  Still have tired spells.  Is it due to chemo, rads, surgery, or laziness...who knows.  But the tiredness during radiation did help me get off my sleeping pills.",

My husband could not look at me without a shirt on at any time after surgery.  He couldn't even help me with my drains. He is now with someone 16 years my junior with breasts and I am facing bilateral DIEP on my own before I lose his health insurance. Everyone deals with these issues in different ways, I just had to get one who couldn't deal with any of it and wouldn't get any help.  Sorry I'm so negative, but after 25 years of marriage and 30 years together I find this a little pathetic.  My positive side is I know God has a plan for me and there is someone out there who will love me for who I am.",
