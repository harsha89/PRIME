If I had known I would have insisted he do it or ask the onco to order it before my appointment.  Without the info I feel like the appointment with the onco was a waste of time and now I am dealing with another 2 weeks of anxious waiting.",

I then called someone I know who is a radiology onco who told me the same thing and said that chemo is not going to have any greater effect on my odds. He seemed to advise not to do it becuase of the short and more importantly long term SE.  I am overwhelmed and want to make the right decision.  I don't want someone to tell me 2 years from now that I've got a brain tumor because I didn't make the right treatment choice.  Any advise or suggestions?",

My second question is about the expanders.  Mine is pretty uncomfortable all the time.  Is this normal?  Will it ever feel like a part of me or will I always be aware of this thing stuck under my chest wall?",

But it could just be that the stress of the whole thing is just piling up right now. I woud love to hear from someone who has made it through this about when you start to feel like you have your life back and if you have any tips to help get there.",

It lasts only a few seconds and it seems to come when I am moving from a reclined position to sitting up, but in the past 12 hours it has happened more frequently.  Has anyone had that experience?  Also, I read in one of the posts that they were told to swab the drain with alcohol.  We weren't told to do that and I'm worried about infection.  The drain is pretty uncomfortable and I can't wait to get it out!  I was surprised at how wiped out I felt after the surgery.  It really took several days to get some energy back.  But, hopefully things will just get better each day.",
