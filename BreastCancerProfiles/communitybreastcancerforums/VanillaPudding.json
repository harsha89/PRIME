      "Content": "VanillaPudding wrote: I have busy breasts.  Very busy.  I am 43 with extremely dense breast with very little adipose tissue, severely fibrocystic also.  Mammograms looks almost entirely white.  I have been having Mammos/US and alternating MRI's every 6 months for 3 years.  Every report from the Radiologist is pages long, listing everything possible going on in these busy breasts.  I have been told I have so many cysts they are inumeral to count!  My Mammo/US appointment usually takes around 2.5 hours for all the imaging.  I have always thought they were overly thorough. So why do I have a suspected Fibroadenoma that has been hiding since 2011 and it was never mentioned on any subsequent reports.  The reports list everything else.  Now I do have mostly complex and complicated cysts, so could it have been mistaken for that?  The last time the Fibro was mentioned was 2011.  Nothing until last week when my report mentioned the solid mass (small just 1cm) but palpable.  I am very cystic in that quadrant. The new report says unchanged since 2011, but it was not ever tested then. I go every 6 months for some test or another. I am fine having cystic breasts, leave them alone!  They hurt but I would not want to start draining the cysts, where would you start?  I just do not like anything solid in me without being tested to prove it is nothing.  My 2 other Fibroadenomas were tested and biopsy came back as complex Firoadenomas.  They both had Apocrine Metaplasia, Usual Ductal Hyperplasia, and Sclerosing Adenosis.  Everything Benign.  I also have a prominent ductal pattern, Fibrocystic breasts, simple cysts, complicated debris filled cysts, and complex cysts, some that are septated, clustered, some complicated loculated septated csyts, and not to leave out nipple discharge.  If there is a benign condition, I have it.  My sister has ADH/ALH/and FEA Bilateral along with every other begnign condition like me.  Her breast are a perfect breeding ground for Cancer.  She has tried Tomoxifen and Evista, without success.  No other family history. I am mad this suspected Fibroadenoma was lost.  I asked the tech what it was and she said looks like a new finding.  I have had enough imaging to know what I am looking at.  It was clearly not a cysts.  Why am I Birads 3, see you in a year?  Isn't Birads 3 short term follow up?  I have already called my PCP to schedule simple biopsy.  I am just mad this was missed and never tested.  I just want it to be proven to be a funky cysts or Fibroadenoma, then see you next year.  Am I overreacting?  Should I just wait 6 months for MRI appointment?   Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "VanillaPudding wrote: I have very busy breasts.  6 biopsies, all benign.  I do have many risk factors that elevate my risk though.  My question is this, how do I calculate risk when referring to family history.  My fraternal twin sister had a bilateral preventative mastectomy due to so much atypia.  She had ADH, ALH, FEA, PASH and several other findings on final pathology, but no active cancer.  She was told it was not a question of if she would get Breast Cancer, but when before making the decision. When I complete any risk calculators, the results vary so much on whether I say yes to family history or not.  All of my reports over the years say I am high risk due to family history.  (We go to all of the same facilities.)  I am going to a large University Hospital in 2 weeks, the same place my sister had her mastectomy and am just trying to get my list of questions together.  Anyone have insight on this?

I know the whole \"remove or not remove\" a Fibroadenoma issue has been discussed before.  Given my age, and history of Complex\" pathologies I think I might push for excision.  I am not really sure what I want to do.  This stress every 6 months is getting to me.

      "Content": "VanillaPudding wrote: I have breasts that feel like bags of marbles.  The variety pack of marbles, big, small, everywhere.  My last ultrasound in May was an ordeal as usual. The techs at the imaging facility all cringe when I walk in, no joke.  I am not sure what I should do next.  Has anyone gone to a larger facility with proven benign findings only?  I guess I want to get an opinion from a true specialist about my breast issues. If it is a benign issue, I have it.  My sister had ADH, ALH, FEA, PASH as well as the same amount of cysts.  She has had a Mastectomy and reconstruction  .Following is my last U/S report.  I will try to actually shorten this:  All measurements are cm. Specific ultrasound findings on right are as follow:  1.0 palpable cyst at 12:00; multiple additional cysts at 12:00; some of which are mildly complicated, measuring .5, .3, .9, .4, .8, .7, 1.1 cm, .4, .5, .4, .6; cysts at 1:00, several having a complicated appearance, measuring .8, .5, .7, .8, .5, .4, .5, .3, and .6cm; 1.0 cm cluster cyst at 2:00; .5 complicated cyst at 2:00; .7 complicated cyst deep at 3:00; additional cysts at 3:00; measuring .4, .5, and .7cm; segmentally dilated duct at 5:00, measuring 1.2cm x .3cm; complicated cysts at 5:00 measuring .7, .7;  cysts at 6:00, having mildly complicating features, measuring .5, .3, .5cm; cysts at 7:00, some of them complicated, measuring .5, .6, .5, and .4cm; .8cm complicated cyst at 8:00, 1.2cm at 9:00;multiple cyst at 9:00some of them complicated, measuring .8, .7, .4, .9, .7, .8, .5. .4, .5, and .6cm; 2.4cm complicated septated cyst at 9:00; segmentally dilated debris-filled dust in the 10:00 position; cysts at 10:00 measuring .2, .7, 1.3cm the latter having clustered appearance; cysts at 11:00 measuring .5, .4, .7, some having a mildly complicated appearance; and a .5cm complicated cyst at 10:00.  also at 10:00 is a .8cm and .4cm x .7cm hypoechoic mass, either representing a cyst complicated with thick internal debris, or a solid lesion such as a fibroadenoma.  This requires additional follow up. Specific findings on the left are as follows;  1.3cm palpable cyst at 6:00 with an adjacent .5cm cyst; .4cm hypoechoic solid nodule versus complicated debris-filled cyst at 12:00; having benign sonographic features; additional cysts at 12:00 some of them complicated, measuring .7, .5, .4, 2.3cm, .3, .5, .3, .4, 1.0, and .7cm; cysts at 1:00 measuring .3, and .4cm having mildly complicating features; 2.0cm cluster cysts at 1:00; multiple cysts at 2:00, some of them complicated, measuring .5, .5, .4, .4, .6, .6, 1.0, and .4cm, largest having a clustered appearance; multiple complicated cysts at 3:00, measuring .6, .6, .8, 1.4, .4, .8, .5, .6, .6, and 1.2cm; segmentally dilated duct at 3:00; multiple cysts at 4:00, measuring 1.5, .5, .6, .9, .8, .7, .5, and .5vm; complicated cyst at 5:00, measuring .8, .9, and .6cm; cysts at 6:00measuring .5, 1.0, and .4cm; probable complicated cyst at 7:00, measuring .9cm; .4cm cyst at 7:00; 1.1cm and .9 cyst at 9:00; complicated cysts at 10:00 measuring .4, .6, .7, .8, and .3cm, the largest having a clustered appearance; .9 complicated cyst at 11:00 posteriorly; .4 cyst at 11:00; and a .9 cm cluster cysts at 11:00. Recommendation is continued surveillance.  I have extremely dense (further categorized as \"severe\") breast. I have had 6 biopsies so far with all benign findings including fibroadenomas, Apocrine Metaplasia, Moderate Usual Ductal Hyperplasia, Sclerosing Adenosis, Clustered microcalcifications, columnar cyst formation and fibrosis.  Any recommendations besides watch and wait every 6 months? -Signed, Sore boobies Log in to post a reply",
