It's firm, non-palpable feels strongly attached but not bony......\u2026.hmmm I'm not good at explaining this lol. I'm thinking fat too (fat pad or fat necrosis). I was in MO office this week for 3 month check up however I was discussing the lump on my spine thoracic and cervical area. It has developed months after chemo and is about 3 inches x 3 inches. I look like a camel now. Told MO must be from the weight gain of months of steroids. He felt it and thinks it is a lipoma fatty b9 tumor because it is palpable. Said we would watch it to see if it grows more. Well when I read about lipomas they typically run in families and yes you guessed it No One in my Family has those! Further read that lipomas continue to grow sometimes.  Anyway, I had not felt the one on my chest at that time so of course here I sit wondering about it. But it too may just be from all the Fat I have gotten from this whole darn mess! ",

Am pretty sure one on back near neck is lipoma but will probably have biopsy before removal just to be sure. If it where to be a sarcoma rather than lipoma they have to be very careful when removing. The one on my chest feels very different....",

Having the I don't want to go but want to get this over struggle today. I am using the Dignicap system which is a stationary machine. They have me wet my hair comb with wide tooth comb straight back and they place the HEAVY cap on my head that is attached to the cooling machine. It is strapped real tight under my chin and covers my ears (can't hear the whole time I am in treatment). It is started a half hour before chemo, so while predrugs are given (I wear during all chemo bags then another 2 hours after....ugggh). At least, I do not have to coordinate dry ice and coolers and I don't need a team of people to help that I didn't have. To go to the ladies' room, I must have the nurse disconnect the head piece from the cooling machine and I have to hurry so it doesn't warm up too much. Ever tried to paper the toilet seat in a hurry? It always slides off lol.....At the cost of $325. per treatment (my Christmas present to my self from retirement savings), I sure hope the Dignicap system will save most of my hair. My first treatment was Dec 8 and today was my first Big shed. I am only the 2nd or 3rd person to try this at Park Ridge facility in Illinois. It isn't easy not washing my hair everyday and using free of anything shampoo and zero hair products and no blowdryer-----all this equals WILD hair for me! It will be worth it if I keep my hair. Today, I took my pittie boys in for their nails. My groomer had just had her eyebrows tattooed and eyeliner. I must say my brows have thinned a great deal due to perimenopause......thinking that chemo may finish them off so this may be an option since I am so slow at using brown pencils etc...the woman who does it is a tattoo makeup artist who also does nipples for breast cancer survivors. She is located in St. Charles IL which is not far from me. BCS2016 Yes, I am having eye twitching in my left eye. Now, skin on my fingers is peeling terribly. I use gloves for cleaning dishes, baths and around the home with Lysol wipes. I apply OKeefe's hand repair it helps. Still have numbness in fingertips. At least the extreme itching stopped. Hot flashes are annoying. I dress in layers. The peel off and put back on should count as my workout, however since it does not back to the treadmill I go. Guilty of too much cookies over the holidays. I normally don't care for sugar treats have always liked salty chips crackers but since the metallic taste for some reason sugar tasted better to me. Now, I must get back to veggies healthy eating. Lately, only wanted toast, coffee and cookies......Not good :( As the metallic taste is going away it is easier to return to veggies.....but back to chemo tomorrow. At least my family is tired of the treats and we have thrown them out and filled fridge with fruit and veggies again. I certainly dread the nausea, heartburn, burping, bloating and oh yes that ach all over flu feeling that will be coming after tomorrow :P All I can think about is how I wish there was a promise that after this chemo that we would all be cancer free for the rest of our lives.......I could certainly take the treatments better knowing that. And of course a bigger wish is that we find a way to identify these genes and stop them before they create cancer in us! Thinking of you all and wishing everyone the best! Take care!",

Plus I have to take extra steroids for 6 days due to burns and blisters on my fingers-----not helping with sleep! As for the hot flashes, I found my cooling pillow in my closet the other day that is perfect now at night with hot flashes. When I have a hot flash I flip it over and the other side is instantly cooler like an ice pack with a light towel-----perfect really helps cool me down fast :) Finally got a change on prescription for nausea now on Zolfran what a difference! Also, have a prescription for heart burn another HUGE difference---not as sick this time and this is my 3rd TC treatment. Also, I believe oncologist adjusted my premeds due to my fingers and other side effects. The combo made me feel better and I am thankful for that.----Glad I mentioned my issues and that they took care of it. I am in the 'flu' feel from Neulasta today...hope it last only one day that would be nice. I noticed someone mentioned they didn't have to take Neulasta on their last treatment perhaps that will be the same for me. I would be happy to skip it! Still using the Dignicap system in an attempt to save as much hair as possible. I have major thinning on the top of my head. Very worried that I will lose more in that spot from this and my last treatment. I had the nurse place more pressure in that spot so will see if that helps. I have experienced lost of thinning all over, however I had thick hair so others do not notice.....they can only see the top thinned on scalp. Not sure how I will cover that when working again. My hot flashes are so bad I can hardly wear a cap to my car when leaving the treatment with wet hair. I just feel like my entire face and head are on fire when the hot flashes hit me!

Unlike when my port was placed there was only the doctor working all other staff was busy in the room but not near me.

While the tech wheeled me back to recovery, he said the doctor hit my artery, which I already figured out.-----I decided not to share that with my MO figuring she wouldn't believe my short removal was an hour and a half! ---By the way the port was not a choice instead it is the only way they give chemo.

Our timelines are very close as my biopsy was in Aug 2016 and surgery Sep 2016. Thanks to BarredOwl's information I will be requesting a referral for a qualified lymph therapist and I may ask for a pain management center as well. I honestly thought I would know Lymphedema from the hospital DC papers stating that my arm would be swollen as in noticeably if I was experiencing Lymphedema. I have my first oncologist appointment this Friday and have been so concerned that I may need chemo that I believe that I missed the Lymphedema symptoms (aching arm, numb hands etc..) Also, just learned from BarredOwl's informative post that Lymphedema can be in my chest, trunk, underarms etc...which I have a great deal of swelling now that I went a couple of days without my compression vest and then tried my week 2 stretches. Not that my surgeon told me to keep wearing my compression vest. He actually told me I could take it off after my first day home and shower then wear a tank top. I chose to keep wearing it until week 2.  The one I ordered had not come in yet so I finally HAD to remove and wash it! I'm just thinking that if my surgeon, his nurse, and my nurse navigator do not help me with this pain management then maybe my oncologist would. I just want to feel good enough to do what I need to do to get well. And I remember my father's quad bypass recovery. He was on pain meds while doing home stretches and while he was in PT. While I was hoping to be only in discomfort and mild pain that OTC meds would handle, if I need prescription meds to do stretches and 15 min walk and to sleep I am willing to use them to help me move through this recovery and get back to normal sooner. Thank you for responding to my post. It makes me feel my concerns are valid. It is a help to hear other's experiences! I will be thinking of you as well and wishing you and all of us the best!  ",

I started chemo Dec 8th 2016 and could not stop thinking 'what if' then on New Year's Eve my family member was killed on a hunting trip by an assault rifle that slipped in the middle of the night, fell to the ground and shot him while sleeping (age 30). I was reminded that I could be gone tomorrow from something else the same as I am reminded by 13 yr and 20+ year BC survivors that I could be here until I'm 90 or 100 but not without the FIGHT as they all had their treatment! Congrats on your Halfway point that is a major Celebration! Just think Spring is around the corner for us too! HUGS!!! Bareclaws-----Because of you, I try to walk on my treadmill as much as possible. All I could think when I started chemo is if she can, so can I. Thanks for the inspiration and keeping me moving! Are you taking TC? Are you almost finished with chemo?",

Also, I kinda just felt I would rather be symmetrical from the start. I also knew that I did not want reconstruction. I will be wearing mastectomy bras with the foam inserts not heavy prosthetics. Do I believe that will make me cancer free? Not necessarily. I believe more in the biomarkers. I believe that science has identified several of these markers yet we still do not understand all there is we need to know about them at this time. It was interesting to listen to the reactions of my extended family on my decision to have a bilateral mastectomy. It was pretty much split down the middle among 14 women in my family regarding what they personally would chose to do. Thankfully all supported the decision I made for me. If I had been questioning or struggling with the choice, I would not have removed the other. It was something that I had thought I would do if I was ever diagnosed.----hope this is a help. I believe everyone's choice is the right one for them. As for the testing part, I will know more April 19 my next MO appointment is supposed to be what she called my survival plan. Once before she mentioned blood test as follow up. She told me that they only order scans if there where symptoms (that worries me as I think symptom testing may be too late) or if blood test show elevated cancer markers. Guess I will learn more on the 19th. I remember my surgeon for BMX telling me this is TREATABLE and my MO saying it is CURABLE. Each has a Very different meaning. I wonder which one IT IS...........

Had blood work prior to my treatment yesterday morning and my doctor said it looked as if I had not had a chemo treatment. Don't know if that is because that was my first treatment or due to the Neulasta pump that self injects 27 hours after treatment. Less dizziness yesterday during my second treatment. Maybe due to taking Claritan before. However heartburn indigestion started right away even though I had Pepcid that morning. Noticed when I ate dinner at 7pm last night that the metallic taste was back. Yuck! Also was very fatigued by 9pm last night. Up this morning with nausea so started meds for that with crackers. Fatigue is still very strong this morning. BCS2016------- Good to know that your treatment was uneventful! Glad no scary reaction or any thing that might have upset your daughter. I'm with you on the steroids. Always happy after the 3rd day with those is over. Chickensandgoats------That is nice you get a printout on your bloodwork. I'm going to ask for a copy of mine next visit. Pamela23------So I had the Dignicap Nurse check her records for the actual number of people who have used the system at Oncology Specialist Park Ridge IL. She apologized and told me that I was not the 2nd but the 4th patient to use Dignicap. She believes due to the cost. She told me that the representative of the company told her that most of the facilities they try to put the system in do not have the space for the equipment and aren't able to allow the extra 2 hours after treatment for people to sit attached to the machine because they have tight schedules in order to get all chemo patients in and out! That's why my nurse had me in at 8 am for bloodwork, doctor follow up, cold cap fitting with pre chemo drugs, Then chemo starts around 10:30am and I don't finish with chemo until 2pm then stay until 4pm due to Dignicap extra cooling and warm up time. KB870- Yay! Great news on your bloodwork and being good to go for 4 treatments! Dizzygirl-----I'm with you thinking there are a lot of us from Illinois! Believe me if I had thin hair, I doubt I would have gone the Dignicap cold capping because of all the extra time plus I must drive much further for treatment. That 2 hours after treatment to complete cooling then slow warm up for scalp really makes me crazy as I just want to leave that chair. BTW, just curious are you on Neulasta? Wondering if your BC dropped even though you were being given a preventative. In fact, is anyone else on Neulasta pump or injections and experienced a blood count drop? Thought Neulasta was to keep us on track so we can get through treatments with out a bump in the road. I have had a several people ask why I am having chemo since my clinical markers are low IDC 1.3 cm, node negative, stage 1, grade 2, ER 85% PR 60% HER 2-, however my ki67 35-40% Oncotype 26(intermediate) & mammaprint high risk luminal B. After 3 oncologist opinions' it was my understanding that they consider the biomarkers the new way to decide if breast cancer should be treated with chemo. All 3 did not like my ki67, 2 went mostly by ki67 with oncotype and the 3rd didn't like ki67, oncotype and mammaprint. All 3 recommended Taxotere with Cytoxan 4 treatments. Wishing everyone well!",

I feel angry that No One ever discussed managing pain with me other than to say that I should be on OTC after the first week. There is no way I can perform post op exercises without prescribed pain meds. I see others have been ok on OTC which makes me worry that something must be wrong. I have recovered from 2 broken feet at different times taking few pain meds and throwing out the rest of the bottles and using OTC mainly. Have always been told I have a high pain tolerance which is making me feel all the more that perhaps something is wrong when ice, heat, OTC and rest are not working.

After reading more about Lymphedema, I believe this must be what is happening to my chest/trunk/arms and underarms. I was aware of the arms, however I had never read about all the other areas on our bodies that could be affected. Since I removed my compression vest to wash and air dry, I noticed swelling in several areas. At first thought swelling was simply from surgery, now I'm thinking Lymphedema. My discharge papers never mentioned propping my arm up......jeeze and it has been aching like crazy. Plus, my surgeon told me last week to use a heating pad on my arm and chest not the ice. I did speak with my surgeon's nurse today. I explained that I was following the simple week 2 stretching exercises. While they were a bit uncomfortable as I performed them it wasn't what I would call painful. I explained that the pain set in about 2 hours later with no mercy. My surgeon is out until Thursday of this week and the nurse will speak with him regarding pain meds. Thankfully, I have a follow up with the surgeon the following week. I will ask about maybe sticking with week 1 stretches for now. I just didn't want to cause any issues from Not stretching/exercising. The link step up speak out is just the opposite of my surgeons recommendations. Looks like they know far more than my surgeon :( I had SNB and No reconstruction. I will be 50 years old this Feb and to me the reconstruction just wasn't important ( not meaning anything negative towards anyone who does reconstruction as I firmly believe that it is a personal choice). This pain issue has been terribly upsetting as like most I am right-handed and my right side was my tumor and SNB. Also because I did not want reconstruction, I had a plastic surgeon perform my closures to reduce the chance of 'dog ears' under my arms. In closing the PS cut under my arms nearly to my back to avoid 'dog ears'. Maybe this was a bad idea. I still can not wash and dry my own hair! I will be asking for a qualified Lymph therapist and perhaps a pain management center referral from my surgeon. Pretty sure my Aetna Insurance will not pay for PT, as they didn't when my daughter had surgery for a different health issue. On my list to double check. Thanks much for all the help!  ",

They call them exercises however they are stretches using a cane while lying on your back. Sort of like a mopping in mid air and one is to hold cane with both hands while on back and slowly raise above your head to stretch. As I mentioned above, it was uncomfortable but not painful while stretching. Rather, it was 2 hours later the severe pain hit me. I promise a grown man would have rushed to the ER! I realize these are considered mild stretching exercises, yet I would have thought that just simple everyday things would be where the surgeon would want me to start. For example, making my own cup of coffee, taking a short walk etc...then as you mentioned stretching perhaps after a month or so. Yes, I did speak with the nurse today. She first told me that she had not had many women call for additional pain meds that most used OTC meds. She asked what OTC I was using. I responded with extra strength Tylenol. And I said it was doing nothing. She said it was a poor choice and of course it would not do anything and that I should use Motrin. Well, Tylenol was recommended on my DC papers! Explained to her that I was told by another MD no more Motrin as I have elevated liver enzymes. The nurse wanted to know why I had been taking Motrin. Well, like my medical history forms says......I have suffered from migraines since age 39 (always around my period). I told the nurse that I feared something was wrong if no one else is asking for more pain meds. She then proceeded to tell me everyone heals differently and not to compare myself with anyone else.---Yet, I feel I'm being treated like everyone else! I explained the stretches and pain and the fact that I have severe pain at night even without stretching. I will have pain at night just from my 10 to 15 minute slow walk down my long driveway (walking was also surgeon recommendation) and from daily meal prep, shower etc...The nurse's response was that she will have my nurse navigator call me to review my stretches and that she will check with the surgeon to 'see' if he will 'allow' more pain meds. I reminded the nurse that my goal is to be able to perform the recommended stretches etc... in order to return to my normal daily activities. I didn't want severe pain to prevent me from doing what I was told I needed to do and I that I didn't want severe pain at night to prevent me from sleeping as I need rest to recover as well. I'm upset and frustrated due to the fact that I have always had a high tolerance for pain and that I have always bounced back from health issues surprisingly quickly. Therefore, it is natural for me to be concerned that I am performing a simple stretching exercise recommended by surgeon for week 2 post surgery and clearly it is not working for me. I fully expected to have discomfort, pain etc...just thought an OTC med would be all I needed by week 2 and truthfully I believed by week 3 I probably wouldn't even need any OTC med. I appreciate your response! Hopefully, I will know more by Thursday and then the following week I have another appointment with my surgeon. Praying I'm not going to be in the PMPS group---just learned about this today from BarredOwl's post!  ",

And it says the first sheet such as shoulder roll is to begin post op through week 2. The next sheet said stretches for week 2 (cane exercises). I wonder if they gave this to me because I Did Not Have Reconstruction. I believe it makes sense to wait longer to do these as I am hurting just when I walk or move around for a few minutes. At least my surgeon is giving me a few pain meds until my appointment next week. According to his nurse he wants to check for a seroma. I have no idea if I have one. I have swelling that just started 3 days ago, however it looks to me like what I believe would be normal post op swelling. It is in different places such as below my right breast area, above my left breast area and other places and seems to be growing in size in each place. I have put my compression vest back on during the day but must remove it at night. Not certain if my extreme pain is from the swelling or what. Can't help but think it is all do to those stretches.....ughhhhh.....just ready to be moving forward in my healing process as I don't like to sit around!",

Had headache upon arrival probably tension and congestion so I took a claritan.  There was a 60min prep: flush port and get Dignicap situated on scalp to get cold for 30mins prior to chemo (wet hair and fit and strap tight took several tries for the nurse to get right). Then 2 chemo bags one T other C each 1hour 15 mins (changing times and bathroom break also caused extra time). Then, 2 hours of Dignicap cooling system after chemo. Once machine is turned off I had to wait another 20 minutes for my scalp to slowly warm up before I could leave. Those wanting to know....at first Dignicap was really cold however I had taken 2 Tylenol extra strength prior to starting then I got used to it. I had one heavy throw and one electric throw and a sweatshirt so no chills! Neulasta pump was placed on my stomach and discussed as well as all signs to watch out for on both Neulasta and chemo. Chemo caused me to feel extremely dizzy and when I closed my eyes I felt as if my entire body was dropping as if on an amusement park ride. Then from one side to the other as if snowskiing-----really strange. This went on for 3 hours or more. Felt like I could fall during my restroom break from the dizzy feeling.  I read and listened many who have experienced chemo therefore I drank 4 bottles of water prior, 3 during, and 3 after chemo----will continue to drink more water through the night. I just took a nausea pill and plain to take one in the morning hoping not to be ill as I can be the queen of throwing up! Overall, I felt pretty good leaving the hospital but my nurse said many become ill that night, next morning or a day or two after....Yikes! Just hoping all stays calm....I do have blotching rash looking blobs on abdomen and back so I hope that goes away. Oh and I am very glad to have the port as it made this procedure much easier! Wishing all of you the very best as we weather the storm moving ever closer to the sunshine!",

I live in DeKalb and drive to Oncology Specialist in Park Ridge IL (long drive) because they are the only ones who have Dignicap in IL other than Cancer Treatment Centers in Zion IL. I couldn't use CTCA because they could not tell me how much of my chemo would be covered by Aetna Insurance and would Not put anything in writing when stating they would 'dicount' my out of pocket. With the cost of chemo, I had to go where most was covered by Aetna. I have enough out of pocket cost for chemo and doctors plus as everyone knows insurance does not cover Dignicap. I believe their are foundations to help those in need afford Dignicap----would love to see more of this! Anyway, I was first with Delnor Hospital NW in Geneva IL----my oncologist did not believe in cold capping but told me that if I insisted I could do the Penguin Cold Cap on my own. Yet, warned me that he didn't think it was safe due to possible mets to scalp. I simply didn't have enough family here to help which left me looking for Dignicap. I felt that adding another person may help to keep Dignicap at Oncology Specialist. I understand the expense in developing this system, yet if they would lower the price with as many cancer patients there are today I am certain they will make a profit just a little slower. I believe California has the most Dignicap system. I sure hope more come soon for all states! Thanks for the cold cappers thread! I will read the post! Wishing you the best! I have heard great results with Penguin capping :) Looking forward to the day all of our treatments are DONE! BCS2016---I think it is the best to take your daughter with you. I believe it removes the mystery and unknown....and it is better than the surgery. My daughter had to help me with my BMX. She is older at 21 years and it was tough on her. She is the one who is able to stay up late so after my surgery my Mom, Dad and husband all went back to their hotel rooms and my daughter and sister helped through the night. With all my family returned to AR, I have my husband take me at 6:30 am to my 8:50am lab, follow up, chemo appointment which takes until approx. 4pm. We get home around 6pm. Which leaves my daughter to help me at night as well as help take care of our 3 dogs.----I actually had her with me from diagnosis through surgery and was part of decision making after researching. I wanted her to feel in control along with me. There have been fears and tears from her however I know overall it was a huge help in her dealing with my cancer and treatments! Of course it helped me too!  I hope it helps your daughter as well :) Good luck everyone on their treatments tomorrow!  ",

I sorry you are experiencing a tough time with side effects :( You are not alone as many of us are having several not so pleasant side effects from our treatments. Hope you find the discussion helpful :) Pamela23----------I don't eat meat so many veggies as a norm. Little processed foods. Only difference is I have been eating more bread as toast and crackers. Also, now eating mashed potatoes and frozen pancakes---all after chemo as anything else makes me sick. My bread carbs have increased so I wondered if that is causing my weight to go up. I know some is water retention from steroids especially since I had to take another 6 day pack due to my finger, knee and hip pains. My chemo nurse said that most breast cancer patients do gain on chemo---How we gain? I didn't ask if she meant due to the drug or eating habits. Like others, I am on Neulasta after all 4 treatments. My second treatment was really awful with the Neulasta---terrible flu like feeling as in the worst in my life. I called and said I wasn't sure I could make it through my next round which is this week Friday Jan 20th my 3rd chemo. I will be discussing lowering the dose or adding a pain med. I seriously could hardly walk after my 2nd treatment---knees and hips were too painful! Scaredashell07--------------I too am worried that my side effects will be long term! Especially the finger numbness, burning and pain. Also, I get a sore throat after each treatment and I do not know if it is chemo or Neulasta. And my voice goes out.

Also, as I explained in one of my post while I had my first treatment I was beyond dizzy the entire time. I would lie back, close my eyes and see all kinds of weird spiraling designs and colors and would feel like I was on some amusement park ride. Scary and strange. My nurse said that she had not had anyone else complain of dizziness! Anyway, I still get the dizzy and light headed feeling off and on. My next treatment is Dec 29th so kinda strange that I still have this feeling. ---hope it improves for you!",

I use black polish the night before treatment and leave it on for about 7 to 10 days then I remove the polish as it is all chipped by then. I will do the same for treatment 3. I don't know if it is helping as I haven't read a lot of others experience with their nails on TC. Plus, to be honest I have had so much burning and pain in my finger tips that I have been more focused on that and my knee/hip pains. Perhaps others will chime in and let us know:)",

May 3rd infusion was Jan 20th and on the 3rd day after treatment I experienced for the first time what feels like a thick swollen tongue and the roof of my mouth has a pins and needle feeling. Am surprised as my dose was adjusted due to the severe blistering of my fingers on treatment 2. Anyone else having issues with their tongue?

I don't eat meat so what do I eat....veggies (no fried foods and no desserts). I know the bread is bad however after each treatment I have about 3 days of bread and crackers only and we all know why....stomach and GI issues. Then, back to veggies. I drink water and ice tea. I did have 2 sports drinks while sick. Am getting very down about the weight. Am afraid that being pre-menopause, which may be menopausal now after treatment as it can do that to us, it will be impossible to get off (oh and add Tamoxifen afterwards). When I mention it to family, I'm told that I should only worry about getting well :( It's just another part of me that is not normal and makes me feel awful. Between my thinned hair (cold capping--but almost bald on top) and major extra pounds, I don't recognize myself.......and the crying begins. I want to at least look the way I did BEFORE all this started. Sorry....just had to get that off my chest.",

Side effects are hitting me hard and fast this time but hey maybe they will leave me quickly this time.

Just hope it is removed as easily as it was placed. Scaredashell07------So sorry for late reply as I was not feeling well Thursday night had to get up at 5am for my trip to chemo on Friday Feb 10th. Unfortunately, I have no choice about 9 days of steroids due to way too much inflammation from TC. I posted a pic of my badly burned hands earlier in the thread. I didn't realize the bottom of my feet were the same :( Guess I must put up with shortness of breath for now---it sure is uncomfortable! --------As for your hands & feet, my nurse said they didn't believe that icing nor any nail polish help. It wasn't until my hands were turning beet red on third treatment after I showed them a pic of my finger burns that she brought me gloves filled with ice. However, I believe it was more to make me comfortable during treatment as they believe in the steroids in fixing that problem if you have it. They said they don't think nail polish does anything-----I read somewhere to use black nail polish so I have done so each treatment. At this time my nails have developed a tinge of yellow like you get when you have worn polish on them too long. My nails where sore to the touch after my 3rd treatment. At this time, I do not know if the dark polish is working or not. My goal was too try to keep my nails from coming off. ---Time will tell as will with my hair and cold capping with Dignicap. So far I have a little more than half of my hair. A bald spot on top and some spots throughout and tons thinned out all over. Just glad that I was able to save some of it. And glad that Oncology Specialist offered Dignicap that was a machine where I did nothing, instead they did it. Simply placed a silicon cap with a foam piece over and Velcro straps (chin strap is painful). Then, hooked the cooling lines to the machine turned it on and it slowly cools to necessary temp. Much easier than cold capping but it isn't offered everywhere and it should be at $325 per treatment it is less than some of the others.------Hope your treatment went well for you!!!

I am trying OTC Motrin now instead of Tylenol and still I don't feel any relief.....as I might as well not take it. Just wanted to see if Motrin would stop the pain.

I had a slight headache, felt a little sick to my stomach and then acid reflux (which I fixed with a pecid). Headache went away around 10pm so did my upset stomach. I had relief of hot flashes the entire night (did not expect it to work that quickly). What I felt was a little warmth, yet it never developed into the HOT SWEATY I need to through off blankets and fan myself for 5 minutes. I did still get chills however much much milder. It even seemed to carry over the next day therefore I did not take an Effexor tablet the next morning. I did have mild dizziness and blurred vision that my glasses helped with. That all disappeared around 2pm. 3/10 decided to eat yogurt with Effexor at 8pm (I usually do not eat after 7pm but didn't want to feel sick). It worked---no upset stomach no headache and no acid reflux and best yet after 2 hours from taking the pill NO HOT FLASHES! Yay! Again today 3/11 I didn't take one this morning since the effect appears to be carrying over! Today no blurred vision just a little lightheaded feeling. What a relief! Can't begin to tell you how great it is to get some sleep. First 2 nights of sleep in months. I start Tamoxifen in a couple of weeks therefore this may all change. MO says Tamoxifen will cause hot flashes therefore I don't know if Effexor will be as effective as it has so far. I sure hope so. I may need to add the morning Effexor when on Tamoxifen. BTW my Effexor dose is 37.5mg",

I figured I would have a problem when I had the severe burns on my fingertips. Then, after 3rd treatment it began in my feet. 4 weeks PFC my hands are better (it is off and on), however my feet are worse. MO says there are meds to try for neuropathy. I told her I wanted to wait to see if it will improve over time as my hands are better am hopeful my feet will follow.",

MO told me that chemo alone at my age (50) should put me in menopause, then said that if I do get my cycle back that we would have to discuss that (not sure what 'that' means...guess will find out next appointment which is my Survival Plan). The name, Survival Plan, alone scares me...perhaps it sounds good to others. Anyway------I'd much rather have my cycle than hot flashes (produced by chemo...really bad!) which now with Effexor and tamoxifen have become less frequent and more like warm flushes.",

Also, had I not been on this forum reading experiences my oncologist would not have ordered an Oncotype test. I had to ask him to order it. He told me that I was node negative and my tumor was small that he would if I insisted order the test. So, I insisted. And he was Shocked that Onco came back 26.  He then said he would order Mamaprint as he was sure it would be Low Risk. Once again he was Shocked that it came back High Risk Luminal B.-------I then had 2 other opinions and went elsewhere for treatment.",
