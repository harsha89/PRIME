Hi jack, That is breast CA.  She will need a lymph node dissection and radiation.  The progesterone and estrogen receptor negative is bad, cause it won't respond to hormonal therapy.  However, the WORST prognostic factors are >3cm lymph nodes + and/or Her-neu positive (which she doesn't have).  The fact that she is so young indicates a more aggressive cancer and shows genetic compoment.  So all women in the family need to be screened.  She may or may not desire BRCA testing.  The significance is for other family members and the knowing the possibily of ovarian cancer (which is a silent killer).  However, insurance use it to discriminate (which they deny).  a lot of thought in this.  But denial won't help.  Action must be taken for the best hope. Nicole Nicole Sharkey, M.D. Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology NHCP Camp Pendleton, CA   From: JackMD1@aol.com Date: Sat, 25 Apr 2009 04:58:04 -0400 Subject: Urgent! To: nlsharkey@hotmail.com Nicole, sorry to have missed your call yesterday... I will call you soon.  Meantime, below is an email that i have copied and pasted.  Please advice.   \"My ten year old daughter was just diagnosed yesterday (confirmed today) with breast cancer. I have been searching for similar cases but have found nothing. My wife and I have no idea what type, stage, etc... We took her in to have a lump removed that was thought to be completely routine, but the surgeon found a solid mass that appeared to be a tumor behind the suspected area. We were assured that it was probably nothing to worry about but a sample would be sent to pathology. Went to a follow up visit 6 days later (yesterday) and the preliminary results were not good. Got a call today to confirm our worst thoughts. Is there anybody that has heard of such a young girl being diagnosed with breast cancer? We are in a holding pattern now and don't know what to do.\" ***UPDATE***  We just got a copy of the pathology report yesterday and I will read the diagnosis word for word. DIAGNOSIS: Infiltrating ductal carcinoma with focal solid papillary growth pattern and secretory feautures, grade II (moderately differentiated). The tumor extends to the inked surgical margins over a broad front. Approximately 2 cm in aggregate dimension portions of benign prepubertal mammary ductal parenchyma. No ductal carcinoma in situ component identified. Changes highly suspicious for large vessel invasion by tumor but no angiolymphatic space permeation by tumor identified. AJCC stage grouping: T2, NX, MX; stage IIA This was also listed in the microscopic description: This material was submitted for breast prognostic studies with the following results: Estrogen receptor negative, progesterone receptor negative, Her2/neu zero (not expressed) and Ki67 rate of 3% in most of the fields examined. Can someone tell me that my 10 year old daughter does not have breast cancer? We have not told her yet, but know we will as she will be seeing an oncologist within the next day or two.   ",
