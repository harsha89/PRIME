I am 32 years old, I have one daughter (almost 2 years old) and my fianc√© and I are supposed to be married on March 5th. I do not know my staging yet or anything other than its in my right breast and the 1 lymph node they tested was also positive. It must be so hard for your children but you are doing the best you can by being open with them. That is so important. I have found this forum so amazing for support and having others in the same situation makes this seem less overwhelming. Although, of course, I wish none of us had to do this at all. Take care everyone ",

I recommend doing this soon because there are various options when it comes to fertility. I am doing FEC-D chemo and was told that there is a risk of going through early menopause from these chemo meds. I was told by the fertility specialist that my options were 1) do nothing and hope that I would be able to conceive after my treatments and 5 years of tamoxifen, 2) take injections to protect ovaries during treatment, 3) freeze eggs, or 4) freeze embryos. My husband and I went for options 2 and 4 to give us the best chance of me potentially conceiving again and if not, we can use our embryos with a surrogate. The whole process took around 2 weeks which is why I suggest you get the info soon before you start chemo. I hope this info unhelpful for you Take care",

But because this was a compassionate case, we paid for #4 out of pocket which they drastically cut the price down for us by more than half and the fertility clinic is absorbing the cost of the injections that I do monthly. If they had not been able to offer that to us, we likely would have had to make another decision as well",

Being scared is totally valid, but try not to panic until you know for sure what is going on. As MelissaDallas said, a large number of these things turn out to be nothing serious and I will be hoping that is the case for you. Take care SkySprite!",

I also had FEC-D (4 cycles of each every 3 weeks) and both had their downsides and upsides when directly compared. That said, overall I found the FEC more tolerable probably. My cancer centre doesn't do cold caps either and really, for me personally, I'm sitting there for 3 hours (at least) for each FEC infusion, I'd rather be comfortable. I found the port convenient as I also have crap veins, it was never really a question for me. The worst of the FEC for me was the nausea but it was well controlled with prescriptions. Best of luck with your treatments!!!",

BCO has good info here http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/diagnosis/sta... In my specific case (IDC) I will not find out actual staging until after surgery. I am doing neoadjuvant chemo, meaning chemo first, then surgery. Then probably radiation after that. Chemo has the potential to shrink tumors which can \"downstage\" the cancer. Staging is dependent on tumor size, lymph node involvement (how many), and whether/where it has spread. Please do not stress about the symptoms of stage IV. I know this is easier said than done, I stressed about every single ache and pain until I had my bone scan, MRI, and CT and received the results. And I was obsessed with finding out the staging. In the end, they found 2 (very small) nodules in my left lower lung and are not even going to look further into that until after chemo. Although that shook me, I was more relieved to hear that my bone scan was clear because for some reason I was very worried about that. My point is that you will drive yourself crazy if you obsess about the stage. You are right that these things are such a case-by-case basis. My advice to you both right now is to focus on spending time together, distract yourselves with work and/or things you enjoy doing. Enjoy these days where she is feeling good and somewhat \"normal.\" I'm sorry that you've found yourselves in this place, but there is a lot of support here. Take care",
