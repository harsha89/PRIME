I had no idea how they put it in, I was sore a few days after- like I was about to burst any moment, then when you are finally finished with the saline, it stills feels weird and sore sleeping on your side, bending over, and doing any kind of upper movement.  I feel like I have learned so much, and now need some information on different kinds of implants.  Take care   Jeanne",
