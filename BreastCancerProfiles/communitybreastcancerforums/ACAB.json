People are generally full of bull when they are faced with a person who has a real problem.  I've been guilty of it myself.  I don't know if they are nervous and feel the need to say something or what. Christina Applegate is pardon my casual manner, the flavor of the month poster child for breast cancer.  I'm not trying to offend Applegate lovers.  It's wonderful that she's interested in helping people get MRIs and genetic testing.  Real heroes are those with lots of bills, losing their hair, puking and doing radiation and all that stuff.  Tomato Juice don't focus on Applegate.  You've been through a lot.  You're a hero.  AND, I'm glad you feel well enough to run those stairs if need be.  Amy B.",
