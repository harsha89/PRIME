She said, \"Are you going to let us do the tattoos?  I said, \"I don't know.  I have just about reached my limit.\"   Then when thy were done, she said with no warning, \"Ok, I'm going to do the tattoos real quick.\"She did the first one so fast that I jumped.  She said something about, \"Now you have to lie still.  Don't move.\"     The next day, I talked to my Rad Onc's nurse by phone for a different matter, and she asked how the sim went.  When I told her about the pain and feeling sick, she said, \"Let me get this straight.  They knew you were in pain and they didn't give you a break.\"  I told her they said they couldn't and she was furious.  She started asking me a lot of questions about how I was treated, and I told her about the tattoos.  She said, \"This will be addressed before the end of the day.  Dr. taylor will be  furious.\"  She went on and on, about how they need to know this, and I didn't call to complain, and that made it the best criticism they can get.  I detest the ink markings all over my body and am surprised that no one complains about that.  Am I the only one who has that road map?                                                                                                                                                                ",

After reading the boards, I thought I misunderstood.  I have not seen one person say that they had to leave them on for 6 or 7 weeks.  She confirmed that.  Said that everyone who receives any kind of IMRT there must leave the marks and tape on, tattoos or not.   This is not a little ticky tack hospital but a huge teaching cancer facility.  I can't tell you how much I hate this. Can't believe more people don't complain about it.",

It had this morning for the first time, and I thought I was imagining it.  Starting to feel the fatigue today.  Husband drove me and I slept most of the way there and again home.  If this continues, I will only be able to count on friends to go with me who can drive it, not the ones who just ride along for company.  Today was # 10 out of 33.  Wonder how I can do this.  ",
