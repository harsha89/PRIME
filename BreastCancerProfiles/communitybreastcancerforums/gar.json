Yesterday she noticed a slight change in the shape of her breast.  She said that one of her breasts, near the bottom, had a \"flat look\" to it, where it has usually been round. Every where I look on the 'net, it pretty much says that this is breast cancer. I'm making her schedule an appt with her doctor ASAP.  Could it be something else?  Is this typical?
