It helps a lot to get on here and read other people's stories, let's you know that other women are having the same issues. So two years ago I my doctor found three lumps, two in the left and one on the right. I had a biopsy on the right, came back B9. The surgeon said we would just keep an eye on the other lumps. Found out the same day my crappy insurance wasn't paying the bills. So I am not sure if the lumps were nothing to worry about or the surgeon was watching his bottom line. I haven't had a mammo in two years. Insurance issues, and not being 40 yet couldn't find free ones in my area. So now I have a new job and new insurance, as soon as my insurance was active I made a doctors appointment. Right before my appointment I found a new lump in my right breast. Somewhere around the top between my breast and armpit. During the breast exam the doctor found a new one in my left. So now three in the left, one on the right.  I had a mammo yesterday, they want to get my old films and compare. I have had pain in my left one for the past couple of months. Not constant, it comes and goes. So what I want to know is, is it normal to have this many lumps? Is this something I can afford to \"keep an eye on\" or should I be more proactive on getting them out? Can they biopsy both breast at the same time? I just don't want someone to look at me in a few years and say If only you would have done something sooner. Is it normal to keep getting lumps like this? Is this just something I need to get used to dealing with for the rest of my life? I currently have a great aunt dying of breast cancer, I turned 40 this year, I have closer female relatives that both dies of differents cancers. Thanks for your imput!!! Log in to post a reply",
