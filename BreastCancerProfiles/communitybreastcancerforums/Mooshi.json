Also, the cancer cells were grade I. Not-as-good news is there were just enough cancer cells in one of my lymph nodes to upgrade me from Stage I to Stage II. The other two lymph nodes (the surgeon removed 3 nodes during surgery) were clear. I am awaiting the results of my CT Scan, and also have a bone scan booked at the end of June. The surgeon mentioned that because the other two lymph nodes were clear of any cancer, that it would be extremely unlikely that the cancer had spread beyond the lymph nodes, and that she would be very surprised if the tests showed anything. Can anyone shed any light on this? Any resources I can research? I'd like to keep myself busy since it seems I'll be waiting for a while before getting a definitive diagnosis. Many thanks.

I'm up in Canada, and although we have a fantastic government healthcare program, we do have atrocious wait times. Same day testing is UNHEARD of here. When I got the radiologist's report that the tumours were highly suggestive of malignancy (Bi-RADS 5), the doctor ordered an urgent biopsy. URGENT meant 1 week lol! Anyways, I have been told by a couple of medical practitioners that the odds of the cancer cells \"jumping the hurdle\" and spreading the the rest of the body are next to nil. In any case, I will meet my oncologist for the first time tomorrow, and will have some more info on my diagnosis and treatment plan.",

I have a copy of the original radiologist's report, and given my personality, researched every word on it haha. The findings on the report are pretty ominous, plus I got a rating called BI-RADS 5. About 90-95% of tumours with this rating come back positive for breast cancer. So, although nothing is yet 100%, I am prepared for just about anything. If there is a light at the end of the tunnel, my lymph nodes looked totally normal on the ultrasound, so if it is cancer, I have some hope that I caught it in the early stages. We'll just have to wait and see. Stay strong.",

To answer your question, yes, it is possible to do a biopsy on something that is suspected to be benign. There is a bit of a grey area in radiology where it can state that something is \"probably benign.\" The statistical chances of biopsies coming back positive for cancer in this category are very small. Perhaps in your case, it was your doctor's call to go with a biopsy \"just in case.\" Personally, if I knew that my report came back \"probably benign,\" I would push for a biopsy anyways. I know of a few people who were the victims of false negatives, so I would rather have the peace of mind. I hope that helps. Please do keep us posted.",
