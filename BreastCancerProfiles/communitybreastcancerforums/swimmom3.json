I hope that you have a similar response and that TDM-1 keeps us stable or better yet NED for a long time to come--Cathy",

While everyone's experience is different, I have to say that my side effects have been mild, especially when I compare it to my TCH chemo back in September 2011.  Usually on the night of the infusion I feel a bit tired and not very hungry.  This general \"yucky\" feeling lasts about 3 days and then I am on the upswing.  Again, I have mild to moderate fatigue for about 3-4 days and low appetite.  It does lower my platelets and slightly elevate my liver enzymes, but not enough to cancel treatments.  I am still able to work (very physical job as teacher's aide of special needs students) and take care of my family.  I just have to make sure I rest when I'm tired so I try to focus on one thing a day after work (laundry, errands) and leave the rest to my husband on the weekends. Right now I did develop one small liver met in March which has shrunk in size and so far is a solitary met which we are watching closely.  I don't mind if it stays there as long as it behaves and is an only child.  I hope for NED status, but I'm happy with \"stable\" right now and so is my oncologist.  In the meantime, I just keep holding on and praying that one day we really will get a cure.

I know I have to try and hold it together for my family, but I'm terrified that I am not going to be here to see my 3 sons become men with families of their own.  My oldest sons are 20 and 18, but my youngest is only 12, with some special needs to boot, and the thought of not being able to help him navigate to adulthood breaks my heart.  My husband is a good man and I know he would do his best, but it's still not the same. Please someone tell me--how do I hold onto hope??  Is it possible that the lytic lesion is not a bone met?  If it is confirmed as a bone met, what should I expect treatment wise?  Any advice or support would be a gift right now. ",

I was able to see my MO this morning.  He squeezed me in on top of an already full schedule and that is why I love him--nothing comes before his patients.  He agreed that the CT and bone scan are very concerning for mets at T6 and L1 (L1 only showed up on CT, not bone scan).  Having said that, he said he would not jump the gun until I have a bone biopsy on both of those areas.  He remarked that my PET scan last year lit up in lots of places and it was all due to inflamation/arthritis.  This year's CT/bone scan confirm no changes to those areas--still arthritis.  He admits that some people just are more sensitive to scans than others and he feels I might fall into that category.  He is also looking beyond arthritis to other bone conditions that could cause these results (mentioned Paget's Disease).  Ultimately though the biopsy will confirm one way or the other and will also show the receptors which are important for possible additional treatment planning.  The liver nodules were just that--very tiny cysts that evidently were there last year on the CT, but are considered benign.  He said that the fact they have not changed in a year confirms that fact.  Who knew we have all these things going on in our bodies without knowing anything. We went to the worst case scenario--that this is bone mets--and he's already looking ahead to how it would be treated and what he would recommend.  First and foremost he would send me to Johns Hopkins to get a second opinion and and to be screened for clinical trials that they are running.  He is on the faculty at their medical school and is personal friends with their clincal trial breast cancer expert.  He also discussed the new treatment options for HER2 positive breast cancer including T-DM1 and Perjerta (sp??), and other drugs that for the moment escape my memory.  He basically said that IF this is cancer in my bones, he has lots of treatments available to keep me around for a long time. It was hard not to cry in front of him and with my poor husband fighting back tears next to me.  I'm going to try and take your good advice and stay focused on the present and wait for the biopsies to be scheduled. I want you to know that your kind words and wisdom have been such a blessing to me and please know that I hold you all in my hearts as well.  I have been following these boards since I was first diagnosed in 2011 but I have been too shy to participate in the discussions.  Time to let go of shy and jump right in the pool.  As the mother of 3 competitive swimmers, I hope I can make them proud.",

On Christmas night, after feeling some pain in my right hip for about a week (X-Ray was negative for fracture) I suffered a sudden pathological fracture there. Nothing says Christmas like a ride in an ambulance screaming in pain. I spent a lost week in the hospital where I was so drugged up after surgery that I have very little memory of it, then another week learning to get mobile with a walker before being shipped off to rehab for almost another 2 weeks. I came home the end of January and began in home PT which was successful and today I get around my house without my cane and just use it when I go out. In the midst of recovery, treatment with herceptin, perjeta, letrozole, lupron shots and zometa continued and I also did 10 rad sessions to my pelvis. Tomorrow I see my oncologist and I feel like human wreckage. Every bone in my body hurts, I have terrible hot flashes, insomnia, gastro issues, neuropathy in feet and hands, and bed hugging levels of fatigue. I'm guessing a lot of these symptoms are related to the letrozole, and they are getting worse over time (been on it for over 1.5 years). Scans in the hospital showed mostly stable disease so not sure if progression is rearing its ugly head. New symptom includes weak pincer grasp in right hand which scares me since it seems like a neurological symptom. My question is do you ladies have advice on how to isolate what is causing the majority of these symptoms and what do you do to motivate yourself to push through when you feel so crappy. Prior to breaking my hip, treatment made me tired but it was more manageable. I feel like this event has worn me down and I hope I can bounce back. Grateful for any advice you can give.
