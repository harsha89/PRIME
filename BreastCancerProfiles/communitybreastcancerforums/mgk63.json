If not what?  Did you have bone pain prior to starting all this? Praying for you ,  marlene",

I am very concerned about this with Vertigo.  I need to drive use stairs etc.  What has shown to be the BEST drug to help with this?  I am a 13yr survivor with 2yrs in bone. Been on hormone therapy for 13yrs. Never any SE.  Please let me know the answers in your opinions, we know what he docs say.  Blessings and prayers for all of you, Marlene",
