The timing of my diagnosis was crazy because I was in the process of moving to Duluth, Ga from Fort Belvoir, Va. My doctors at Fort Belvoir, immediately sent me back here (I flew out on Friday) to Emory University's Cancer Center in Atlanta to start treatment that Monday. My whole world was literally turned upside down as most of you all must have also felt. Chemo knocked me on my butt, and I have been vomiting from the first day of chemo till today. I cannot hold any food down. The doctors have done all types of test and given me all types of nausea medications and nothing seems to work. I am getting desperate. I am so weak and fatigued. I can barely walk. I have chemo this tues and I am going to beg the doctor for nutrition through IV or whatever they can do. I get so frustrated because I feel like they are not listening to me and are just treating the cancer but not treating me. Help anyone, please!",
