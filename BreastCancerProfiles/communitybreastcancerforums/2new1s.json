How awful that you have to have the surgery to get the expander replaced.  Now I wonder to get to your desired size, how many more fills do you need?  Only wondering because if you are almost there, why not just have the exchange surgery and have her put the desired size put in as the final implant?  My left foob is filled 450cc's.  Not sure what cup size it is, but it looks awfully small to me.  I think because I was so used to by big fat droopy boobs!  Now this one is high, perky and tiny.  I want to be a \"D\".  So not sure how many cc's that would be??????? Bee, maybe fill up to a full \"B\", and see how you like it.  I know you joke about the belly sticking out more than the foobs, but honestly if you want to have some sort of chest, if it were me I would do the \"C\".  Only because women that I have personally spoke to that have implants have told me that they wish they went a little bigger.  But that's just my opinion of course!  I do not have my Easter decorations up and it is bothering me!  We store our holiday things in the basement and there is no way I could sort through everything to get them out.  I could have DS or DH help me and just stand there and direct them as to what to out, but my whole storage area with everything would end up looking like a disaster!  I have all my decorations sorted by holiday, but the boxes are not all marked.  I know what's in them by just a glance, but no one else would figure it out. Anywhoo...we ended up buying new baskets for the kids this year and I will have to be happy with that!  I already planned that next year I will donate the older baskets to DS's school for them to use in the office area or teacher's lounge.  Sorry for the super long post, but DD is watching a DVD, oh and I also took two vicodins after we got home due to the pain from driving way too much today!  LOL",

Thank you all for the advice on the \"sex\" situation of my DS.  I have talked to both of the mom's of the girls  involved.  Of course it is all my fault & DS's fault for the sex happening!  Like I was there cheering them on - give me a break!  Basically I agreed that at their age being \"active\" is not necessary!  At this point it's done & over - no going back.  I have told DS & the mom's that neither girl is welcome in our home again.  I want no part of more teenage GF/BF drama. Added to that the rest of my day consisted of driving into the city to see my Dad in the hospital.  Quick story: his is four years out from throat cancer remission.  This morning he went to onc dr.  His neck was leaking a yellow gook near the area that had the radiation.  Basically the whole left side of his neck is very thin skin caved in & scarred from the incision & rads.  We are very worried that the cancer has come back.  As of today they did bloodwork & CAT scan w/ contrast.  No results yet!  More tests scheduled tomorrow.  During the whole drive all I kept thinking was \"Please do not let him be sick now, I am barely holding myself together!\"  My dad & I have a very close relationship.  When him & my mom divorced years & years ago and I ended up living with him.  He is like my best friend, I talk to him everyday. If you can please say an extra prayer for my Dad and send healthy vibes our way!  Sorry to be a downer - I am just out of my mind with worry over him.

I totally agree with those of you who said how much more can I handle right?  Not sure if I even want to answer the phone when it rings!  My PT went good this morning.  Had to take DD (23 months) with to the appt.  Since we are in a private room & the door is closed, the PT said just to bring her in with me.  I kept her occupied in her stroller with little snacks.  She actually did so good that we scheduled my next  appt for during the day! After we left PT, DD & I spent the rest of the day @ the mall.  I bought a new outfit for a concert DH & I are going to this Saturday night.  It was awfully disheartening to try on so many pretty tops that looked awful with my caved in chest & left foob filled to 600cc's.  I finally found a beautiful pastel top that has that flowey loose look to it.  The best part was that when I tried on a pair of jean capri pants - they were too big!  I went down a size!  I guess all of this stress had one advantage for me.  :) Needless to say I did NO housework today.  DH told me this morning not to bother about having something prepared for dinner since we didn't know what the status would be w/ my Dad.  Since Dad is home now.  We are ordering pizza - one of my favorites.    Enough rambling on for now.  All of you have a wonderful day/evening.  I am blessed to have all of you on this site! ",

On Wednesday I had some complications with my tissue expander on the left side. (The left side has been perfect sine the original BM in 2/09)   It shifted inside my chest about a inch & a half & caused the tissue inside to tear. I was in the ER on Wednesday and had to go see a surgeon yesterday. My regular surgeon is on vacation until next week. I had to go see the other surgeon to make sure that it wasn't something he needed to operate on right away. He said that I can wait to see her next week. He gave me some pain meds to keep me comfortable until then. So it looks like I may be having another surgery here real soon ~ sooner that I had anticipated! My exchange surgery is scheduled for 11/16. We'll see what my PS says next week when I go see her on Tuesday.   I swear if it's not one thing it's the other with me!

I guess I will now start researching the nipple reconstruction threads.  From the pics I have seen on the forum, they do a very good job on the fipples!  Another adventure for me I guess.  I know it could have been worse, so I am thankful that the whole breast wasn't compromised. If any of you have any nipple reconstruction hints/stories to share please let me know. Thanks",

My DH has also been my savior through this whole after surgery process.  My in-laws have been great too by taking our youngest (she is 21 months old) to their house a lot.  SInce the older kids can more or less fend for themselves they just take the baby as she is the one who needs the most care & attention.  Be thankful for the brother that has your kids for the weekend.  I have two sisters that live less than 10 minutes from me and have not had one offer of help from them.  So if your brother offers more help - take it.  Take it easy and remeber the less you do - the quicker the drains will come out.  I had mine in for two weeks.  Hated everyday of them.  Also I gave in to the pain and asked for Vicodin.  I was trying to get by on Tylenol, didn't work much.  SO I found the Vicodin to take the pain away without making me a zombie.  Keep us posted on your recovery!  Gentle hugs!",

I am looking forward to my TE replacement surgery on 6/11.  It will be awful to start the darn fill all over again, but I will get through it!  At this point I am just hoping that my body won't reject the TE again! Hopefully everyone will continue to check in on here then & again to keep up with all of the upcoming exchange surgeries!  I wish all of my February surgery buddies the best happiness & health!

I saw my PS yesterday.  She did another fill, so I am at 650cc's.  I think the foob is finally looking fuller.  No big surprise when I asked PS about scheduling my surgery for the TE replacement, she told me \"Sure just check with Lisa (her secretary)\".  When I did ask Lisa about putting me on the surgery schedule her response was \"I can call you Monday or Wednesday of next week.\"  I said \"I am standing here so you can ask me anything you need to know, plus I am a stay at home mom & my schedule is open for anything the doctor has available.\"  Her response \"Doctor's schedule is full until mid June.\"  Tears immediately came to my eyes!  It sounds so dumb - but I was so badly wanting the TE to be replaced before my DD's 2nd b-day party (5/24).  I hate the thought of seeing so many family members & friends when my chest is so deformed looking.  I do know it could much worse, but for me this is awful.  I also know that reconstruction fails on a lot of women, so I am being patient.  But the PS had \"promised\" me that she would have me done mid-May.  Secretary also said that PS is on vacation for the last two weeks of May.  Basically I am now having to wait until mid-June for the TE replacement.  So much for promises.  I left the office in tears.    Got in the car & called DH crying.  He was very supportive and said that of course our families know everything so it's not going to be a big shocker when they see me w/ one foob.  I just hate the looks people give me.  The look like : oh boy what happened to you? Okay enough of my boo-hooing.  I am going to get ready for the day.  I have some garage sales to get to!  The next town over is having their annual garage sale.  DD needs summer clothes - so her & I are going bargain hunting!  Plus we have some other errands to do.  I just wish the sun was out!  Enjoy the day & sorry for being a little bit of a downer!",

Had the drain pulled today.  That was awful.  Hurt so bad I was sweating!  Could have used a shot of Demerol for that.  Today PS said that at my appointment next week she will be checking to make sure the infection is gone.  As long as it is looking good, the following week she will give me my first fill on the left foob.  Woo-hoo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I am so hoping that the fill goes good.  Those two weeks seem like a million years away.  I could really use something to smile about! ",

What these two girls are offering him must be magical - because he has basically forgot that anything else exists! Did I also mention that both girls mom's have called me and of course blamed all of this on ME!!!!!!!!!!  So yeah, I have had quite a few interesting conversations with them.  When one of the mom's said to me that my son should have respect for her daughter, my response was \"Maybe if she didn't come to my house dressed half-naked with see through white shorts on with her ass hanging out - he wouldn't be so tempted to take advantage of her!\"  Her mom had no response for that one!

I ended up developing a worse infection overnight and went in to see PS this morning.  The PS came into the office on her day off to check out the infection to see what was going on.  She ended up have to preform an emergency outpatient surgery to repair the infected breast tissue and the nipple, the procedure is also known as debridement.  My whole chest is wrapped in an ace bandage so I am sure what it looks like now.  Tomorrow I can remove the wrap so I will see what happened with the repair.  Since I have been photographing my surgery journey I will also take new pictures tomorrow so I will be able to tell exactly what was done.  When I have more healed photos I will add them on the picture forum.  Both of these sites have just been so beneficial to me for information and support.",

Bee54 ~ Keep up the great work with the DG.  That's all you can do ~ as you have learned! samiam40 ~ I did try and call the PS's office and the answering service says the dr doesn't call back unless it's an emergency!   Ummmm.........hello for me this is an emergency!  LOL.  I see her again next week and I will talk to her personally and see what the mix up was.  I honestly do not think she \"lied\" to me but that the secretary does not know that the PS told me she would do whatever she could to fit me in.  As of now I am done getting my hopes up and settling for a June surgery date.  I did also tell them that if they have a surgery cancellation I would take it.  Enjoy this beautiful day.  At least here it is not raining & the sun is out!",

I do agree that with the weather finally getting nicer it's wonderful to spend time outdoors & less time online! I have all my pics from the beginning of my journey.  I still have not posted them on the pic forum.  Sometimes when I look in the mirror and see my chest, it still makes me catch my breath and tear up.  Soon enough I will have the TE replaced.  That I am looking forward to so much!",

All of my February ladies...sorry if I seemed to vent a little.  All of us have had our own journey with surgery and recovery.  I think maybe because I have had so many setbacks that I forget that you other ladies have been \"recovered\" for quite a while and have moved on.  Since I still see my PS & PT every week, my process does not have a light at the end of the tunnel just yet.  My right TE replacement has been scheduled for 6/11.  Of course after that, I will start the weekly fills on that side.  So for me it seems like my process is never ending.  I know this thread was my link to all of you who share the pain & joy of what we have been through.  I will continue to keep this thread as one of my favorites.  Please post on here even if it is just to vent or share a happy, funny moment in your life.  I miss you ladies.  Still sending gentle hugs ",

I take Correctol for the stomach issues.  I also take Vicodin and Darvocet for pain.  Oh and I also take Xanax to sleep at night.  Could not sleep without the Xanax! I also have been taking photos.  I have not had the courage yet to post them.  Maybe if I had both expanders as planned I would, but for now I will wait.  Buy the way, it's okay to have bad, bad days, just come on here and we will help you get past the bad days!

I also have to get one nipple reconstructed.  I had the nipple sparing BM in Feb.  Lost one nipple due to a staph infection.  My PS has the nipple recon. surgery approved for the same time as the exchange.  I saw a post on here that there is a \"mini tummy tuck\" for nipple reconstruction? My presurgery consultation is next week.  I already have a list of questions for my PS.  Obviously if the tummy tuck surgery is cosmetic I have to pay out of pocket.  If she uses the stomach skin for the nipple does insurance cover that?  I am so confused. I hope by posting this I do not sound dumb, but I want to know what some options are before I do something. Also, what is the recovery period of an exchange & a tummy tuck? Many thanks to you for responding, as you can see, I need some help!  LOL Gentle hugs, 2new1s (very soon)  Log in to post a reply",
