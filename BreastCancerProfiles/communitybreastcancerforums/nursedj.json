I have never had a mastectomy but I have had six major surgeries, its tough the first couple days because of muscles and nerves, but it gets better. The key to fast recovery is to move, always turn cough and deep breathe, these are the most important, and always ask for pain meds, relieving pain is important for your recovery in that it helps you to do the turning, coughing, and deep breathing, get up and walk as soon as they say you can, I don't know how effective holding a pillow against your body when you cough would be after mastectomy but it helped me with all my surgeries, it supports your muscles. I hope this helps some to prepare for surgery, you are in my prayers, be strong and realize that we are stronger than we even know and God never puts more on us than we can handle, he will help you get through this. God Bless you and I wish you the best.",
