I had the fiducial markers placed Wednesday and it was quite a bit more uncomfortable than I was expecting. I had three markers placed and after the radiologist reviewed the post-mammogram, she had me go back in for her to place a fourth one so there would be a better triangle for the RO. I guess he'll ignore one of the four! I have another scan on Tuesday and then the simulation on Friday before one week of radiation twice a day starting May 9. Is anyone else following a similar protocol?",
