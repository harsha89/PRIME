It was caught so early the doctors have suggested I might just start taking Tamoxifen and avoid radiation and/or chemo. Recovery from surgery has been pretty good, but I'm waiting on pins and needles for my post-op appointment this Thursday. It was scheduled for the afternoon but they called and moved it to the morning. I'm trying to convince myself the move is to accommodate my surgeon's schedule and not because the results are not what have been hoping for and we need to get moving on treatment after the appointment! This is my first time posting but the site has been so helpful over this past month+ that I've been working through the diagnosis (emotionally and physically!). My best to you all!",
