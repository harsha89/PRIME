Had my first chemo today (3 hours). So far, doing well and feeling fine. Love my Power Port (I have small, deep veins). First two questions. I hadn't heard about the SE for the Neulasta (scheduled for Wednesday @ 2:30), and my MO didn't mention anything about the Claritin. I can take some tomorrow (after I check with the MO). I wonder if I should wait and see what my reaction is before I take it. I tend to not want to take something until I need it, but this sounds like it might be worth taking ahead of time just in case. What do you all think based on your experiences? I'm also wondering about taking antiemitics before I have symptoms. The MO said wait, then the onco nurse (a temp while the regular is on vacation) said don't wait, take them right away. I'll go with what the MO said, but am a bit nervous about it. What if I wait too long? How long before the meds kick in? And a suggestion for indenial. I saw from your first post you are concerned about having others cook for you due to diet restrictions. Our family has very strict dietary restrictions too. Many people have wanted to help, but I can't take the chance of an \"accident\". Instead, I have had people come to my house to fix meals with my ingredients. I am also planning a couple of cooking days where people come to my house and help me make large batches of food that I can freeze. That way I can get some help and also feel safe.  **** \"When you're going through Hell, just keep walking.\" ****",

On the other hand, maybe the sheer quantity of the hugs will be enough to counteract the germs. Maybe it will need to depend on my WBC count and where I am in my chemo cycle. How about this: a name tag that says: \"Healthy hugs happily accepted here.\" I too, used to disdain hand sanitizer. Now I have a small bottle of it hooked to my purse and use it obsessively. I get especially nervous with the key pads and signing pens at check stands, also elevator buttons (especially ones in medical office buildings; I'm getting pretty good at hitting them with my elbows), shopping cart handles, and door handles (especially in bathrooms). I've also been known to use the ends of my scarf (the one used to hide the lopsidedness to open doors or press buttons) I'm really horrible at not accidentally rubbing my nose and eyes; a bad habit, really. I like Doc Martins of Maui sunscreen: www.docmartinsmaui.com/StoreFr... I get clogged pores easily, and this doesn't cause me to break out. It can also be put around your eyes and on your lips, and doesn't sting your eyes. It's hard to come by, but if you shop around, you can find it online for less if you buy several at once (suggest you just try one tube first to see if you like it). It is coconut oil based, and smells like coconut jelly bellies. Indenial, this must be so hard when everything about this disease triggers all your fears. Keep remembering that you have made it this far, and that you are almost two-thirds done. I noticed on the link someone listed here to a list of famous people who had BC that one had adopted after BC and another had a surrogate birth. Love the breast remover machine. I remember my son used to design elaborate machines of all types when he was that age. Virginia, I guess you must be used to the night shift if you have been doing it a while. Does all the chemo and BC-related treatments mess with your schedule? I doubt you can get chemo on the night shift! For sties, a clean washcloth soaked in hot water and wrung out makes a good hot compress. Just gently press the cloth against your eye, then slowly wipe it in the direction of the sty (for instance, if the sty is on your lower lid, wipe upward from a couple of inches below your eye). The teabag might have some astringent qualities that will help also. Onawing, I would let your MO know about the sty. They can tell you what to watch for and what to do for it. Better to call on Friday than have it get bad on the weekend. They could give you a prescription for something to treat it if it gets bad. I think there are prescription ointments that can be used. Day two, and I am feeling good. Maybe too good. I think I'm hyped up on the steroids and operating a bit on the manic side. Trying not to go to fast and end up exhausted. Found out at my chemo yesterday that the Taxol/Herceptin phase of treatment means over 7 hours of chemo starting at 8:30 am. Plus a shorter herceptin-only treatment on the alternating weeks. I notice it was the nurses who told me this. My MO never mentioned it. The fun never stops!",

Not coming back anywhere else that I can tell.  Had a rather disconcerting experience last week. I'm not usually a gym person, but because of not being able to do much of my usual exercise (martial arts), and because my underage son wanted to join, I signed up at the local fitness club. I didn't even think about changing in a locker room until the first day I went...then realized that there was no way I was going to strip in a locker room with other women. What with my deconstructed breast looking like a deflated balloon stuck on my chest and still leaking goop, I changed in the bathroom stall. I guess I'll just continue with that for a while. No showers for me either.  I find myself looking wistfully at other women's breasts and feeling more abnormal than ever. I still haven't found a comfortable way to feel about my post mastectomy body, and now with the failed reconstruction it's even more problematical. It doesn't help that reconstruction is likely to be many months down the road (due to dealing with the thyroid issues), and even then I still won't have matching sides unless I decide to reduce the other side.  Sometimes I forget about it entirely, other times it looms large. Obviously I still have a lot of processing to do.",

My heart is with you as you strive to cope with the changes. Second herceptin-only infusion went well; no side effects that I noticed. Due for my third Echo soon. It's starting to feel like a normal, routine thing. I'm hoping this one will be more comfortable, as the first two were done with the tech trying to get a picture without mashing my TE too much. This time that shouldn't be a problem. Amazingly I still have a few long hairs left growing through the fuzz (I never shaved). They are the Hercules of hair, having hung in there through months of chemo. Looks ridiculous but I don't have the heart to cut them off. All the fuzz looks grey. Lashes and brows still loosing ground, but, of course, the chin hairs are sprouting.  Ladies, we have come this far together and our mojo will rise again.

So far decided to forgo the Claritin for the Neulastra (MO said OK to take Tylenol and alternate with the Claritin if needed) until I knew if I needed it. No obvious pain from that so far (24 hours after shot). I'm also waiting until I have nausea to take any other antiemitics. I did take epsom salts at a low dose to prevent any constipation (seems to be working well; no problems there). Crossing my fingers and hoping things continue this way.  I have to say that I won't mind losing my hair too much (frizzy greying hair no real loss!). I plan to mostly wear scarves and hats (not interested in a wig). I've always wanted to wear hats, but they never worked with my hair, so I guess I'll take this opportunity to live it up and get some fabulous hats. I was mainly wondering along with BeHereNow how you keep the hats on when it's windy. I think a scarf under will help (maybe; or will that make it worse?). Hat pins aren't exactly an option. Bonnets with ties aren't my style. I suppose tight hats would work. Any one have any experience with keeping hats on in the wind?  Did a bit of research on hat etiquitte, Emily Post (http://www.emilypost.com/everyday-manners/common-courtesies/479-hats-off-the-who-what-when-where-of-the-hat) says cancer patients can always wear hats. Apparently not everyone has the message, (http://blogs.clarionledger.com/thebuzz/2013/02/06/hat-wearer-barred-from-paying-jackson-water-bill/ and http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2215141/Mother-breast-cancer-forced-leave-roller-rink-wearing-hat.html). The problem is letting folks know why you want to keep the hat on as well as dealing with those businesses and organizations have inflexible rules.  Of more concern to me is losing my nails. That sounds painful. My MO is unfamiliar with icing fingers to prevent nail loss. Didn't seems to think it necessary (but open to whatever I want to do).  What are the particulars of how you do that? Just wrap your hands in cold packs? Do you have to keep it up for the whole time, or can you just cycle them on and off? Looks like my DH has brough home a cold from his business trip to the UK last week. Perhaps the loving reunion last weekend (pre symptoms) wasn't the best idea. Sigh. ",

Right now I think anything tougher than avocados and yogurt will feel that way. Maybe I'll just start putting everything through the food processor.  I'm also noticing that I want to eat more frequently (I think due to slight nausea), and lots (probably the steroids). I will have to watch this carefully as I really don't want to gain weight. If I'm lucky, maybe the mouth soreness will counteract the food cravings. ;) Anyone have any experience with mangoes since chemo? I bought a mango at the store the other day, thinking to have some with the yogurt. Then I wondered if it would be too acid or irritating. Or is that me just being paranoid?",

I haven't heard any hard and fast \"rules\" about what thread you follow. I think it's about support and what works for you.  My \"Chemo 101\" class wasn't anything special. We (hubby and I) had a couple of hours (I ask lots of questions) one-on-one with the nurse navigator. She wen't over a print out of a power point presentation about chemo prep, side effects, and medications, as well as what to look for afterwards. We went over the prescriptions (although she confused me about them more than helped) and that was about it. It was mainly useful for figuring out what questions to ask when I met with my MO the day before chemo. I went with a list of about 20 questions, and we went through them all. I think you can get about the same information by going through the http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/chemotherapy files.  One thing I am surprised at is that some don't seem to have a solid regime of prescriptions and instructions regarding what to do after the chemo. Everybody will have a different regime and needs, but I thought I'd give you my regime as an example of what kind of information you should have and expect.  The premeds given through the IV at chemo last until day 4 of chemo (chemo treatment is day one, Tuesday for me, which meant that day 4 was Friday). The MO said that the premeds should take care of any nausea until day 4 (they did), but if I had any problems I could take compazine (sedating). I was also to take Dexa (steroids) twice a day from day 2 to 4 and the Ativan at night. After Friday, the Zofran in the premeds would have worn off, so I could take that first (as it is non-sedating) and alternate it with the compazine. If I was still having nausea, I could add in the Dexa and more Ativan during the day. If you aren't clear on what to take when, keep asking until you are. If your SE aren't controlled by your current medication schedule, there are many options available that can help. I have four different prescriptions to help with the nausea. Between them I am doing well and have not needed to take any of the sedating ones during the day.  I'm also wondering, for those who have \"stomach cramps\", if those aren't just nausea? At first, I though I was having cramps, then I realized it was mild nausea. I kicked in with the Zofran, and things calmed down. I'm not usually one to take pills at the first sign of a problem, but am learning that there's just no reason to put up with something than can be easily remedied.  Sending strength and hope for all who are having infusions this week. ",

If all else fails, remember that a couple months of crappy food is not going to cause your family lasting harm. Neither is a dirty or messy house. Let go of anything that isn't essential to your health and healing right now. I totally understand about the breastfeeding and how important it is to you. Have faith that, given time, you will find the right path for your family. There are many avenues to parenthood, not all of which involve adoption or giving birth (and I don't know much about adoption, but why would having cancer put you out of the running once you have recovered?). Be open to all possibilities. I suspect the steroids are a big factor in how you feel at the moment. They really messed me up emotionally. I'm better now they have cleared my system, and I hope you will be once you get past them. Irene and Allie, sorry to hear about the bad side effects. Before you drop the chemo, make sure to get a second opinion about it. Research as much as possible; hit the library and stock up on books on BC. I've been reading Dr. Susan Love's breast book,www.dslrf.org, which has lots of detailed information about treatment I haven't seen online. You are both ER+ and node negative: have you had your oncoscore done? If not, you might want to consider doing so, as it will tell you your chances of recurrence based on the genetic typing of your cancer. (More at Oncoscore.com. I think Dr. Love has an online assessment as well.) And tell you MO how unhappy you are with the SE and that you are considering stopping chemo because of them. If they aren't responsive, it might be time for a change. If they won't let you have the Claritin (ask why not), try Tylenol (it helped me and is cheaper; my MO said I could do both together). Allie, not everyone has bad SE from the Neulasta; I had only mild symptoms.",

Maybe it's a good thing that Myriad lost their exclusive rights to do the test, if they can't even write a clear result on their reports.  Molinda, congrats on the clean path report, and sympathy for 5 days in the hospital. It would be my worst nightmare. Looks like I am heading for more surgery tomorrow. My implant infection is not responding to the antibiotics, so they are taking it out. I'm a bit confused about exactly what they are doing, as I haven't spoken to the PS yet, just his nurse. Very frustrating to have so many complications to the complications.

I know what a relief it wil be to have that tumor out! Just thought I would give you my perspective on the TE aspect. Having had the TE put in right after my MX is not something I would do again. I have had two delays in my chemo, both due to the surgery and healing problems, the second directly due to the infection in the TE. The bacteria that infected me was a type that is opportunistic and only infects those whose immune systems are compromised. Even then, the antibiotics would probably have worked, but the TE made it more difficult for the antibiotics to fight the infection because blood cannot circulate around it to clear up the infection directly on the TE. Once the TE was out, the infection cleared immediately. Now I will have to wait until chemo is done (and the thyroid surgery as well) to have another TE put in and then finally the permanent implant. That said, this is actually good news from my point of view. The TE was hideously uncomfortable, and I would not have been able to have the permanenet implant until sometime in late fall or winter anyway, after the thyroid surgery and possibly chemo for that. It's been a huge relief to have that TE out, and I am glad not to have to have it in there causing discomfort all those months. Now, after all the thyroid things are resolved, it will be a short process to have the TE back in (it shouldn't take long, as we were almost finished with the expansion) then the permanent implant. So, Heather, even though it is dissapointing now for reconstruction to be delayed, there are some benefits to it. Now you can have your reconstruction done when you are healthy and not immune compromised and can focus on it 100%.  DeleriumPie, congrats on finishing chemo! When is your surgery? Annie, sympathy for the 'roid rage. This too shall pass. Also, just curious why you are having herceptin if you are HER2 negative? Was your score borderline? Well, Dr. D and I prevailed, with the help of a good blood count, and yesterday I had my second T/H infusion only 8 days late. This time, we are trying the Claritin/Naproxin routine to help with the muscle and bone pain. Even so, I am prepared with my Vicodin.",

I found that if i propped up my feet on pillows at night so that they were higher than my heart, the swelling would go down at night, which would reduce the swelling during the day significantly.  I have to say that I haven't had any SEs from the Herceptin so far. The worst part seemed to be during the infusion. After they give me the Benadryl my feet and legs feel so strange and restless I can hardly sit still. Next time the nurse suggested reducing the amount of the Benadryl. Still have some annoying neuropathy in my feet: feels like walking on hot sand all the time. MO says most should go away in six months, but anything lasting past two years is permanent. One good thing the chemo did for me is to get rid of all the calluses on my feet. Towards the end of my Taxol treatments, the skin started coming off my feet in clumps. I freaked out until I realized it was just the dead, callused skin flaking off. They may feel bad, but my feet look better than they have in years! Jen, nice to hear that your hair is coming back and looking good. So far my fuzz looks even worse than the baldness. That letter about the mammogram is seriously flawed. Really, is that the best they can do? Probably written by lawyers.  I did not use any conditioners on my lashes or brows. They were the last to go, and I have just recently lost the last few straggly brow hairs and only have a few thin lashes left.  I still fatigue easier than before, but see steady improvement. I'm looking forward to a trip to Mendocino in October. Hoping everyone has a lovely first week of fall.",

It's funny about the national grouch day. After my surgery, they kept asking what my pain level was. The worst part of the surgery was having the IV. It hurt going in and didn't stop hurting the whole time it was in. I was mad that they wouldn't use my port. So when they asked for about the 20th time, I told them my pain level was annoying and extremely grumpy due to the pain of the IV and refused to give any other answer. I expect I came across as an unpleasant whiner, but I just didn't care. Finally the nurse offered to take out the IV, but said it was against medical advice. I said just take it out! I was a much happier camper after that. My hair is also coming back at different rates, the front is definitely sparser and shorter than the top and back. Herceptin is not bad so far. Echo is normal. Lynn, technically, when you are on Herceptin it's called targeted therapy, but because most people have no clue what that is, I just call it chemo.",

Lynn, seems like we have more parallels: I had an ankle rebuild/Achilles repair last October and had just completed my PT when I found the lump and was diagnosed in January. I've also had three surgeries on my right knee since 2006. Had my left thyroid lobe removed on the 14th. Preliminary results from the path report are that it is the follicular variant of papillary carcinoma (previous biopsy was indeterminate). No word yet on staging, which will be what really determines if the other half comes out. Unless there is something indicative that this is a \"clinically significant\" cancer, I'm leaning towards keeping the other half. I'm feeling done with medical care., and another surgery and more treatment just does not appeal, especially when there is such a low mortality with thyroid cancers of this type. I hope to hear from some of our other April Chemo Sisters, although I am glad to think that many have finished treatment and moved back to a more normal life.",

      "Content": "Dec 15, 2013 12:31AM - edited Dec 15, 2013 12:32AM by PamelaKay Hi all, Thinking about how one year ago in early December I first noticed a lump in my breast...I went to a holiday party shortly after finding the lump and before I decided to do something about it, and found myself chatting with a woman who manages research trials for new types of breast replacement implants. How's that for a giant \"Guess what?!!\" message from the cosmos? I've also had to come head-to-head with our annual holiday letter. How to start: \"\"This has been an exciting and adventuresome year with lots of new and unique experiences...\" No. \"2013: not my luckiest year ever...\" Uh-uh. \"...a year I'll never forget.\" Nope. In the end, I just skirted the issue. Almost everyone on the list already knows about this year's events in the cancer category, and they've heard enough about it already. Still dealing with the fallout from the thyroid cancer, which is the folicular variant of papillary thyroid cancer. The path report was a mixed bag: cells well-differentiated, no lymph node involvement or spread outside the thyroid. On the negative, it was un-encapsulated (growing out of it's fibroid outer surface); that plus the size and my age put the cancer in stage two, which means they want to remove the remaining lobe and do radioactive iodine (what passes for chemo in thyroid cancer) treatment. Even if I keep the other half, they still want me on thyroid hormone replacement. I'm considering going against medical advice on this. I'm feeling really done with surgeries, treatments, and pills. The Herceptin is going well; since I told them to hold the benedryl, I have no obvious side effects. I'm half-way through! Going for my fourth echo next week. Hope the rest of you are enjoying the holidays and doing well with your remaining treatments.",

Getting the right amount of food was key for me (not too much or too little) If that hasn't helped, here are a couple of things you can try: Ginger (candy, in tea, fresh blended in a smoothie) helps with nausea. There is also an acupressure point on the wrists you can use. You can buy Sea-bands which are wrist bands that have small bumps you can align with the pressure point. I think most drug stores have them these days.  Or, in a pinch, just put pressure on yourself or having someone else hold the poiint. You can find the point by putting two fingers on the  inside of you wrist ligned up below where the bend is, then press just below that in the middle of your wrist. (you can probably find more info and a better description online). Another prescription you can ask for is dexamethazone. It is a steroid, but it is for nausea also. My MO had me taking it for the three days after chemo to prevent nausea (it worked for me).  Did you get premeds prior to your infusion? Those are supposed to last for 3 days (I know they don't work for some people). If for some reason you didn't, you should find out why. The premeds took an hour and a half before the actual chemo drugs. Hope you feel better soon, Anne.",

Pamela Kay takes off her shirt. Her scarf comes off with it. No problem. Cap underneath. She struggles to pull her camisole off over her head without disturbing her last remaining head covering. Just as the camisole comes off, and the cap with it, she hears the door begin to open. Our heroine is now topless and bare headed. Mind racing, our heroine knows immediately what she must do. But first, a word from our sponsor. Chemogate : Brought to you by Moflo: the stool softener guaranteed to smooth out even the toughest obstructions and get you flowing like a river. No blockage is too sticky for Moflo! We now return you to Chemogate... With seconds to spare before Dr. D sees everything revealed, our half-naked, bare-headed, heroine dives for the floor, rummaging through her clothes. Finally, there it is! Pamela Kay grabs the cap and jams it on her head, just in the nick of time! With any luck, Dr. D was spared the sight of her mostly-hairless head before he hastily ducked back out the door. A few minutes later, decorum restored, Dr. D comes in and checks Pamela Kay\u2019s benighted proto-breast, which to her looks like it has been daubed with raw hamburger, and says, \u201cLooks like things are doing well.\u201d Before Pamela Kay can wonder if he is looking at the same breast she is looking at, Dr. D is aiming a large needle at her filled with 50 CCs of fluid and has jammed it into the proto-breast. At this point, Pamela Kay realizes that the proto-breast may not be as numb has she had previously thought. \u201cSo,\u201d asks Dr. D as he slowly presses down the plunger, \u201cdid you do your chemo?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d Pamela Kay replies, \u201cnot yet.\u201d \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t the chemo happened?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard to\u2026\u201d \u201cI told you to do the chemo last week.\u201d \u201cBut\u2026\u201d \u201cJust do the chemo!\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d As Pamela Kay leaves the office, she realizes she now has the answer to a question that has been bothering her for some time. Why is it that this man, who has seen her breasts many times, compared them, measured them, drawn diagrams on them, and operated on them, is not allowed to be in the same room when she takes off her shirt? The answer is now abundantly clear: there are far worse things that could be revealed while undressing than mere breasts or proto-breasts. She sincerely hopes that she had that cap on her head before Dr. D had the door open enough to see her uncovered, sparsely-haired head! Next week on Chemogate, will Pamela Kay\u2019s proto-breast continue its slide towards the hamburger side, or will it be healed enough to avoid the dreaded Massive Chest Infection?

I have found that even people who know I am having chemo come up and hug me whenever they see me.

Should I reject all hugs, or screen people before the hugs to weed out the sick ones (which is still taking a chance because healthy people are contagious days before showing symptoms)? I would just stay home, but these are important events for our community and my family. By the way, the other day I saw someone I haven't seen in a while who didn't know about the BC. He complimented me on my new look with hat the and scarf. I figured I'd better let him know (those are always hard conversations to have). He said that he wondered about chemo when he saw the new look. I have been wondering if people think that; I guess no amount of frills covers up such a drastic change.

What a terrible concatenation of experiences for you. I hope the rest of the week improves.  Heather: Wonderful to  hear about the BRCA results.  For those with shortness of breath, here is a worksheet (someone else here posted this a while ago) that has a detailed list of symptoms that tells you when to call the doctor. It says if you have shortness of breath with a normal level of activity or at rest, call the doc.  BeHereNow, taking Ativan at night before bed helps me sleep and helps with anxiety. My MO also prescribed Cipro, but I haven't used it yet, as the Ativan works well enough on its own.  Dealing with teens: I have 16 and 22 year-old sons. They have both been fairly quiet about the cancer. I think this is because they really don't know how to respond. My older son talks to me about it when he sees I am down. The teen has not said much. I know they are both very aware and concerned, even though they don't talk much about it. I look for the little things (recently my younger son wrote the most amazing thing I have ever seen him write for his creative writing class; completely different from his usual writing and very touching. Nothing directly about cancer, but so stunning I have to think he was doing some heavy duty mental processing). The average teenager is such a bundle of raging hormones, I think they hardly know which end is up. I occasionally take time to check in with them and ask if they have any questions or want to talk. Then it is up to them. Mostly, I think they want to be reassured that I will be OK and nothing will change too drastically.  PugMom, I think it is a great idea to see a counselor to work through how you feel about your girls. Getting a fresh perspective may help you decide how to proceed. Deep breath here.  Body image and our DH. This is a huge topic. My response to this whole experience has surprised me in many ways. Today, I was outside puttering around when a stranger unexpectedly drove up our driveway (we live in a rural area) I had on a regular shirt, but no scarf or jacket to disguise the lopsidedness. I found myself clutching the mail I had just picked up to hide the missing part. Before that, I hadn't even thought about how I looked. It still surprises me that I care what a stranger thinks when he looks at my body. It strikes me that a lot of the BC experience involves diminishment, fear, and loss. We lose our sense of security, all or part of our breasts, our hair, and our sense of what it means to be ourselves. We are confronted with our mortality in a way we never were before. This is a huge thing to process and work through, and it will take time and dedicated effort to do so. But know this: no matter how diminished we are, no matter the loss or fear we experience, we still have the same spirit inside to guide us, the same foundations we have based our lives on are still there underneath.  We are called on to seek out and develop our deeper strengths, to find new paths through unknown territory. It will never be easy, and we may stumble many times, but we still have our integrity, and nothing can take that away. BeHereNow, you have been through so many challenges. What carried you through before is still there, if a bit battered and bruised right now. My DH has made his priority here clear: me alive and well. My body is a different place than it was before, with many changes to come. I will deal with the changes as best I can, one at a time. With time, we as a couple will come to terms with and adapt to this new reality. Cancer can diminish me, and it can scare me, but it can never make me a different person.  OK. Enough of that. Now, go get some chocolate and chase away those chemo doldrums.",

This episode of Chemogate  brought to you by Chemowax: the only hair remover made from the finest wax impregnated with powerful hair-removing chemo drugs. Guaranteed to remove unwanted hair all over your entire body, from head to toes, and even inside your nose. [Not guaranteed to remove all hair from all body parts. Some body parts may experience only partial and/or patchy hair loss. Note that hair loss may include some wanted hair, such as eyebrows and lashes.  Side effects may include, but are not limited to, vomiting, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, rashes, and loss of immune system.]  We find our heroine getting another fill at the office of Dr. D, the plastic surgeon. As he injects another 50 ccs of saline into the ever-enlarging proto-breast, Dr. D makes small talk, \u201cSo, um, have you experienced any of that hair loss yet?\u201d To this, the stunned Pamela Kay can only reply, \u201cYes, I have.\u201d While she is quite perplexed that Dr. D apparently has not only hamburger blindness, but hat and scarf blindness as well, she finds some comfort in finally getting the answer to the question that has plagued her since the time several weeks before when she had to choose between covering her balding, wispy-haired top and her bare chest. Pamela Kay now knows for certain that she had covered her head before Dr. D opened the door enough to see that, indeed, she had definitely experienced that hair loss thing. This week, our heroine\u2019s trusty medical oncologist is on vacation, and Pamela Kay\u2019s pre-chemo check is performed by Dr. J's associate, Dr. Why. After a thorough exam, Dr. Why spies a problem on Pamela Kay\u2019s lab report done the previous week. \u201cAh,\u201d he exclaims, \u201cyour blood plasma is at 106. That\u2019s pretty low, and it could be even lower now! Let\u2019s check it again and see what it is today.\u201d Our suddenly despondent heroine trudges down the hall to the nurses\u2019 station to get her finger pricked. Soon the results are in, \u201cBlood plasma is 84, that\u2019s way too low for chemo today.\u201d Seeing the look on Pamela Kay\u2019s face, Dr. Why, correctly interpreting it to mean that, come hell or high water, our heroine will get her chemo today, even if she has to mug some healthy-looking passerby for a blood transfusion, comes up with an alternative. \u201cLet\u2019s do a blood draw from your port and send it over to the hospital for a second try.\u201d An hour or so later the results are in. The jubilant Dr. Why comes up to Pamela Kay and announces, with some apparent relief, \u201cIt\u2019s 114! Chemo is on!\u201d Happily ignoring the possible reasons for the 30 point spread between the two draws done ½ hour apart, our heroine gets hooked up to the IV. A few hours later, having been transfused with three premeds, two tubes of the ruby-colored Adriamycin, and a bag of Cytoxan, our heroine stops in at the restroom for some needed relief. Observing the effects of the Adriamycin as she flushes the toilet, Pamela Kay jubilantly realizes that perhaps pink ribbons are used to symbolize breast cancer awareness for a much better reason than the trite \u201cpink is for girls\u201d/\u201dbreast cancer is for women\u201d connection. Next week on Chemogate: Between more visits to the handsome chiropractor, Dr. Cartwheels, and a follow-up with her accomplished breast surgeon, Dr. Smallnick, Pamela Kay hopes to banish any lurking concerns about the nagging back pain that has been plaguing her for the last three weeks.   ",

What that means for me is that she is not seeing patients for the next month while she does so, and I will have to see a \u201csubstitute\u201d oncologist for the next two treatments, then switch back to my original MO at a different treatment center for my infusions. Very bad time to have to do so, as I will be starting my new drugs for the second of those two chemos, so all the questions I have about it will have to be asked of the substitute MO, about whom I know almost nothing. I\u2019ll be meeting this new MO 15 minutes prior to my next infusion on Tuesday. I\u2019ve actually met this person (a retired MO) once briefly in a non-medical situation. Unfortunately, during our brief interaction she did not impress me as someone I would want for my doctor, at least personality-wise. My impression of her was that she is a my-way-or-the-highway type; exactly the kind of person I will not do well with. It seems the only other options I have are switching to another MO in the same practice (and probably they are booked and I would still have to see the substitute until I could get on their schedule) or trying to switch to an entirely different practice (which would probably delay treatment). No good options as far as I can see. I will try to focus on just getting through the chemo, but it sure is upsetting and disappointing to have this happen. I'm trying to put this in perspective as not the worst thing that could happen. Still, I chose my oncologist because I felt she was a good fit for the kind of MD I work well with. Now I'm stuck with a mystery MO at an important point in treatment. Plus, I'm now so angry with my regular MO (not exactly rational, but that's where I'm at at the moment) for abandoning me to a stranger, I can't even imagine seeing her for treatment in July and feeling good about it. (I'm feeling a rather teenagerish desire to punish her by not telling her any of my SE or asking any questions.) Hoping this will pass by then. Thanks for hearing the rant. Any help with perspectivizing this appreciated. Will also accept sympathy and righteous indignation. ",

Yesterday was fine, but today I'm feeling sore fingertips and a bit achy and tired. I'm starting L-Glutamine, B6, and B12 today. That was the last treatment at the original infusion center. I'll start next Tuesday at the infusion center my oncologist has moved to (with my herceptin only infusion). I stopped in there yesterday to check it out. The infusion center is run by the hospital, and it shows. All very sterile, regimented, and formal. I will definitely miss the old, informal and cozy infusion center where \"everybody knows your name.\" At the hospital center the first thing they do (after you sign a dozen forms) is slap a wrist bracelet on you, so I guess they don't need to actually know you or your name. I've now seen three different MOs at the old practice for each of my last three treatments. Maybe if I come to regret staying with Dr J and moving to the hospital infusion center, I'll just trot back across the street and beg them to take me back. It's a bad omen that they didn't have my Tuesday treatment on their schedule. Apparently Dr. J forgot when she gave them the orders for her patients for next week. ShipsGirl, I believe Gabapentin is only for nerve pain. I don't think it is supposed to help muscle pain. Molinda, best to you on Monday. I'll send some light your way. Hushkat, hope the fatigue eases up. I found there was a definite pattern to it, with the worst being from days 3 to 6, then getting better from there. Keep up with the anti-nausea meds.

It's good that you are getting other opinions. For me, lymphedema was/is a big fear factor. I try to take some comfort that it doesn't happen in every case and in learning about treatment (early is better). Ultimately, you have to make a decision that you are comfortable with; none of those surgeons will have to live in your body afterwards. I wonder if the decision can be postponed for a few weeks or months until you have had a chance to heal and process? It doesn't sound like this need to be done in a huge hurry. Right now, you are in a very emotional state, and a decision like this is hard enough when you are feeling strong. Consider asking your surgeon about putting off the surgery decision for a while.  I have heard from other cancer survivors that they do stop thinking about it so often. One friend said that eventually she realized she hadn't thought about it all day, then all week, then she couldn't remember the last time she thought about it. I found that for me, once I was through the acute phase (decisions, surgery, treatment) I was not so constantly focused on it. I have to say, though, that the ads I keep hearing for Cancer Centers of America give me a jolt every time they come on.  DaffyC, right after my surgery I wore a long scarf draped around my neck and a loose shirt. The scarf was long enough to drape down both sides and disguise my drain and the unevenness. I also used a leather shawl that worked for this too. Unfortunately that was when the weather was cooler and I didn't mind the scarf around my neck. Another thing I did was wear a tank top with a very thin, loose button-down shirt over the top. I kept the shirt half buttoned up, and it was large enough that there were lots of folds to hide things. I really scrounged through my closet to find things that would work; didn't buy anything new except the scarves and a couple of stretchy tank tops.",

I realized it was similar to when I was first diagnosed, with many unknowns. Once I had some answers, I felt less terrified. To help with the pre-chemo jitters, I just tried to distract myself with other things (from laundry to jigsaw puzzles). Now I know what to expect, round two doesn't seem so frightening (at least, from a week away). I too had a moment of concern when I saw my MO the day before chemo was scheduled, and she was concerned by the surgery wound not looking healed enough. I panicked and practically turned myself inside-out trying to convince her it was OK (ultimately, she gave it the go ahead). She said that she was careful because one of her patients had not been healed enough and ened up with a nasty infection in her chest wall. It helped to hear that there might be worse consequences than having to delay chemo for a week or two, even though it sounded like the end of the world at that moment.  Made my first chemo-related impulse buy today. I was out all afternoon and, because of my sore mouth, couldn't eat the food I had brought (need to figure out portable soft foods). Starving, I fell prey to a display of Vitamix blenders (all those lovely pictures of blended-up shakes) and decided it was the answer to all my problems.  Just a thought for those with anxiety and sleep problems. I've been doing really well with Ativan (Lorzapam). My MO prescribed it for both nausea and sleep. I started taking it a couple of weeks before chemo, and it really helped me feel better to get a good night's sleep (I've just been taking one at night). She also prescribed Celexa, but the Ativan worked so well I haven't needed it. Just that one thing (a good night's sleep) helped so much.

For those considering this method, I can't recommend it. First, you have to have an on-demand water heater (I do). Then you have to have lots of time (fortunately I woke up early). And lastly, you have to have lots of patience (which I ran out of before all the hair was out). This was pretty much the longest shower I've ever taken, but I decided if there's one time in life you get to waste water, it's when you are in this situation. I think if I had kept on, I would have gotten it all out, eventually. As is, right now I have about 10% of my hair left.

This is just part of the normal healing process. You would have been fine with the chemo.\" Torn between two conflicting opinions, who will our heroine believe?

Rockermom, so sorry to hear your incision is causing problems. I hope you don't have to miss a treatment. I have had to go a whole month since my first chemo. In some ways, it's been nice to feel well for a couple of weeks, but really, I just want to get the chemo over and done with. And I really dread next week and chemo number two. At least I am prepared now with my Vitamix blender! Best wishes for speedy healing, Rockermom. I keep looking back on my appointment with Dr. D, thinking how weird it was that my first instinct was to cover my head, not the rest of my body. Then, when all my clothes slid off the chair and ended up in a heap on the floor, cap on bottom, I really panicked because I didn't want him to see my head uncovered! Before this, I would never in a million years have thought I would react like that; my usual attitude is, I am what I am: if someone doesn't like it, it's their problem. Strange how your priorities change. I'm having lots of fun with hats, scarves, and decorations. I have my basic ensemble: Buff topped with fancy long scarf (long ends over the left shoulder), decorated with a magnetic chain set tiara-style on top of the scarf(the chain really jazzes things up and adds definition to the look). Today I added a hat (an old fedora that belonged to my husband's grandfather). I tied a favorite small scarf around the brim with the ends trailing down to cover my neck. I also added a braiding scrunchie (two scrunchies linked together with a beaded chain)and braided it into the two ends of the scarf over my shoulder. I have to say, I quite liked the effect. All these decorations are things I have had sitting around forever (the scrunchie from years ago when I had long hair; it was just too pretty to get rid of). I guess being a pack rat pays off sometimes. I appreciate all of you on this board. I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have somewhere to share all my experiences in this long, strange trip.",

The comment I get the most is, \"You look great!\" I keep wondering, compared to what? Did I look that bad before? Or do I look better than they expected a person with cancer to look? (This started before chemo and hair loss, and even now people still say that.) Or is that just the only positive thing they can think of to say? Maybe it's just that, for the first time in years, thanks to the Ativan, I'm getting a good night's sleep every night.  I try to accept the compliments graciously and not read too much into them.  No, Indenial, you don't sound like a nutcase, just someone who has been through physical and mental trauma and is on steroids. I think your feelings are entirely normal for where you are in the process right now.  You have a lot of strong emotions right now.  I say this from the perspective of someone who is over 3 weeks away from being dosed with steroids. I recall how hard control was to come by during the first couple of weeks, and how grateful I was to start feeling normal again in the third week. You have not gotten that break to feel normal again.  So give yourself the understanding that, in addition to the trauma, you are being influenced by a powerful drug that affects your emotions. Keep on talking about them here and wherever else you feel safe.  Indenial, I hope you can find a solution to your rash. Consider if there is anything new (soaps or lotions) you are using that might be irritating your skin, including any caps you are wearing. Some fabrics can cause reactions or have chemicals on them that can cause reactions.  Rockermom, I lost only a few more hairs than normal during the second week after my first chemo. On day 16 it started coming out in clumps and hand fulls. I just kept pulling the hair out until I lost patience and gave up (see my post on page 23 for the whole story). After that, it continued to come out in hand fulls for about another week. Now, at 3 1/2 weeks from the first chemo, there's only a few wisps in patchy spots left (I decided not to buzz it). I still have all my other body hair (including luxuriously growing chin hairs, darn it!). I'm curious to see what happens after chemo  number 2 next week. ",

Maybe your hair just got brittle, and the extra weight of the extensions caused the brittle hair to break off. Good luck with your incisions. I'm off to the MO and PS tomorrow.

I expect you must have developed some powerful emotional muscle by now.  Molinda, I sent you a PM with my personal story on my decision. I'm sure all the ladies here will second my suggestion for an Ativan prescription; it will really help with getting a good night's sleep and help reduce the panic. Kerri, sorry to hear you are in the doldrums. Sending hugs and wishes for a fresh breeze to help you sail through those doldrums as fast as possible. Regarding Ports: I love mine (I am a \"hard stick\"). It was painful in general for the first few weeks. Now, as long as I am careful not to bang on it or put pressure on it (especially from the passenger side seat belt, which I wrap around my back), it is not painful at all.  As to port pain during infusions, I have found the EMLA cream useful (put on at least 1 hour ahead; I use a Nexus, cover with no pad instead of taping on the wrap). I didn't need a prescription, just got it at a pharmacy. I heard later that you can get it cheaper at Costco. A couple of times I forgot the EMLA. They injected lido cane, which worked well. I tried once without anything, just to see how it would go. It wasn't super painful, but it hurt enough both during the insertion and throughout the day, for me to know I prefer to have it numbed. I also tried putting it on only 1/2 hour before; it helped, but 1 hour was better; I've gone up to 1 1/2 hours after application with good results). Make sure they are using a Huber needle for the port (I expect it is standard, but you never know).  For those having the IV directly in the vein, I've seen our onco nurses put warm blankets on the arm before putting in the IV. It helps pump up the blood flow. If they aren't doing so, ask for this if you are having a hard time. Had my fourth and last AC yesterday. Went well. Substitute doc was \"OK,\" but I miss Dr. J.  Hair report: about 5% of my head hair is gone. The rest is growing profusely (I never shaved out of curiosity as to what would happen). Most fell out about 16 days after 1st chemo. I keep expecting the rest to follow suit, but so far no luck (looks completely ridiculous as my hair is frizzy and sticks straight up like clown hair, even with only wisps left). Still have eyebrows and lashes, and a bit of fuzz on the mustache; I think some of the larger hairs are gone, as are most of the chin hairs. TMI alert: the hairs growing out of the mole under my lip have vanished (yippee!). Nether regions mostly the same as the head: very sparse but not completely gone. Breast hair gone; pits are thinned. Leg hair gone in patches (maybe where my pants have rubbed it off?). Fingers and toes: thinner but still there. Taxol/Herceptin schedule for me is Taxol/Herceptin in week 1 followed by Herceptin only in week two (this will be 1/3 the dose of what I will get later). This schedule goes for 8 weeks. Then I switch to Herceptin only every three weeks to finish out a year on Herceptin.  Best wishes for everyone feeling better. Don't forget to treat yourself somehow when you are low (flowers, massage, comfort food); it really helps. Pamela Kay",

If she is having pain when eating, then definitely call and request the numbing mouthwash right away (my MO prescribed Stanford mouthwash). You should also have the MO examine her to make sure she doesn't have thrush. Here are a few things I found helpful. When I am getting my infusions, I constantly sip ice water. Only need to do this during the actual chemo drugs, not the premeds. This decreases circulation of blood to the mouth, thus less damage to the cells there. I found just plain baking soda worked better as a mouthwash for me than the Bioteen. The recipe I was given was: 1 Tablespoon Baking Soda, 1 Teaspoon Salt mixed in 4 pints of water. I just usually mix about 1/4 teaspoon of Baking Soda in 1/4 cup water each time I need it (I omit the salt due to high blood pressure). I use this several times a day, and always after I eat. I did find using the Bioteen toothpaste helpful, as regular toothpaste seemed to irritate my mouth. To deal with the taste problems: Using plastic (or any non-metal) utensils is helpful in reducing taste problems. Distilled water for drinking is good too. Blender foods are good if it is painful to eat. Smoothies are an excellent choice (I would stay away from acidic fruits, such as pineapple). You can add protein powder to them for an extra boost. I also found scrambled eggs and re-fried beans to be good food choices. I find soft cheeses good too; goat cheese is my favorite. As a last resort, the liquid meals (such as Ensure) would at least get calories down. Hope this helps. Let us know how it goes.",

      "Content": "Jul 14, 2013 05:32AM PamelaKay wrote: Chemogate 7/13/13 (Oh! Unlucky number!!!) Previously on Chemogate:  Pamela Kay was sent on a round of testing by the anxious Dr. J in an attempt to explain our gastrointestinally-challenged heroine\u2019s mysterious abdominal pain. What new miseries will be revealed by the results? As promised, our Pamela Kay has arrived for her CAT scan on a lovely Friday morning. After a tasty treat of vanilla-flavored barium drink, our heroine is amazed at the ease of having a CAT scan and warmed with the thrill of being infused with iodine tracers.  Two hours later, she finds herself in bed, unable to accomplish more than a few hasty visits to the bathroom, a situation that continues until Monday morning, when she wakes up feeling a bit more normal. As our heroine showers, she reflects on the shape of the proto-breast, especially in comparison to her natural breast. If they were headlights, she muses, the natural breast would be lighting the asphalt and bushes at the side of the road. In contrast, the proto-breast would be shining somewhere in the trees above.  And, rather than having the contours of a gently rolling hill, the natural breast is vaguely reminiscent of a somewhat sagging ski jump, perhaps one even an experienced Olympian jumper would think twice about trying, and the rather irregularly-sculpted proto-breast could be better characterized by an ice-covered mogul carved and shaped by herds of hot-shot skiers as they bounce down the steep mountainside. Dr. D has indicated that the next fill will likely be the last. Our heroine had hoped that by this point, the proto-breast would have some resemblance to an actual body part that might have naturally occurred. She finds it hard to imagine how the icy mogul will be transformed into a gently sloping ski jump by the simple removal of the tissue expander and substitution of the promised permanent implant. Stepping out of the shower, Pamela Kay glances in the mirror for a last comparison, where she spies a rather disturbing development: half the proto-breast is now a rather unnatural blotchy red and purple color, which sends our multi-colored heroine dashing for the phone to call Dr. D. Two hours later at his office, Dr. D confirms Pamela Kay\u2019s concern: this is definitely an infected implant.  Antibiotics and rest are ordered. But first, our heroine must visit Dr. J for the revelation of last week\u2019s test results, which, naturally, explain nothing of the origins of the mysterious abdominal issues. But those were last week\u2019s symptoms; after some strategizing to plan for next week\u2019s chemo approach, Pamela Kay brings up another nagging concern: the cough she has had for the last two months just isn\u2019t going away, and would Dr. J mind if she treated it homeopathically? Suddenly, the alarms are going off, and Dr. J is demanding another CAT scan. Loath to undergo another thrill-filled barium and iodine experience, our unenlightened heroine questions what in the world Dr. J thinks she will uncover? After listening to Dr. J\u2019s somewhat convoluted discourse on needing to check on any cough, no matter how minor, that had lasted two months, the light finally dawns and Pamela Kay finally understands what all the CAT scan fuss is about, in spite of Dr. J\u2019s odd refusal to say the actual word. Apparently, Pamela Kay\u2019s determination to put the matter out of her mind has blinded her to this suddenly obvious connection between the ordering of multiple CAT scans and the reporting of what she had considered to be simply chemo side effects: the dreaded metastasis! At this point, we can understand how the reader may be somewhat reluctant to believe that, after so much fuss about her back pain, somehow our oblivious heroine had not made this connection, but, we beg the reader to consider the depths of misery our heroine\u2019s life had taken her; depths where even metastasis was only a vague, half-forgotten shadow. Even our heroine is stunned by just how oblivious she had been. It is true. The side effects of chemo are so horrible they can make you forget the reason you are having chemo in the first place! But, for now, our heroine has only one goal: ridding the body of infection and getting back on track with the chemo. Knowing that the last thing she needs right now is more tests, Pamela Kay convinces Dr. J to put off the CAT scan. What she needs first is rest, and rest she does. Pamela Kay rests harder than she has ever rested in her life. She rests and takes pills, then takes more pills and rests. In between, she makes many checks on the proto-breast and reports to Dr. D\u2019s nurse. The reports aren\u2019t going well. Maybe some parts are less red, but some are more red. At Nurse Baneful\u2019s request, Pamela Kay outlines the red area on the proto-breast with a marker in hopes of seeing a reduction.  But by Thursday, it is clear that, even though the top corner has turned less red, not enough progress is being made, and Nurse Baneful delivers the sad news: the implant must go! Our feverish heroine once again contemplates the proto-breast, now more reminiscent of a misshapen  strawberry muffin hot out of the oven than an icy mogul, and wonders what will become of it, and if there is still any hope for any kind of a ski jump whatsoever? On Friday, the deed is done, and on Saturday, all that is left for our un-implanted heroine to do is contemplate how something that has taken three long, laborious, months to slowly inflate could be so quickly deflated. The lumpy balloon, once hard and filled to capacity, now punctured, is empty and shriveled.  No longer even a misshapen muffin, but a Halloween Jack-o-Lantern left to shrivel and cave in on the porch until Thanksgiving, rows of stitching on the bottom indicating the remains of a toothy carved mouth.   As our heroine bemoans the loss of her once-disdained but now mourned-for carved, icy mogul, she realizes that she must think of the future. Dr. D has said that chemo must go on, and next week is not too soon. Once again, however, Dr. J is reluctant, and has announced that next week is much too soon. Pamela Kay takes a deep breath and prepares for battle. Armed with Dr. D\u2019s ammo, Pamela Kay sets her sights squarely on Dr. J, determined that no matter what, chemo will happen next week! Next week on Chemogate:  With both Dr. D and Pamela Kay ready to shoot her down, will Dr. J be able to halt the chemo train before it takes them over the cliff of Massive Infection? Has the train already gone over the cliff? What are the proto-breast's prospects for reconstruction? Have they faded like the sun over the gently rolling hills? Find out in the next episode of Chemogate!",

My sympathy for the complications and bad news about the nodes. So do I understand that the node they took out, and at first told you was just damaged, was reexamined and turned out to be malignant? I haven't been in that situation, but can tell you that in your place, I would be looking to consult with other surgeons/oncologists. Maybe even consider switching surgeons if you're not happy about what they did. Do you live near an area where there are well-known BC surgeons at a larger hospital? I traveled 50 miles to go to a surgeon with a good reputation.  Melinda, sorry to hear about the infected drains. Let us know what happens. Anne, bummer about the cellulitis; sounds like a very unwelcome visitor. Shipsgirl, your shoes made me smile, and reminded me of the time I wore my Ugg slippers to work (and that was before BC, so no chemobrain excuse for me). Johnetta, my onc says the effects accumulate, so this last chemo might be the worst. I'm not finished with chemo, but can relate: after one of my chemo's I had a dinner meltdown too. I was determined to finish it myself, but thank goodness for my wonderful hubby who took over when I collapsed. 6Cats, I had Gabapentin after a complicated ankle surgery last year. I had a lot of nerve disruption, and the Gabapentin definitely helped (as I found out when I forgot to take it for a couple of days; never did that again!). I had no noticeable side effects. I think after I was on it a couple of months, I started to have some minor effects (dizziness), and that was when I realized it was time to stop as I didn't need it anymore.  Congrats to Shipsgirl, DaffyC, Sandra, and Virginia on being PFC! I won't be PFC for a year, but only have two more Taxol, then it's only Herceptin after that.  Both of the two Taxol treatments so far have hit me hard; worse than the AC. About day 3, I get hit by the Taxol truck: nerve, muscle, and bone pain, pelvic pain, exhaustion, nausea. I'm slowly loosing what's left of my hair, brows, and lashes. The only good thing is that the Vicodin keeps me from having diarrhea. A week and a half out from #2 Taxol I am finally feeling a bit better. Next week I am determined to start the Vicodin BEFORE the truck hits. No more trying to catch up to the pain.   An interesting note: my MO says she thinks the combination of the Taxol and Neulasta is what makes it bad. She offered to stop the Neulasta, but I was afraid that low counts would delay treatments if I did that, so I'm toughing it out. I never had any problems with the Neulasta when I was on the AC. Does this jive with anyone else's experience? {{TMI alert}} I never, ever thought I would have occasion to ask this, but does anyone else really miss their pubic and nose hair?",

Fortunately I am doing the dose dense TH, which is Taxol every 2 weeks, so I get a week of feeling good in between the Taxol treatments.

Somewhere on this board someone (maybe someone in this April Chemo group) mentioned buffs, which are tubes of fabric about 20 inches long that can be used in several ways to cover your head. I got one from REI, and I can already tell it will be my \"go to\" for daily wear. It is very quick and easy to put on, stays on even if I bend over, is light and cool enough that I hardly notice it's on, and works great as a base layer to put other scarves and decorations on. Yesterday being the first day I had to go hairless, I had to quickly figure out how to cover up. I tried several different methods, including the TLC knit hat, with no success, before trying the buff. I doubled it up and made it into a cap, tied a scarf around the rim with the long ends of the scarf over my shoulder to camouflage my missing part, then wrapped a magnetic chain on top for decoration. It was perfect, with just enough height, without having to stuff something underneath. Today, I'm just wearing it \"do-rag\" style on its own, as I am just staying at home all day.  Several companies sell buffs on line, just search for \"buff bandanna\". REI has a video on how to wear them in different styles, several of which will work for us chemoites. They are $20 and up. You can get a UV protection version.  Reindeer, I was much less affected by my chemo (I've only had one so far) than I expected. The first week was the worst, being a bit more tired than usual and having less reserves. Lessons I learned: don't do anything more than what you need to do. Cancel any extra activities, especially the first week. Plan on resting as soon as you get home. The first three days I didn't have any side effects or nausea, thanks to the IV premeds (Aloxi, Emend, Decadron: make sure you get those!). After that, take your Zoefran (non-sedating anti-nausea drug) at the first sign of any stomach distress. Take your Ativan (sedating anti-nausea drug) every night at bed time to help you get a good night's sleep. If you don't have at least those two drugs (I have 4 total anti-nausea), ask for them.  Another great find was small bottles of Purelle that have rubber loops that can be attached to your purse. I got several and have them everywhere. I make sure to use them every time I have to touch anything, from door handles to key pads at the market.  OK, Virginger, you asked for the cast list of Chemogate, so here it is. George Clooney as Doctor D, the mature and taciturn PS. Zooey Deschanel as Doctor J., the young medical oncologist. Sela Ward as the wise homeopath. And, of course, Mary McDonnell (who portrayed Laura Roslin, the president who had BC, on Battlestar Galactica)  as our hairless heroine.  ",

Previously on Chemogate:  Will Dr. D\u2019s hamburger blindness defeat Pamela Kay\u2019s determination to get her next round of chemo on time?  Where will our ever-expanding heroine turn to for help next? Frustrated by lack of any useful information on healing her damaged proto-breast from the MDs, Pamela Kay knows she has only one last hope for help. Desperately, she calls her wise and trusted homeopath, Dr. Coping, \u201cHelp! Hamburger-breast syndrome heading toward the dark side. What can I do?\u201d she sobs. Dr. Coping tells Pamela Kay to stop the bacitracin and start using Colloidal Silver first aid gel. Pamela Kay quickly purchases the gel and applies it to her injured parts. Amazingly, just a few hours later, the breast looks much better. More gel. Next morning, it\u2019s a whole new scene: the Colloidal Silver is a champion hamburger helper! A few more helpings of gel, and things have completely turned around. Our healed heroine can hardly wait for the doctors to see this. Dr. D is, as usual, eager to inject. He pauses briefly before plunging to mention that things are looking good. Dr. J smiles and says \u201cVery nice: you are cleared for chemo tomorrow.\u201d Pamela Kay hardly has time to do her \u201cI get to have chemo\u201d happy dance when the next shoe falls. \u201cBy the way,\u201d Pamela Kay unwittingly mentions, \u201cI\u2019m going the chiropractor for adjustments. I\u2019ve had some lower back pain that\u2019s been bothering me.\u201d Suddenly, Dr. J leaps up and starts poking our heroine\u2019s aching back. With a concerned look, Dr. J lets the questions fly, \u201cHas this happened before? How long has the pain been going on? Is this any different from when you\u2019ve had back pain before?\u201d As Pamela Kay blithely reassures Dr. J that this is just the same old back pain she\u2019s had for years, a strange transference happens. Like a nasty virus, Dr. J has infected our hapless heroine with the doubt bug. IS it the same? IS there something different? Is it possible that this could be something worse? At her next visit to the handsome chiropractor, Dr. Cartwheels, Pamela Kay subtly probes for information, \u201cSo, does anything feel different to you than it has before? You don\u2019t feel any, uh \u2026strange lumps, do you?\u201d Immediately catching her drift, Dr. Cartwheels is quick to reassure her that this is not cancer spreading, just the same back issues she has had before. Unless it gets much worse and keeps her awake at night, he tells her, don\u2019t worry about it. Temporarily reassured, our not-too-badly aching heroine heads home, thinking, it feels better already\u2026doesn\u2019t it? Coming on Chemogate:  Will our heroine manage to sleep at all between worrying about whether her back actually hurts enough to keep her awake, or whether she is awake because she is worrying about just how much her back is hurting?  Join us next week to find out on Chemogate!

I think our digestion is compromised and we aren't absorbing nutrients properly. For those of you who are having this SE, check with your MO about a supplements. I have always felt liquid vitamins were more easily absorbed, especially for those whose digestion is compromised, as ours is while undergoing chemo. Consider a liquid iron supplement plus a good quality liquid vitamin.  About the Taxol, side effects, and nails, I've been looking for info on this for a while. I've heard from others on the boards that they had minimal side effects and no nail problems (even those not chilling nails). Some have had more problems. I've heard that Taxol has less nail problems than Taxotere, but have found no actual research or facts to back this up. I've also heard that both can cause nail problems about half the time, and that it takes 6 high-dose treatments for nails to be affected. I found little direct research to back up any of these statements.  (Anyone that wants all the references, PM me.) I've decided that, for myself, I will do what I have for the AC: spend as much time as possible clutching my ice-filled water bottle. The three-hour infusion just seems too long to try to ice the whole time, even if I could figure out a way to haul in enough ice to keep peas frozen all day long.  I'm also going to discuss with my MO the use of Gabapentin and supplements (L-glutamine, B6) to deal with any neuropathy. ",

They are constantly doing research on new cancer drugs. I mentioned before the young man I know who just started working for a cancer research company looking for new targeted therapies. While he's just starting out, he's very smart and motivated: a good person to have on your team.  Hushcat, I'm on the opposite end: just finishing AC (last round next week) and starting Taxol/herceptin. For me, I had relatively few problems with the AC, and am more worried about the TH coming up (especially the possibilities of allergic reaction).  For the last two infusions, I brought a bottle of iced water. I held it and sipped it through the chemo infusions. I haven't had as much mouth soreness or loss of taste since I started doing that. Can't say for certain if that's a direct cause/effect, but I'll continue doing it just in case. No nail problems so far either. I had my DH at the first AC, but just went on my own for the others. My premeds were in the IV. They (or something else) made me sleepy during the treatment, but I was able to drive home with no problem. I had steroids in the premeds, which kept me from being sleepy as well. This would be a good question to ask your MO or the chemo nurses: will your premeds be sedating or not? The chemo nurses know exactly what you will be getting and how it will affect you; they are a great resource.  I plan to have someone drive me to and from my first TH at least. For me, it's a long all-day of infusion, so I'm going to be cautious, at least for the first treatment. ",

Pamela Kay\u2019s long-awaited visit to the breast surgeon finally arrives, and she heads in with a list of questions aimed at focusing Dr. Smallnick\u2019s razor-sharp intellect on the mysterious, lingering back pain. After a satisfactory breast exam, Pamela Kay blasts out her questions: Dr. Smallnick, this back pain, it\u2019s not going away\u2026 Not unusual, sometimes it takes a while for back pain to resolve. But, it gets better after the chemo treatments, then worse again\u2026  That wouldn\u2019t be a sign of metastasized bone cancer. What if\u2026. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, be happy!\u201d  Dr. Smallnick sings in conclusion. Pamela Kay resolves to take her advice, and try to focus on something other than her aching back.  This turns out to be an easy resolution to keep, as the next two A/C treatments wipe out all of our heroine\u2019s energy, so she has absolutely none left over to fret about back aches. Finishing her last A/C treatment under the auspices of Dr. J\u2019s substitute MO, the Onco nurse reveals the true reason for Dr. J\u2019s long absence: she is opening her own practice and will be switching her patients to a new infusion center operated by Dumbinagain Hospital.  At first shocked, Pamela Kay tries to take the change in stride, but is worried about all the possible cracks she could fall into during the transition. Pamela Kay is launched into her first Taxol/Herceptin treatment by yet another colleague of Dr. J, her third MO since Dr. J\u2019s \u201cvacation,\u201d and the last at her comfy, old infusion center. All goes well during the treatment on Tuesday.  On Wednesday, Pamela Kay arrives for her Neulasta shot feeling fit as a fiddle.   On Thursday, Pamela Kay is hit by the Taxol truck. On Friday, since Dr. J\u2019s new office won\u2019t be open until the following Monday, she calls the old office to beg for some Vicodin.  She is told that Vicodin prescriptions must be dispensed in person, and that no doctors are there that day to do so. Our desperate heroine tears apart her medicine cupboard and finds a two-year-old prescription for Vicodin, with 6 precious capsules left.  Parceling them out one-by-one, she barely makes it through the weekend, clinging to the hope that on Monday she can obtain the precious script. Bright and early Monday, Pamela calls Dr. J\u2019s new office, describes her side effects: hit by a truck, muscle pain, nerve pain, and abdominal pain, and requests the Vicodin. Not so fast, comes the reply, first you must come in for a blood test.  The problem, it seems, is the abdominal pain, the source of which must be determined. Willing to jump through just about any hoop, Pamela Kay arrives at the new infusion center, has her port accessed, gets the blood drawn, and hands over a urine sample. The results in: nothing that explains the mysterious abdominal pain. It is now 4 P.M., and Dr. J declares: \"NO VICODIN FOR YOU! It could mask the pain and then we\u2019ll never figure it out. You must visit the Emergency Room and get a CAT scan.\" Beginning to wonder if a mere Vicodin script could be worth this much trouble, the ever obedient Pamela Kay trudges into Dumbinagain Hospital\u2019s ER. Two nurses, one physician\u2019s assistant, and one hour later, our heroine is taken to a room and told the ER doctor will be there shortly. Two more nurses, another urine sample, and one more hour later, Dr. Gravy arrives. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d  he asks. For the fifth time, Pamela Kay tells her story: chemo + abdominal pain= CAT scan.  Dr. Gravy snaps back, \u201cCAT scan? No need for that! Let\u2019s start with an ultrasound.\u201d Pamela Kay suggests that a simple prescription for Vicodin could solve all their problems, and is happily reassured that it will be forthcoming before she leaves. One nurse, a lab assistant, a pharmacist, a hospital gown, and another hour later an orderly arrives and wheels Pamela Kay to radiology, where the ultrasound tech asks,  \u201cWhy is your bladder empty? I told \u2018em to fill you up an hour ago!\u201d One empty-bladdered ultrasound, a ride back to the room, two promises of \u201cthe doctor will be in to see you soon\u201d, three ice chips (\u201cNo water for you, just in case.\u201d), preparation for a vaginal exam, and another hour later, Dr. Gravy arrives and announces that the ultrasound has yielded results: an ovarian cyst is the culprit. Nothing to be done for this but to follow up with an OB/GYN, and cancel the vaginal exam. Pamela Kay is doubtful, and after more discussion, Dr. Gravy decides that the vaginal exam is back on. But, too late, the nurse for the exam has been dismissed and must be summoned again. The doctor disappears. The nurse reappears and waits for the doctor. The doctor appears and asks where the wet mount is. The doctor and nurse both disappear. The nurse reappears with wet mount then disappears. The doctor reappears and asks where the nurse is. The doctor disappears. The doctor and the nurse reappear discussing how to do the wet mount. After some searching for tools and supplies, the vaginal exam finally proceeds. Samples are taken, and the possibility of a yeast infection is discussed.  Pamela Kay dresses while waiting for the exam results, which she is assured, will only take half an hour.  It is now 8 o\u2019clock. Pamela Kay has not eaten since breakfast and is exhausted from medical care. Having been assured, several times, that the Vicodin script will be given before she leaves, Pamela Kay resists the temptation to just walk out; after all, by this time the abdominal pain has dulled enough to be hardly noticeable. Our heroine girds her loins; she has waited this long, surely she can wait another half an hour? An hour later, Pamela Kay leaves her room and finds the nurse, who assures her that the results should be in soon. Half an hour later the nurse comes in with two prescriptions, one an antibiotic, the other for a yeast infection, and none for Vicodin. Pamela Kay asks what the antibiotic is for. The nurse doesn\u2019t know, and leaves to ask the doctor. Half an hour later, the nurse and doctor arrive. The doctor explains the antibiotic is in case the second test is positive, and even though the yeast test was negative, he is convinced by the looks of things she must have an infection anyway. It is now after 10 pm, our hungry, disoriented heroine has been at the ER for over 6 hours, is wishing for a pair of ruby slippers and chanting under her breath, \u201cThere\u2019s no place like home, there\u2019s no place like home,\u201d and is afraid that if she asks for the Vicodin prescription it could be another two hours before she can escape from the ER.  Figuring that no narcotic is worth that, Pamela Kay flees the ER, wondering how she got herself into this mess anyway. The next day, still exhausted from her ER ordeal, Pamela Kay is on her way to another fill with Dr. D., to be followed by her Herceptin-only infusion at the new Center, when she gets a call from Dr. J\u2019s office: Why hasn\u2019t she come to her appointment this morning?  Pamela Kay replies, \u201cWhat appointment?\u201d  \u201cOops, guess we forgot to tell you\u2026\u201d After establishing that no appointment is possible until after her infusion, Pamela Kay agrees to see Dr. J at 4:30. That afternoon, sore from another fill and the hard chair at the infusion center, our wiped-out heroine arrives at Dr. J\u2019s office, seeing her for the first time in two months. Dr. J greets Pamela Kay with a question: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you get a CAT scan yesterday at the ER? Now we have to schedule one for Friday!\u201d It seems Dr. J. is unconvinced that the cyst can have caused that much abdominal pain, and that all other possible reasons for it must be ruled out before chemo can proceed. Having obtained Pamela Kay\u2019s promise to schedule the CAT scan for Friday, Dr. J relents and writes the Vicodin prescription. As Pamela Kay leaves the office, she reflects on the trouble that can result from a mere desire for pain relief, and hopes that she will suffer enough pain from her next infusion to have made the trials of obtaining the Vicodin worthwhile. Next on Chemogate:  Will the uncomfortable chairs at the new infusion center cause Pamela Kay\u2019s back pain to reoccur? Will the CAT scan discover anything worth being dosed with radiation? Has Pamela Kay learned her lesson not to mention any pain that lasts less than a week?  Is discretion the better part of being a chemo patient? Find out next time on Chemogate!",

End result: no chemo this week due to a raging infection of my TE. I think it is the curse of the second chemo (had to delay the second AC also). This time the BS says definitely no chemo for 2 weeks at least.

I heard from a friend (and have read in books) that it can be a real shock to finish chemo, where you had a whole medical team scrutinizing your every move, to post chemo where they just say goodbye and good luck.

Last fall I had ankle surgery, and I was just about to get back into my normal martial arts routine when the BC hit. Before the ankle surgery, I was in great condition, doing about 8 hours of martial arts a week plus other conditioning. Since then, I've gained 15 pounds and have lost a lot of my strength. I know it will be a long, hard haul to get back in shape, and because of the LE concerns and implant restrictions, I'm not sure I'll ever be able to do any sparing again. However, I am determined that I will do whatever I can as soon as I can to get back in shape. Lynne, I'll try some moisturizer and see how it does! Looking forward to my last TH tomorrow!  Then on Friday, I have my first appointment with the thyroid surgeon, starting the next round of treatments.  Glad you all enjoyed the song. Once something like that gets in my head, I can't get it out until I write it down.  Off to get my blood draw....Be well, everyone.",

I haven't thought to ask if it will go back to what it was after I recover from chemo.  Lynn, I so understand how you feel about being told to tone it down. I've had a couple of similar experiences myself. I find it hard to react with equanimity and brush it off. The best I can do is to try to understand that they weren't intending to make me feel bad. Even so, I am glad that some of the other patients came to talk to you. I think that shows the nurses were overreacting.  I am impressed that you were able to do so much canning after your infusion. I can't even make dinner. I wonder if some of those extra peaches could be sliced up and frozen for smoothies later? Also, time to e-mail friends and say come and partake. But really, what's a few lost peaches when your body needs rest to recover? I had an ultra sound yesterday to check for blood clots (swollen feet) which was negative; waited an hour and a half. The only good part was getting to see my favorite radiologist MD (how sad that I have been there often enough to have a favorite).  My last Taxol was uneventful. Had all the usual SEs. This week I had the first 3-week dose Herceptin (triple what I have been getting weekly). Since I'm only one week out from the last Taxol, it's hard to say what are SEs left over from the Taxol and what is from the Herceptin. Nothing too bad, just some stomach upset and fatigue. Last week my MO dropped another bomb. She told me it was time to decide about taking Tamoxifen. I was shocked, since I thought it wasn't offered to ER- women. Then she reminded me that, even though the first pathology report said ER-, they rechecked all the hormone receptors after the mastectomy and that had come up as 1% ER positive. I had completely disregarded that, as 1% seemed insignificant, but, apparently, there is some benefit for even such a low amount of ER reception.  Really, though, haven't I gone through enough? I can't imagine there would be enough benefit from the Tamoxifen to justify taking it for the next 5 years, plus all the side effects. If anyone has experience with this or knows if there is a forum where this is discussed, let me know.  AmyQ, wishing you good luck on your scan. Thinking about Heather, Kobrien, and Molinda and hoping to hear from them and others in the group we haven't heard from in a while. ",

Jen, no out-of-the-ordinary joint pain, but then I didn't have radiation.  Heather, I was given a book by the Oncology nurse coordinator about dealing with the emotional aftereffects of cancer called Dancing in Limbo: Making sense of Life after Cancer that you might want to read as you deal with getting back to \"normal\". We have a lot of baggage to deal with after all we have been through. Hope to hear from more of our April 2013 chemo friends as we come up on those unfortunate anniversaries. Had my first mammogram since the one a year ago after I found the lump. When the tech went out of the room to ask the doctor if she needed another view, I went into a minor panic thinking, did she see something suspicious and not want to tell me? I've also realized how hard it is to wait for test results after hearing twice that I was positive for cancer. The possibility of a serious problem is now all too real, and it is difficult to ignore the voice screaming in the background that I'm going to hear more bad news. So how come I don't get half off on a mammogram since they only have to do half the work?",

I was thinking about this group today after hearing about comedienne Tig Notaro, who was diagnosed with BC in both breasts in 2012. Apparently during a performance she took off her shirt and showed what her chest looks like after a double mastectomy and no reconstruction. Very brave. I'm still \"half flat\". After my recon failed due to an infection during chemo, I never could stomach more surgeries and the thought of going through the whole process again, especially as I heal so poorly. I don't wear a prosthethic, just loose clothes, scarves, and vests. Winter is easy, but I still haven't a good plan for those hot summer days. I think most people don't notice, or if they do, no one has ever said anything. So far no reappearance of either breast or thyroid cancer. A genetic test showed a variant of \"unknown significance\", which my MD says means it probably indicates something bad, but they just haven't figured it out exactly what kind of bad yet (my interpretation of her much more technical phrasing). No surprise considering the aggressive nature of my cancer. Irene, hope your surgery goes well and fixes the problem.  ",

I am scheduled for surgery on February 25, and expect Chemo for sure and radiation after depending on pathology report after surgery.  I see many here who have had neoadjuvant therapy (as I understand it, this means chemo to shrink the tumor before the surgery; please let me know if this is not right). Many others have had the chemo after. Is this decision made based on the individual's specific case (size of tumor, number of tumors, receptor status, age, or other factors)? Or is it a preference of the treatment team, based on what research they have read or what they believe works? My surgeon has encouraged me to ask questions, and I will be asking her this one and why they chose surgery first for me, but I wanted to find out a bit more about this on my own first, and see what experiences others have had.
