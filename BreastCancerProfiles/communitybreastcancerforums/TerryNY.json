All of my scans came back clear, MUGA, bone and CAT.  However, the tumor marker was elevated to 79 when normal is below 38.  The PA wouldn't approve the port removal until I get a follow up blood test in a month. She did say that chemo has a tendency to elevate tumor markers, how common is this?   I tried to push the point that since they're aware of this to schedule my port removal, she refused.   So my question is this, just how common occurence is this?   I'm more upset about the port not coming out NOW than I am in the possibility that cancer may still be lurking in there somewhere....or maybe I'm just in denial.

I was dx Feb 13th with IDC, had a lympectomy and SNB done 3/29 with mammosite, finished that on 4/12. Now comes the 'scary' visit with the oncologist dr this Wed May 2. The closer it gets, the more nervous I become. Both the surgeon and rad onc have said I'll need chemo due to my age (48), tumor size and other factors. So I've come to you wonderful ladies for advice and reassurances as chemo (and PORTS) are scaring me.... The path report indicates: IDC, high histologic and nuclear grade SBR III/III, tumor size 1.3 CM. Foci of DCIS, intermediate grade, present inside and adjacent to tumor nodule with lobular extension (DCIS quantity approx. 5%) Focal LCIS All surgical margines negative for tumor (the nearest margin is 0.2 CM from the anterior/inferior margin) Sentinel node is negative 0/7 ER-/PR+/Her2-, actual numbers ER- <5%, PR- 50%, Her2- 0 Ok, what questions should I be asking this doctor? My twin had BC 14 years ago, I have two cousins and a grandmother who've also had BC. My sister tested for BRCA 1 and 2 and we don't carry the genes. What is the Ki67 test, do I need it? I know I'm not a candidate for the oncotype test due to my tumor being ER neg. What other tests are out there that I should be asking if I've had it already or need it done? I want to make an informed decision on this chemo business but the best news would be that the onc pulls rank and says I don't need it AT ALL. What other questions in general should I ask him? I really appreciate this board, I've learned so much from everyone. I waffle on this BC business, going from absorbing everything I can get my little hands on to wanting to ignore it completely and have someone else make the decisions. <sigh> Thanks for any thoughts or input.

Teach, saying 'welcome' to a group such as our's seems so oddly weird, I mean, who wants to join a cancer group?!  But, the ladies here are wonderful and supportive and no question or concern is off limits.   Sounds like the cumulative effects of chemo are wearing you down, it's not unusual and I'm glad to hear you have meds to help with the depression and emotions.   I'll never forget what my onc said to me when I requested some xanax for nervousness, 'We don't expect you to be Super Woman\" and promptly wrote out the script.    He and I have butt heads over the past few months but I do know he's a caring physician.  Good luck to you and post again. Linda, congrats on finishing chemo!   What a huge hurdle in the course of treatments and you're DONE!  :-)   I don't have any advice about your cousin's denial.   Just be there for her if and when.   I think for many women the thought of dealing with cancer is too much, if they deny it, it'll go away.   I really hope you can convince her to get a biopsy.  DebbieM, a pool AND watermelon, no fair! LOL   We are smack in the middle of fall, my favorite time of year although I have yet to decorate.   Just don't have the energy this year.   We had to skip the wedding as my leg pain and neuropathy were in full swing.   I knew it was going to be iffy due to having to change my chemo date from Mon to Wed.   The SE were right on schedule!   However, I feel much better today with just tingling in the toes and fingers.    Yesterday we did the ACS Making Strides Against Breast Cancer.  I could only manage to walk about a block but my husband, daughter and her boyfriend finished the course, a little over 3 miles.  It was an emotional morning seeing thousands of people participating and knowing each and every one of them had somehow been affected by this disease.   I hope this finds everyone doing well and have a great week!",

Denise, I think we all suffer from chemo brain, makes for some fun entertaining at my house.   The kids are waay too eager for mom to speak.   :-)   I think the decadron may be what is causing you to feel jumpy.  I had to ask them to cut my dose in half as well and it helped immensely.  They never sped up the taxol infusion after the first time for me.   I think it took about 4 - 5 hours the first time then 3 hours after and that was just for the taxol, then add in the benadryl, zantac and decadron too.   It made for a long day.   The benadryl sent me to sleepyland so it didn't bother me too bad about the length of time.   The last thing I heard the nurse say was, \"Don't fight it.....\" Dawn, is that what cancer is teaching us, to be patient?!  LOL   Actually, with all the dr appts, waiting for test results and length of treatment times, in hours and months, I guess it does in a way, huh?  Seriously though, I have found myself cutting more slack to people, I feel everyone has a story and if they do something stupid or irritating, hey, I've been on that end of the rope plenty of times the past few months!   But enough rambling on that.... DebbieM, I'll have to look for the B6, is it in pill form?    My toes are very sore today and kept me up some last night.   Thought the worst was over on that front.   Thanks for the tip.   I'm very glad I went through this during the summer, couldn't imagine doing it through a western NY winter with all the snow and cold and being cooped up in the house, would've gotten cabin fever very quickly.   We have had drought conditions as well so we do need the snow just for the spring melt!  Hope you get some rain soon, a good TD would be great for that area.   My folks live in N Florida and they are suffering too.   Ask your dr about your port.  Mine likes to keep them in for a few months after tx ends but I was adamant about getting it removed ASAP.    He agreed as I was so against it in the first place.   I know, I'm just a troublemaker patient.   We are expecting to break heat records this weekend, it is FALL, right?   But we'll pay for it soon enough.   Youngest, and last, son's Open House is tonight at the high school.   Will be bittersweet for us, we've sent 3 kids through the district over a course of 10 years.   He's looking into colleges in the area.  I guess that's the update from here.   I wish everyone still receiving tx minor side effects but better yet, none at all.   We're still here cheering you on at the finish line.  ",

DebbieM, another at the finish line, congratulations!!   I can't help you with rads and tamofixin since I'm ER neg and have decided against hormone treatment.  (my tumor was slightly PR pos).   As for flying and wearing of the sleeve, I've heard so many conflicting opinions on this but most agree, the longer the flight, the  more precautions you should take.  I think I'm going to buy one for now and see how it goes.  My flights to Florida should be short enough in length that it won't be a concern but I'll have it just-in-case.   Dawn, too funny about the elderly patient.  I swear I felt a buzzing the last Taxol that was such an odd sensation!  I'm thinking it was some weird neuropathy thing going on but I'm glad it stopped, it felt so odd! Well, I guess me and my port will go watch some TV and relax some before bed. Hope everyone is having a good week!",

I've decided to get the genetic testing and go for counseling on Dec 5th.   I've got a second opinion on Wed, Nov 14th with a different onc about using an AI.   I hope I like this dr much better than my other onc.  I'm sorry to miss everyone's news the past few weeks but I hope everyone is adjusting to their new normal and returning to work, growing hair and celebrating their strength of the last few months...hooray for us!!",

Welcome, Ellie!  My last taxol was 9/26 and I still have lingering numbness and pain especially after a marathon shopping spree.  My hands are much better and I only notice it there if they get cold.   But, overall, the SE are much better than they were while I was still undergoing active treatment.   I would ask your doctor about the swelling though.  I sometimes feel as if my ankles swell but just a tad and after I prop my feet up, it goes away.  Dawn, it's great you're not having a difficult time with your rads! DebbieK, happy birthday to your son.   My son is 25 too, although he's the oldest. Cy, thanks for the explanations.  I hope the procedure works, we know it did, we are strong and we are WOMEN!  Hope everyone is staying safe and warm and not getting hit by the massive storms.   We had rain and more rain yesterday and woke up to a few inches of snow this morning.   Very odd weather! Shrink, check in soon!  I'm thinking of you. ",

Fun but tiring too.  Medical updates:  Met with my oncologist on Thursday and I've decided I need a new one.  He's so set in his way and I'm the sort of patient who needs to have input in my treatment....so..I have a second opinion with another onc on 11/14 for my hormonal treatment.  Wish me luck that this one clicks.  I know, seems odd to change after finishing chemo but I rarely saw him during my infusions, dealt mainly with his nurses and PA and I loved them.   Him, not so much.   :-/   Had my first mammos yesterday since my surgery.   I was not a happy camper, first time ever (in 14 years of getting mammos) that I actually had tears in my eyes from the pressure.   But, remember, I still have that open wound so I'm sure that didn't help.  And, the port in the left breast kept making the whole screen black so she had to keep repositioning me to get a better picture...sheesh!!   I was glad to be done with that.   But, got the all clear until 6 months. Had a follow up with the surgeon's NP after the mammos and she is suggesting genetic counseling...which I wanted since my family has several cases of bc and I have a 21 daughter.   Go for the genetic counseling on the 14th too...if my husband can go, might have to change that date.   Let's see, I see the rad onc tomorrow for my follow up with him.  I don't even think he knew I had an infection after the mammosite so will have a lot of catching up with him.  I do expect an all clear from him too though. My calendar looks like a medical convention!   My husband and I are leaving for vacation on Thursday, the 1st.  We both need a break!  After we return I'm right back with the doctor appts...does it ever end?! Oh, the BEST news, I had my port removed today!!! I was so excited they could squeeze me in before we left.   I'm sore tonight but nothing too bad.   Good luck to those starting rads soon.  As for hair, mine is growing pretty fast now!  Unfortunately, it's definitely a white/gray color but it's definitely there, like a fuzz all over my head.  GarnetAnn, I had volunteer hair too....they're really long now!  LOL  I love that expression, perfect description.  Hope everyone is doing well and Happy Halloween!",

There are a few women here who've had chemo before surgery to shrink their tumors and have had great success.  I'm sure they'll be here soon to relay their stories.  Good luck to you and check back in often. ",

She injected a numbing agent and I felt a little tugging, that's it.   They used the same incision site as for insertion so I have two scars, one small one where the tubing went and a bigger one, maybe an inch, where the port was placed in my chest muscle.  Took about 20-30 minutes.  It wasn't a big deal at all.  Good luck!",

The changing of the bandages wasn't a big deal to me, you only have to do it over the weekend.   The actual length of time that the balloon and catheter will be in your body is longer than 5 days.  That's just the number of days you'll get radiation treatment.  I had mine in about 10 days.  They have to insert the balloon, run tests to make sure it's placed right and that it meets the requirements.   Figure in a weekend and the actual length of time runs around 7 - 10 days if not longer. The other con is the risk for infection is high, 1 in 10 women will get an infection, me included.  So, after having said all that, I'd still opt for the mammosite if given the choice again.  Check out www.mammosite.com and they can answer a lot of your questions.  Good luck at your appointment and your decision!",

However, I have read that herceptin is of great benefit for Her2neu positive tumors.   Also, the oncotype test for ER positive tumors is another tool for women to use to help in their decisions.  Maybe ask your onc if this test would be of benefit for you?   Taking everything into consideration, most doctors will recommend chemo based on age, tumor size (anything over 1 CM in the US), and grade of aggressiveness and other factors.   I believe the Her2neu is a gene that helps control cell growth.  Someone a lot more educated about this will reply soon, I'm sure. I'm sorry you had to join us but the ladies here are well informed and caring.    Good luck in your decision. ",

The statement that BRCA genes are more of a concern in younger women needs more explanation.   It isn't the fact that that type of cancer affects only younger women, it's the fact that the younger you are at diagnosis, the odds are higher that you potentially have the BRCA 1 or 2 mutation.  We all know BC affects women at all ages, the very young and the very old.  However, if you have first degree relatives who were dx in their 20s, 30s and 40s, it's a much higher likelihood that the genetics come into play.  As you age, beyond 50 and over, then the statistical numbers are more the 1 in 8 lifetime chance...this is especially true if family members are getting dx in their 70s and 80s. I have three relatives with breast cancer, two in their 30s, one in mid 40s and me at 47.   My grandmother had it in her late 60s but it wasn't a factor to include in the testing.   Because of our youthful ages (yeah, who would've thought at age 47 I'd be called 'young'  ha ha ha....), the genetic test is being suggested for me.   As for the privacy issue, Myriad is the only company in the US that does this testing.  You can go to their web site for reassurance on this.  It is illegal in the US to be discriminated against for genetic testing results and as of this date, there is no legal documented case of any discrimination occurring.  The results are shared with your dr only, not the insurance company.  You choose who can see the results.  Also, there is a new component of the testing just initiated this year called BART.  I can't remember what the acronym stands for but it's a more 'indepth' test.   If you test negative after the comprehensive BRCA 1 or 2, they can conduct the BART using the same blood sample and detect further mutations.  They are finding out that some women who've tested negative for the BRCA 1 or 2 are positive after the BART.  But this is definitely more than my chemo brain can handle to scientifically explain all the ramifications and methods used. If your family history concerns you at all, I would definitely talk to your doctor about further testing.",

I have neg nodes and I'm PR pos. HOwever, I've been reading posts about the statistical benefits of chemo vs the dire effects of chemo...how is this determined? Is it a test? I don't qualify for the oncotype test due to being ER neg so I'm not sure what else to ask the onc. I had a mugga (I have a heart murmur), my bone scan and CAT scan are set for next week. He's recommending 4 cycles of AC then 4 four cycles of Taxol. He told me w/o further treatment my prognosis was 80% but I don't know what the benefits of chemo would be...if it raises my chances to the 85 - 90% range, I'd be a happy camper...what do I need to ask him?

I have been reading many posts about triple negatives, ER + and PR + but not ER -/ PR +....what is the difference in treatment if your tumor is ER negative but PR positive? I haven't read anything about this situation. My tumor was 1.3 CM, grade 3 (which has me worried) but no lymph node involvement (which has me happy). Any info would be greatly appreciated! Thanks.
