I am completing my chemotherapy regimen this week but I am experiencing a burning pain in my left arm pit with swelling and across the incision site is so incredibly sensitive I am unable to wear my prosthetic breast. My surgeon assigned me a physical therapist who specializes in lymphodema but I am only able to see her once every two weeks. She says I have a mild case and will be wearing a compression sleeve. I am also doing exercises and self massage with little to no relief. My surgeon mentioned a drug called Gababetin ( Neurotin, Gralise ). I have asked to now be assigned this regimen. I would love to hear that if in the last few years has anyone found any other therapeutic modalities that have helped. Thank you! ",
