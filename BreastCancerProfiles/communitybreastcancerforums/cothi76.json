I have been givin a choice of 2 chemo options, AC-TH or TCH. Its a hard decision because my Onc suggest AC because I'm \"young and my heart can handle it\".I'm worried about the chances of luekemia with the AC. Any thoughts? Thanks",

After the results of the bc on the right breast i opted to have both removed. The risk and just the mental anguish of whether it would occur on the other side was too much. Plus my sister works for a plastic surgeon, who are family friends, said it was easier to match 2 fake boobs than one real/one fake. I've also had 2 breast augmentation surgeries b4. Anyhow the hardest was the 1 1/2 week. I took pain meds the 1st 2 days than stopped. I needed help getting up after sleeping thru the night but other than that I was okay to walk around. The drains were a pain in the arse because they kinda get in your way. You should have someone help you, especially with your kids(watch that they dont pull your drain tubes). You can't pick up heavy objects and it really helps if someone can prepare your food for you. My surgeon also said to stay away from beef and shrimp, It has to do with the healing of the scars .hope it helps.good luck   ",

Reading other people's past experience has helped me.  @bkj66, I just had my port install  Tuesday. My surgery was 2 hours late due to some complications with my surgeons prior appt. But I was nervous the whole time waiting. I must say the port wasn't as bad. I opted to be put under. But compared to the healing time of my bilateral mastectomy this was very easy. It was a 15 min surgery and it took me an hour to wake up. Than I went home. The area around the port is kinda tight but that could be due to the fact of all the other surgeries and tissue spacers, which I had 50cc's added to today. I was nervous about that too but because I only added 50 cc's instead of my Reco Dr's 100cc he wanted, I dont have too much tightness at all.  I don't know about you ladies but ever since I've been researching online about BC, I've got info overload about foods,chemicals,how the chemo will effect my organs,etc. I got so stressed about what to eat or not to eat, I started eating less and not enjoying food when I should be boosting my nutrient levels before I start chemo. But I was afraid everything was gonna taint my body and trigger my receptors. I starting losing major weight after researching alkaline diets and i cut red meat(i was a heavy carnivore), my skin color started turning green.  I met with a CCN, certified clinical nutritionist, today. She will help me before during and after my chemo. If anyone else is stressed with this I can say this has helped me. I changed to organic recently and I also did a house makeover, I took everything with chemicals soaps, detergent, cleaning products, etc., and gave them away, than I went and bought new stuff without all the toxic ingredients. I have been a hairdresser for over 15 years and now I'm going to research organic and non-toxic lines of haircolor and products.  ~if you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything  ",

My oncologist said the road she suggest is the AC road but was okay if I decided to take the TCH. I didn't know I had a choice to make. I just thought surgery and then chemo. Well if I take AC it is harsher but puts strains on the heart and has a very small % of causing lukemia!? Ugh..its like one kick after the other. TCH route for me is not as harsh but than its not as agressive in fighting the cancer. After researching and speaking to other doctor friends and fellow BC friends, I've decided on AC-TH.  Because they're poisoning our bodies does anyone have any suggestions on how to prepare organs to stay strong during chemo? besides the old faithful H2O. ",

I have not worked, initially before surgery I decided to work through it all but since surgery I have not been back. I own a hairsalon and was the main hairdresser there. I cannot lift my arms the same, especially the right where lymph nodes were cut. I also have the fear of the chemicals because 60% of my work was with haircoloring. I'm possibly going to sell my business. I miss my passion(work). It has brought me tremendous stress but I gotta do what I gotta do. I'm trying to figuire out how to stay in the industry still without being so exposed to chemicals. I'm fortunate to have people around me helping my parents, friends, even the owners of the building of my salon have been very understanding. But I have to think of the long run and my health comes first. I understand your frustration. I'm glad you are able to work from home. Keeping yourself busy is good but when you need to rest, rest.
