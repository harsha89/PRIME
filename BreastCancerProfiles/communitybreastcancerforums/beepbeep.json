I'm so scared only because it makes me feel like my original lump was misdiagnosed and I might have missed my chance to treat any cancer. I'm under 30 with a family history and I just know exactly how you feel. 21 is on the very young side so that does put you in a much lower risk category. I know it happens at all ages but hopefully that comforts you. I will pray for you and hopefully you all will do the same for me. You really never know with these things and I'm fearing the worst since my breast lump is huge and lymph node issues are never a good sign with a pre-existing breast lump. I can't think of anything else it could be. I never get sick ever so I'm very nervous.",

I can't believe how many women on this site along got cancer between 28 and 35. Am I missing something? What's the harm in self exam and clinical exam? I went many years without checking and it wasn't smart of me. I might have been able to track my current lump better if I had known more about it. There's no such thing as being \"too careful\" with breast cancer. The only thing I take issue with is giving a mammogram to a young woman without good reason. My sister has had 6 mammograms and the only indication for it was a benign cyst that was diagnosed through ultrasound. 6 mammograms in someone under 35!!! I don't care for that but then again, it's all we really have for screening.",

It takes less than 5 minutes and is probably one of the more important things to check for at an annual doctor appointment. I think the breast exam is more important than the pelvic exam to be perfectly honest. Breast cancer is more common and there's really no such thing as \"average risk\" since the overwhelming majority of cancer patients have no family history. Even young women that get breast cancer tend to have no family history. I agree that there should be a better screening method for youngsters. Ultrasounds serve a good purpose but they can be utterly useless at times. It was for my lump. MRI's are extremely invasive IMO. Maybe not medically but emotionally. I'd say laying down in a cylinder for 30 minutes could be very traumatic especially for a high risk woman who is already worried enough. I'm not even so sure about core biopsies anymore. Seems like anything with even a small risk of error is the wrong method to use. Bottom line, I hate breast cancer. I hate everything about this unforgiving disease. I hate that some women have to be more worried than other. I hate that women who thought they had no reason to worry get blindsided by this disease, often at young ages. My friend brought up a freaky story the other day. She said that there are people ready to test out cures but the health committee (or whatever it is) aren't giving them the green light. Then my friend said that the medical community might not want to find a cure because then they'd lose out on the money they gained from all these sick people. That's a scary thought. I hope that would never be true but is still freaky. They make a lot of money on sick people and eradicating a common disease would lose money from their perspective. Makes me feel a little queasy.",
