The swelling and bruising were very unexpected, as was the discomfort from laying on that d- - - table for so long, i am feeling much better, physically. Today is sunday, no word yet on results. my husband is overly causual regardless of the results. it is all i can do to appear calm. i just want to go to bed and sleep. i have perused the topics and responses and they are all helpful. guess i just wanted to update, since husband seems disinterested :( or :) depends on my perspective i guess. God bless you all for your concern and sharing.",

I received a report in the mail today that said referring to the contrast mri \"At that time, a 1 cm spiculated mass was noted in the lower inner quadrant of the right breast and a 1 cm irregular mass was noted centrally in the left breast\". Near the end of the letter the following \"Assessment: category 4 - suspicious abnormality, biopsy should be considered\" I am trying to put my anxiety aside. My mom was first dx with bc at 45 (and another breast dx 5 years later, died at 60 of pancreatic cancer), my younger sister at 42, I am 47. Any input as to what the report is saying, more specifically, as written above. Any insight is appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
