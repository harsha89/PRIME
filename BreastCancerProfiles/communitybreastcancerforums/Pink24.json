I had a total duct excision almost two weeks ago due to blood nipple discharge. Hoping all will now stop and results won't show anything sinister. I was surprised as to how much was taken.. was told all ducts and some tissues would be taken but still more then I imagined. Does this fill back in? If so how long will it take? Also has anyone had any pain? Mine keeps swelling up but no infection. Also keep feeling a burning sensation and scary sharp shooting pains. My main concern is the shooting pain that keeps happening.. it's new and painkillers don't make a difference :( Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Pink24 wrote: Hi just wondered if anyone else has had nerve pain in their breast post surgery? Had surgery 10 months ago and recovery was fine... no pain etc. However, for the last four months I've had a lot of pain. The area which was operated on is tender to touch, struggling to sleep as wake if I brush it or sleep on it. Went to the surgeon and they did an ultrasound which was clear. They said it sounded like nerve pain. To treat it I just need to apply voltarol etc to the area and see how I get on and that they couldn't tell me how long the pain would carry on for. It's so painful. It's already been over 2 months.. how much long should I expect it? Any tips or information would be appreciated Log in to post a reply",

I didn\u2019t feel myself whilst taking them so I stopped. However know it has worked wonders for many who have tried it. I just felt too foggy and unbalanced and didn\u2019t like that feeling. Since then I have been going down the natural route. I\u2019ve been drinking turmeric milk aka golden latte (1/2 a teaspoon of turmeric in hot/warm skimmed milk-any milk is ok, sugar can be added but I don\u2019t mind the taste anymore) on an empty stomach every morning and feel it so made a huge even difference. Also tried a gel on days I need to be nerve painless called flexiseq it\u2019s non medical aka can be bought at a pharmacy not prescribed and also does wonders. I prefer all things natural. I have been back a few times and unfortunately the surgeon said they\u2019d cant predict how long nerve pain can last",
