I have found him very responsive and willing to discuss my case. My cancer was a very common type, and I have been happy with my doctors, so I did not feel the need to go to MD Anderson. I would not have hesitated to do that however if I had a more advanced case, or an unusual diagnosis. I also have a derm and derm surgeon that I like if you need that reference.",

Take care, and try to live your life as normally as possible while you go through this.  I've found that as long as I\"m busy my mind doesn't have time to worry about all of the what ifs.  Jen",

I have three kiddos too, and of course my hubby is overseas on business while this is all happening.  I've only told a couple of people, so I'm happy to have found this site.",
