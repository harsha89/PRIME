In my case, we knew there was something in the duct because I was having bloody and/or clear discharge from one duct, and imaging showed a dilated duct with \"debris\" and who knew what else. According to my surgeon it doesn't really matter if the discharge is bloody or clear, both are cause for further investigation (milky is a usually a whole different story). Surgeon and Radiologist both thought I either had DCIS or a benign papilloma. Thankfully, after removing pretty much all of the ducts on leaky lefty all that was found was a benign papilloma. Hoping for good results for you as well!",

      "Content": "Sep 19, 2013 07:55AM - edited Sep 19, 2013 09:40AM by Moderators So sorry you are going through all of this. It sounds similar to what I am going through, I am just a few weeks ahea of you. I am 37, too, 4 kids, but I do have a family hx of breast cancer. I started in early August with lots of spontaneous bloody discharge from one duct. It eventually turned mostly clear, but has continued to bleed and be obnoxious. I had a mammogram which showed some slight growth to a known fibroadenoma on the other side. Had an ultra sound which also showed the fribroadenoma and dilated ducts on the side I was leaking. - Did your ulta sound show any dilated ducts? Next I had a galactogram which is a study where the radiologist injected dye through a small tube into the dilated duct and took more mammogram pictures. It showed something in the duct but it apparently didn't really have the appearance of a papilloma, so up next was a contrasted breast MRI. MRI showed activity of some kind in the duct and 3 other fibroadenoma we didn't know about. The moral of my story is that at the end of all of that we pretty much knew exactly what we did at the beginning. There was a dilated duct with something in it, which the breast surgeon told me from the very first appointment with him that he would be taking out. As I understand it they almost always resect the ducts in situations like these to confirm that the cause is a papilloma and also because sometime other things can be lurking around, even if it is a papilloma. I had that surgery yesterday and am recovering an waiting for pathology hopefully Friday. I had lumbar back surgery in May, so I can relate to your frustration with further poking and prodding. I'm really sorry your dealing with all of this on top of a new diagnosis. That must feel pretty overwhelming. I'm also sorry the insurance is giving you a run around. That shouldn't e something you have to deal with at a time like this. My guess is if you are still having spontaneous nipple discharge from one duct, and or dilated duct(s) on any of your imaging the surgeon may do a resection even if the insurance won't pay or an MRI. Thinking about you!",

Glad you called and spoke to the director of the facility. My husband is a Radiologist. He (and his partners) would be horrified to find out their front end staff were treating patients that way!! I'm hope they take your complaint seriously. Sounds like that tech needs a good slap upside the head. Hope your appointment with the surgeon goes better. My surgeon always does a quick ultrasound himself to get a look at what is going on, so maybe you will get another chance at that. Are you able to express anything manually from the leaky side? I was always able to get some to express. I don't think they will/can do a galactogram if they can't get anything to express because they don't know which duct to go into.",

I did end up being discharged the same day, even though the nurse had told me I would be in overnight. As my 3 year old was climbing all over me last night I was wondering why I had worried about coming home! Although being in my own bed was nice, I didn't get much sleep. Because I had procedures done on both sides I basically had to lay on my back, which is painful for me after my back surgery. Surgeon took a golf ball sized lump from Leaky Righty. I was barely a B to begin with and I'm wondering what could possible be left! Lumpy had a grape sized fibroadenoma removed. Anyone with experience, how long do you think it will take it all to fill in? Will it fill in? Do you think reconstruction is in my future? From what I have seen under my dressings my nipple on Leaky is all droopy. BS said he had to invert my nipple and scrape out everything in my nipple because the dilated duct went right to the surface! THAT is an image I didn't need in my head!

I guess I'm not really looking for advice or anything. Just support while I wait and get to the bottom of this. I am 37 with 4 kids ages 13-3. Just barely recovering from back surgery at the end of May for a herniated lumbar disc. 3 weeks ago I started having spontaneous bloody discharge from what I am now calling \"Leaky Righty\". In 3 weeks have had Mammo, US, MRI w/ contrast, and galactogram. At the end of all that I am basically where I was 3 weeks ago. There is something in the duct. Imaging doesn't really distinguish it one way or the other - papilloma or cancer. I know it is much more likely to be a papilloma, I just wish it had shown up clearly as one during the galactogram. I am scheduled for a duct resection on Sept 18th. Surgeon wanted to wait a while for the inflammation and risk of infection to settle down after all the poking around during the galactogram. (THAT was a fun procedure) Incidental in all the imaging was 3 fibroadenoma s. 1 in \"Leaky Righty\" and 2 in \"Lumpy Lefty\". Because one of the FA in \"Lumpy\" has grown over the past 3 years and is quite painful I am going to have an excisional biopsy at the same time as the duct excision. As a side note, my husband is a radiologist. One of his partners has been doing all my procedures and imaging, and it has been a little awkward getting so closely acquainted with a good friend. :-/ On the plus side, after reading so many posts I know how lucky I am to basically get immediate results from my studies. Thanks for listening. I haven't told too many people. One of my friends actually said she knows exactly what I am going through because she is having a varicose vein ablation in a few weeks. Um. I think that is a little different. Log in to post a reply",

I'm sorry you have had such a long wait and I hope you get some answers soon. It sounds like you have a great attitude. I have had a tough time knowing what/how much to tell my kids at this point. Because I just had back surgery a few months ago, they are basically annoyed that I am having surgery again. I have told my 2 older ones that there is something growing in my breast that needs to be removed. They were grossed out and then immediately asked if it was cancer. Not a fun conversation to have. I reassured them that the likelihood was very high that it is nothing serious. I know they are still worrying though. We have a good 12 year old friend who has been battling cancer for 3 years, so the word means something quite scary to them. One question for you all: Did anyone have an overnight stay after an excisional biopsy and/or duct resection? During my consultation with him my BS told me that it would be an outpatient procedure. But when his nurse called to make the arrangements she told me that I am listed as an inpatient procedure. \"I don't think you are going to be going anywhere.\" I'm not too happy about it and wondering what's up. I seriously can not believe I have to have surgery again. Recovery from the back surgery was tedious, and the thought of doing this again exhausts me. Wire loc and injection of the blue dye into the duct starts at 7 am and 2 hour surgery begins at 9:30.",

Going to add to the stupid things people say because it is making me smile and I need that today. A few years ago we lost a baby girl that was born prematurely. At church several weeks later an acquaintance was offering her condolences and told me that she knew just how I felt going through something hard because her baby had been up all night for several nights crying. That particular comment is stupid on so many levels I didn't even realize she was being serious at first. The take away is that some people just don't know how to be supportive and empathetic, and heaven help me from ever being that person. My guess is that the one thing all of us who has cause to visit this board, for a long or short stay, will come away with a lot more empathy than we started with.",

Mine has been causing me pain for several years - enough that I am basically always aware of it on some level. The excision will take place at the same time as a resection on the other breast to remove some concerning ducts. I don't think that I would have scheduled the surgery to have the fibroadenoma removed if that is all that was going on. But, since I am already going to be under anesthesia, I figured let's get rid of the painful lump at the same time. I have 3 other fibroadenomas and I am not doing anything about them, because they don't bother me at all. Good luck with your decision.",
