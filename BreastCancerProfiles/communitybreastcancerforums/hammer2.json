I will find out Oct 13 if I am actually receiving the Avastin or just a placebo. The reaserch nurse came to me at my last chemo and said that 6 of 200 patients had developed congestive heart failure. They didn't know of it is the Avastin or the A/C. and they are investigating. Now they are not taking any new patients but the women that are already in it have to make a decision as to whether to continue in the trial or to stop. I have already received 8 doses and will have to decide if I am receiving the drug and not the placebo; should I continue with 10 more doses or quit??????? Anyone in the same boat?? I want to be fight with everything I can but don't want to have heart failure. P;ease help with any insight. Thanks for all your help",

I just happened to be getting my chemo the day the report came out. She said I should think about it and decide by my next taxol on Monday. I want to continue because I fell like if they give Avastin to women with mets it should help us without mets to avoid them. Its just with this report I got kinda scared. I may not be getting the Avastin,won't know until Oct/ 13; maybe just getting the placebobut I have to make a decision by Monday. I know I'm talking in circles but I just can't decide.",

I had felt a lump long before I went to the doctor but since there was never a history of breast cancer in my family I thought it couln't be. Then one day we were in a hotel room and they have the big extra size mirror and I saw that the skin was dimpled and I thought its cancer. Even then I made an appt. with obgyn and didn't say what I  found. So I didn't get an app't for two months. This was all very dumb but I just couldn't believe it was cancer. In the beginning I really beat myself up about waiting so long. I just have to believe that God has a purpose for all things and he will give me the courage to face whatever comes my way. My mom had dementia and all through her disease God guided us and everything may not have come out the way we thought was best;it definitely did. sorry for rambling but this is the first time I have even admitted to myself that I should have gone to the doctor sooner but I have to forgive myself. Hang in there but know that we are all praying for you.",

I think if you have confidence in them it makes the decisions easier. I have found there is no right way to fight b/c;just a lot of different approaches.It seemed to fall into place as soon as I decided on the doctors and everything started to fall into place. Just know no one has all the answers;we can only do what we think is right. Good Luck!!!",

Last week at my regular checkup I mentioned have some lightheadedness and she immediately ordered a ct of the brain. All was ok. It turned out I was just not drinking enough.Make sure you are not dehydrated as this can cause this problem.  I think we will always feel everything is related to the cancer but then again I think thats ok. I will just always let her know when something is not right and let her take it from there. The onc said we will have symptoms before it will show on the scans.",
