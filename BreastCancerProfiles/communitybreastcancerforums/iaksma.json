      "Content": "iaksma wrote: How do you handle the WAITING?  I had a stereotactic biopsy yesterday and should have the results by the end of the week.  I had a routine mammo about a month ago, then got called back for magnified images of the left breast.  The radiologist showed me a small group of 4 microcalcifications behind the nipple.  They looked irregular in shape to me (I think that's not a good sign?) The biopsy went just fine, but since the radiologist told me she would guess I have a less than 50% chance of having cancer, I am on this roller coaster ride with my emotions.  One minute I think to myself, it's not a problem, it's a challenge I will deal with.  Next I think of my husband, kids, and my parents and how they would cope without me.  I have not yet told my children (15 and 11 years) because I don't want to worry them unless I know for sure. It's hard to keep it from them though.  My husband is a great support and I've told only a few close friends.  Anyhow, if you have coping tips, please let me know because I'm in desparate need.  Thanks in advance for your help!  I wish I weren't here, but I'm glad this is available! :) Log in to post a reply",
