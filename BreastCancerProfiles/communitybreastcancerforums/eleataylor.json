I would love nothing more than to have boobs again but it's not worth it. I have had so many surgeries I cannot even remember how many. Now I am seeing a new surgeon and she wants to start over with tissue expanders. My husband does not want me to go through anymore but I would rather boobless than as I am now. I am going to approach him tomorrow with my thoughts.",
