I am getting a double masectomy on october 25th after testing positive for the braca 2 gene in may...my hysterectomy is this Thursday. I feel I am in good hands at university of penn,but am still reeling from my diagnosis...and 5 days ago found a lump between my right breast and my underarm. Really freaking out now....don't know what questions to ask...am being seen by my doctor oct 3rd to see if I have enough thigh fat for reconstruction...I am a c cup,have been for 45 years,(now 59) and am hoping they can get enough fat from me to get me a b cup...otherwise I am going with the implant and stretchers...just very scared (actually,terrified) of my future and where this will land me...good luck to you,hope you are healing well...please tell me how you are doing....",
