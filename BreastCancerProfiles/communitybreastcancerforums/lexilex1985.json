Then the pain started and I got concerned, it felt like and has continued to feel like 3 sensations; a searing stabbing pain in my breast, pain when I lift my arm up or grab something, and an extreme pressure in my breast making it feel like my nipple is about to pop off. I then did a self breast exam and noticed 3 lumps in my right breast and scheduled an appointment with my gyno right away. She also felt the lumps and drew my attention to a milky/foggy discharge coming out of both nipples she wanted me to get a mammogram. The mammogram was booked for a while at my local office so called Boston hospitals scheduled a mammogram and ultrasound with Beth Israel and they came back \"normal\" just was told I have dense breasts. I have been struggling with this for 3 months going to dr apts being told that this may just be a pain I have to deal with for the rest of my life. I feel like I am fighting this battle alone. I had to beg my dr to give me a chest plate MRI which I still have not received because my insurance will not pay for it became the other tests showed inconclusive results. I have begged for genetic testing and still don't know if I qualify cause my mom doesn't get mammograms and apparently isn't getting one any time soon. I do know for sure that my maternal grandmother had ovarian and breast cancer which may be my only way I can get the BRCA testing. I have an appointment tomorrow for a high contrast MRI and ultrasound and just hoping I can find answers. Still no answers but the Dr is talking about removal of breasts and hasn't ruled out cancer still after 3 month but also is not helping me get other testing. This is literally interrupting my life so much and creating an intense amount of anxiety and stress. I am a yoga instructor and cant teach as often as I have been which means I am losing money and need money for the tests I have to pay for that insurance is denying. Does anyone have advice? I have no clue what to do and almost want to give up. I was ready to give up until I found this forum and the women on here gave me hope. Log in to post a reply",
