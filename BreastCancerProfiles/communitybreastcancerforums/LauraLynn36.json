    "Content": "LauraLynn36 wrote: Hello everyone. My name is Laura and I am brand new here...I was diagnosed 3 years ago after finding a lump in my left breast. I was only 34 with no family history. Since my mastectomy, I have also had a complete hysterectomy. I have always been fine with the prostetic I wear, but lately have found it very difficult to buy clothes. I have an appointment with a reconstructive surgeon next Friday. I know there are a lot of different types of re construction and was hoping I could get a little insight as to what people here have had done.... Much appreciated! Laura Log in to post a reply",
