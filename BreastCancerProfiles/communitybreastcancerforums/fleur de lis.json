Like anyone who has dealt with breast issues ( previous Phyllodes tumor in the right breast in 2009, some atypia and ALH on surgical path report at the time) I researched some of the findings on the net, via the 2013 MRI BIRADS edition. Report: Findings There is asymmetrical background parenchyma like enhancement in the left breast relative to the right. There is moderate parenchyma enhancement and minimal background enhancement on the right. In the upper outer aspect of the left breast there is a 9mm area of heterogeneously enhancing non- mass like enhancement with rapid wash-in and plateau kinetics. This represents an interval change as compared to previous MRI's The irregular shape, heterogeneous enhancement aspects along with the rapid and plateau kinetics make the odds of this lesion being malignant. I have read somewhere between 55-67% likely hood of a cancerous finding. I know that false positive findings are quite common on MRI's....sadly, I have small, dense breasts....so I know that complicates findings all the more Any advice? Or tales from the front? If you had finding along similar lines, what was your DX. Per biopsy, or surgerical findings? Thank you in advance!ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜Š High Risk due to family history, BRCA1+2 neg., P53 and PTEN neg., Phyllodes Tumor 2009, ALH 2010, Hemioanginonoma 2016, Second Phyllodes Tumor with ILC 2016.
