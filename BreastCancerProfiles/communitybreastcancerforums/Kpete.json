He ws going to use the test results to help determine which drug regime to give me. my test result came back a 2!  The onc said with such a low score, the side effects outweighed the benefits, so no chemo for me.  I was thrilled!  I started rads 9/12 for 33 treatments.  As long as you're stage I or IIA or B, I think you're eliglble for the test.  I haven't gotten any bills yet, but I believe my insurance will pay for it.  I'm sure i'ts a heck of a lot cheaper than the chemo i would have gone thru. Good luck!  Prayers to you!  Kim ",

My boosts have been going well, and I haven't had any further SE's - my itching has pretty much stopped, and of course the redness is still there, but that's about it.  Our community has their annual Pink Pajama Party today for awareness month.  Should be fun - there's a silent auction, a speaker, and a style show.  Can't wait! Have a good weekend!  Kim",

Went to my onc today, and I will be on Tamoxifen after rads for ~ 2 years, which should place me for sure post meno, then he'll probably switch me.  I agree with you PattyK - I can do it! Congrats to everyone who's recently finished their rads - I can now see the light at the end of the tunnel too. Prayers, Kim ",

I will be hopping on the Tamoxifen thread soon.  I already have the RX to fill it, and the onc told me to start after rads, so I guess I'll start sometime next week.  I read somewhere that they started on the 1st of the month, so it was easier to remember, so I may try that.  Although my dx, surg, etc. were all on other days than the 1st, and those dates are engrained into my head!!  Hope everyone is enjoying the cooler temps.  Here in KS, the air is turning cooler, and the leaves are turning some great colors.  Hugs & prayers, Kim",
