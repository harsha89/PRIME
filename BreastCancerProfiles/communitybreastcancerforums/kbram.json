As for radiation, it is every day for weeks!  Hence me saying previously to find a treatment center convenient to where you live! Let me know how you are! Kathy",

Let me know if I can answer any questions.  I would be glad to help! Kathy  ",

You are correct that there is not much information on this subject.  I hope we can all get thru this together.  Good luck! Kathy",
