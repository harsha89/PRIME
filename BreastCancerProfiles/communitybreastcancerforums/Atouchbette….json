Mine typically does not pay for compounded prescriptions. I got a quote from my compounding pharmacy and it was high! Over $100 for just an ounce! I have had neuropathic pain on the chest wall and under my arm since my UMX 3 years ago. In the beginning, I could not even wear any clothes on the upper half of my body. It finally calmed down enough that I could wear a coobie bra and soft material shirts. Still was constantly aware of it. Then I just had a redo of my reconstruction (TE's again and Mentor CPG a.k.a. gummy bear) and that seemed to kick it up again, especially since my areola tattoo last Monday and the oral gabapentin is just not knocking it down. Thanks, Connie",

I highly recommend the Facebook group for PMPS - I recently joined and everyone has really been helpful - plus there is a lot of information posted there. Connie",
