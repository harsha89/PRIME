I went all the colours of the rainbow but it was uncomfortable but didn't hurt. I have my op on 11th and go in for pre op assessment tomorrow- in Churchill Hosp Oxford UK. The bruising will go down- be it slowly. Would love to keep in touch with anyone feeling low- as I am very positive about the process and have already bought a wig!",
