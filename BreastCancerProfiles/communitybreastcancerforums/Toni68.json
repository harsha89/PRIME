I just go into the bathroom for ten mins and set it on the area that's been bothering me, not the entire area that's been radiated. I put one on before I go to work, when I get home from work and then before bed. Just space them out. My phone nstructions said to do this 3-4 times a day for 5 mins. You may get different instructions though. All the best Barb. Toni",

I know some people develop a dry cough and I was thinking maybe it was just things getting really dry in my system or I was on the verge of a cold. I didn't get a cold and all is fine now except for the itching skin! The cream doesn't help the itching but the salt water saline they have you prepare and use several times a day really helps. One last all over breast treatment today and then onto my booster next week. Good luck with your radiation Barb. I hope all goes well. Toni",
