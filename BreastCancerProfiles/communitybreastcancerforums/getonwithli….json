Fortunately I found this website and started reading the posts.   I realized that many people can live a long time with this horrible disease. I have been on Xeloda and Zometa since October 2012.  CA27.29 counts have been dropping since I started.   CT scan in December showed significant improvement, I will have a new scans the end of this month.    I am on STD, it is very doubtful that I will return to work I would much rather spend my time beating this disease and spending time with my family.    I get nervous everytime I go in for my blood test but so far so good. I have been married to a wonderful man for 34 years and we have a son, daughter in law and daughter.   I have a large extended family and they are all very supportive. I visit this site daily and it is wonderful for me.    It really is true that the only people that truly understand how I feel are the people that are going through the same thing. Thank you all for your posts, they have truly kept me going through all of this.",
