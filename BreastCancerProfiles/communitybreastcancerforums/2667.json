      "Content": "2667 wrote: My wife was recently diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma.  At first the surgeon thought she would just need a lumpectomy, however, after the steriotactic biopsy, he thinks a mastectomy is more appropriate.  The surgeon thinks mastectomy is best because the breast contains areas of atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) in addition to the actual tumor.  The information I have says that ALH is not necessarily pre-cancerous.  Does anyone have better knowledge of ALH?  She is scheduled for surgery next week, so she has to decide between having a lumpectomy or mastectomy soon.  Any thoughts/personal experiences would be appreciated. 2667 Log in to post a reply",
