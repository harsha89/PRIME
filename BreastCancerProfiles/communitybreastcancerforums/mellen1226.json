I did get a surprise that I was not expecting and have found that I am her2+ and will start herceptin on Friday. Anybody here do herceptin? Can you tell me what the side affects are? My oncologist seems happy to have something else to treat me with. I also need to decide what I am going to do as far as hormone therapy. I meet with the radiation oncologist next week to get that moving. I am recovering and am ready to move on to the next step and get this process over with. Some days it seems never ending.",

I know that it varies from person to person but am just looking to see others' journey/advice. I am having a modified radical on the left and a simple with SNB on the right. I am now concerned that both arms are going to be a mess for awhile. My concern is that I have a 3 1/2 year old and wonder how long it is going to be before I can use my arms. I will have alot of help for 3 weeks but am not one to sit around and it is making me very nervous. Any advice? I am not having reconstruction. I don't know where I am with all of that yet and I do need radiation on the left side. Log in to post a reply",
