I have used it on both breasts with no local recurrence! however I also use frankincense oil, the stuff is smelly and strong woody order, but the oil heals scars from surgery too. Taking boswellia for arthritis pain related to taking armidex has helped me. I am cutting back because i have a rash on the chest wall right now. I would not take more than 1x per day but it may lso help fight your cancer-what two way winner. there are studies with Dr. Lin U of O. blessings Marcia ",

I did not have lymphodema after surgery that I know of; but it's here. So I am not sure I can continue since it was painful and very swollen. I checked with the doctor and he said it will not get any better and usually radiation will make it somewhat worse. I am pretty sure although I was stage 3, early, and I would like to have the benefit of radition that I will have to pass on it. I type for a living and I understand that the swelling can reach your hand; and simply leave you without an extra hand. I am trying to be positive but I cannot go forward. Is there anyone out there, who might have experienced lymphodema and gotten better after radiation; and if so how long did it take you?  Very discouraged, Marcia ",

I had a brother donate blood and what a life saver it was for me. As soon as I got the blood in the hospital I could breathe again. however it is not something I wish to repeat. I have been on Taxotere/ Carboplatin and it has been very rough on my body. I have two treatments left. I've lost all my hair on my head arms etc. Julie I hope your treatment is going better than mine. I Never expected it to be like this. Now the hair feels way too hot we had near 75  degrees in Mid IL today! Always something but I am so glad to see one dafodil up knowing that in late spring my chemo is over. I still have the radiation treatments in May. Doesn't the treatment seem almost endless? I would never go thru it again knowing what I have experienced. Grateful that I am if it heals me it feels difficult. I hope you other ladies who began in Jan are having a better time and just hang in there it's almost over!  take care all, Marcia ",

I had a brain turmor went undiagnosed till it took out my right hand .I had asked for a scan many times. No scan. I had MRI of the neck showed nothing. I had brain surgery and then rads in 2012. I m doing well. Eating a strict diet, vegan juicing and also follow up with Onco every 3 months. Be careful of mets in your brain. I would as k them to scan there. No other known recurrence anywhere .I believe the diet helps. I hope you all find healing stay well as you can. Explore reiki for wellness, mine helped a great deal. care, Marcia",

I used cold packs on my head feet and hands to prevent hair loss, and to prevent neuropathy. The hair loss did not work but I used some homemade herbal cold packs. I am on taxotere/carboplantin. So far it' s exhausting me. I dont' like the hair loss as I had  beautiful long hair that was great. But it's the price you pay to have your healing complete. I am living in hats, scarves and I have a whig. The whig is uncomfortable unfortunately. Without the hats your head is darn cold in this sub -0 weather in Central Il. I really want spring to come. As far as I know Taxotere is the same thing as taxol- and neither are going to cause permanent hair loss.  Good luck to all friends here going thru Jan chemo!  Marcia ",

I had to rap my arm in cold packs, ice packs on Christmas and then take antibiotics. getting the sleeves was near impossible. a few days of old packs and antibiotics with religious adherence to the le therapies including arm massage, and compression sleeve always , nd a week later the arm is normal gain, thank God. Im permanently handicapped i n teh right hand due t o a metastasis t o my brain so functioning around the house was horrible, challenging. I had t o hire help. Because I have lost use of the right hand. sorry for typos its the right hand issue. Take heed and use the sleeve every day and don't let it get out fo control. Its a n issue that does not go way. I wish I ahd not had the surgery but then maybe I would not be here. Take care all, Marcia ",
