I believe you are very lucky to have less than one centimeter lump, if you have to have this dam thing at all. I am sorry you have to go through this merri-go-round of emotion trying to find out what the best treatment is. You are taking the right steps for treatment and remember that contained is a very good thing. Please try and relax and not let the unknown consume you life.
