I also have had sharp pains in the middle of my chest, though doctors don't know why (heart doctors, lung doctors). Lastly, I have noticed a change in the skin on my nipples, particularly the right one, but also the left. I hope I'm not being paranoid, I just don't know why these weird things are happening to me. If you have any info, please let me know. Thank you so much.",
