      "Content": "dsueb wrote: I received some information about my biopsy today. I have intermediate grade invasive ductal carcinoma and metastatic ductal carcinoma in my lymph nodes. I have not seen anything in writing yet. Neither person I spoke with would give me any rating numbers, the radiologist said I needed to not worry about numbers and just wait until I see the specialist, which concerns me because he has been very upfront and honest with me both times I have seen him and I specifically asked him for these. Maybe I shouldn't think this way but I find that concerning. I have a 1.0 cm x 0.8 cm mass, satellite mass (unsure of size) and a 5 cm x 2.6 cm x 4.6 cm in my axillary lymph node. Any helpful insight would be appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
