How's that for strange? I hope you start to feel better!  I'd recommend alcohol, but I am not sure you drink and I am not so sure we should mix emotions and alcohol right now anyway!",

Would they help me with everything around the house - absolutely!  I guess the good part of that is because I have the responsibility of taking care of the house, a lot of time, my mind is not on my worse fear.  Go figure.  I am glad I have these boards to, because I like to vent, but won't do it in front of anybody because if I did, it would be terrible! I will tell you one thing, I've probably accomplished a lot more heavy cleaning, since the mammogram!  That way if I have my worse case scenario, people coming in and out of the house will know that it's clean!",

I had bloody nipple discharge from my right nipple my Dr found a lump in each breast and scheduled a mammogram and an ultrasound. I went in Friday for both and was told I have a lot of ductal papillomas and will need to see a BS for a ductal excision. My Dr called today with the results of my nipple discharge culture and said it grew a lot of bacteria, so I have a breast infection on top of everything. My breasts are noticeably larger about a size larger and the pain is as you described. I have noticed it getting worse and they ache. I hope your doctor finds out what is going on soon, pain isn't fun and neither is the unknown. I'll keep you in my prayers.",

Whatever the case, I know, I have breast cancer.  Because of the node involvement, I chose to undergo a bilateral mastectomy.  My breasts are small and my mass is big, so if they were taking one-side, they might as well take both.  I will have four months of chemo, followed by six weeks of radiation.
