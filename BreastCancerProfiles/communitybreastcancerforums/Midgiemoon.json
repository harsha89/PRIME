My IdC is smaller, and I am older, but it isan uncertain time. I am planning to go for a second opinion this week, at Mercy Hospital in Baltimore. I eould like to be treated at my local center since it is 5 minutes from home, but I feel like I need that second opinion. My local surgeon recommended lumpectomy and radiation. My on a good note my KI67 proteins were only 3-5%. Which is the lowest she had seen.  I am originally from Mass., and Dana Farber is a wonderful place. If I were still thee, that's where I would go, too. Keep us posted, wishing you strength for the journey!  midge",

My center offered only the blue ink, or the option of wearing stickers for the duration. Well, after having stickers on for a few weeks that bothered my skin, I went ahead with the tattoos yesterday. I can not see them, they are so small. I have three, one between the breasts and one on each side. After I had them done, Irealized I got myself worked up over something that turned out to be not such a big deal. I am 5 treatments in out if 33, and at this point, I want my techs to have an easy time with me. So far so good. If you can talk to your nurse, maybe she can have someone like me get in touch with you. Wishing you well, ~Miidgie ",
