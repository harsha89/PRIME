Right next to it, over my surgery/incision site I am also red and splotchy but not itchy, Like you palmetto, I think it's a reaction or sensitivity (not an allergy) to either alcohol prep or something else they used. It doesn't feel warm or seem infected. I will see the GS Tuesday for follow up but since it's not itchy or blistering I haven't thought of it too much.  Still sloshing though and getting use to the \"hollow\" sound when I touch that breast. Glug.  ;-) How are you doing?",

No lymph nodes.I had a fibroethelial lesion which could be benign (like my previous lumps) or could be something called a phyllodes tumor. I am thinking positive until I hear otherwise later this week! My tumor was deep - near chest wall in upper inner right breast. In most ways it went better than or about as I expected. Long day - checking in at 9:30, wires at 11:30; surgery at 1ish - home just around 3:45. I wouldn't say the wire localization was a \"piece of cake\" as some have said, but it's certainly not terrible - just a quick numbing shot and then a lot of manipulation and new mammo films - the mammo squeezing with needle in was the hardest part for me, but we all were trying to laugh - it's such an odd set up! Everyone was extremely kind at each step along the way - make sure to get some heated blankets! The best part was that they gave me a choice of general anesthesia or IV sedation - I chose IV sedation and am so thrilled. I was completely asleep for the whole thing, but woke up much faster and quicker than if I had had general. They were ready to switch to general if there was any indication the IV wasn't working. They also gave me anti-nausea meds - so I had no nausea at all.  The only thing that's been harder is that my incision is much more painful than I expected - and larger. GS said this was due to wider margins needed. I also just had my CNB last week so the area is completely bruised and sore already. I also had an allergic reaction to bandaids so the whole area is just a blistery red mess. This is not typical - I'm not sure we're allowed to post pictures or I would post one so you could see the outcome - it would have helped me to see some incision pics.  I'm taking Vicodin but it's still pretty painful. I need to go back in tomorrow for a check if the Vicodin continues not to work, but I expect tomorrow will be much better - as things usually are. Even with the incision issues, the whole thing is very managable. I loved having my sister there with me all day - she had a lot of waiting but it was great to have someone with me during the in-between times. We laughed alot. I would recommend moving around as little as possible for the first 24 hours when you get home. Movement definitely makes it feel worse in these early hours. Like someone else on this thread, I find the bra (even the soft sports bra) too uncomfortable so am wearing loose t-shirt. I took a slow walk around the yard when I got home just to stretch out my legs (gently) and get some fresh air. Tonight a movie with the family while resting on the couch -- and ice cream. Now, off to bed. No pain typing (but I did not do lymph nodes so I assume that's different). It's really do-able.  I wish you smooth surgeries and recoveries.  I'll post a quick follow-up when I have my results. Many thanks again for the support and advice. I found it very helpful and I thought of you guys when I was at the hospital today!",

I received my results today - benign! Yay! Some question of phyllodes vs. fibroadenoma so I've got to go to specialist, get a second pathology opinion in the city, etc. I have a feeling this will be a prolonged journey. But, for today I'm celebrating hearing the word \"benign\" and feeling so so lucky. Four days out I feel totally normal - my incision and brusing is still pretty dramatic looking, but not painful.They put me on antibiotics and steroid cream because I seem to be having infection/allergic reactions, but otherwise totally back to normal other than the \"sloshing\" sound - which makes me laugh every time I hear it. I can't tell what my cosmetic result will be. The incision looks awful now -- right across the top -- and the breast is definitely smaller/flatter than before - I had a relatively big chunk removed. But, as everyone says it will take a while to know exactly how everything will settle down. I can't thank everyone enough for letting me both lurk and post here - I learned so much that helped me prepare for my surgery and learn about potential outcomes. I hope my post about my surgery helps others as previous posts helped me. I guess I will stop posting on this particular thread as I have no further surgery scheduled and I do not have a cancer diagnosis. I want to be respectful to the forum. Please feel free to PM me if I can be of help to anyone contemplating lumpectomy or who has questions about multiple biopsies/fibroadenomas. In addition to my thanks, please accept my best wishes and prayers for good health, healing and recovery to each of you. Mirabile.",

I am almost 49, have had fibroadenomas in both L and R breasts. Also cysts. (\"Busy breasts\" - R side particularly dense.) Have had several core needle biopsies and cyst aspirations - all B9. Have mammo and US every six months. After last US, radiologist told me he was \"very concerned\" about a R side deep non-vascular 7mm nodule that he could not find on US, but had grown significantly in last six months. I assumed I'd go for another needle biopsy but he wanted to get an MRI \"asap.\"  After MRI (BIRADS 0)  they sent me for a repeat targeted US. US was BIRADs 4 but new radiologist didn't seem that concerned except that it was \"deep.\"  Met with my general surgeon (who told me she had no idea why they had given me the \"million dollar workup\") and finally scheduled CNB for June 8th. Frustrating, but OK.  Today my internist called and told me that I was anemic. She seemed to think alarmingly so  - level of 30 down from 41 a year ago, which doesn't seem critical to me. I have well-controlled Crohn's Disease so have frequent GI consults and have had several polyps removed during colonoscopy (most recently last year). Never been anemic before other than one point off once in a while. Internist recommended that I see GI within one week and told me she thought he'd order a CAT scan - possibly repeat colonoscopy.  I have also been having persistent lower left pain - GI does not think it's Crohn's related - have been seeing GYN - pelvic ultrasounds. No conclusion - she thinks it's cysts forming and disappearing.  Each of these things seems like no big deal. But, with the new anemia Dx today, I confess I'm feeling a little anxious. Could all of this be related in some way?  Nothing to do but wait I know but thought I'd check in and get your thoughts. Mirabile dictu = \"wonderful to relate\" Log in to post a reply",

Frustrating to not have more info.  General surgeon recommends lumpectomy with wide incision (and wire localization).  It's scheduled for THIS FRIDAY. (kinda fast) I'm going to  look around on the site for more information but wanted to close this thread with my results at this point.  Thanks for all your support and for this great site.",
