Is it normal to not be tested for hormone receptive when having DCIS?  Will they still have the samples they took and can they now be tested? What have peoples consultants/oncologists advised you about the marina coil? Any comments would be appreciated.  I thought all this cancer stuff was out of the way so feeling a bit :( that I now have this dilemma. M x Log in to post a reply",
