I asked about numbing or being put out. I was told numbing cream was not used because it can affect the tracer. The radiology department told me it would be like 4 little bee stings on each breast. I am happy to report that it was very quick and virtually painless for me. Easier than the lidocaine for my biopsy. So each person is different and perhaps each technician also.",
