At my first ultrasound, the radiologist said he thought my lump was cyst, but recommended a biopsy just to be sure. At the hospital, I met with a breast surgeon and radiologist who did another, longer, ultrasound and confirmed that it was a cyst, so the biopsy was unnecessary. I am so relieved. They also found an area of fibrocystic changes, which they said was normal for women in their 20s, but I'm glad it was found so I can keep an eye on things. Thank you everyone for your kind and supportive words. I'll continue to read your stories because this was one of the most educational and accessible sites that I found when I so desperately needed information!",

      "Content": "cfloat wrote: Hello all. Brand new here (and terrified). I'm 24 and felt a very small, hard, painless, fixed lump under my right nipple last week. I saw a nurse practitioner the same day, who scheduled an ultrasound for a week from today. She didn't offer any comment about the characteristics of the lump or what she thought, except to say \"We'll find out what that is, hopefully it's nothing.\" I had a family vacation scheduled this week and asked whether I should cancel, and she thought it would be fine to get checked when I come back. Of course, I'm having a really hard time enjoying vacation and haven't said anything to anyone except my fiancé because I'm so scared. I think I can feel two swollen lymph nodes under my right armpit, but I'm not sure. Both of my grandmothers, and one great-grandmother, had breast cancer. So I've been steeling myself for this mentally\u2013that it will be a concern at some point\u2013but I never expected it so soon. I would really appreciate any words of support or encouragement or suggestions... I know the general pattern of what will happen from here (ultrasound, possible diagnostic mammogram\u2013if it's not a cyst, a biopsy\u2013then staging...) but no idea of how long it takes, how many doctors will be involved... so on and so on.

You ladies really reassured me that I was doing everything I'm supposed to and helped me relax (and actually enjoy a little!) of my family vacation. I had my ultrasound Friday. The radiologist said it's a very small (4mm) mass with rounded edges like a cyst, but because of its small size/close to the surface location, he isn't 100% sure it's a cyst and wants to have it biopsied. Definitely not the news I had been hoping for, but not bad news considered either. I have the biopsy this Friday. I want my fiancé to be in the room with me, but I'm not sure if this is allowed\u2013has anyone else on here brought someone for support to a biopsy? Thank you all again for your kind words and support!",
