It appears as if I have two more small masses forming in my left breast, just a few weeks after surgery. Really nervous because, unfortunately, I don't have tons of confidence in the doc's I have been seeing. I live in a small town in the midwest, and the new doc said he has only seen one PT before. Sheesh! Would you get your car fixed at a place that has only worked on one car??? You ladies on here have provided more sound advice and support and I thank you so much!",
