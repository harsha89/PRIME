Why take any chance when it comes to Cancer?  Hope this helps you.",

As I felt nothing and rad lasted about 20 seconds.\"  Doc gave me prescription for Biafine Emulson, comes in a tube  and I am supposed to cover breast with it  twice a day but not within 4 hours of treatment.   They tell me that I should be in and out in 15 minutes per treatment.  Except one day per week when they do xray pictures to re-verify location of rads.  I meet the criteria for 3 wk as small breasts, small tumor, negative for nodes.  Time will tell if I have made the right decision to have the shortened rads. but for now I am satisfied with my decision.   Good luck   Cathey",

By the second day you might want to put ice on spot about 15 minutes every hour.  Wrap ice or frozen peas in a light weight towel and put on spot.  Not too much cold for too long a time.  Keep it up at least until you have your post-surgery appointment.   Thats what I did and kept it from swelling which helps healing.   I am now 8 days after Lump. surgery and got my pathology report on the 7th day.  Another thing if no one has told you is to wear a sport bra 24 hours a day for the first two weeks.  Get one that closes in the front. I even shower with it on to protect the stitches.  Dont know if you have a Walmart there but they have sport bras cheap.  I hate wearing the bra but I know that it holds the breast firmly but gentle which protects the stitches from injury allowing them to heal better.  I stopped pain meds on the fourth day but this you have to decide how long  you need .  Allow yourself as much comfort as possible.  I cannot sleep in my bed yet but I sleep in a recliner.  I hope this all helps you.    Did they check your lymph nodes?",

Chemo or radiation you can receive $500.00 of credit that may be used by you for such things as childcare, pet care, gas cards, restaurant gift cards and more.  The list is on their site.  Relatives are not elligible for this money and no regard for income.  I completed the application and my rad onc signed that I am going through radiation and then I got a call from the foundation telling me that I was accepted for the $500.00 and what could they do for me.  I asked for a $100  gas card at BP and a $100 gift card for Steak and Shake and I received both the next day.   This $500 is good for six months from being accepted. If you are as sceptical as I am, I urge you to check out the site.  It works for me. What a help this has been for me.  Using my gas card helps me with money for my prescriptions. I cant say enough about this wonderful foundation that was set up by a nurse.  Check it out!!!  Cathey Dx 5/29/2009, IDC, <1cm, Stage I, Grade 2, 0/2 nodes, ER+ Log in to post a reply",

On its best day this whole thing is confusing to the layman who is unfamiliar with how to navigate.  Good luck    Cathey from Indiana",

She showed me her breast which was not even pink after her 20th treatment.  She said she really spreads this emulsion on thick at least twice a day and has had no burning.  I hope Im that lucky.  It does not smell and does not feel sticky.  It is water soluable and must be removed at least 4 hours before a treatment.   Three large tubes cost about $200 in Indpls without insurance.  After my insurance it cost me $35.00.  A lot of money but worth it is it gets me through the breastburn.  Good luck.     Cathey",

I also slosh lots of Biafin Topical Emulsion (prescription) on my breast after treatment.  My treatments last about 15 minutes in and out.  Once a week they make an xray proofing location for extra caution which adds 5 minutes to treatment.  Each treatment gives me 2.67 units (grays) equaling a total amount of grays of 42.72 which is less than the 50 grays for the 33 treatment plan.  As my surgeon told me that the results of shortened or standard are the same you might want to discuss it with your rad onc.  Luck to you   Cathey",

I do however smear on my breast twice a day the Biafin Topical Emulsion that my rad onc prescribed for me. Even this Emulsion must be washed off at least 4 hours before a radiation treatment.  It is water soluable and easy to remove and not sticky,  It really feels good and goes on easily.  Friday was #9 with 7 to go and so far I am not even pink but I am beginning to feel tiredness in my legs.  But I have not hit the wall yet from fatique.  Maybe next week. Hope not. As far as the qualifications for the shortened rad, your rad onc should be able to decide if you are a candidate. There are many sites that descibe lots of details on the 3 week radiation treatments  One can be found on this site which will tell you about it.  Luck",

Keep all food bland and stay away from spicy foods.  Good luck  I remember my first colonoscopy and how nervous I was.  I have one every five years and are no longer afraid.",

I feel so fortunate that I am retired (age 72) and dont work.  This will enable me to rest all day and night and I can focus on my treatments.    Also I wont have a very long drive, about 2-3 miles.  I wish others had my advantages, it would make it easier for them.  I feel for young mothers who work and still have to fight this fight.  My heart goes out to them.  Thanks again.  Cathey",
