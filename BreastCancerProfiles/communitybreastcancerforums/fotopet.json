First chemo treatment was a bit more eventful than I would have like.  But, on the good side, the staff stayed uber-calm and quickly dealt with the issues.  Could have been worse, I am sure.  Say started out ok with doc giving finial clearance to proceed and me being relieved that the pre-chemo blood tests are just a finger stick.  Then off to the infusion room and the fun began with three unsuccessful attempts to get a viable IV before they finally got one going.  First one went in fine but blew.  Second attempt the nurse could not get it into the vein and gave up to get another nurse.  Her first attempt also blew.  So my entire hand is severely bruised and sore as hell.  THey finally got a line in the lower forearm but could not do the blood draw that the doc had wanted.  Their solution was to get the chemo going and try to get the blood out when the session was done.  (That actually worked). Premeds went fine - the benedryl was a trip - hit like gangbusters! Then the Taxotere.No sooner had they gotten through the saline and the Taxotere itself hit anbd I got a scary reaction.  Immediate chest and jaw pain, stomach contracted and DH says I turned the color of a cooked lobster.  They immediately stopped the IV, four nurses came in (very quickly but very calmly).  Within a couple of minutes, I felt fine again. So 20 more MG of steroids (bringing the day's total to 46! No wonder I couldn't sleep after that). A half hour wait then restt the Taxotere, slow at first then ramp it up.  The doc called it \"challenging\" my body to accept the Taxotere.  Well, it worked and we got through the rest of the treatment without event. Went to the Look Good Feel Better program last night.  I highly recommend it to anyone who can get there.  Got a great bag of cosmetics that I would NEVER splurge on for myself and tips on minimizing effects of chemo on the skin (I never would have thought of using all disposable applictors - but the infection possibilities with mascara alone . . .)  Was actually good timing, I needed the fun energy in the room.  Felt a little nauseated on the way there but I blame it at least as much on the greasy, fatty, fried foods DH and I packed for chemo and ate for dinner than on the chemo itself.  I took a Zofran and felt fine after that. Then, virtually no sleep last night.  (Have to talk to the docs about that).  So I am fatique-fuzzy today. And beginning to get a real metallic tase noticible in the water I am pounding down.  Oh yea, and woke up flushed in the face, like I was just out running (maybe the huge amounts of steroids?)",

It was a relaxing, very normal getaway.  Hot and humid most of the time.  I even indulged in one (just one) ice cold beer.  Yum. Very little in the way of SE's -- just some tiredness and hair shedding all over. It is coming out in clumps in the shower now. Not sure how much longer I've got until it will drive me nuts and I will buzz away.   I think I am ready to rock the scarves. DH offered to shave off his mustache in support.  That sounds weird, I know, but he has actually NEVER shaved his mustache (ever ever - even when he first started shaving) so the offer was touching. Of course, I declined the support. I have developed a bit of a phelgmy cough.  Even though I don't feel sick and it's not really bothering me, I have called the onco office.  Just hoping it won't put off chemo next week. Day - So glad you are starting with a new onco office.  It is so much easier when you have confidence in your docs and nurses. packjen: Love the buzz!! I hope I can carry it off even half as well as you do. cleob - if you are still concerned about chemo maybe not working, I would call your onco and ask.  I doubt that's the case, like others have said, you are probably just a bit more resilient.  You might also want to check for a Taxol specific group - they might have answers for you that the rest of us (those who are not doing the same protocol) don't have. leanna9 - I am drinking dirt-water too. But have found that lemon helps. Just have to make sure to squirt it in rather than leaving the pieces in the water, or I get heartburn.  And if I want just a \"water\" taste, distilled water seems to be ok. nanaof2 - I had the neulasta pain but it was manageable with ibuprofin and a bit of stronger stuff at night.  And went away within 48 hours.  I think the trade-off was worth it.  This time, I will be taking Claritin, so we will see if that helps.",

Day - please don't worry about addressing all of us.  I think that is actually impossible - we are a chatty group.  Lots of times, I am not able to respond, either because I am at work (and actually working, unlike right now) or on my i-touch, which won't let me write on this site for some reason. Well, my hair has basically given up.  I gave up trying to get all the loose hair out this morning in the shower and just dried off and tied on a scarf.  Then when I went to my car, I saw quite a sight.  I had my windows down driving home last night and guess all the loose hair blew right back into the back seat.  Looked like a pack of shedding dogs had been frolicking back there!!  So far, have not buzzed it but maybe I will get the guts this weekend while I am in the mountains.  In this humidity, even the scarves are getting hot. Or maybe that's another hot flash. . . .",

I am not sure when that decision will be made. AM in contact with my team as much as I can right ow so we will see. I do have a question to throw out to all of you out there.  I buzzed the hair last week and had o problems until yesterday.  Now, I have broken out in an itchy rashy type thing all over my head.  Might be pimples? from steroids.  But I don;t know.  All I know is I want it gone.  Any suggestions out there?  Trying to avoid my own self-pity party here.  DH had a photo shoot (he is a pro-photographer) yesterday so he was gone most of then and he has a wedding today so will be gone from noon til midnight.  I hate being alone though these SE's - it's scary and I feel myself sinking into bad places.  Ugh.

In the meantime . . . I updated the intro post with all the info you have been posting.  Let me know if anything needs to be added or fixed. njbhwgirl - I still get quite a bit of aching pain in the mx breast (which was reconstructed with a DIEP).  PS says to expect this for awhile.  Fortunately for me, the pain is manageable with tylenol.  Hugs to you - pain sucks and sucks all the energy right out of us! Leah58 - Thanks so much for stopping by and the words of encouragement! nanof2 - Agreed -the waiting has definitely been the worst part of all of this. Hang in there and let us know what the onco says on Monday. Barb - I already had my teaching sessions.  Now just waiting to heal up enought to start.  Not sure about my hormone drigs after. I had a hysterectomy a few years ago - kept the overies, so they have to do a bunch of tests to see where I am at menapause-wise.  Gotta love all these tests, right?  I.ve never been poked and prodded so much in my life.  JennyB - CONGRATS on being 25% done with your chemo cycles!!!  Sorry the SE's are hitting. Cyber-hugs!",

Not feeling too bad yet, although I definitely feel myself sliding.  So I am hanging at home and doing a little work from here.  Eating what tastes good and just generally being gentle with myself.

Working from home today.  Still very tired from TX.  No major bone pain this time - yeah!!  So maybe the Claritin helped that SE.  My rash-y head is getting better.  I am using Aveeno baby shampoo with oatmeal on it.  Very soothing.  I think it's just the newly revealed scalp combined with the awful humid heat we've been having lately that is making t rashy.  My mom would call it heat rash.  Just have to deal with it, like all the other SE's.  But I actually feel halfway done now that the major SE period has passed!! Summer38 - It's nice to find out you have a decent head, isn;t it!  I've been going bald mastly at home and did quite  abit of errands yesterday wthout headcovering.  Don;t mind my look too much myself.  Leanna - Hope you are feeling better.  The heat is a bitch, isn't it! LibraryJen - It is tough to keep up the positivity.  Particularly when you feel bad.  Hugs out to you.  -- Also, I don;t have you on the list of people in the group.  I must have missed you in my chemo-haze.  If you PM me your info, I'll add it! Redbarb - SO sorry about the 15 year old.  Mine is almost 17 and has evened out some but those years were awful!  Have you let the school know about your situation?  They might cut your son some slack with grades and stuff - mine did. KimLovesDachsunds - Money Barins - yes, that is what it feels like!!! Also, I don;t have you on the list of people in the group. I must have missed you in my monkey brains. If you PM me your info, I'll add it! Charliebird - I so agree with the others that sometimes, it's the little things. I had no mouth sores but got throat sores.  Biotene 3-4 times a day, plus the benedry/maalox rinse, worked wonders!  Paxton - so srry your BF was not around for you.  Sucks feeling alone when you feel bad.  But the s'mores idea really sounds good. Hmmm - wonder if I have any marshmallows. Day - Damn bugs!  I am right with you.  Hope they experienced the FULL effect of chemo! sacphoto - sometimes you have to wonder about the people they have working in those stores. DancerMel - I have decided to take the easy way out and leave the decision to my docs.  Early on, I said that I made my major decision picking he doc then will just do what h says.  So, now I am just waiting for him.  Apparently, one reaction may not be a \"true\" alergy to the  taxotere, but once you get another, they assume you are allergic.  And that can be bad.  I guess I would rather get two Adriamycin in then get anotther Taxotere reaction then have to switc.  Hm, so I guess I am leaning one way.  Wil have to let the doc know that.  This is such fun!! packjen - my head rash has stayed to the head, so I am assuming it's a kindof shaving/eat rash.    ",

Sacphoto - Saw your quickie post and fell on the floor, laughing.  I SO agree - I am sick and tired of lemon!!!!  Martinis sound so much better!!!     Or a strawberry dacquiri - or a nice cold beer - . . . oh, wine, I so love wine......... njbwgirl - tired is the name of the game here.  Day 4 & 5, I can barely manage to get of bed to do bathroom runs.  THis second tx, it seems like the tiredness is taking forever to lift.   KimLovesDachsunds - I love the bra patch.  Might have to set one up in my postage stamp front yard!!!  ANd I agree about grabbing life - when people ask me how cancer has chnged me ( a question I hate) I say, it has made me selfish!  I am not putting things off anymore - I deserve better than that~ LauraM - your daughter's story made me tear up.  THis is so ard on our kids.  Mine is 16 and just keeps asking if the \"percentages\" are staying the same.  He read somewhere about the 5-year odds and knows mine are good but can't sem to get the bad ones out of his head.

Sacphoto and Patricia 48 - I am with you on the nightmares.  Mine are mostly serial killers and weird monsters that no one believes are there.  Onco says steroids make them worse but just have to tough it out.  And Sacphoto - I agree.  My DH is wonderful with all of this buit sometimes I hate to worry him about things that I just need to vent and get out in the air.  Just chatting with all of you helps so much! Well - I will be off-line and hibernating until after the long weekend.  Everyone - enjoy the holidays as best you can!  Sacphoto - sounds like you have a fun weekend coming up.  Enjoy! x-ray girl - Welcome.  As long as my chemo brain doesn't kick in, I will add you as soon as I am done with this note.  Patricia - Great reminder that the weakenss is the TX not the cancer that we are so diligently chasing away!  It's a hard thing to remember right in the few days after tx. To those jealous of the ability to taste Oreo's - well it is gone now.  Back to cinamon toast and fruit smoothies for awhile  But the oreo's WILL return :) Irishtess - I seem to be getting some relief from the tearing by, of all things, adding artificial tears!

And the diarhea has passed with one day of BRAT diet.  nanaof2 - my doc said it is not unusual to get the bad tummy 6 - 10 days after tx.  so yours might have been that, although my doc also suggested that alot of cramping is usually a bug (I had minimal cramping).  Hpoing for you to have an easier next time. As for the hair - I might have to get a quick, cheap trim before it all falls out.  No wayward hairs as of yet, but I am only on day7.   packjen- thoroughly not fair about the hair - i have a friend who went trough this last year and complained all the time that she had no hair anywhere except her legs!  sacphotomom - I am seeing the onco tomorrow and will ask about starting the pain meds earlier, now that we know neulasta pain is in my future.  Thanks for the suggestion.   As for the taste buds, DH is cooking from the Cancer Fighting Kitchen, which has lots of suggestions with fresh herbs and sweetners.  I am drinking lemon water constantly - seems to help the fuzzy mouth feel and cardboard/metallic taste. sunflower87 - my thoughts will be with you on your second tx.  That reaction is SCARY and I , like you, hope for no repeats! ",

Onco thinks my cough is from allergies and regardless, is nothing to worry about.  All in all, feeling basically normal except for a bit of fuzzy tongue, deadened tastebuds, and the damn itchy spot from the reaction at the infusion site. I am back to working full-time, back to the gym, and back to most normal stuff.  Feels kind of good but mostly just feels tiring. packjen - Franly, I wouldn't be workig if I had the resources to stay home.  But, I am the primary breadwinner and no disabiliity so, I am kind of stuck.  Luckily my boss is pretty good with it.  On the flip side, I thinnk working keeps me active, which helps the SE's seem less daunting.  I know when I stop (like the weekends) I tend to wallow, which makes it feel worse. And for DH and I, it's the theme song from the 70's movie \"Flash Gordon\" It's by Queen and kind of goes \"Flash - ah ah. . . \" Gets us every time. Leanna - Enjoy your vacation!!! I LOVE Disney. Tricia - Ditto what JennyB said.  It's great that you can actually measure the change! sacphotomom - Love the wig story!  irishtess - \"age appropriate\" my ass.  I think we get to be anything we want after going through all of this. I probably wouold have been tempted to smack her with her \"age appropriate\" foobs!",

Welcome to our recent joiners.  Did my best to update the main thread - if I missed anyone, please drop me a PM. Random comments on random posts below - sorry for the lateness! Laurie_R - belated congrats on finishing chemo! Yeah for you!! njbhwgirl: I cut my hair as soon as the docs said I would lose it, even though I have a wig that pretty mch matches what it looked like before the cut. My hairdresser has been wanting me to go super-short for years, si I figured what better time? Also, I am hopng that I will look \"normal\" to myself that much faster after chemo if I get used to short hair in the morning mirror. I actually figure I won't wear my wig much at all.  Scarves or bald will do it for me - I am a comfort-loving creature.  I pretty much plan on only wearing the wig when I hae to be in court (I am a trial attorney and I think the bald thing would be too distracting for a jury). adb1971: Delay is the name of the game for me.  I was originally scheduled for end of April. Delayed to May 4th becaue the onc did not like the look of part of my abdominal incision (left mx with DIEP on 3/26).  He was ight because the incision popped open and had to be debrided and reclosed last week, which outs me off until 5/18 at least.  Hoping the OS will clear me on Monday. So maybe we will start on the same day - both after long, depressing delay. ",

Patricia48 - My neulasta pain was about 6 days after.  My onco nurses said they hear that all the time, although the neulasta makers will say the pain starts within 24 hours.  I've run out of steam here.  Heading off-line.  HUgs to all.",

But next week is tx#3.  After that, just one more! Paxton -- adorable pics!! Summer - I am not taking anti depressants - yet.  But have been taking Ativan since shortly after diagnosed. JennyB - I have nightmares too, when I don;t take the ativan.  Mostly about seial killers and weird monster creatures that no one will believe are after me.  Sacphotomom - I also have tightness andpain for about a week after tx.  The abdominal scar is the worst - but it's also the biggest and I had healing problems with it anyway. Day - I don't know about anyone else, but my docs told me to eat protein-rich because the chemo slows healing and I am still healing from surgery.  Protein is supposed to help. JennyB, packjen and GolferGirl - Congrats on being 75% done!",

Protein -- I get alot of mine from smoothies with yogurt and whey protein (DH makes them) and Carnation instant breakfast spiked with whey protein.  I, too, love tomatoes, fruit, etc and it's hard to eat meat beacus it seems so dry!  If I went with what I really want, I would eat nothing after chemo except chocolate milk, tomatoes, strawberries and cinnamon toast! I received my wrap from the same place the Day got hers.  Mine came last week.  I wasn't paying attention to my home email, so it came as a surprise.  Mine is cotton and bright and summery - very cheerful.  I am wearing it today - super comfy! I am dreading this next tx since I had reactions to both prior ones.  My doc has decided not to switch meds.  DH is wondering how high my blood pressure will go just befire they start the taxotere.  I think I will take a full dose of Ativan before I go.  Although, I am encouraged by Redbarb's experience with no reaction this time.  Yeah! Moms - My mom is visiting in a couple of weeks despite me telling her NOT to come.  I was planning on going out there (she lives near Las Vegas) between chemo and rads, but she just could not wait.  Love her but she always seems to say things that set me off.  And now I have to figure out how to entertain her, work, and ride out the SE's at the same time.  Ugh. So glad it's Friday. ",

I have decided not to do anything about it, since I wear a scarf most of the time anyway, and just see how it goes or grows! Sacphoto - glad your dad is improving. Snipinfool - Seems like tx#3 is kicking all our butts! Leanna9 - So sorry that wig place is awful.  Some of them seem so great, but when they are insensitive, it is really bad!  Golfergirl - I hadn't heard of that before about losing weight during rads, but I guess it makes sense.  I will be training for The 3 Day while doing rads, so might be an issue because I will more likely than not lose weight even if I keep eating the same. Oh well, not like I am not getting real used to \"issues\". X-ray Girl - don't think I said a proper \"hello\".  I, too, keep rubbing my head because it feels different in a good way.  (Still would rather have the hair, though :)",

Sacphotomom - I had started a weightloss program just before diagnosis too.  That's been put on the back burner but I have not really gained or lost anything during treatment.  I am basically eating normally but am not drinking alcohol much, which probably helps. I am actually looking forward to getting done with treatment and back on the weight loss path! My las tx is Tuesday - for some reason, I am REALLY dreading this one.  Maybe because I don;t feel like I have recovered from the last.  But I want it OVER! GolferFirl - this will be my 3rd 3-day walk.  Obviously, this year will be different since I will be a survivor and all.  DH is crewing.  We are doing the Washington DC walk Oct 8 - 10. Leanna - So glad your hubby got a job!  Redbarb - I get an annoying dry cough that starts a couple of days after tx and lasts about a week.  Doc isn't worried about, so neither am I.  But it is annoying.  Oh yeah, and I am using a coppertone kids sunscreen (SPF 50) with zinc oxide in it.  Seems to work. Jen - Wow!  And I was pooped just keeping up with my mother!  Congrats on finishing chemo (and to all the rest of you out there who have finished.) njbhwgirl - I really don;t think the people at work get it.  They see me here working and seem to think I am doing \"fine\".  NOT!  And now that chemo is winding down, the boss keeps saying he's glad I'll be back to working like I did before.  Apparently he has no clue how long it is going to take me to recover from all of this crap.  Oh well.  So I sleep 13 hours a night and have virtually no time for myself. ",
