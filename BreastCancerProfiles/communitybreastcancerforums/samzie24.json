I found quite a seemingly large painless lump whilst on holiday a couple of weeks ago... and now I am waiting for biopsy and CT scan results. I can\u2019t even believe how much can change in just a a few weeks. I had an ultrasound and mammogram last week which lead to a biopsy as the radiographer didn\u2019t like what she saw. She more or less confirmed that what was seen was highly suspicious and that it was probably cancer. My consultant echoed this. I feel like my world has come crashing down around me. She did say that there was no evidence of swelling to any of the lymph nodes and she checked this thoroughly during the ultrasound. I initially thought this was a good thing but have since read that cancer can bypass the lymph nodes... so I\u2019m back to being absolutely terrified of what I\u2019m going to walk into on Thursday when I get all of my results. I\u2019m just so scared and can\u2019t even believe this is happening to me. I\u2019m 30 with no history of BC in the family and I feel like my life is now over. I feel sick with worry... constantly. I keep crying at everything and the worry is totally consuming me. All I keep reading is horror stories and just can\u2019t see any light at the end of the tunnel right now. :( Log in to post a reply",
