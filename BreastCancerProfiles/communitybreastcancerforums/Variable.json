Mine was a sensation of warmth on my treated breast and an occasional zing of something else but not really pain. I was in the prone position and the hair on my arms also felt static every single time. I have had discussions with my RO and the dosemetrist about my treatment plan and what I feel and they look at me like I am an anxious mess. I don't think anyone who HAS NOT experienced radiation can discount what you feel, and each person's response to treatment is different. It does get easier, and I have had to work hard to try and relax and not think about expecting to feel something. I have found counting during each treatment and machine change helpful as a distraction, and also as a mental cue it is almost over. Three more boost to go for me :) Peaceful thoughts!!!",

The addition of the BSO came from my cancer team as they all feel I should reduce my estrogen production to reduce the risk of recurrence. I have also been recommend to take Tomoxifen, but have a fear of the worse case scenario side effects of that drug. I also had a pre tomoxifen baseline ultrasound that indicated my uterine lining is already thick and was advised to get the Hysterectomy/BSO before starting anti hormonals. I would love to just go with doctor recommendations, I just seem to be resistant to doing anything that may cause me further harm. My one year anniversary of diagnosis is upon me and given I did not expect to be here a year ago I feel like volunteering for anything that may further compromise my health is a really bad idea! I think I have used my nine lives already!",

I was diagnosed with BC in August, much to my shock having already survived synovial sarcoma many years ago. I feel my world does not make sense anymore. I was free, I was living, and I was done! Now what! I too have the feeling that this may \"take me down\"? I suppose the fear of dying from cancer has been with me all along, but is now more realistic given my new diagnosis. Something will take us down eventually; accepting that disappointing fact, regardless of how it comes, is tough for everyone. You are here for encouragement and good vibes so here they are... While the initial shock is devastating, I did get through my surgery and radiation just fine. I have some issues with hormone therapy that I am working through, but so far so good! I see my doctors every couple of months to check on things and continue to live as normally as possible! (Most of the time) YOU are still here to fight this next battle! You are an experienced patient! You are wise enough to know this is out of your control, so allow others to support you when you need it! You can, and will do this, whatever comes your way! Good luck with everything! I am sending positive vibes!",

Finding out my BC was ER+ was devastating to me as I was essentially feeding my BCs growth over the years. I chose QOL at the time, but may have shortened it by taking the pill. These decisions are not easy, and you have to be willing to live or die with the consequences. I would seek out other options if I could do this over again. Good luck!",

My surgeon was amazing and said she had to move some things around to fill in the hole. My scars are barely visible (4 inches for lump and 2 inch for nodes). While I have no current indentation, I was told it may take two years for the full impact of surgery and radiation to be seen. Your surgeon should be able to tell you what you can likely expect based on your individual situation. Good luck with your decision! A good cosmetic outcome is definitely possible!",

I am 5 more treatments away from done but the change in my radiation routine is unnerving! I spoke with the Dosimetrist yesterday to have my plan explained to me as the thought of direct straight line electrons to my breast, and everything behind it on my left side is a concern. Essentially, I was told not to worry these rays don't go that deep. Uhh??? OK...., but if you are showing me a scan and my lung is in the field you plan to radiate, then that is TOO DEEP for me! And by the way, my large breast balancing ever so dangerously on my ribcage does change the amount of breast tissue under the large bullseye drawn on it depending on how far I am on my side!!! His response, it will vary slightly day to day, this is a clinical workup. Sure, I understand that, but this is a treatment designed to TARGET the tumor bed, shouldn't it be more PRECISE! Dear GOD, please have my radiation team look at the BOOST plan and positioning one more time before delivering that CURATIVE dose! Just 5 more, just 5 more (repeat all day!) Am I wrong to expect a certain level of understanding when asking questions related to how a treatment that will effect my body for the rest of my life is delivered??? Making treatment decision under the gun is so unfair!!! I will do as I am told, and suppose his confidence in what he does for a living is sufficient to keep me safe!!!! And as a secondary concern, all of my copilots for my 45 minute drive to treatment have terrible colds! Today's barrier to peace, solo and spooked!!!!",
