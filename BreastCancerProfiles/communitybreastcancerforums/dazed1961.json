Had silicone implants put in on June 17, 2011, and ironicly had my nipples and tats done on Jan 17. 2012, this past tuesday. Full circle of one year, almost to the exact moment of diagnosis. It's been one heck of a journey. My question is anyone who got nipples and tats together. Were they very dark at first? will they shrink? and did your surgery cause your breasts to have bulges post surgery. My breast mounds seemed real nicely formed prior to this surgery, and now look deformed. Is this because of surgery, or is this what I am left with? any response is greatly appreciated!!!

No redness or fever..just tender. I see my p.s. tomorrow for post op check up so will find out what is up with the bulges. They are smaller than yesterday, so maybe it's just a matter of time. This entire journey is a waiting game. Unfortunately, I wasn't blessed with alot of patience.I'm about the only person I have ever heard of that had both nips and tats done together, and I'm on alot of sites. I figured it would be 2 procedures, but he did it in one, and I'm counting my blessings that it hurt, cuz I DO have some feeling!! :)",

The left is still quite bruised and colorful but bulges going down and i think this scar will fade. He said in 6 weeks he can do laser if I'm not happy, but I'm just tired and exhausted and sick of drs. and I have so many appts cuz i also have major back problems. I'm getting an epidural next week and will then be starting physical therapy. I'm hoping all goes well and I can get better use of my arms also. I'm just having a rough day and I'm really overtired and down in the dumps today. Tomorrow will be better!! Any question you have, I love to try and help others and share this journey. It strengthens me!! Stay strong and fight hard!! Sandy",

I chose to get both off as I know too many people that end up coming back. I'm a very thin person so I had to get expanders. I was a b cup and went to a c cup. Why not get something good out of the deal? anyway, the expander was very uncomfortable and actually fractured my upper ribs. I went for weekly fills and toward the end was when it was most uncomfortable. I wanted to run the expander over with my car, hit it with a baseball bat, and burn it!! My p.s. is like stat of the art, prob why i gpt nips and tatsÂ  done all at once. After my last fill, my skin rested for 3 weeks and the silicone implants were put in. They weere much more comfortable. Today, my breast are starting to resemble normal and i think they are going to look real nice when they completely heal and the bruising and swelling goes down. Would love to help you and answer any questions you have, so feel free to post or email me slg121961@aol.com. have a super day!!",
