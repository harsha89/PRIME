Looks like you had a good doctor/surgeon to listen to your concerns. Results from my MRI indicated another potential area of concern in the same breast so had a MRI guided biopsy today ... but many MRIs only show the known area of concern so hopefully that will be the case for you. It will be difficult during the wait but when that anxiety hits you to try to remember to breathe in ... breathe out ...",

Two years ago started the 3D mammos (paid the extra $ out of pocket for the 3D) since I have dense breasts. 3D mammo 5 months ago was clear then I recently saw an indention in my breast. Cut to the chase and per MRI I have a roughly 1 inch 'cube' IDC mass (2cm x 2.5cm x 3cm) that is supposedly slow growing. Has anyone experienced something like this where it seems to have gone from apparently nothing to \"That can't be the size\" in a short period of time and how do you deal with that?

I'm about 1 month out post UMX (no radiation/no chemo) and developed a few small slightly raised brown spots on my chest on the mastectomy side that haven't gone away (they weren't there/no discoloration pre-mastectomy). The spots are not at the incision site. I don't think they are necrosis as I had necrosis at the incision site and they don't look the same. Has anyone had this happen? Any idea what they may be?
