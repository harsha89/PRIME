The results of my Mammogram were no abnormalities found and for ultrasound no abnormalities could be identified. Notes: Abmormality is palpable at 1:00 on left breast. needs to follow up with Surgeon. My nurse said that in a note to my doc it has stated my breast were dense the scans were not distinct on abnormality.  She said at the appointment he will give me another exam probably set me up for a biospy or futher scans. Iam nervous, but I got my phone call and Iam one step closer..   As Ive read alot of stories about when the lump can be felt but not seen on mammogram/ultrasound and 80% of the stories it was cancer worries me. Iam just praying its benign and I can get through the next couple of weeks without to much worry!!! Log in to post a reply",
