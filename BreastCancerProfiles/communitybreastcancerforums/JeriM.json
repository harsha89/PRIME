I have an MRI-guided breast biopsy tomorrow and am terrified that it will hurt. I do NOT do well with any type of pain or needles (I have a terminal genetic disease, as well, so I've had a zillion tests). I seriously have the lowest pain threshold and it is a real problem for me. I have a chest port for blood draws and transfusions and use EMLA cream each time. I'm wondering if it is okay to use EMLA on my breast before the MRI (with contrast) or if that will screw it up somehow and before the numbing shots (which never work well on me). I'm thinking I could have it on for a couple of hours and then wipe it off before I go in. Anybody know??",
