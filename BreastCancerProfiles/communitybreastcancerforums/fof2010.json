      "Content": "fof2010 wrote: Hi all, In January, I had a rt. breast mastectomy with latissimus dorsi reconstruction.  A temporary saline implant was put in as a tissue expander.  I also had an axillary lymph node dissection.  The lymph node dissection was a surprise since all of the testing had led us to believe there was a very small risk of lymph node involvement.  My pathology report said I had great margins and the cancer in the 2 sentinel nodes only were very small, just above the \"micro\" status.  I will be starting chemotherapy soon and that will go on for an 18 week duration.  My question is regarding radiation.  I am considered a borderline case and have gotten 2 different opinions so far from radiation oncologists.  I am going for a 3rd opinion soon.  I am considered \"borderline\" or in the \"gray area\" because I have minimal lymph node involvement and good clean margins.  Because my cancer was invasive and DCIS with quite a bit of small tumors throughout the breast is causing one of the radiation oncologists to recommend radiation.   However, the other radiation oncologist feels there just isn't enough benefit to outweigh the risks of lymphedema and encapsulation of the implant. Has anyone out there been faced with this decision based on a similar diagnosis and the unfortunate circumstances where the radiation oncologists just don't agree?  Also, I have been told that encapsulation is pretty much going to happen if I radiate so to plan for that which can be a very involved process to recover from.
