I know the Epstein-Barr virus stays with you and can become reactivated as it has for me in the past. How I felt this past month is exactly how I felt then, extreme exhaustion.

MRI showed heterogeneous liver instead of homogeneous which is indicative of diffuse mets. No tumors were seen. Now on A/C chemo and its working. I cried too. It was hard to believe it could work on one part but not another. It's the same cancer! Unfortunately A/C chemo has made me neutropenic so I've been hospitalized twice.-Jill",

When first diagnosed in 2017 de novo my TM was 581. Letrozole for 6 months brought it down to 167. Great, this is easy, I can do this I thought. February 2018 TM started creeping up. And so did some gnarly dark bruises. My onc knew immediately-bone marrow involvement. Confirmed by biopsy. Started taxol April 3rd same day as port placement. Taxol was always 1 step forward 1 step back. Started A/C on June 28th and boy did I feel good. Ended up in the hospital with pneumonia twice from low ANC, WBC but I knew it was working. A scan during this time showed a wonky shaped liver, highs and lows not a smooth uniform appearance. Did CT, MRI and PET nothing showed definitive mets to liver. Diffuse mets he said. I just feel like I can't catch a break. Shetland-I do trust my oncologist but I asked him the same thing yesterday. Can I be on Ibrance all the while this rising TM is getting out of control to the point that chemo can't rein it in? I'm worried that while he wants me to stay on Ibrance/Faslodex and give it a chance that my grade 3 tumor is having it's way with my organs, especially my liver. He said he will do a liver biopsy to see if it's mutated. Mine was highly ER+ PR+ so hormonal therapy should be working. I'm 45 with 12, 15, 16 year olds. My oldest two I know will be fine. My youngest and I have always been close and she is transgender. I'm sad I won't be here to guide and protect her. I need something to work more than 6 months.",

When I started Taxol I was sent home with Compazine but it knocked me out. Worked wonders on the nausea but I slept all day. Backed off a little and now I use Zofran when I have nausea. Just the right balance. Hope you feel better soon-Jil",

My ALK PHOS down 6 points though. Scariest thing is my tumor marker. Had gone up from 182 on 9/28 to 632 on 10/26. Now 4 weeks later it's more than doubled to 1,311. My doctor wants to keep me on Ibrance even though I was only on it for 2 weeks before I had to stop due to low ANC. Started 100mg today. Blood tests in 2 weeks, may have a scan in December. I feel great, no pain anywhere to speak of. Could tumor marker be ahead of scan? More sensitive? Doctor said if liver were in bad shape bilirubin and other liver tests would be off. He wants me to stay on it for at least another monthto \"give it a chance\" How long do tumor flares last? So sad and confused. Onto Halaven if this fails. Jill",

No mass, seems to be heterogeneous liver, suspected infiltration, inflammation. Some areas are lighter, some darker. LFT's continue to rise slightly. Enlarged spleen. I guess all of this adds up to diffuse liver mets. Confused though because report doesn't say definitely one way or the other. Stopping Taxol, I start A/C on 6/29. I'm scared it won't work. I was strong at dr. office but broke down when I told my three children the new plan and what to expect. Dr. said \u201cmixed response\"-Taxol killing off cancer in bone marrow but progressing to liver. Anyone had success with A/C and their liver mets? If not what has worked for you? Thanks-Jill.",
