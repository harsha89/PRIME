I have been almost \"dismissed\" too. Mostly for my age . Funny my breast specialist said the hardest part of her job is telling young woman they have bc and then tells me I'm too young?!?!? So don't worry you are prob fine. I will believe my MRI results if good. But I just know something is up though, Iv never had any sort of healthissue or an odd pain stay around for more then a week. I'm a fit healthy person and even my husband has said this is so not like you!",

She did mention however to be prepared it can pick up a lot of things that might require a biopsy even if there is NO suspicious mass. Djmammo your post really makes so much sense and really resonates with what I was getting at- how many of the storys I have read are actully the norm and so on! Thank you, you totally put it all perspective.",

All clear, I'm confused now. But the specialist took a biopsy of a \"denser area\" that she said is nothing but asymmetrical tissue (so not showing up on the other side by feel ) The area has been picked up by me and her so she wanted to prove that nothing was going on... but I said is that nessasary as the MRI was clear... I was not ready for her to just get needle out and do a biopsy right on the spot. I guess that can happen ðŸ˜³. Could different country's have different scoring systems or this universal?",

So I had strange breast pain plus other strange symptoms.. i had a few test plus an MRI. Well today my MRI was totally utterly clear! Again bi rads 0 nothing. I'm still in pain but hey I can breath easy for 6 months until my follow up ultrasound. I did however have a fine needle biopsy today on the \"firmer\" denser\" area that I found but she said each breast is not always identical just always be awear of your breast rather then go overboard on each detail of them! So... my breast pain is very much looking like nothing or coming from a muscular source. Hope this might easy any anxiety in anyone that comes here searching.. but always see your breast specialist!

And for me now it's like is it just a huge coincidence that I have a breast lumpy then the other and the lumpy one is my pain side. It's been a few months of wondering what is going on. My gp threw gallbladder around back at the start two. Ysi my breast pain actually started first though. I had a funny ach for about a month or more before it became obvious I had a issue going on then the other stuff started, the elbow ache that has popped up with this is odd too.

      "Content": "Sep 7, 2017 02:59PM - edited Sep 7, 2017 03:14PM by Staceyatmiss Thank you for your response! Much appreciated I have just turned 30 so while I'm far from the high risk category I'm aware that there a small chance that it Could very well happen to me at this age. If my MRI comes back fine I will accept that Iv done all the right steps and hope it will allpass and follow up in a few months if still there. When I have read some things that other woman have wrote on here it resonates so much, for instance even the shower water hitting that area causes a sensitivity pain and my nippple can not stand the water hitting it at times. My husband can not even go near me most days and the searing bee sting just knocks the wind out me, when it happens I grab my boob and have to wait for it pass! One thing I'm so grateful for is that if this does all pass and all good I have become super breast aware for the future. Adding to... that my CT scan said that all lymph nodes were perfect, so my breast surgeon said that is a very small possibility that it might be a \"baby cancer\" hence why she has ordered the MRI almost 5 weeks from when I saw her.",

I understand your point completely... and I'm a little tired of docs not spending any more then a minute with me. I'm concerned on why I have a lot \"inflammatory cells\" in my breast! What is in my breast that has caused this response... and it's in only one so I'm now concerned as it won't leave or resolve. What am I fighting in there? Iv changed nothing... I'm not even big on underarm deodarent. I use that only if Iv got a big day and need to use that if that make sense... my worry is that this could lead to cancer. I'd love to hear if anyone has had this issue. I'm desperate to shake this! But I can not :(",
