Just a wild suggestion here but maybe if you look at sex/intimacy (and moreover orgasms - i.e. plural - i.e. as many as you can muster in one sitting - or, um, laying) as an act of healing (endorphins) perhaps you can find a way to enjoy it again.  I know it can be almost impossible to tune out the constant hum of cancer but by using endorphins to feel better then maybe you can sort of beat cancer at its own game.   Now, how's THAT for TMI?   Also, ((hugs)) because you're having a crappy cancer day.

Regarding alcohol - I have read that one of the best things women (and I suppose men) can do to prevent breast cancer is limit alcohol intake.  I just did a quick search and found this 2010 Medscape article:  Studies examining the relation between alcohol consumption and breast cancer have been decidedly mixed. But a paper published online August 30 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology reports that alcohol consumption appears to increase the risk for breast cancer recurrence.

Washington, New Hampshire! Nicole, I love your posts.  You have a great attitude and like so many others here, an excellent way of putting to words what I'm often feeling - i.e. \"persistent low level sadness.\"  Thank goodness it comes and goes.  If it comes to stay I'll have to look at other avenues.   Wishing everyone a good day with few or no side effects!  And stay warm and/or dry - wherever you are!",

My first \"official\" chemo is on January 2; however, I had my first Herceptin infusion on December  12, 2012 and I've had two vancomycin (intravenous antibiotic) treatments in the infusion room during the month of December so I feel like I've kind of had my \"start\" in December and would have definitely had a full start had I not gotten an infection in my right tissue expander.  In fact, my oncologist wanted to start chemo this week (last week of December) but his assistant said there was \"no room at the inn\" (her exact words) - plus, my first dose of Herceptin was so large (?) that in order to keep me on schedule with that they're starting me on January 2.   I'm far more nervous about this than I was before having surgery but reading all of your posts has been a great help!   My first Herceptin dose went well and without incident - just a little tiredness afterwards, a little bit of soreness in the area above the knees and a slight fever the next morning (very slight - and could have even been related to the infection issue versus Herceptin).   Yolanda, I would like to give that lady that walked up to you and said you looked beautiful a great big hug! What a wonderful way of reaching out - and I can relate to being in a city where you don't know anyone.  We've lived in the Los Angeles area for years but know very few people; however, I feel very blessed to have met one of our BCO sisters in person (since being diagnosed) and she is just great!  She's a triple-positive and we both share the same oncologist, in fact, it was because of her glowing description of him here at BCO that I set out to try to get into his practice, which had been closed for several years.  Wishing you all the best for the holidays and beyond!  ",

Good thoughts/wishes/prayers to everyone today!  ETA:  Sandra, I know I've said it already but I really love your haircut!  If my stylist was closer (she's 100 miles away!)

Also, Pbrain on the Triple Positive thread had some heavy-duty side effects as well.  If I recall correctly, her oncologist ended up changing her cocktail to one more suited (?) to her tumor size, node involvement as well (I think she was stage I as well).  I'm going to see if I can find one of her posts as well.   - 1.) Here is a link to Nanc620's post.  She mentions that her oncologist plans on giving her a 20% reduction in the chemotherapy medications.  She also mentions an allergic reaction:  http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/69/topic/797712?page=52#post_3406082 2.) Also, Moonflwr from the Triple Positive thread had to have some adjustments as well due to side effects.  Here's a link to her post mentioning it plus a copy/paste of it: Moonflwr: \"Pbrain, I mentioned they changed my chemo because I was so sensitive to it and it made me so suck with diarrhea and vomiting. I learned to stay on top of the nausea and didn't throw up after the first time. But by my third Tx, they had adjusted all my chemo. They start the dose based on body weight, but the adjust by sensitivity. So make sure you tell your mo ALL the SEs so if they need to change something up they can.\" http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/80/topic/764183?page=412#post_3298154 3.)

We have a friend who went in for out-patient surgery in Beverly Hills in the morning (single mastectomy) and by afternoon was out grocery shopping with her girlfriend (on their way home from the procedure). I had a double mastectomy on November 7 with tissue expanders placed which involves a cut into the chest wall so there's more pain and it's a longer procedure.   I was on strong pain meds (IV) in the hospital but by the time I went home two days later I was on Vicodin.  If your mom isn't having reconstruction and/or tissue expanders I would think Vicodin would be fine.  For the first week and a half I was taking the Vicodin about every four hours but I probably could have gotten by spreading the dosages further out than that.   Today I've had just one pain pill (two weeks out).   I'm assuming they aren't going to do an axillary lymph node dissection.  I really don't see how that could be an out-patient surgery.   Do you - or does she - have a reclining chair that could be used for sleeping the first few weeks?  I've been sleeping in a recliner every night.  We already had one in the bedroom and it has worked out great.  I'm a side sleeper and the recliner has kept me from wanting to sleep on my side - plus, it's good to stay somewhat elevated.  She'll probably be able to take Tylenol in addition to the Vicodin but keep in mind that Vicodin contains a form of Tylenol (I think?) and too much of that can be hard on the liver.  My first plastic surgeon gave me three tubes of Arnica Montana (homeopathic remedy) to help with swelling/bruising and I've been very fortunate to have very little bruising/swelling.  The dosage/brand was Boiron pellets - the 12c formulation.  I started taking them two days before surgery - no pills the day of surgery - and am still taking them two weeks out.  The starter pack given to me by the plastic surgeon included three tubes of pellets.  When she gets home she may feel like having crushed ice because her throat might be sore from the intubation.  Make sure she has tissues, the television remote (if she's a tv watcher) and her phone nearby because movement is a bit constricted at first.  I'm wishing her well with her surgery.  If I can think of anything else I'll post it.",
