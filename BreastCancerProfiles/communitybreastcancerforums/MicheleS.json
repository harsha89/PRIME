I have a big belly now and am wearing much larger pants.  My onc says it is the high steriods (every week too) and that it wil redistribute again after chemo is done.  In my chemo grp (the Feb 2009 starters), some have lost lots of weight and others have gained lots of weight.  Others, like me, have stayed almost the same but look very different.  I don't think there's any way to know where you'll fall 'till you do it.",

Anywhoo, I sleep (and other stuff when it happens!) in a pocketed tank top (from tlc).  I'll post the link below.  I keep in the poofy thing because being \"lop-sided\" is my biggest gripe.  I'm having a prophylactic mastectomy in Nov on the other side.  I'm opting out of recon for a couple of yrs at least. (I can't face figuring out what *type* of recon I want and don't want to go through a long \"process\", like TE, right now.)  Anywhoo, I'm hoping that once I'm matching (ie flat) on both sides, I can buy a few pretty camis.  I've never been the lingerie type anyway so *not* wearing super-sexy stuff isn't a change. I think that it is very normal to have difficulty with these things... Our culture equates boobs and sexy so it is pretty easy to feel \"unsexy\" when you are missing parts.  Just give it time... And, talk to your DH.  Mine was very understanding when I told him how terrible I felt about my body.  It didn't make be run and jump in the sack or anything but it did help with my comfort level.

Dx 12/08 uni Mx 1/09- no recon because the PS couldn't coordinate with BS.  Tumor was smallish and grade 3 so getting it out fast was a priority.  Also, I wanted a bilat and BS wouldn't do it... So, I knew I'd be in for more surgery later either way... Went for the immediate mx... chemo 2/09-9/09 prophy uni Mx- Didn't have recon then because I was still very sick from chemo.  However, didn't want to wait on mx because 6-month mammo showed spot to \"watch\".  I felt like I had a ticking time-bomb strapped to my chest.  So, went for mx w/out recon for now. 12/09 to present- Been exercising and eating right to get my strength back. 6/10- ovaries are coming out. I'm just now exploring options for recon.  I have an appt next week with a local PS and an appt in NOLA in a few weeks for a consult. I haven't figured out *if* I even want it.  I like being able to exercise without pain. xxoo",

It is best if you can stay distanced from little kids for 24 hrs or so.  For instance, I try not to hold my daughter on my lap.  Generally, I try to get the 1st appt of the morning and then go to work after! LOL!  I'll expose my co-workers! (They aren't on my lap anyway. ha ha!) Finally, the 1st few times you pee, flush twice.  I have a friend who is a radiation safety officer and he told me that.  The radiation is ultimately cleared through your kidneys and into the urine (before it ultimately decays to nothing) so it help to wash that stuff out of your potty.  (It would only be radioactive for a day or so anyway because of the half-life... Oh-- and drink tons of water both before and after.  It will help your body drive down blood glucose while you are fasting and will help you clear the radiation after. good luck!!",
