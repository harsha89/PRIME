He/she must feel there is no down side to your waiting several weeks for surgery.  If it was the States, the Onc would have you scheduled right away.  With BC, the oncs, don't mess around here.  They know the patients are already quite nervous and distraught and they want to do everything possible to get them calm in preparation for surgery.",

He was very sensitive to my issues and readily prescribed anti-depressants, recommended a therapist, and most importantly reminded me of all my love support.  You, too, must re-connect with your loved ones. We are strong, we are women all sharing the same pain, same thoughts and hopes.  I'm not sure of your belief system, but I found meditation and prayer very helpful.  The hospital onc nurses kept in touch with symposiums, group meetings and just feel-good gatherings.  Don't be afraid to reach out to others in your home town going through the same issues.  There are many of us.  And many of us who have a strong will to survive and beat this beast known as Cancer.  Be blessed Sueps.",
