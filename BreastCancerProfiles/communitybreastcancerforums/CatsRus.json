I'm in Canada and when the doctor wants me to have a mammogram, the appointment is made for me and I get a call with the date and time, for other imaging tests, eg a bone density test, my doctor gives me a signed sheet and I have to call the imaging clinic and book my own appointment, then for blood tests the doctor gives me an order sheet of what he wants and I just go along to a clinicand wait my turn. How would anyone know all this if they didn't ask!! I hope all is well and your results are benign. Good luck to you and ask all the questions you want, especially here. Be well! ((Hugs)) ",

One is far away. The worry of having to tell them was the worst! I finally did tell them on Monday...very hard but they seem to be doing okay. Bit more worried about the one who is far away though..... My stomach has been in constant knots, but I found this forum very helpful and that it helped calm me somewhat.

There were also tissue changes in the breast, including microcalcifiations that were reminiscent of those found in my 'cancer' breast 5 years before my cancer dx.

Having said that, I had a donation of 62 wigs for a charity and washed them all in regular shampoo and hung them to dry on a hat display stand....they came out great too - I brushed every one of them so I know! Not so sure I'll buy more of the special stuff for my own now! I put the shampoo in the sink with warm water and swished the wigs back and forth gently, then rinced really well.

Glad you like it the colour, I hope I like it too when it grows more, it's freaking me out a bit at the moment, even though it is what I expected. I really don't want to go back to colouring it. I've been putting a concoction I read about somewhere on my head... equal parts coconut oil, vitamin e oil and castor oil. Not sure if it's doing anything but at least I feel like I'm doing something. I'll start taking photos next week.

When I happened to mention in the course of conversation that I helped out is charity with shipments of humanitarian aid, she sorted out a bunch to donate. DH and I washed and delivered them. The wig boutique also loaned me the hat display stand to help with the drying. The owner is awesome",

Hardest thing for me was telling my adult daughters, especially one who is a long way from 'home'. I think I worry more about how they are doing than I do about myself. I lost my mom in Janary at 94 years of age. There's no history of BC in the family that I am aware of. Not the best start to the year, that's for sure. Glad you got good news today and I am keeping my fingers crossed my lymph nodes are clear too.. they apparently look good on the US but I'm preparing for the worst while hoping for the best. I think I'll have to try and get myself some of that Xanax... or wine.... or both ;-)",

That was 12 months ago - last Sunday was anniversary of Dx and this Saturday anniversary of being cancer free.",
