It is much easier that way. I am a bit achy today, but I'm doing well. I walked 2 miles on Thursday and Friday. I mainly want to say this. . . Get started. The fear of starting was much worse than the reality. That was how I felt about surgery, too. The unknown is too difficult. Keep us posted.",

I am very nervous and would love to find a group of people who are also just beginning their treatments. I've read posts from others who had treatments at the same time and the support seems to be very helpful. I have found that I crave connections with those who understand. I had a low grade tumor and was very hopeful for no chemo. My oncotype dx came back last week and it was 23. After a doubler mastectomy and TE in Dec., I was feeling good and ready to get back to my regular life. Didn't happen YET! As much as my family and friends have been amazing, they can't truly understand. Anybody interested?
