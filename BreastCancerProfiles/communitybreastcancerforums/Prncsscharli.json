That being said I am 25 and a mother of 3 children, which makes this all the harder for me to be strong for them as well as me. I have noticed a change in my left breast over the last few months... First it was the size of my breast seemed larger and facing lower than the right breast. It no longer fit into most my bras and just seems fuller than the right and spills over the cup. Then I was noticing some discharge and a purplish color around and on the nipple. Lastly I have been experiencing a pain in my left armpit and a very small lump/bump that doesn't move wen pressed and it's VERY tender to the touch. I've had the pain for quite some time but never noticed the lump before my shower tonight. I am going to make a dr appointment tomorrow (hopefully) but I just need to know that I'm doing the right thing and not over reacting Log in to post a reply",
