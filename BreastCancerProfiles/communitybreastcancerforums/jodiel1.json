She`s had 2 ops mx in september and then all her nodes removed end of oct, still waiting for the results to see how many lymph nodes were involved. I agree with many of you that say its horrible when other people say \" thank god my nodes weren`t involved\". i hoped she would have neg nodes but she`s got 1 out of 2 so far and will find out friday if there was any more. i dread it, its all the waiting around for the next lot of results that drives me mad. i suppose if there are move nodes involved there will be more tests to be done? Its really encouraging to read posts with people going strong years after dx with possitve nodes x",

They have said she will be having chemo,so i suppose that will start soon. It`s such a long jurney isn`t it? x",
