Here's my 'two cents\": On chemo /steroid induced constipation:   Take one (or two if needed) rounded tablespoon of metamucil in 8oz of water or juoce every day at the same time everyday.  Start Miralax 17mg in 6-8 oz of water/juice the day before chemo through Day 7 - or until your \"normal\"... you can take more of this if need be.  Start colace twice a day, the day before chemo through Day 5 or so. Take ativan 0.5mg every six hours - start the night before chemo and take through the \"crummy\" days  --- through day 5 for me.   and use anytime you are feeling scared or anxious ot having trouble sleeping at night.   It also helps with nausea.  Take anti-nausea meds aournd the clock ,- I was on zofran every six hours on day 1 through day 4.  If the antinausea med isn't completely relieving the nausea, ask for another med - there are many choices. Heartburn is common - Prilosec OTC for the duration of chemo. Keep a journal of side effects - report all of them to your oncologist AND chemo nurse.  There are many interventions to relieve those side effects.  Your chemo nurse is your lifeline through this -- contact her/him with any concern.  I had my chemo nurse's work email -- I only used it on occasion-- that connection provided reassurance that what I was experiencing was normal.  If anything needed to be reported to my oncologist, she emailed him and he called within hours...sooner if need be...   Know you will get through this,,,,",

I haven't read much of the hormone boards, and I don't mean to sound judgemental, but I think once you get all the way down the road of bc to the hormone blocker phase, I wonder if people who have complications or SEs are more likely to post..... those who have no problems, prob don't have the need to seek out info or use this as a support group ---  very different from the chemo/radiation phase where the fear/anxiety and need for support are so universal among all of us. lisalisa: thanks for starting the May 2009 Rads thread -- I'll be there. KM47: YEAH!!!    Like they say in the movies, \" There's no place like home\" .  Hope your DH get's better before his long flight home.  Grandma Patti;  hope you are feeling well and enjoying that new babe. And my vision is weird --  sometimes it's crystal clear and sometimes it's fuzzy - that, coupled with the tearing makes it a challenge.    Plan to ask when to have my eyes checked after chemo.",

Take care everyone!",

I \"gifted\" my med onc today by signing up for the bisphosphanate study.  He was so excited that I would consider it. (We were both disappointed that my oncotype DX score was too high for the TailorRx study). I passed my dental exam and had my teeth cleaned ( that felt great!).. Think all that yucky biofene really paid off.   So, a few lab tests, a physical exam and I am ready to be \"randomized\" (almost sounds obscene).    I will start the drug in about two weeks.    Patti and Phyliss:   Hang in there -- It is JUNE!  Soon you'll be on the other side.  ",

Phyllis, I laughed and your pills throughout the day plan.   I have a little jar I take to work -- and munch on pills all morning!  Holtbolt: Hope your appointment well.  Is this your ziplining weekend?  Stay safe and fly like the wind. jillyG:  Still eating turkey?   sounded so good Ii made a turkey breast this week.   Our Thanksgiving is a ways off.   Although I try to be thankful every day ...  lots to appreciate these days -- esp the cancer-free part. Renrel:  I love your DS stories.  I'm planning a birthday party for mine next weekend - his 21st.  The years have flown by... I cherish those little boy memories.   Thanks everyone for the birthday wishes.  It was a wonderful day...a whole new perspective on getting older -- what a beautiful thing!   My brother-in-law hosted a surprize party for me -- he had two heart valves replaced emergently a year and a half ago - he understands the joy of celebrating another year of life!   Both my brothers called. My son called -- taking a break from studying - music to a tuition-paying mother's ears!  My workgroup got a cake for me - they are so very supportive of me. I am truly blessed. And --- no wig all week!    The CEO of our hospital has been asking for a while if my wig is my real hair ( I had a really great wig) -- I have been saying, \"Trust me, you'll know when it's my real hair!\"  Tuesday he came into our morning meeting and said, \"I like the look!\" -- Told him he'd know!  And get this---- now keep in mind I work in a small hospital (everybody knows everybody's business) and every day this week, someone has come up to me and said they didn't know about my bc.   I loved the one who said, \"Wow. you cut your hair so short!\"   to which I said, \"Actually, it's pretty long now.\"    It has been good for a few more hugs and words of support.... think I have more energy for that now than early on...esp now that i have beat this beast! Well, I hope you all continue to do well. ",

I am not crazy about surgery on the radiated tissue. I have to say, my reaction of near panic took me by surprize.  In my head I knew this was likely nothing, but it took a while to get myself to a calm state and convince myself not to worry until I had something to worry about,   Then I was emotionally drained for two days.    Guess I am not a resilient as I once was..... So, it seems for a few weeks every sixth months for the rest of my life, I will need to deal with the anxiety of surveillance -- wonder if there are any refills left on the ativan from the chemo days,,LOL!  Overall, I feel good, a few aches and hot flashes..all manageable.  I hope you are all well.",

If I can ever figure how to post pix, I will. Only two more radiaton treatments... it has gone by quickly and my skin is holding up well.  And after 4200 miles of travel, so is my butt! LOL!!!   Looking forward to having that chunk of time back every day. Saw a genetic counselor today.   I was diagnosed just as I turned 51. Because it's close to 50 - the arbitrary cutoff age to define \"young\" bc - and I likely started developing the abnornal cells well before then, she suggested testing for that reason alone.  My mom had bc at 55, an aunt in her 60s......not a strong history of other cancers, so interestingly, that did not contribute much to her recommendation.   She said if I was BRCA1or2 were positive, my brothers and my son should be tested as they would have a 50% risk of carrying the mutation -- If they are postive, they have a greater risk for breast and prostate cancer -- that was enough for me, they need to know as much as I do --- had the test today and will know in a week and a half.  Sure hope it's negative. Small world story: As my genetic counselor and I talked, she knew the specifics of my tumor - that it was Stage 1, small and detected early.  It was Grade 3, and \"messy\" (that's what my rad onc said) as there was one defined IDC, three areas just emerging from the ducts in a sea of DCIS - so much that the patholigist had to look hard to find the IDC.  When I went to my first med onc appt -- the question arose - did I have one tumor or four.... right then and there he called the pathologist who evaluated my cells --- after two weeks, he clearly remembered my tissue and could explain what he saw to my med onc -- imagine that!   I told her how impressed I was by that and by the detailed work by the pathologist to get an accurate diagnosis-- turns out the pathologist is her father........asked her to extend my appreciation to him ... I bet patholigists don't get much of that...and yet their role is critical.  Phyllis: hope your LAST SEs are few Patti: Thursday is it!!   Will be thinking about you.... Soon all the Jewels will be done with chemo.   A toast to us! ",

FROM Lance Armstrong:     I returned to cycling this year for one reason: to fight for the 28 million people affected by cancer worldwide. We are making tremendous progress in this fight, but there's still so much to be done. By next year cancer will be the #1 killer in the world and yet most of the world's leaders lack any real plan to fight back. During my 20-day ride in the Tour I'm calling on leaders around the world to make major commitments to fight cancer worldwide - but I can't do it alone. As a first step, will you join me and sign the World Cancer Declaration - a major global push to pressure the world's leaders to act now on cancer? http://www.kintera.org/TR.asp?a=8dJFKVNyEeKHK0L&amp;s=7fJELTPCIdIEJTPvHjF&amp;m=eqIHLXNzEfL1F As an added incentive, a donor has pledged to give $30,000 if we can collect 30,000 signatures before the end of the Tour. I'll send these signatures to world leaders after the Tour de France and pressure them to make cancer a priority in their own countries. It's our best chance to push for better treatment, more funding for cancer research and access to care for everyone around the world. Without your commitment, these leaders won't pay attention. Will you sign the declaration then ask your friends and family to do the same? When you sign the declaration, you'll be able to dedicate that action to a cancer survivor or caregiver who has inspired you. I dedicated my signature to my mom, who stuck by me - and fought alongside me - throughout my cancer fight. Who will you dedicate yours to? We'll be keeping you updated on our progress over the coming weeks - meanwhile, join me at LIVESTRONG Action and make your commitment now: LIVESTRONG, Lance and the LIVESTRONG Action team",

Holbolt:   Tony Randall!!!   He could be one lonely man with that kind of comment. Well I emailed a raft of questions to my onc for their case review -- me being the \"case\".   This is the bottom line.... being BRCA2 positive, and having had chemo and rads... they don;t really know my risk..  He said I got the right chemo and \"more than enough of it\".   There was not one onc in the meeting that would recommend Bilat Mastectomies right now ... I am chemoed and radiated, and estrogen blocked .. I am good for now.  He is more concerned with the cancer I already had, not the one I might not ever get.  He wants me to recover from treatment fully. I do need to get my ovaries out within the next six months -- that and the Arimedex will decrease my risk of a new bc .   I will get mammography and MRI annually -- either staggered or at the same time ( some research is saying it's good to do them at the same time and look at them side by side).  He will leave the decision about Bilat mastectomy to me... however it is not recommended for 6-12 months after rads (and TE with implants is not an option on the radiated side).   So I'd be looking at tissue transfer of some sort if I opt for that.   So I figure the more oreos I eat in 12 months, the bigger boobs I might get????  Actually, I will do just the opposite -- eat well, exercise, get rid of some stress, stay positive and hopeful and be grateful for every day.  I am so grateful for my oncology team.... my onc emailed me the very same day they conferred about me.   Before this, I called the NP at the breast cneter - the one who helped me through the diagnosis phase-- to ask about plastic surgeons and options for reconstruction... she talked to me for about an hour.  She is also going to present my case at the breast center review meeting-- some of the same people will be there.  Her questions are targeted at the best intervals for surveillance both me and my son (if he inherited the same mutation).  I am relieved that I do not have to \"do\" anything now.   I am feeling great, but I still need some time to heal - physically and emotionally before I do anything more.      This is a strange time --- I am so tired of thinking about cancer and treatment -- I just want to stick on a shelf for a while. Well.. enough rambling .. you'd think I was back on steroids!! Hope you are all doing well.     ",

Holtbolt: hope you are feeling well post-op!  Welcome to menopause - for sure. BerkleyKim: I'm on arimidex since May.  I think the side effect profile is about the same for all the AIs.  aches, hot flashes and fatique -- I had all three, but the good news is, they have all subsided significantly with time.  I am in the bisphosphanate trial - ibandronate every morning.  There are few SEs with this.. a little upset stomach, but I just drink more water with it and that helps. It is a little inconvient to have to take it on an empty stomach, first thing in the morning and not eat anything for 30-60 minutes afterward....and you have to stay upright for at least 30 minutes after taking it.    But it's becoming part if my routine.  As I understand it, the AI is at least as important - if not more important than chemo in decreasing recurrance and the ibandronate is protecting my bones from mets. So I can live with the SEs and let's face it, these SEs are still way better than chemo SEs!  Enjoy the rest of the summer!  ",

My rad onc believes I should get a bilat mastectomy and eliminate the risk as much as possible.  That was after talking with three med oncs ( they will be involved in the care conference next week).  He also says radiation does not contribute to increase risk for bc - the genetic mutation is a faulty protein meant to repair cancer cells, and doesn't effect tissue healing related to radiation.. so that was good news.  He also believes the radiation will not limit my reconstruction options -- but that is best answered by the plastic surgeon.   I need to wait 6 weeks post radiation to have surgery. He also talked about a recurrence or new breast cancer as a very ominous finding and my long term survival rate declines dramatically if that happens.  I'm going to wait to see what my med onc says.... will setup the OB/GYN appt and plan that surgery... and get myself psychologically prepared for bilat mast, as that is what I suspect will be recommended. My DH is furious about the course of my care and having a lumpectomy and rads for absolutely no reason.  And why didn't they look for the hereditary cancer sooner.  Have to let him process this in his own way.   I feel I made the best decisions with the information I had.   Getting hereditary cancer at age 51 is unusual and my bc family history is not strong.   Seeing the genetic counselor at the beginning would likely have altered the course -- I can't go back, no sense spending energy with that -- move on, get through it, plan for the future. ",

I may never have cancer again..... I am not mentally ill, disabled or have a chronic disease.   I have a great job ( with great health insurance), a great family, and I want for nothing.   I endured a tough 8 months, I am stronger for it.   My priorities have changed -- the little insignificant cr@p doesn't matter anymore.    I do worry this will come back, moreso since the BRCA came back positive -- it is downright scary to think about a recur or new bc.  I'll do what I need to right now -- arimidex, oophorectomy, imaging and clinical exam every 6 months.....and try like heck to not stress out every 6 months.    Oh yah, and keep my stress under control and eat right and exercise.   This week I got a call from my breast surgeon -- out of the blue - haven't heard from her since she called with my path report in Nov.  She wants me to come in for an appt to plan my surveillance and exams. The breast center I am connected with has weekly care conferences, and the NP that coordinates the center has kept my case on the agenda.  So my surgeon called to offer to  be the person examining me every 6 months -- I am so reassured by this -- she only does breast surgery, so if anyone is going to detect something, it's going to be her.    Well Jewels, good to hear from everyone.  As always, thanks for \"listening\". ",

Today I return from what I will call \"cancer immersion\" --- I attended the FORCE (support group for BRCA carriers) annual conference.   I learned so much ---- when they say knowledge is power - they are right.  I feel so much better about my decison to do surveillance and not PBM.   I met with experts in BRCA -- medical geneticists, researchers, plastic surgeons -- all who fully understand hereditary cancer.   The leading researcher told me I have about a 15% risk of getting a new primary ( far less than the ususal quot of 85%) because my family history is slim on cancers and I AM OLD!!!!    God, I love being OLD!!   And both of the medical geneticists told me my chemo and radiation pretty much wipes the slate clean of mutant cells...of course that can change with time, but for now it's a good thing.  And one of the breast surgeons I met with told me not to even consider mastectomy unless I get another primary -- because my risk is low... and because I AM OLD  (YEAH!!!!) if I get a cancer, it will likely be like the cancers that OLD LADIES get -- slow growing, easily treatable.   Now, when a plastic surgeon, who clearly is invested in surgical options tells me not to consider PBM, I am reassured. I also met a whole bunch of wonderful BRCA ladies-- ladies who understand and talk and talk and talk about cancer and risk and how they feel -- and it was great.  Now I feel liek I can take a break from thinking about this.  Well,,, thanks for listening.... hope you are all well.",

I am feeling great,   Bought myself a membership to WeightWatchers and am 25 lbs lighter as a result.  Am eating good food and exercising regularly.    Am ramping up for the Relay for Life in June... of course I will be carrying you all with me again.

My best defense is hand washing.  I also use copius amounts of alcohol hand gel and antibacterial wipes.   I am a nurse and work in a hospital.  Most people think hospitals are \"sterile\"; in reality they are breeding ground for bacteria.   If you find yourself hospitalized, make sure every single person who comes in your room washes their hands or uses hand gel every time.   Get a bottle of hand gel for your own use in the hospital.    For you teachers ( and God bless everyone of you for tending to our children) - this is great opportuniy to educate your students... They need to understand they need to cough and sneeze in a kleenex - this significantly reduces spray.  They also need to learn to wash their hands for at least 30 seconds - the time it takes to sing their ABCs.   I do not think it is out of the question to ask the parents to supply a box of tissue and a bottle of hand gel for each student ---if they truly cannot afford it,  when someone says, \"Let me know if you need anything?\" tell them tissue and hand gel.   Maybe your Public Health department can help provide this - they are all about prevention.    Also tell parents to keep their children home when they are sick. Day 18 for me -- rollercoaster of emotions - I shed about 1/3 of my hair in the shower this morning.  Called my stylist and got it trimmed to 1/2 inch -- just couldn't go the bald is beautiful look.  My hair has always been a challenge - it's fine and straight -- needs lots of \"product\" to look good,  So today, I wore my wig to work for the first time.   My wig consultant did a great job in matching my color.  My close associates knew it was my wig, but my casual associates ( most don't know of my BC) didn't know and complimented my on my new hairstyle.....   depending on the person, it made me laugh or made me cry.   Now I'm thinking it is just plain funny...   i t was an emotional day for sure, more so than I anticipated... it sure makes it all \"real\".     My son says he's seriously thinking about buzzing his head for me - see me, crying again - he has wnoderful hair ( from his dad),  hope he doesn't, but how sweet of him. he gave me his Under Armour fleece beanie --- it is awesome - has a breathable soft nylon like fabric on the inside and light fleece on the outside - it is comfortably warm, but not hot.       And the day ends with news of a dear friend and co-worker's death. Ed was diagnosed with metastatic esophageal cancer several years ago.  He fought a good fight against this beast.....did his chemo on Thursdays and was back to work on Monday - smile on his face and twinkle in his eye. Never had an unkind word for anyone, everyone loved him.  He was a gift. He is who I think of and draw strength from on my crummy days.  I didn't tell him about my BC, wanted to  - to be connected to him even more closely  - but it didn't seem fair to tell him I had cancer that can be beat, when his couldn't. Say a prayer for his safe journey.    Tough day.. thanks for \"listening\".",

Insomnia has been a prob for me...ativan seems to work pretty well.. plan to take some tonight.  sometimes use Ambien - works good for 4-5 hours.  Tried Ambian CR - again worked good for 4 hours - then awake for a while -- then another 4 hours (just like the commercial) -- grogginess hung on til 10AM - didn't like that. Won't mix the Ambien and ativan - seems too risky to take both.    I think my insomnia is related to chemo and anxiety and being thrown back into hot flash menopause. I miss my HRT - but never again with BC. I get dexamethasone 4mg twice a day - the day before, day of and day after. Also get 10mg IV as a pre-med (with Zofran) the day of.  So happy to hear from those of you who are feeling better.   i am too, for now.  hard to gear up to feel bad again..... Hearing and remembering we do feel better with time really helps me. Thanks Jewels. today the hospital pharmacist (I work in the hospital - and this is the pharmacy that mixes my chemo) invited me to discuss my chemo.  He was awesome - went through my drugs and se's and was very reassuring about what I'm experiencing. He talked about \"chemo brain\" as a real phenomena.  told him I didn't really think I was having too much trouble  - then paused a second to think about it - and we both said at the same time  \"but how would ya know?\"   we had a good laugh over that....laughing is soooooooooo good. Finally -- SOME TIPS ON CONSTIPATION -   After two cycles with distressing constipation and a variety of interventions -- I saw a gastroenterologist today.  He is known to be a wizard with protocols for patients with chronic GI problems.  Here is what he reccommended:  Metamucil one rounded tablespoon in eight ounces of water or juice every day (may increase to twice a day if needed). Take this at the same time every day until through with the last cycle's side effects.  Miralax powder mixed with eight ounces of water at the first inclination of constipation.  He wrote a prescription for me as it is quite expensive over the counter (OTC) - some insurances won't pay for OTC meds, but luckily, mine did.   He also said the colace twice a day that I am taking is ok to continue.   He told me the fiber tablets I was taking are inconsistent in their results depending on where in the intestinal tract they open up and join with fluids - metamucil is more consistent, passing thorugh the small intestine and retatining it's fluid/bulk to help pass through the colon intact.  the colon's job is too extract water back into the body - metamucil holds the water, giving bulk.   The Miralax is an electrolyte solution that pulls water into the intestinal tract - also helping to keep things going.   He said physician's often recomend drinking lots of fluids, which only make you pee more --- the colon wil still do it;s job and extract fluid. he was awesone -- I told him I never in my life did I think I would keep a log of my bowel function!  he was grateful for it, as I listed my chemo meds and all my failed attempts at resolving constipation with MOM and fiber overload (FiberOne and mega amounts of fruit), etc..  Before that passed through, I felt and looked like I was 7 months pregnant. Yes, this is one WEIRD RIDE!   Well enough of my steroid ramblings. Jan 2 Jewels - mimi07, AZStacy08, and eadsla --- I moved up one day to Thursdays, when my oncologist is at the infusion center.  If you are still on for Fri, I'll be thinking about you. To all the Jewels, whose names and situations I can't keep straight anymore - stay strong.  We'll all get through this.",

You have just been through the hardest part!!!!  I'd say she's \"too fresh out of medical school\" to have any freaking people skills!!! All oncs probably think those things -- most keep them in their heads!!   You did chemo -- you killed those cells -- you removed the tissue - you will take an AI and block the food source (hormone) from any cell that might think about converting to a cancer cell ---- you're doing a biphosphanate and research already shows that will additionally decrease the recurrrece rate - esp in the bone.   And you have an incredibly positive and healthy spirit!!!!  There!! That's my two cents!    And another 2 cents re: hot flashes.   I've been \"flashing\" for about 4 years - I took effexor (low dose - worked for a while, then I had to double it -- again, worked for a while..   Then started HRT (which took them away)... so I told my MD I wanted to stop the effexor ---- OMG!!! the withdrawal syndrone with effexor is pure h*ll.  I ended up actually taking the capsules apart and decreasing the dose by granules over course of 6 weeks .... Don't want to scare anyone -- but MDs rarely tell you about that possibility  -- it is worse with this type of drug because it's half-life is so short and it leaves your sytem so quickly.    What I find works for hot flashes is 1) regular exercise that increases your heart rate for 20-30 minutes (can't wait to get back to that) 2) sleeping in a cool room with a fan on  3) keep a bottle of ice water in an insulated mug at my bedside at night  4) using ambien for sleep -  I find I can take it as late as 2AM and not be groggy in the morning (I only use it when I am short on sleep a few nights in a row- it can lose it's effectiveness if you use is all the time).  Berkeley Kim: Thanks -- am feeling pretty darn good on my last Day 8!   Patti:  One more closer to being done!

Funny story -- As I've mentioned -- i work in a hospital - a small hospital ( everyone knows everyone's business and they talk about it -- and if there is no news, they make it up ----)  Well anyway -- most know about my bc.. but today, one of the doctor's made a HUGE deal about how good I look today and my hair -- what a great style for me -- how long have you been wearing it that way and  Wow, it really looks good !!!    There were about 10 people there - they all cracked up laughing -- he still has no clue why -- I was going to tell him that I am actually as bald as he is -- but patient care issues came up and he got busy.   Feel bad, cuz he is a really nice guy who is going to feel bad when he finds out -- but it was hilarious.....  On another note - I've joined our American Cancer Society Relay for Life Team - they needed a new \"mascot\" since our dear co-worker Eddie died from esophageal cancer this Winter.   We had a soup luncheon fundraiser at work yesterday and I have all my pledge envelopes out.  I learned yesterday that I will get 2 T-shirts -- the one for participating and a \"survivor's shirt\" to wear for the \"survivors lap\" -- Jewels, that lap will be be for you --- I will put every single one of your names on the back of that shirt -- going back to day one of this board!!

Jess: Ports out !!!  That was one of my happiest days as well.  It's another milestone to putting it all behind. Patti:  WOW you are about 2 hours away from me.  Hibbing, the home of Bob Dylan!  Played in a tennis tournament there in high school.. that was a long time ago.  Hope you are having a great vacation.. it is a beautiful area. HoltBolt: I'm on arimidex and have the same foot pain phenomena.   They hurt and are stiff when I first get up, then onece I;m up and around, they don't bother me.   Hey, there was a special on Aerosmith on TV last night .. thought about Max and sure hope he gets to meet those guys. renrel: you have a very thoughtful, insightful approach to life.  You embrace mind-body healing.  And you have the weirdest brownie recipe I've ever heard about (with red bean flour!)  All the making of an intesting book.   Maybe ddlatt can do the cover.   I am holding up ...thanks for support about my genetic testing.   I got the printed report in the mail on Sat.  An interesting, albeit confusing, read..... I am not BRCA2 positive - I have a BRCA2 variant mutation which is \"presumed deleterious\" - they (Myriad labs) don't know if this variant increases risk of a new bc or ovarian cancer as it has not been researched, but they suggest  that I treat this result as is I were BRCA2+ if I come from a high risk family....which I was told I don't.  Now I don't know what to think......  Then at 7:41 this morning I get an email from my Cancer Center nurse telling me that my med onc wants to discuss the results with me - wow -- the results are hot of the press and he's already calling ---- amazing coordination of care...and very reassurring.   I already had an appt scheduled on Thursday as a part of the clinical trial so I will learn more then.  I am sure he will be researching this result and have a solid reccomendation for me. Of course, I've spent a little internet time on this test result -- there is a government website that lists all the BRCA variants - there are hundreds of variants.  They list the number of each reported by various labs -- only two people identical to mine -- always knew I was a rare bird!  Wish i knew what happened to them....   Will keep on -- one day at a time--  and hope for the best.   Like \"doable\" and \"cumulative\", I have added \"presumed deleterious\" to my list of annoying words..LOL. I think a sleep over would be great....I'm really good at pictionary.. well I used to be before chemo/estrogen deprivation brain. Keep on keepin on Jewels.....  ",

Had a visit from a co-worker who found out on Friday there have been changes in her mammogram -- 4cm something \"with it's own blood supply\".   She is having a ultrasound guided biopsy this coming week.  Like all of us, she is already going down the \"worst case scenario\" road.  She asked all kinds of questions about cancer, treatment, etc. Told her we would talk more - lots - if that is what she has.   Say a prayer if you will that she doesn't join our \"club\".  Thanks.",

By about day 6, you feel pretty good.   Each cycle is different - once you figure out which side effects, if any, you will get, you can learn how to manage then so you feel as good as you can.   For me, work was the distraction I needed -- I'm sure I wasn;t 100% every day, and I was tired when I got home -- which usually meant I slept well.  And part of me didn;t want to stay home and play the sick role.. If I had it to do over, I would probably cut to part-time during chemo, maybe work 6 hours a day and then spend some time both resting and exercising.  I've read (now that I'm done) that a regular exercise routine helps your body metabolize the chemo and it keeps your mood and feelings more upbeat and is just generally good for your recovery.   I found I was to tired after a 8-9 hour day to exercise -- but I think that would have helped.",
