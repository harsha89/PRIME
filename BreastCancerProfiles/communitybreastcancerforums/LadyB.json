They are really helping and I can tell if I don't do them.  It is always worse when I get up in the morning.  I can see that I am gaining range of motion each day.  I found a book that might help at the local library - \"Thriving After Breast Cancer\" by Sherry Lebed Davis.  It has many useful exercises.  My therapy is soon to end and I like having a reference guide.  You are not alone.",
