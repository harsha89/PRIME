I was told I had a 7mm \"complex cyst\" in my left breast at the 4:00 position and to follow up in 6 months. Due to my family history, my family doctor asked me to do closer to 4 months. My mother, maternal grandmother and her mother all battled the demon that is breast cancer, and I am terrified. My follow up is next Monday at 8am. Log in to post a reply",
