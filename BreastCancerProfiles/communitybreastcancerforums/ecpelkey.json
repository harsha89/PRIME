I did not see any regimens which we use in which 6 cycles of treatment were indicated. You can view our standard treatment guidelines for invasive breast cancer at the following link: http://www.mdanderson.org/education-and-research/resources-for-professionals/clinical-tools-and-resources/practice-algorithms/ca-treatment-breast-invasive-web-algorithm.pdf The various treatment pathways for invasive breast cancer will be found on the first 4 pages of the guidelines. Detailed information regarding the chemotherapy principles we use are found on pages 7 and 8 of the guidelines. Of course, each patient's case is different, and while there are no standard pathways listed which call for 6 cycles, it is possible that this may be appropriate in certain cases where a patient's physicians feel that extra treatment cycles will offer a more optimum treatment outcome. Our breast cancer specialists would typically offer a treatment plan that is based on the specific needs and circumstances in a patient's case; this may reflect a standard treatment pathway, a variation of one of those pathways, or something totally different, including a clinical trial. You may wish to address with your physician the reasons why he/she is considering extra cycles of chemotherapy in your specific case. I hope that this is helpful.

I figured they would have mentioned something about parabens in makeup and things to steer clear from, but instead they talked about the potential to contaminate your makeup and the importance of not \"double dipping\" your applicators in your make up.  I use Bare Escentualls make up and have been trying to figure out an easy and inexpensive cleaning for my brushes.  The stuff they sale is expensive and I am not sure a daily cleaning will help the brushes last.  Any ideas??? My artist friend came up with a Chick Superhero character named NED.  She is supposed to be emailing me the pic.  As soon as I get it, I will forward onto here or a link or something.  Thanks ladies for allowing the \"vent\".  Here's hoping everyone has a GOOD week this week!!  I am chilling out and enjoying my kids.  I may even take them to Jekyll to hunt for treasures:) ",

I'll keep you posted if she comes up with something.   ",

I am wanting new pots and pans b/c the ones I have are teflon and I am getting rid of plastics regardless of what # it is. I have my whole pantry of tupperware that I am converting to glass jars, when I can afford to switch.  I have been switching to natural soaps and I don't use deoderant/antiperspirant anymore.  I am currently planning a garden to grow a few things organic.  I have been wanting a chicken coop for a while, even before my diagnosis.  I have 2 friends that have one and love their chickens.  My husband says that I am being neurotic about all of the changes, but it is happening.  Chickens and all...just wait:)    I had to laugh about the hair incident. Last night we went to my son's basketball game and there was a storm coming in and my husband was laughing because I was holding my hair on in the wind.  I wanted to tell you ladies about Crickett's Answer for a Reason ( I think that is it) anyway, they have funding for wigs and other things for breast cancer patients.  I am getting a wig from them in a few days.  My insurance doesn't cover cranial prostetics.     I have indeed missed you all.  I got in a bit of a funk and just didn't want to talk about, read about or anything breast cancer, especially since I felt fine.  Reality is back now and I realized how much I needed you all, b/c no one around me knows how to answer my questions or understands what I am feeling right now. I am glad to hear many of you are done or will be done soon. I am still waiting to find out if I end at #4 or if I will have 6 rounds. I am ready for the countdown. Goodnight.   ",

We are trying to squeeze in a vacation if we can before I start rads.  I am hoping to feel up for a vacation.  Y'all take care.  Deb~  Love the idea of St Augustine:)  Contact me if you ever want to meet up for coffee or anything.        ",

The blood is related to hemorroids (yep, feel them now).  As far as the menstruation, my system is out of whack from the chemo.  It could be onset of chemo induced menopause or I could bleed for a while.  UGH. (Can't I at least save some $ on $6 cardboard and cotton since I am spending it elsewhere?)  My counts were great and I am ready to go tomorrow for round #3.  I will get Neulesta on Wed.  As far as why I would be doing 6 Tx over 4 Tx of TC...originally, my MO suggested that it would be an option if I did well with the meds.  NOW, he thinks that 4 is enough, but he is leaving the decision to me.  I can do more treatments if I want to (WHAT!! Yeah sure sounds fun!!)  I asked him about scans and such to make sure the chemo is working and his answer was that I would get scans 6 months to a year later to make sure all was well (again, WHAT!!)  I need answers NOW!!  He said I have markers and each blood work order that I have had shows the level of proteins in my lymphatic system. It fluctuates during chemo, but as long as it is under 38, it is good.  My last one was 16.  (I didn't write it down and my brain has forgotten the rest of what he said about this....Does everyone else need to write EVERYTHING down??)  My brain is shot.  Anyway, has anyone heard this?  Josie4: I had to give up dairy while nursing my youngest since he had a milk protein allergy.  I was the thinnest I had been in a long time.  Of course, when I stopped nursing the ice cream was back and so was the weight.  I have considered giving it up again. I am trying to go organic but it is so dang expensive to eat healthy.  I am such a meat and potatoes girl and being southern...comfort foods are a staple for me, not sure about the raw diet.  Someone (a friend that was a little anti chemo) gave me the Hallaluyah Diet book about going vegan and and juicing.  The man that wrote the book is a minister that claims to have cured his cancer eating raw veggies and juicing.  Check out the website.  It is interesting.  I just don't know if I could do it, I LOVE FOOD.  CKK: Gonna get with you on FB.  Look for me.  I am NOT a gardener.  I grew tomatoes (for the 1st time) and bell peppers and jalepenos and herbs last year in containers.  I am wanting my husband to build me an above ground area to plant a few other things this year. I really have no clue what I am doing, but I have such an interest in it.  Do you do pinterest?  I started a board for gardening ideas there that has been helping me with planning.  I want to at least have items for salsa (which I love) and salads and a few additional veggies. BaileyBump:  The reason my husband says I am neurotic is b/c I am wanting it ALL to go. some of the plastics are 'good' plastics.  There is a list somewhere that found that discussed the differences in the plastic #s.  It might have been here.  I can't remember, I wil check.  No cooking in plastics, though!  I used to keep water bottles in my car and drink them later, but not anymore. If your teflon pans are scratched (which mine were) and there is heat, that is when the (cancer causing) fumes get out and contaminate food. RachelVK: I have had such an easy time with #2. I am scared #3 will be ROUGH.  My husband has to work straight through March 10-20 12-16 hour shifts at his company and probably longer and right now he is uncertain which shift. It could be night or day shift, so he won't be around to help and my mom doesn't think she can come back in March after all. I am scared I won't have help this month, although my friends have all offered to help out. I don't ask for help well.  And being normal helps me cope. My poor mom was here after #2 and I wouldn't let her do anything because I felt fine.  GracieG: Question, Did you ice your nails during infusion?  I have to say,  I went to see my cousin today while at the hospital (his wife gave birth to twins this AM)  and he said \"I really like your haircut\".  I told him it was a wig and he said he couldn't tell.  WOW.  THANKS DEB267!!  And his wife owns a hair salon.  Cool, huh??  Made me feel good b/c he is a pretty straight telling it guy and he is family and if it looked like crap he would have told me:)  OKOK...My steroids are causing me to write a book. Sorry.  Y'all have a great night!!  Round #3 at 8:15AM  Thanks!!  ~E",
