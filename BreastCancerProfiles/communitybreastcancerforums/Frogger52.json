I am a year out of radiation, I.ve been to the heart dr. 4 times, while. I have a blockage it's not enough to be causing the chest pain and shortness of breath. after my second echo the drs saw some changes, had some pulmonary testing which is showing restriction.

I have been referred to the university of Washington to their pulmonary clinic.",
