I am 29. Then wanted to automatically get a biopsy scheduled. They could not get a hold of her so I called my doc the next morning and explained everything. She said she would not approve anything until she sees the report. And would rather send me to breast specialist. So today she calls me and says that the report said that the masses are in the scar tissue from my previous surgery that had fibroadenomas removed from each breast. The two on the left are at 12 o'clock and adjacent. The one on the right is at 12 o'clock as well. Which is the location of the pervious ones. The report stated that they are probably fibroadenomas but they classified it at birads 4. So now I am freaking out again. The ultrasound tech told me she was 100% sure that they were FA. But why 4. Have an appointment with my specialist this Thursday. But after reading about birads 4 I can't help but think that something seriously be wrong. And I had no clue that lumps were there. My concerns were the 8 o'clock and 5 o'clock areas. And I am told at 12 o'clock so I am even more scared!Â  Log in to post a reply",
