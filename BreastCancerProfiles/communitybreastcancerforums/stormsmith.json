I just had a core sample that was DCIS non invasive Is that stage one or zero?. its half way from the nipple to the chest wall, on the inside. I'm hoping that the scar won't show and praying I won't lose sensation. My GP is urging me to get a lumpectomy; she also said I likely will not have to have radiation. Comments? ps any one out there from ritish Columia canada. Sorry for the typos, ut  the necessary key is stuck ",
