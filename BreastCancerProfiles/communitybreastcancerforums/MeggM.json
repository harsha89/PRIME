My sister was diagnosed with Stage 2B at 32.  My paternal grandmother died of breastcancer, diagnosed before age 40 and my maternal grandmother died, riddled with cancer, thought to have started in the ovaries or breast, also diagnosed before age 40.  Sister tested negative for BRCA mutations but we all know that doesn't mean a whole lot.  I struggle a lot with this decision but I'm leaning toward a double prophylactic mastecomy once the baby has weaned.  Thanks everyone.",
