Needless to say, it's made me kind of depressed. I have a couple of questions though - will they all fall out this time? Sometimes I feel them tingling and I'm pretty worried about it. Also, how long until they begin to grow back? I probably have just over half of them right now, but if I touch them, some of them usually come out =(. At this point, it's really only noticable to me, but I don't want them to get worse!!",
