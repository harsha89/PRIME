I forgot and walked out of the radiation treatment room with the front of my gown/top/wrap thingie wide open.  Fortunately I felt the breeze on the nether regions before I met anyone in the hallway.  I've gotten so used to whipping my foobies out I forget that not everyone wants to see them.",

I'll see what he thinks when he looks at the foobies on Monday.",
