My trip will be LAX: London: Stockholm, then returning from Copenhagen: London to LAX - so 11 hours + ahoy. Here are my tips: upgrade with miles where possible, biz class is worth it for safety and added comfort. Wear support hose until you arrive at your destination. Wipe down your tray and seat rest (germ traps). Avoid raw fish like sushi and salad bars (major germ fests). Drink lots of bottled water. Cruises are gentler than other travel (no daily unpacking), so please consider a cruise. River cruises like those on the Rhine and Rhone are flat - no seasickness. I will be in Basel, Switzerland in July (after my Paris cruise), visiting Lucerne and Zurich. I love Switzerland. FYI the Euro is down and cheaper than the pound or swiss franc. Altitude may bother you, so please bring meds. In fact bring all your meds EXCEPT - take a week off Ibrance, etc. per my onc's recommendations. For this next trip I'm taking a week off Afinitor. If you need to sit down, please do so. If you need a wheelchair through a major airport, get one. It can save you long lines of standing. Ask for help if you need it, and please travel with someone. PM me for any travel tips. I have been to many distant filming locations in my biz - happy to discuss.",

Here is a my favorite Lord Byron poem for you and Stephanie: She Walks in Beauty: She walks in beauty, like the night Of cloudless climes and starry skies; And all that's best of dark and bright Meet in her aspect and her eyes; Thus mellowed to that tender light Which heaven to gaudy day denies. One shade the more, one ray the less, Had half impaired the nameless grace Which waves in every raven tress, Or softly lightens o'er her face; Where thoughts serenely sweet express, How pure, how dear their dwelling-place. And on that cheek, and o'er that brow, So soft, so calm, yet eloquent, The smiles that win, the tints that glow, But tell of days in goodness spent, A mind at peace with all below, ",

Seems Oliparib is a powerful PARP inhibitor. I wish my Foundation 360 had come up with some mutations to follow, but it's vanilla MBC for me. I had my PET yesterday, get results and meet with onc next Tuesday, then back in the big chair on Wednesday for another ride on the A-train. I went to work today feeling better as this cough/flu is finally going away. Momatt - thinking of you and Dani - you both deserve only good things. Z- when do you add a med? (()) Claire",

Bone is almost resolved, jaw met is better, right liver met nearly resolved, but new left liver met. ugh So we are planning for Abraxane through Jan 16th (which is just shy of 6 mos on A-train). Next med will either be xeloda or tamoxifen. FYI UCLA onc said that the results of switching to Abemaciclib after Ibrance fail are still a little cloudy. So Abemaciclib is in my arsenal, but not going there just yet. And since bone resolution is going well with Abraxane, X or tamox may be a better. All in all, a one page report is good news. Bummer is yesterday after work I cracked a right rib. Really hurts when I take a deep breath or cough, but had X-rays today (I must be glowing in the dark), and onc said it's not related to cancer and should resolve on its own in a few weeks. My hair is hanging in there, so will continue with cold caps through Jan. Happy dance for all good scans. :))",

My TM's dropped by 1/2 first month and then 1/2 again second month and are still dropping. Do not be afraid, you can use cold caps and save your hair - or not. The SE's are not too bad, major one to watch for is neuropathy. I have a little in my left foot which was where I got some from Taxo-terrible when I was stage 3. No question this stuff will knock out bone and liver mets. Please PM me with any questions. It's gentler to take because it's delivery mechanism is via an albumin binder which is easier to tolerate. Antimicrotubule agents (such as A-train), inhibit the microtubule structures within the cell. Microtubules are part of the cell's apparatus for dividing and replicating itself. Inhibition of these structures results in cell death. Way kinder than any other taxane - fyi we don't get this chemo initially because it's more expensive and we know how cheap insurance is. :)",

I'm having a spine MRI on Wed. to rule out any C cells sneaking around, then see the radiologist on Friday.

My onc said I don't need a liver biopsy as they know I am still ER+/PR+/HER- and not a candidate yet for proton therapy to liver, and can't have rads again or try proton to jaw met. But I am a candidate for Abemaciclib like many of you who had Ibrance fails. Looking forward to trying this new pill and having a good run. I had 18 mos on Ibrance. Z - I can't wait for your safe NED return and perhaps persuading Japanese clinic to re-biopsy you there. (()) Claire smiling tonight",

I have been susisting on rice cereal, protein shake, ice cream and fried eggs for dinner - and fluids 3 x a week. lol Lost 12 pounds since my fall on 2/24. So I will try and gain some back. Since rads make me sleepy, it's been easier to rest. Now getting ready to walk a little more. Trying fluids twice next week to see how I do. BP still low, so I am using a walker as needed.
