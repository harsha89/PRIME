I am not very comfortable with my score of 12 like your doctor says cutoff of 11 for young patients, but two MO's I saw are against chemo. I want to treat my BC as aggressively as I can, and it was my shot going for a BMX, but I\"m not sure if it is wise to have the same approach with chemo decision. I feel I need to listen to the doctors, but still there is a nagging \"what if. Will get 3rd opinion next Wednesday and make a decision. Thank you for sharing your perspective!!!!!",

He said when deciding on a chemo decision, everything needs to be looked at, not just the Oncotype score.  Your BC size is small and medium grade with a very low Oncotype score, but unlike its favorable profile it acted really aggressively.  This discrepancy should weigh in heavily when you make a decision.  I'll keep praying for you...",

My friend's slides were not sent at all when she checked with Genomic Health delaying her case for 2 weeks. For mine, when I called GH after 2 weeks of waiting to see if they had sent the result to my MO, they hadn't even started since they weren't sure the block was IDC or DCIS... I lost 2 weeks too and it just added extra stress on me. So please check & check!! Good luck with your decision!!!",
