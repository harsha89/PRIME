She was 60 or so then.  Sadly my reasons for not doing it are mostly vain.  I don't want to have an even harder time maintaining my weight and I don't want my hair to thin.  Also, I am hate heat. I always joke I won't survive menopause.  My friend with BRCA did both surgeries.  She is miserable without her ovaries.  Regrets it. She is 43. I know my reasons are lame. If I had BRCA I'd do it no questions.  The only confirmed ovarian cancer is my 1/2 aunt at 88 on my maternal grandfather's side.  My mom's mother's sister died of lady cancer - my mom's words????   They claims it was vaginal; not ovarian - anyway she was in late 60s.  Then there is my uterus.  I had polyps about 5 years ago, they'd said they would come back.  Drs. don't seemed concerned=I don't like them in there.  I am going for an U/S next month. I will discuss my gyn. I guess I'd also like know if those who had their ovaries removed premenopausal - had as awful consequences as predicted?",

She tested negative for BRCA but she just did the BART test.  When her cancer appeared in her other breast at 57 I thought long and hard about a pbmx.  Everyone thought it was crazy.  Well 7 years later, this past nov. I was dx with DCIS.  I was some how relieved that my biopsy was positive, so I could now deal with it. It was stage 0 and I still got crap from friends for the bmx.  I can tell you this, if I had BRCA confirmed I would have done it.  I am glad however I waited for one reason.  Nipple sparing mast. have come a long way and luckily I was a good candidate.  Psychologically it made world of difference.  I am 44 now.  Seven years ago I wasn't sure if wanted children and I was running out of time.  I was afraid to get pregnant because of the BC risk and the hormones.   If I were younger, I may have done the pbmx and then had a baby.  Well, I ran out time-never understood how any could afford daycare anyway!   I am very content with my doggies. If you are comfortable with the added risk of keeping your nipples (and risk they may be lost in or after surgery), it may be something to consider.  One of my best friends is BRCA+ and she got  DCIS at 41 and then they found 5 small invasive tumors in her good breast during her bmx that didn't show up on her MRI, mammo or US.  So that bmx saved her life.  She was able to keep her nipples!  A really really good BS is necessary. Mine surgeon is the best but he doesn't do many nipple sparing mx and he still did an amazing job. Best of Luck!",

I looked into a pbmx 8 years ago when my mom's bc came in the other breast.  Everyone told me I was being a hypochondriac.  Well 8 years later, this past Nov., I was dx with DCIS at 44.  Even though it was stage 0 I immediately opted for the bmx.  I was almost relieved when the biopsy came back positive.  I didn't want radiation and I can't lie, knowing I had the best chance of good comestic results if I had the procedure done before any major treatments, made the decision super easy.  I guess I am glad I didn't do it 8 years ago, because I didn't know about nipple sparing procedure back then and I was fortunate enough to have them survive the surgery.  It is a added risk, but I can live with it. My question is - should I remove my ovaries?  Can it wait until menopause?  Has anyone else without a positive gene removed them before menopause?  My oncologists thinks it is fine to keep them and just have u/s yearly.  I think they will go as soon as I hit menopause. Thanks.",

My mother had it twice (she lives in Berks Co, PA).  So I can honestly say, when my biopsy was positive I was some how relieved. If it would have been negative, I am not one to get through the 6 mo check ups and waiting game.  I guess I knew it was coming and I just wanted to deal with.   All along I was told it appeared to be DCIS and it was.  I still choose bmx because of my family history, a close friends expereince and with DCIS I had  good chance a better comestic results if I avoided radiation. I know that probably doesn't help you, because you probably weren't expecting it as I was.  My close friend who was dx at 41, wasn't expecting it either and it took a bit of time to accept it, but she too some how got in -let's deal with it and get through it mode.  And we both had nipple sparing mast. and she is in love with her new boobs.  Mine look great too so far, I hopefully will get my final implants in a few weeks.  I beleive you will get in the let's deal with and move on mode also. I must say that mother's care was less than desireable in Berks Co.  She was dx at 41 with DCIS and then at 57 she was in her Dr. office looking at her mammogram and her Dr. told her it was fine.  My mother asked what some little dots were on the film and her Dr. said -well I can biopsy them if it will make you feel better with her bc history.  Turned out it was cancer in her other breast and it had been on all her mammograms for the past 5 years. At this point it was in 1 or 2 lymph nodes. Luckily is was a low grade tumor.  If she wouldn't have asked, it would have just spread.   She had bc at  41 - how could they not biopsy anything that looked remotely out of the ordinary?  My aunt had a tumor in the area by her ovary at the age of 85. Her doctors said it was nothing.  Now at 88, the tumor was so big it was pressing on her colon.  Now the dr said it was ovarian cancer.  I think he just assumed she was old and she die before it was an issue.  She is now getting chemo and doing great!  She is type who is always on the road and still goes dancing.  How dare he just dismiss that tumor.  Again, in Berks Co., PA. Now matter where you go ask questions and try as many drs. as it takes to you feel great about him/her.  Hang in there.  You will get through it.  I personally feel guilty that I didn't need chemo or radiation.  I had/have a lot of discomfort with my tissue expanders and I think some women have to start chemo with these beasts in their chests-suddenly the discomfort seems minor.  Best of luck! ",
