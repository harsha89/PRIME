My hormone status is estrogen and progesterone strongly positive. They said my HER2 is \u201cequivocal \u2018 so treated as negative which I don\u2019t really understand. I was told my cancer is IDC. My surgeon is saying lumpectomy which seems strange to me as I have been told I have very dense breasts so I\u2019m not sure what to do, My oncologist says chemo and radiation although she can\u2019t tell me what kind until they do testing on the lumpectomy I guess. It\u2019s all so confusing. I like my doctors but I have no idea if they are the \u201cbest\u201d as far as treatment goes. Thank you all for your responses it feels like a lifeline right now.",

I was diagnosed on December 11th and it has been a whirlwind of appointments and tests and I have stayed pretty calm throughout. Tonight is the first night that I am just losing it and I feel completely panicked. I have been looking at other stories and seem to find a lot of stage 0 or 1 and grade 1 or 2. I am not trying to diminish anyone's experience, I know this is a difficult journey for all. Its just that I have been diagnosed with Stage 2A, grade 3. There are two tumors in the right breast one is, I think, 1.2 centimeters and one is 1.4. They are very close together, and with the connecting tissue, they are calling it 3 centimeters. Now they have found three small spots in my left breast as well. I just had the biopsy today. The doctor felt that there was a fifty/fifty shot whether they were cancerous as well. So this leaves me really confused and overwhelmed. Is this cancer survivable for ten, fifteen, or twenty years? Is this cancer automatically going to metastasize? I know no one can answer these questions, but I would be very interested in other people's thoughts and experiences. I have two kids and I am absolutely terrified of leaving them. Thank you for listening. Amy Log in to post a reply",

Miraculously, I got the biopsy results on the left breast back in 24 hours and all three spots found on the MRI came back negative! I was so relieved. They scheduled my lumpectomy on he right breast for next week. Two doctors have advised a lumpectomy. I am completing open to the idea of a mastectomy and I have seen others here who started with a lumpectomy and then ended up with a mastectomy. I can live with that. Muska, in regards to my age I am 51, probably not much younger than most here. I just had my children later in life, so they are still young. I think I just want to have the lumpectomy to find out exactly what I am dealing with as quickly as possible. I know that they can't really stage me until they know about lymph node involvement. My surgeon thinks my lump will turn out to be smaller than my oncologist thinks so maybe that will change my stage. If the results are worse than I am hoping for than I am completing wiling to have a mastectomy. Does this make sense? I can see you ladies are all very knowledgable. I am so happy have found this space. Thank you so much for the support!",

This seems strange to me, but the doctor felt that he could do a better assessment before chemo changed my breast. I am worried because I am somewhat nauseated and also have pain after the neulasta injection, plus I am mildly claustrophobic. How long do you have to lie still? How long are you in the CT scanner? How \"contained\" are you, did it trigger claustrophobia for anyone? How long does the whole process take? Thank you for any help. Amy Log in to post a reply",
