      "Content": "Iamsaved wrote: I have been recently diangosed with infiltrating ductal carcinoma in the right breast.  I am planning on getting a single mastectomy with immediate implant reconstruction.  I have talked to a couple of wonderful women who have gone through something similar and both of them decided to get a double mastectomy to prevent future recurrences on the other side.  There is so much information and big decisions to make and the doctors are cautious not to overwhelm me, but I don't want to make a decision and later say \"If I would have known this, I might have done that.\"  First of all, has anyone else had bc on one side and opted for a double mastectomy and why; and, anyone that had a one-sided mastectomy, how was the cosmetic result?  I was told my breasts won't be the same and I will probably need a lift on the other side at a future date. Is there someone who could share their experience about how the second surgery went to get symmetry with the other side?  Would you do it that way again?  Are you happy and at peace with your decision?   My surgery date is December 1st.  I am trying to have a positive attitude about all this, mostly for the sake of my children and parents.  But I have to say, getting a surgery date was a bit sobering.  There is a lot of hope and technology for women with our diagnosis, but some moments are just darn right scary!  My prayers and compassion to all women who have to go through this.   Log in to post a reply",

It is a tough decision to make.  Sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed too.  I have to say, I am somewhat relieved now that I have decided on the single mastectomy.  Do you have the option of a lumpectomy with radiation also?  Do you mind if I ask how old you are?  I would like to hear back from you, if you don't mind, and hear what you decided.   I had my preop appointment the day before Thanksgiving with the surgeon performing my mastectomy.  I felt better after talking to her about things.  I am still not sure if I may return at some future date to have the other one taken, but I think that is all I can emotionally handle right now.  These are such big decisions.  Of course, my life takes priority over my breast, I think most of us can agree on that.  But it is part of your womanhood, your motherhood and your sexuality.  ",
