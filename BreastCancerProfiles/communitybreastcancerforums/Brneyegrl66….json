I know how hard this part is - tests, plan in limbo, keeping this secret, but it will get better. The emotional rollercoaster is still there a little for me over a month out from diagnosis, but we have a plan of attack and that has helped immensely. I have four daughters and struggled with what to tell them. They are handling this beautifully and we have tried to normalize this as much as possible in our family. We had a blue hair dye party for me with my daughters before my surgery which was fun and had a lot of laughs. We are gearing up for the head shaving party as well. What I guess I'm trying to say is that it does get better so do what you need to do to get through today (have a long cry in the shower, go for a walk, etc). I'm thinking of you and sending you a virtual hug.",

I found myself tearing up while getting ready this morning and then my favorite song came on Pandora and lifted my spirits right back up. I am scared of how I'm going to react to the chemo and if I'm going to be able to enjoy this spring/summer/fall at all. I guess I just need a little extra courage tonight so I can shake these nerves and get plenty of sleep tonight.",

They gave me three different nausea medications before chemo and said that should cover me for 48 hours. I don't normally have nausea with medications so I thought I'd be ok. By 830 that night I started feeling nauseas and took some compazine. Woke up before it was due with more pronounced nausea and it took about an hour after I could take the compazine for my stomach to settle. Then woke up two hours later and began vomiting. Called the doctor and got a script for zofran. Now I'm taking both and it's controlled thankfully. ",

I started taking compazine and zofran on a schedule as soon as I got home. Bone pain was worse this time around so I think I will take ibuprofen on a schedule too. Claritin by itself was no good. Today is the first day I started shedding hair. I thought I might get away without losing hair after I shaved it all off! Not to be i guess. Since my scalp is so itchy it will probably fall out a lot tomorrow.",

I promise that once you have a plan in place it does get better but until then...take a breath, go for a walk, take a long hot shower and cry it out. If that doesn't help - get some ativan.
