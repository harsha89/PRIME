Sisters here:) I hate water too lately, it's making me gag.  Soda water is o.k. And Fresca. I have terrible chemo brain, my week of chemo I'm totally foggy.  No brain power for anything except Pinterest & TV.  I had a feeling of relief when I shaved my hair, I hated it falling out.  I hate my wig, I wear scarves & cute hats - I'm working & I get compliments on my hats:) I'm seeing a lot of young ladies here, I'm 45, I am BRAC 1+.  I have been in a genetic program at Dana Farber for a few years before my DX, thankfully, it was caught on MRI. I love all your posts but I just hate this, there is a you tube movie called Pink Ribbons, Inc. and a quote from it is \"the biggest risk factor for Breast Cancer is being a woman\".  It's seems so true with our span of ages & dx's. Good luck & wishing you all comfort! Carol",

Take the Ativan or whatever they give for anxiety & don't feel bad about it you won't get hooked! Stay hydrated through chemo, seltzer w/cranberry was my go to. It's scary, this is a great place for support ",
