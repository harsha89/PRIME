My doctor recommended chemo for me and I went back and forth on it. I asked anyone I knew what they thought I should do. Well, I finally decided to do it. I keep reading the info I am getting from my doctor and the more I read, the more I think, \" Do I really have to do this?\" I wish you and everyone else in this group good luck.",

First chemo tomorrow but I don't have to be there until 11:30. I'm not an early bird. I am enjoying reading everyone's posts and appreciate all of the suggestions. You are all so positive which is encouraging. I never thought about what I would do if I got cancer. It came on suddenly. In June I felt a lump and knew I had to see the doctor. The radiologist and ultrasound technician both kind of gave it away. The radiologist said I had something \"suspicious\" and the technician said that life didn't stop because someone has cancer. She was very supportive and listened to me and I cried a little. I don't want to sound like a whiner; it's just that this is a lot to take in. Thank you for your support.",

I was sweating but then it went away. When they did the pre-meds (not sure what was in it) but I felt sleepy and kind of like I do on Nitrox at the dentist's office. All kinds of things were popping in my head. Then that wore off. I also got a free knitted cap which was very sweet of those who donated them. You could choose the colors you liked. So now I have one turban and one knitted cap, but no wig yet. They have free wigs through the American Cancer Society. All in all, it was not bad. Thank you for the encouragement. We'll see what tomorrow brings. Hope everyone is doing well.",

I went to my E.R. and my blood counts were low so I got some medicine through the IV and also some pain medication which made me feel so much better. I had taken a little tumble down 2 stairs and fell flat on my knees and stomach. I couldn't brace myself, just went down. X-rays showed no fractures, just bruised knees. I would say the worst side effect for me is the extreme fatigue. I feel guilty not cooking dinner but the family is making do. Nothing tastes good but I am thirsty. I know this treatment affects everyone differently but I'm thinking if I want to continue it. I want to have a good talk with my MO before I make the decision. I am glad for those who are not experiencing as many side effects. My cousin who is a bit younger than me and had uterine cancer a year ago is encouraging me. Take care of yourselves and I'll let you know what my doctor recommends.",

Today I woke up a little earlier and thought, \"Too early, I'm going back to bed.\" Got up in a couple of hours but I could barely sit at the table. Had some coffee and watched my favorite soap B&B and couldn't wait to go back and lay on the bed. It seems like that is the only comfortable spot for me. Anyone else like this? Then I kind of plod through the day. Thanks, ",

I have to remember to take that pill (Ondansteron) the night before. Do you have to take that? I guess it is to get a head start on the nausea. I am planning on bringing my Kindle (I have lots of free samples of books on there), I can play a few games like Cookie Jam and Candy Crush. Have to bring a Pepsi and a snack. The nurse who did my chemo education told me that some of the ladies call out for subs from Jimmy John's. Sounds like it might be a fun group. I've been trying to get the house cleaned and in order before Friday because who knows how I will feel afterwards. By the way, my husband and I traveled to Toronto several times when we lived in Detroit, MI in our younger days. It is a beautiful city. He loves hockey so we would see the Maple Leafs play. Hope all goes well on Friday. We can compare notes.     ",

My first infusion wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, hoping the next 3 won't be too bad. Then onto radiation, which I heard doesn't take much time but it is everyday (except weekends) for about 5 or so weeks. My 27 year-old son is a smoker and I've begged him to quit but he says he can't because his life is too stressful right now. I offered him a challenge. It was that on the day I lose all my hair, he would stop smoking or he'd have to shave his head. He said he'd shave his head. Wrong choice. I don't want him to get lung cancer. Maybe he will get inspired to quit while he sees me going through treatment. Good luck to everyone this week.",

I am 66 years of age who at the \"young\" age of 52 decided to adopt a child from a foreign country. Now fast-forward 13 years and I have a beautiful 15 year-old daughter who needs a mother (me). I keep telling myself that God wouldn't give me this beautiful child and then take me away from her. In June, 2016, I felt a sizable lump in my left breast. Uh-oh! Went through the mammogram and ultrasound and although they don't come right out and tell you, you know. I then had a lumpectomy of a 3.6 cm tumor, Stage 2, grade 2. Then the oncotype score was 27 so my MO started me on chemo but I hate it. I'm sick most of the time. If I could just lay in bed, drink Sprite and have no one bother me, maybe I could do it. It is very stressful. The only bright spot is that I'm losing weight like crazy because I can't taste. When the side effects started, I swore I wouldn't do the 2nd treatment but now I don't know. I'm scared too like everyone else. Will the cancer come back? What do I do?",
