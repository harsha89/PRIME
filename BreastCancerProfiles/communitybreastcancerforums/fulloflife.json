Before you start thinking my GYN is a bad doctor----I always asked him about lumps noted by me and by him during exam, how he tells the difference---he said that cancerous lumps don't hurt, fibrocystic lumps do. Every lump ever felt was tender. I also drink allot of coffee which years ago they wanted all to sustain from before a mammography. They don't adhere to that rule anymore. But coffee does cause benign lumps in the breasts.. Many doctors react aggressively to what is noted by tests and others do not---also many doctors have fear of getting sued if they misdiagnose something as not being cancer----so a mastectomy would be an aggressive approach to avoid being wrong too late. There is a new diagnostic test someone on this site mentioned that I think you should look into---it's called BSGI ( Breast Specific Gamma Imaging).  If you go the manufactures website ---www.dilontechnologies.com    you can find out if they use it in your area. There are only a few around the country. It's an xray that is so accurate it can distinquish suspicious calcifications from normal cellular activity and prevents many unnecessary biopsies.",

I'm one of those people that contemplates absolutely everything before making a decision but once I make the decision I don't back track. As they say 'the only thing to fear is fear itself'.  The only time I have ever had a procedure done was when I had a tonselectomy  while in grade school. I've never been on medication, not even tylenol or aspirin. And I've never experienced pregnancy----found out while in my 50s that I had blocked follopian tubes from scar tissue caused by ruptured ovarian cysts.  Never being pregnant put's me on the risk list for breast cancer but generally I'm in good health and eat the right food sources.

I read about damage to nerves, hematomas, scar tissue, etc....my blood vessels are visible beneath the skin now, I'm sure I'll be one of those people with a hemotoma and my breasts are very sensitive and the needle is supposed to go to the center of my breast to reach the site, then I've read about the computer miscalculating the exact spot the biopsy supposed to be taken from---and if negative the titanium chip the size of only 3mm will inside my breast for maybe another 20 years attached to what? my aging cells? How does it stay put during the changing breast tissue through the years. I once went to a dr that wanted to do a biopsy on my arm because he thought it was possible skin cancer---he charged $200 for the 10 minute office visit---when I left his office I never went back to him again---what was on my arm was normal aging skin and I saved myself from an unnecessary biopsy---I think healthcare has become a big money making industry and I just don't trust it all",

My first experience I thought my breast was going to come off and shoot across the room. I was hoping they would have come up with a better machine than the 'pannini maker' by now. But 6 months ago I agreed to have my second mammography and the results were the cluster of microcalcifications that radiologists look for. She recommended I have a stereotactic core needle biopsy done. I hesitated and instead agreed to have a 6 month follow up. This week had it done and the microcalcifications showed no change on the digital mammography. She is still recommending I have the biopsy under digital xray. I've read that 80% of such biopsys come back negative. The titanium chip remaining is also a concern of mine. I've never heard of BSGI. What does that stand for? It sounds as though you didn't need the biopsy after that test. I'm wondering if I could avoid the biopsy if I had that test.   And you are in my prayers too nancy",

Sloan and Kettering doesn't even have it. On the Dilon website they provide contact information to the sales representatives for each area and I called the person closest to me on the cell number they provided and she told me where each machine was located. Everyone should go to their website to find out if a machine is in their area because this diagnostic tool would prevent many unnecessary biopsies. I didn't write down their website location but if one types in Dilon Technologies BSGI in the search word you shouldn't have a problem finding it.
