It was the biopsy results, she said they were benign!!!  She didn't have the report yet but the pathologist called and told her that.  I want to thank all you wonderful women for your prayers and good company during the time i was worried and afraid. I will keep all of you in my daily prayers. I love that you are a wonderful family here. They will do a follow up mamo in 6-months, might still have to get the ductogram, it my primary requests it.  I hope you ladies would not mind if i pop in every now and then to say hello :) God Bless all of you women with courage, strength, peace, hope!",

Took about 4 day for it to really hit me. I gave myself 5 minute to cry and compose myself. But most of all it has kept me in prayer!! God is good and merciful.",

I hope i have explained this to where you ladies understand. Had a rough night last night. They said what ever it is that that the growth and ducts go together.",

      "Content": "cspiritl wrote: Hello everyone! I went for my routine mamo and was called by my primary Dr the very next morning.  They wanted to do diagnostic mamo and sono. It took 19 days to get the apt. i went this last Monday and after test radiologist came into room and was recommending a Sonogram biopsy. He said I had a 5 cm solid mass in the left breast. I am 52 and have been on estrogen for the last 3 years, for menopause. Which my primary took me off immediately after getting results from Radiologist. I have been doing some research until i go get my biopsy on this coming Monday. I was some what concerned until i came across a internet side talking about large solid mass possibly being Fibroadenoma.Oh I should also mention I have had liquid stuff coming out of my breast for years off and on. The day i had my first Mammogram i had bleeding from my nipple for a week.  So with all this said I have been very concerned, and hoping maybe someone might have some of the same thing happen with them. Thank you so much for taken the time to read my concerns.   Worried in Arizona :) Hope to hear from you all.. Log in to post a reply",

Are the biopsies very painful?  Thank you for listening to me ramble on..  :)",

But to add to this topic, i have lupus, fibro, sjogrens, and Reynolds. I thought the bad news for me was last year, when i was told my main aorta heart valve was leaking. But I don't thing anything I have been through this far has scared me more then being told I have a solid 5 cm mass in my left breast. My thought go out to all of you ladies here. I will be adding all of you to my prayers. So glad I found this site!!",
