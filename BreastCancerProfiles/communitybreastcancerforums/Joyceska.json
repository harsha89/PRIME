It really tires me out.  I am not sure if it is normal or not?   I had 4 treatments of TC and now finished 2 of my 4 treatments of A. Then comes surgery.  I thought they would keep giving me chemo till it disappears.  Now I know only 2 more treatments.  I do hope it is shrinking enough.   Joyce  ",
