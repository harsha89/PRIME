I was happy to read your experiences before starting my own treatment on August 24th and have it every other Tuesday for the next 3 months. I am only 18, but was lucky to catch the cancer early enough, as it hasn't spread anywhere else! I decided it would be best to take the semester off from school, and I know this sounds silly but when told this I thought, what am I going to do for the next four months?! I wish everyone the best! :)",

At the end of my exams last semester I found a pain in my right breast, and I noticed a lump about a year before but it would come and go. I monitored the lump for about a month but noticed it was getting bigger. So I decided to go to my doctor who said it was just a fibroid, but I told him I didn't think it was. So after going through an ultrasound, mammogram and biopsy they found out it was cancer, and I got a lumpectomy to remove it. Luckily, after another surgery removing more tissue they said that they don't think it spread, and I am undergoing chemo and radiation to prevent recurrence. I like your do it yourself idea! Maybe I'll go try the spray painting idea too and re-spray all the fences in my backyard. And hopefully I'll be able to see your comedy someday if you release it in Canada, but to be honest, I've never watched Jersey Shore. I watch Fallon too, but lately I've been watching Craig Ferguson (shallow television at its finest J ). Thanks for letting me PM you, I'm sure I'll have questions once I get started. wherria: Yeah once I was diagnosed, that is all I thought about was being off from school, and how I would make it up. After talking to my surgeon and professors they reminded me it is only a semester that I would miss, and not to worry. At the beginning I was worried about how behind I would get but they suggested to take the semester off and rest, and then come back in the Winter. After thinking about what they said, it did sound like the best thing. Thank you both for the support! Good luck again!",
