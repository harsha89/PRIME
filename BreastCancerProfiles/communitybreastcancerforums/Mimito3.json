I just received a new RX for 7.5mg of the Afinitor.  Have only been on that one day!!  I did have bloodwork done two days ago and my LFT's have started to really creep up along with my bilirubin.  This was before I started the new dosage.  My onc is already talking about taking me off the Afinitor but I think maybe the 10 mg was too strong for me and I'd like to give the 7.5 a chance.  I'm having a liver scan tomorrow (this onc isn't fooling around, that's for sure!).   Just wondering if anyone else had this type of experience?  Did you finally settle into the Afinitor or if it's a problem at the start will it continue to be?  Also wondering if Faslodex is the best choice for the combo.  I know a lot of people use exemestane (Aromain)  with the Afinitor.  I have mets to bones and liver.  This is the first time I'm afraid of the next step.   Thanks for any responses, mimito3",
