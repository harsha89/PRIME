I went to the Dr. a couple days after discovered the discharge. They said the discharge was milk and they did some blood tests and ordered an CT scan after they got the test results as something was very high for me not to be pregnant. They thought I had a tumor that were triggering something in my brain that could make my body produce milk(I can't remember what they called it, it was a weird word) THey found nothing and finally said that it could be the pill I was taking for my stomach (though I have took the pill about an year before this started.) I was off the pill for 6 months to see if the discharge/milk would go away but it never did - so I started taking it again as I can't go a few days without taking the pill as I stay sick at my stomach everyday. I was scared to death and I still am even though they say it isn't breast cancer. Anyways, what I am wondering, how would a Dr. know that the discharge coming out of my breasts is milk? My breasts are very painful(sharp pains), sometimes worse than other times. I check my breasts once or twice a month and basically I don't know what the heck I am looking for, my breasts feel weird to start with and feel like there's A LOT Of lumpy things in my breasts so umm I don't know what I am looking for. I went to the Dr. last month and she checked my breasts so my breasts must be fine. I am still worried that there might be something wrong that the Dr. is overlooking mistakenly. My female Dr. is a very nice doctor and seems like she knows what she's talking about, but I'm just wondering if I should get a second opinion to be sure. Thanks, Lacey Log in to post a reply",
