And I have a very vivid imagination fueled by 20 years of transcribing medical reports. It's all very clinical when you hear them talking about someone else. I'm not so hot on the experiencing it myself side of things. But I do admit my imagination far far outstripped the actual experience. None of it can be described as pleasant - but just keep telling yourself you can get through anything that's temporary. And there is an end, at least on surgery day. Wishing the very best for you.Â ",

You're being taken care of, you're taking care of yourself and everyone here is cheering you on. My advice? Stay off Google! You've found the best place - everything else will just scare the living daylights out of you. California requires doctors to give women who might have BC a pamphlet. I couldn't read the whole thing because it was scaring/depressing me. I decided to just take each day, each procedure, each phone call as they came and let God take care of the rest. Someone told me they don't have breast cancer survivor walks because so many people die from it. Look at the number of women who show up for those things. We live and you will, too.",
