I had double mastectomy with lattismus dorsi flap reconstruction in July '09 and I have never been the same since - severe upper back pain. They finally sent me to a pain management center and prescribed me Fentanyl which I was on for 6 months. It took care of the pain, but the side effects were horrible - constants sweats and chills, drug withdrawal symptoms every other day. I ended up kicking the Fentanyl cold turkey after becoming addicted to it. That was a rough week. OK, Now I've been off the painkillers a month and - i am hurting again. I have that bungie cord wrapped around the chest feeling - so glad to hear that this is from the surgery, I had convinced myself it was the cancer back and even saw the onc yesterday. The big problem though, and I don't see this mentioned in the thread - SERIOUS pain above and below the area they cut for the lattisimus dorsi flap, both sides. My back aches after sitting all day like you wouldn't believe. I have been told this muscle helps you sit up straight. Could it's removal be what's killing my back? Does it make sense that these nerves would be kicking in now? The area from the scars to the breast are also very sore to the touch.Would love to hear from anyone who has long term pain from the lat flap surgery -",

I can't tell you how many times I kicked myself for not going in for that second yearly mammo..Though they say it might not of shown anything. Apparently this was a sneaky fast-growing cancer.  And too I am shocked at all the young women here with breast cancer. I think when they do ads for awareness, they need to acknowledge the fact that it's not all middle aged grandmothers getting this disease - it's young moms with babies, young women who haven't even had a chance to be pregnant yet.

I had surgery last week to remove the lung lobe with the mass, and pathology determined it is breast cancer, again :( There was also cancer in some lymph nodes by the mass. I am seeing my oncologist on Monday to see what our next steps are. A PET scan and brain MRI showed the cancer to only be in that lung. What kind of questions should I be asking this time? I really don't want to do chemo again, at least not the brutal ACT regime - which didn't even work, apparently. If I have to do chemo I don't want it to be one that makes my hair fall out.

There is a blood clot in my thigh, where they went up through my femoral artery to get to my brain. Earlier in this week I was diagnosed with phlebitis in my arm where my IVs were from the hospital. So I seem to be clotting all over, probably from the cancer. The other bad thing - I'm no longer NED. There's a lymph node in the middle of my chest that has grown, has an SUV max of 4.2. My oncologist is not sure how to proceed. He and the neurosurgery team think the strokes are a bigger danger to my life right now. I'll be on Plavix for awhile, so chemo might not be an option.

I was kind of hoping eliminating this one would lessen the chance of it spreading more cancer cells through my body. Because of the location of the node (AP window) it might be too tricky to SBRT. He said traditional radiation might be an option. I really didn't want to go through that again... I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to wait around while this spreads, but I need to be on Plavix for 3 months which takes chemo options off the table. Very sad and frustrated.

If I had known there was a chance of insurance denying it, I never would have agreed to it. They were supposed to get it precertified by my insurance company.

The path report says they got the tumor, clean margins (since they took the whole lung lobe), but 2 out of 11 lymph nodes tested had cancer. He is classifying me as Stage 4 NED. He outlined 3 options for treatments. 1) Do nothing for now 2) start a chemo - Xeloda was suggested since I really don't want to lose my hair, and there are studies where Xeloda was used to \"mop up\" TN after traditional ACT and surgery 3) Possibility of trying an immunotherapy trial - but that would involve Taxol. He says my case is unusual, both because of the length of time to metastasis (7.5 years) and because it's a single isolated metastasis. There's no real clear cut treatment to follow here. He's going to consult with Dr Carey in NC, who I saw after my first local recurrence 4 years ago. He also wants to do PET scans every 3 months to check progression. Problem is my insurance, Cigna, will deny the scan as \"surveillance\" - he says it happens all the time with them. I'm trying to figure out how to pay on my own for a PET, but at 8K for each one, that's impossible. Anyone do GoFundMe? I hate to ask for money, but... I'm going to see my oncologist at the end of next month and see how we want to proceed - he wanted the PET done before the visit but it doesn't look like I can make that happen right now unless CIGNA surprises us. Any advice appreciated!  ",

I know what you mean, very few people know that I've progressed to stage 4. I plan on keeping it that way as long as I can. I met with my oncologist today and the recommendation is that I do the Glembatumumab clinical trial. Only 2/3 of the participants get the drug. The other 1/3 get Xeloda, which I was interested in because of no hair loss. It seems silly, but I cannot stand to lose my hair again. They're going to test my tumor and see if it expresses gpNMB, which is what the drug works against. If so. I'll probably do it if I'm accepted. But I will use a cold cap this time. I'm pretty unhappy about the thought of chemo again as I was so wretchedly miserable on it 8 years ago.

No new mets, nothing found in my hips. They're thinking the hip pain is sciatica. But the one bad node in my chest is still there and has grown slightly, a few millimeters, from 1.7 x0.8 to 1.5x1.3. However, it's still not big enough to be in the CDX-011 clinical trial! The smallest dimension needs to be 1.5 cms and it's 1.3 now. So I'm on hold until the next scan in May. Which may be in issue because my onc mentioned these trials close out once they get enough people, ack. Something disturbing happened yesterday. My 11 year old son told me he has a lump underneath his nipple. I checked it out and indeed he does, small but painful. I googled it and it's not that uncommon around puberty. But I'm taking no chances. He's seeing the doctor Monday morning and I'm going to push for some kind of testing. I just need to do this without freaking him out.",

They removed the lung lobe and it was MBC, 7.5 years after my original stage II diagnosis. I had clear PET scans for awhile and then October's showed an enlarged lymph node between my lungs. My oncologist consulted with several others and they said my best bet was to enter the CDX-011 trial for metastatic TNBC. However, my tumor has to be larger to qualify for the study. In December I started having hip pain. Saw my onc in early January and he ordered the PET/CT. Which insurance denied - at least the PET part. So we'll see if just the CT is sufficient, and if it shows what's up with my hip and that enlarged lymph node. I'd hate for the tumor to be growing, but I want to start some kind of treatment ASAP.",

My metastatic lymph nodes were finally big enough top qualify me for the CDX-011 trial. Unfortunately I got randomized for the control arm and will be getting Xeloda and not the experimental drug. I'm beyond disappointed. I've waited over 6 months to finally qualify, and I get put on Xeloda! If I wasn't trying to get into this damn trial I could have been on Xeloda months ago. They won't let anyone into the trial if they already had it. So now my untreated cancer has been merrily growing away, and the scan showed some pleural effusion as well. I start the Xeloda on the 10th.. I've been having issues I think may be related the the pleural effusion - intermittent shoulder pain, excruciating at times, coughing fits, every morning I have a fever of 99.1. Last night when I was working out I felt short of breath but not sure if I'm imagining it. I don't want to end up in the hospital. Hoping I can make to the 10th and start killing some cells ASAP! ",
