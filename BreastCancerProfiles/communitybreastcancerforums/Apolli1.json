Afterward I kept saying, i'm tender under the opposite arm close to breast. The sent me for an MRI and said there is nothing there. I can feel something there without touching, it feels like a bruise and I can actually feel something there now. I figured that if the MRI said no, then it was nothing but all week i've been having my period and it is the same, sore, tender and if I touch it, I can barely stand it. I start chemo on Tuesday but what if this is something. I told my surgeion and this has been going on! He looked at the MRI and said \"I have nothing on that\". What should I do?

My WBC is 2.5 and i'm worried they will hold my next Taxol. My first visit was the fastest because the teaching took priority and the meds were there and ready to hang right away. Lately it's been taking about 3.5 hours, at least an hour of that is waiting in the waiting room, starting IV etc. I go to a cancer center and it's a madhouse on Mondays and i've heard on Thursdays because of those who work during the week and want to be better by Monday. I find that 3 days after the Taxol, the steroids wear off and i'm just real tired.",

So to all working night shifts, please please be sure to take your Women's Daily vitamins with extra vitamin D.  If there is anyone here who is well versed in LTD, I am mid reconstruction and ltd is discontinuing my benefits as they say my choice for a second mastectomy after symmetry could not be achieved, was unwarranted. ",

      "Content": "Jun 23, 2008 10:10PM Apolli1 wrote: Taxol has been easy for me. I just had dose 5 of 12 weekly doses today. The premidicate with Kitryl (sp)for nausea, Decadron (makes you want to eat your own chair but only lasts one evening). And Benadryl which is stronger (to me anyhow) than any street drug must be :) It makes me SO tired. It did cause a flare reaction for me even when they slowed it down and I take it by mouth now which is much better. The Taxol goes in in just over an hour I think, it is 150 mg and I have had no nausea, no constipation/diarrhea, no numbness and i'm not sure if the shoulder pain is from muscle tension and stress or if something is settling in there. I'm not sure if it is related to the Taxol or not. I've read here that your nails can change colors and fall off especially in the last four doses. The only trouble i'm having is low white counts, all the rest of my bloodwork is normal now. There is also a Taxotere, could that be the drug you are getting? I sont know much about that one. Good luck with your chemo. There is lot of help here when you can get someone to anser your posts :)",
