Well I hope her and myself get to the bottom of this? Imight add too, if you ever see this woman again, that a lot of it is inflammation. Chemo just causes a lot of inflammation. Naproxen, which is a really good anti-inflammatory and has a pain killer added, really helped a lot. I am hoping if I just keep on it, it will totally clear all of this up. It hasn't yet. It isn't as bad as it was when I first finished Taxol, so I am hoping it improves totally within a short while. It has all been gradual improvement with everything, as you know. And WC3 thank you for letting me know what EMS is. I will ask my doctor. Hopefully, these exercises the physiotherapist has me doing will get rid of it.",

I am going to the Rheumatologist in a few weeks, as we think it may be Fibromyalgia. I had blood work done and an ECG to rule out other things. The blood work came back positive for autoimmune i.e., lupus. Now, it can read positive and not be Lupus, as I don't have the usual butterfly rash on my face and my organs are functioning ok. So, if you get a positive blood test and it is not lupus it just means most likely there is another auto immune disease going on here. Now we need to see what it is. My mother has Fibro, and she is the one that made me aware of this. So muscles and joint stiffness goes along with Fibro. Finally, it just didn't seem right to have stiff legs like this and muscles etc. so long after finishing chemo. So, this is something for other women to look into if they have this stiffness and aches etc. and there is no reason for it.",

I was on an anti-inflammatory with a pain killer for about 6 months. My doctor referred me to a rheumatologist, as we were trying to see if I had fibromyalgia or something else from the blood work I had done, which suggested I may have some sort of auto immune disease. These blood tests can be wrong and in my opinion may read wrong also, because of all the treatments you have gone through with the chemo and in my case Herceptin, as well. I was also in the hospital for a week under IV antibiotics for a reconstruction infection. The antibiotics were really strong and would burn my skin if the IV wasn't in right. A lot for your body to go through. Anyways, the rheumatologist said there is a low percentage of ppl/women that will get those side effects from the Herceptin. Because I was really healthy before all this started, she said it was treatment related and would go away. It gradually did. It has been 1 1/12 years since I have been off Herceptin now and 2 years since I finished my Taxol. I can say everything is back to normal. I am pretty limber now. Knock on wood. Watch me have problems now. lol I just wanted to tell you ladies on here, and everyone is different but you just have to give it time. Anti-inflammatories are not a bad thing to start doing. Talk to your doctor. I really think it has a lot to do with inflammation from the toxic treatments.",

I probably would have taken it, if I hadn't had breast cancer. School buses where the bus driver sits do have old heaters etc. It comes right out in your face as your driving. It is full of dirty dust and I don't think good. I just double think everything now. I know, which job doesn't have something? Well, nothing is perfect but I am going to wait for a clean office job or retail inside. It is just really hard to find employment where I am living right now. So, I was willing to take something that had me worried. And I am not putting that profession down. I enjoyed driving when I did. The little kids were fun. No one knows what really causes breast cancer. I did all the right things. Exercised, maintained a good weight, had a decent diet, got a good amount of rest. Still got it. It terrifies me to do anything that might contribute to a recurrence.",

So even though I was told it was not nerve damage, I feel something is going on with the nerves and muscle in the upper legs. The physiotherapist feels it is just a bit jumbled, my words, not hers. Trying to explain it. I have not ever heard of a EMG. Now I hope my doctor can understand all this. It gets stiffer with exercising.",

So... anyone not in that 20-30 % will never deal with this again? Most likely? My Oncologist said it is the 1st 2 years it most likely will recur if it is going to... and he said mine was very small. He seemed confident in this statement. And the surgeon was like \"why are you doing chemo, it didn't hit your lymphnodes\"? I guess I am hiding behind these statements...like it is giving me a false security. Anyways, I worry if I have a stomach ache or any pains, am I stressing my body to bring something on? If I do this..eat this, inhale accidental smog from a passing truck etc... will this be the trigger? It is hard living this way. The whole thing is surreal. I feel panic inside myself at times. There is nothing you can do to change any of this.",

You know the group, none of us wanted to ever be in. I do realize what you are saying and I do live my life everyday to enjoy it. I enjoy just being here, if that makes sense. There are no guarantees with anything really and if anything, it has made me start to get the things done now, that I just took for granted I would do when I am a senior and retired. Life is short really. This has hit me like a ton of bricks. We are not immortal and old age is not guaranteed to anyone. It still scares me though. It's a work in progress.",
