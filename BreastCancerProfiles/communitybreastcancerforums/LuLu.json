Make sure you get an ultrasound or MRI and push for a biopsy if you don't get solid answers. You look too young for a mammo to be effective. If you are under 40, it's not reliable. Not all doctors understand this. Make sure your specialist does and make sure they see you quickly. Be the squeaky wheel who calls every day or at least every other day until you get an appointment time and make sure it's within weeks, not months. I hope it turns out to be nothing and that you get reassurance QUICKLY.",
