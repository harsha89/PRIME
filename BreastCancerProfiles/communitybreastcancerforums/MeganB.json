We had the choice to do chemo or not, and we decided to because of the LVI. I am about to finish 4 rounds of TC--my oncologist said this chemo would be more effective than AC. I'm starting radiation and then AI's, and have been on Lupron since a month after my BMX in September. It's interesting how different oncologists treat the diagnosis---we got 4 opinions, and 2 oncologists said definitely chemo, and 2 said we could skip it. I have no regrets choosing it though.",
