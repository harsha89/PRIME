For some reason it keeps disappearing or jumping to a different page. Am now too tuckered out to post much more. Will say that i have estrogen positive lobular. Have been on Arimidex since 2102. Saw colo-rectal guy today for consult. Love him. Trust him. He is the one who found the BC mets on colon during routine colonoscopy. Next Tuesday doing another colonoscopy. He will biopsy an area even if looks normal. More later. Grandson just arrived and will spend next several days here. He is 8. Just what I need to keep my mind off things. Also, when I first log in, how do I easily get to this page. Each time it takes a long time to find it. Gotta go now and hope this gets posted. More another day. Thnaks again everyone. You are all great!! ",

Lobular BC stage 3, Hormone Pos. Discharged in 2010. One year later during routone colonoscopy found breast cancer cells in colon. Very rare site for BC mets. Put on Arimidex (anastolzole) and later PET/CT scan showed those BC cells gone. Yay! But about 1 year ago, breast cancer cells found on spine (C4) not a great place. But, very small (so no symptoms), ony confined to soft tissue inisde spinal chord, and, it has remained same size. In Jan. 2016, first of 4 incidents with GI probs invilivng ER visits-last one while away on vacation 2 weeks ago. ER scan showed thickening on wall around colon. Seeing the same colo-rectal surgeon who first found the mets on colon in 2012, tomorrow for a consult. Would be grateful for any hopeful words. Thank you! Treated at Memorial Sloane Kettering in 2001 (living up north) and at Johns Hopkins since 2002 after moving to VA. Am fourtunate to have been receiving great care. Know of one women diagniosed with breast cnacer mets to GI tract-higher up the system and therefore closer to breast. She is still around 20 years later. Cancer keeps popping up elswhere,for her too, but like \"whack- a -mole\" we just keep hammering it back down. Again, thanks for any helpful words. Log in to post a reply",

Good news is, it HAS been 2 more years since last post. Am and STILL here. Yay. Since last posting, BC mets still in colon but also in bones and most recently to inside of skull and now at top of spine-at C4 to those in the know. June 22 had last of 5 daily radiations to skull- is considered to brain, but I prefer less intimidating sound of skull.During that week a Spine MRI showed a compression fracture, that after more consults, has resulted in me being told need to have more radiation this time to that area ofmy spine. Still dealing with after effects of June\u2019s radiation. Feeling more wiped out than I thought possible. Having very ominous feelings about being able to withstand yet another bout.When mets to bone Was found in 2016, put on Falsidex, Ibrance, Xgeva. Seemed to be containing cancer till spread to brain and now spine. But still in bones, so docs waiting until results if follow up MEI\u2019s and a PET in Sept. B 4 deciding to switch mets. I could go on, but I do tend to say too much these days. Hope the kind ladies who responded earlier are all doing well. And the beat goes on. ",

      "Content": "Aug 1, 2018 12:16PM - edited Aug 1, 2018 12:26PM by YellowRoses Hi Claudia, Am so sorry you had to experience such tough se's from rad to face.But you are a trooper. THREE in a row. Yikes! Thank you for your encouraging words! After once posting above I learned something else. Part of my ominous feelings had to do with the mask they make for you to immobilze you. The one for rad to brain at least had a more open\"face\". (For different machine too:Varian True Beam Linear Accelerator)).The one I just had made last week at the simulation(for CyberKnife LINACC)) was something out of a medieval torture chamber-or so I thought. It was huge-covered entire head-front, back and top and extended down to beginning of breast line. (Will be radiated at C4 at the very top of spine, behind my neck) Incredibly tight (as was the one for brain rad but necessary for immobilazation)but also felt suffocating. When I mumbled through the thing, \"When do they put in the air holes?\"- they said the front was covered with air holes. Long story short, called the ro office and spoke with a very kind nurse. Xanax had worked for all rad to brain treatments, but was already wearing off when they were doing only the simulation (not too long after takin Xanax.). What I then learned, from nurse, contrary to what was told for brian rad, is OK for me to fall asleep duorng treatment so, they are uping my X dose. Will also be taking codeine for cough side effect-worried I would cough and move and get zapped in the wrong spot. They also said, to tell the rad therapists to cut bigger air holes for me. Whew! I feel much more confident going into this. And also since last posting, re after effects of brain rad went from all time low re energy level, general sense of well being- felt as though was dying- past Friday morning to finally turning around and actually started to feel BETTER!! (Last brain rad was June 22). So, between increasing meds (and I HATE meds, but a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do, to.) and better air holes, am now feeling lots more comfortable with this back to back zapping. Thank you again for your encouragement. My 1st zapping will be August 9. They don't yet know how many total treatments-total of from 3-5. Gratefully, Your Bosom Buddy",

Was warned about possible strep-like sore throat, but wow. Was told to gargle with Benedry(?!) which hasn't helped). Also loss of taste/abnormal tastes, loss of appetitie, Just overall, totally out of it.Finally taking the advice to rest more. Am hoping for long stable periods for everyone in this situation! ",

Side effects for this latest bout of zapping has been much rougher than expected. But they say it's temporary. The worst is the killer fatigue (worst have experience) and the horrible sore throat. Unlike with tonsilitis, eating ice cream does NOT help. If food or drink is too hot or too cold, yikes.The good news is, it hurts only when I swallow, not when I talk. The bad news is, one swallows more than one talks!! More bad news: Has affected my sense of taste so chocolate tastes awful. Talk about life not being fair!

Am VERY low tech) 1st Dx, 2001 Lobular invasive carcinoma, stage 3. Did well. \"discharged\" as a pt. in 2001. 2012 BC mets to colon. Arimidex worked 4 yrs. 2016 further mets to bone. Ibrance, Falsodex, Xgeva. Past March, mets to skull. (PET showed no other organs involved.) Completed 5 days stereotactic radiation, June 22. During that treatment week, more mets to cervical spine (C4) discovered. This coming week simulation for another bout of stereo radiat. to spine, to be done in about 2-3 weeks from now. Am STILL dealing with after effects form brain radiation (I call it skull radiation, sounds less intimidating to me), but odcs consider it to brain.Am beyond wiped out. Before Winter, 2017/2018, still felt pretty strong and well. Started to feel as tho something wasn't right, Winter of 2017/2018. Since radiation to skull, have felt old and as if I am spiraling down.Last several days having very ominous feelings abut upcoming radiation (didn't feel this pre-brain radiation)and wonder if anyone reading this has had separate radiation treatments SO close together. I have never heard of this before. I do intend to call radiatn onc's office tomorrow, to ask if what I am feeling could be after effects of treatment. Docs keeping me on current meds until follow up MRI's and a follow up PET to all be done in Fall.I have aways been a very upbeat person and have always been able to see the humor in some very tough times I still use humor to get me through all of this, (it's always been a part of me) but not today.
