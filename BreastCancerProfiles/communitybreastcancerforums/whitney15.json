    "Content": "whitney15 wrote: My mother was diagnosed with invasive lobular breast carcinoma back in 2012. She had positive lymph nodes with removal of all axillary lymph nodes and left mastectomy with chemotherapy and radiation. She recently started having problems eating and has lost over 65 lbs by not being able to keep any food in her stomach without puking. We found her gallbladder was not functioning and she went to have it removed. During surgery the surgeon noticed a strange appearance of the peritoneum which came back as the same type of breast cancer on the peritoneum. The doctors decided to use taxol every 3 weeks and then off the 4th week in hopes this would help her be able to eat more. She went for her third treatment today and her potassium, electrolytes and other lab values were too low. Needless to say, she was unable to have chemo today. We have so many concerns with her treatment and with her labs continually going down due to her lack of nutrition. Any advice or success stories with something similar to this would be appreciated. She is miserable, still puking, now has diarrhea and continues to lose weight somewhat rapidly. Any advice or guidance would be much appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
