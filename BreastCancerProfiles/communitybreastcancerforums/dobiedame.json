I am considered high risk since my Mom was diagnosed with bc at 47 and passed away from the 3rd round of it at 57. My maternal grandmother also passed away from the same thing. I am 38 and got my first mammo about 4 yrs ago which showed microcalcification clusters on each side. Biopsy done on each and came back b9. Last may I felt a lump on my left breast with some minimal pain. Another mammo, ultrasound, and mri. Fine needle biospy showed a b9 7 mm complex fibroadenoma. I went back last week for my 6 month follow up mammo and ultrasound. The dr said it has grown 3 mm and she wanted to schedule for excisional biospy (which I have set for feb 4). From the way I understood her, she felt it would be best to take it out now before it gets any bigger due to it being more complicated if it was larger and not necessarily a higher risk. I guess I'm looking for some advice or knowledge from anyone who has had something similar. Thanks Ladies for any input. Log in to post a reply",

I do try to keep things in perspective, but until the biopsy and findings are back, the thought of bc hovers in my mind. With each new test it seems my risks go up. Thankfully all have been b9 and will hopefully continue that way. I do try to pull out of the negative thinking when it gets out of hand and this board really helps!",

I actually feel better physically from the excisional than I did from the stereotactic I had a few years ago. The dr. said it looked like a typical fibroadenoma. Will have the results back monday or tuesday.",
