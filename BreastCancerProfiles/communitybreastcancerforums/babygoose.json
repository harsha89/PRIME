My story is so similar to many of you.  And if crying is letting out toxins then I should be healed!  I was misdiagnosed by my gyn who insisted with \"110% confidence\" that my painful lump was not cancer, just a result of turning 40.  After the tests revealed otherwise, I went for a second, then a third, opinion.  It was cancer.  My surgeon felt that I'd only need radiation following the lumpectomy, but 2/3 lymph nodes tested positive so I've been struggling with the idea of chemo for over a month now.  I'm supposed to start by June 4th & I AM TERRIFIED.  My darling boyfriend tells me how cute I'll look in a pompom hat or redhead wig (I have long blonde hair) but I struggle with every aspect of the chemo, not just the hair loss - although I admit I am vain & having a horrible time with that... I understand sometimes there just are no good options, but I cannot wrap my head around this.  I haven't worked since my operation due to severe lymphatic webbing & I can see I'm sinking into a depression over this.  I can't stop feeling sorry for myself.   ",
