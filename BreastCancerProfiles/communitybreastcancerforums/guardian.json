My mom has always had cystic breasts but I began to get worried when I read online that women over 50 dont usually get cysts. It's comforting to know that other women over 50 have had cysts as well. Thank you all so much. Good Luck and God bless you",

There is no lump, and the ultrasound confirmed she had a lot of small simple cysts and the doctor said it was nothing to worry about. The women in my family have a history of cyst formation. But I read online that women over 50 cannot get cysts and my aunt was recently diagnosed with breast cancer after she found a lump. Can women over 50 get cysts? Should I be worried?

      "Content": "Guardian-Angel wrote: Hi. I am 21 years old and was just diagnosed with a fibroadenoma following a Ultrasound due to 2 months of pain in my breast. The doctor at the screening center said that it was nothing and very common in women my age and that it could be left alone. I haven't gone to see my doctor following the results though and I am afraid she might suggest removing it. My mother had a fibroadenoma in her 30's and removed it with surgery. She suggests I leave it alone and monitor it regularly as the surgery itself causes pain and leaves a big scar. I am still weighing my options and would absolutely have it removed if the doctor informed me of any danger of having fibroadenomas. My aunt who was recenly diagnosed with BC at 49, also had a fibroadenoma when she was my age. However, other than her case,  there is no other family history of any cancers in my family, but this also has me worried. My question is are fibroadenomas a precursor to BC? Does having an aunt with BC put me at higher risk? Have any of you had fibroadenomas in the past and how have you managed them? I know I have a lot of questions but I admit my diagnosis as well as my aunt's diagnosis has gotten me worried. Any advice would be extremely appreciated! Log in to post a reply",

The DR said that it was genetic since my mom, sister, my aunt and I all have or have had breast cysts in the past. My question is are breast cysts linked to cancer? Does having breast cysts put you at higher risk for developing cancer in the future? The reason I ask is cause my aunt who had cysts in the past was just diagnosed with Breast Cancer at 49. We have no previous family history of cancer. I was wondering if the cysts are an indication of genetic breast cancer? Should I be worried? Any advice is appreciated! Log in to post a reply",

The reason I was initially worried was because my Dr. told me that I was probably getting Fibroadenomas because of my family history of them, and I thought that my family history of Fibroadenomas might also indicate a family history of BC.Beesie thank you for your detailed explanation everything that you said makes a lot of sense but I hadn`t considered it with my initial panic. I haven't had a biopsy yet but I will definetely discuss it with my Dr. at my appointement. I`ve also never heard of crobylation before, it is definetely something I will look into and discuss with my doctor it may be a better option that having it surgically removed. Betterfrombreastcancer did you have a fibroadenoma you had removed with crobylation? Is this a precedure you preferred or that worked for you? Thank you all so much for responding so quickly. I was really worried but it helps knowing that there is support out there. Good luck to all of you, you are all in my prayers. Thank you again. ",
