It's tough to do with young kids around, but thankfully they keep me busy and occupied with taxiing them around, going to practices, helping with homework, etc.... I do read a ton though. In fact I read \"Orange is the New Black\" (the book that the series is based on). Will have to start the series soon. Thanks for the recommendation! Best wishes on your biopsy tomorrow. I've had two ultrasound guided and one MR guided (that's the most recent one that I'm waiting on). I'll be wishing you well!",

Plenty of samples were taken and now I'm waiting. This whole process has involved so much waiting (waiting for initial MRI results, waiting for ultrasound attempt, waiting for second u/s attempt, waiting for those results, which were inconclusive, and then waiting for today's procedure). And now the big huge ultimate wait for the biopsy results. I know the stats, I know it's probably okay... But how do you stay sane and focused on life (kids, husband, friends, holidays) while waiting?!?! They said I should know within the week... Log in to post a reply",

The radiologist told my BS that he thinks he can get at it with ultrasound this next time and that the he believes that the ultrasound guided core needle biopsy would be the preferred procedure for me. Not sure why (but I'll be sure to ask him next week when I see him).",

      "Content": "Hopefilled wrote: I'm new here but need to start by saying thanks already. Reading thru these posts it's so obvious how helpful and supportive you all are! I've had a mammogram and an MRI recently. The MRI showed a suspicious growth (BIRADS 4) on the right breast, back by the chest wall. As a result, I was scheduled for an ultrasound guided core needle biopsy. The radiologist said he used the MRI findings as a guide but that he was unable to see it via ultrasound (he said it was due to density) so the biopsy didn't happen. He poked and prodded with the ultrasound wand, but never went in because he couldn't locate it. He told me to wait the dreaded 6-month wait and then have a follow-up MRI. I called my breast surgeon and said that due to family history I didn't want to wait. She called the radiologist to discuss further and the radiologist told her that he \"wants to try the ultrasound guided core needle biopsy again\" because he feels as though he was looking \"in the wrong neighborhood\". So, next week I go back for \"take two\". Has anyone ever heard of this and were they successful finding it the second time?? Seems silly to me that he thinks he's going to find it this time. The \"neighborhood\" is pretty small and I'm concerned that we're wasting time. Would love to hear what you all think. Thank you! Log in to post a reply",
