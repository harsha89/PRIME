I am still going to meet with the genetic counselor and also see about requesting an MRI but I have tried for several years and my insurance won't cover that. hmmm. Cause the pain is still there.  I am not 100% satisfied.  But thank you everyone for the well wishes.",

Or who reviews it?  I guess I should just suck it up and call. Thanks for your response...",

I called the radiology dept and they left a message for my breast health dr and I am waiting for the call.  They wouldn't tell me ANYTHING not even if they were trying to call me back for follow up. ugh.  Can they find cancer just from a regular mammo? I have been getting a headache every day for the past two weeks soo stressed and am afraid it could be more serious. I am single mom of two I don't have anyone to help me I don 't know what I am gonna do.",

      "Content": "dillars wrote: Hello Everyone,  First Thank you for sharing your stories and I wish you ALL health and prayers.  I have been worried about getting breast cancer since I was 30 years old. I am 38 now and it all started when i turned 30 I started getting this pulsing, stinking pain on my left breast and when i would touch a certain area it would hurt like crazy, I have been to numerous breast exams the breast health center and FINAllY in 2008 I was given my first mammogram, It showed some dense area in my left breast (the one with the pain) and I had to go back for a diagnostic and an US they could not find anything, I had the results looked over by an oncologist that my friend referred me to and he agreed that there was nothing that it may be a nerve problem from years of working out? So I have lived with the pain, I have tried everything and have just stuck to Motrin, NOW about a month ago I am getting pain in  my right breast, the same type of pain as my left except more burning on the inside and when I lay down it hurts also, I went back to the breast health center and she checked said I have very lumpy breasts but she didn't feel any thickening or anything out of the ordinary, I have my mammo tomorrow and I am scared!! I have two children and am a single mom and I guess I am scared now more then ever because the pain is now in my right breast and I dont know why?? Also, my aunt was just diagnosed with BC about a  month ago, they were able to get it all out with the tumor and both my grandmothers died of BC one in her mid 70's the other in her late 60's and I am SCARED! Anybody ever had this type of pain before?? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.. Log in to post a reply",
