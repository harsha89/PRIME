I think that is what has happened to me. I cover my implants now and I can see not having them. I agree being cancer free and pain free is most important and no more mammograms.

Sunflower, I don't know how you were able to do it in the office.  There is no way I could have mastered that. I have two drains and am happy to be without the painful implants but I needed the recovery room support and lots of pain medicaiton.  Thank you though.  Three days out and I feel so much lighter without the implants. HAPPY is the key word. I think I will stick with cami and not silcone foobs or nothings.  My own breasts were big too so I think my old bras might work on their own. I am in my 50's and will be happyto be pain free. I appreciate all fo your comments dogsandjogs:  All of it should be covered. I just had to pay the hosptial my coinsurance, that was it. Piper Pete My PS did say she might have to fix a flap or bump in her office in a few months this surgery But she said  it is such a minor proceduce to nip and tuck.  It so nice not to feel those painful implants inside. Nancy:  Sorry you have had to go through with so much. I agree with sunflower. I would go for the masectomy.  To me comfort and pain free was my goal getting these implants out and I am happy with my decision.",

I do hope your rashes get bettter.   I may see a dermatologist about my my foot.  First I guess I can try the B Vitamins I have to clear it up before it blisters.  My problem is I sweat all the time on my hands and feet so I can never keep them dry.   This is Day 7 of #3 and I am beginning to feel like me again.  I still have the C Train. But at least it seems better.  Only 3 weeks to the last round. Wishing everyone minimal SE\"s next week and less skin problems",

Took 4 days and lots of shots to boost it back up!  Now I get the shot the day after each round and take my Claritin the night before and for 5 days after. If I feel dehydrated the first day or two I go in just for fluids",

Thanks for sharing. By the way:  I have had PT and it does not hurt if it is done by one of those lymphdema specialist. I don't have that.  I have a frozen shoulder and cording.  It feels wonderful. I just wish I culd afford it.  Maybe after my surgery I can try PT again. How long were your drains in?  How long before you were able to drive?  Thanks   Lezza",
