      "Content": "greetings1 wrote: I had and MRI done 2 months ago that showed DCIS + / - invasive adenocarcinoma, some masses and lymph node involvement. My doctor wanted me to have a biopsy done by ultrasound, but nothing showed on the ultrasound so I need to have an MRI guided biopsy. The doctor also wants to have the biopsy on the same machine used for the MRI, and the place that did my MRI does not do mri-guided guided biopsies, so this means I need to have another MRI. I will have the MRI this Saturday April 28th. I am quite nervous about having a second MRI wondering if anything has increased in size. I am not scheduled for the mri-guided biopsy yet because the doctor wants to wait to see what this new MRI shows. I had a 3D mammogram that showed abnormalities 7 months ago but the report was never sent to my Dr. I found out it was abnormal 3 months ago when I went to get the CD and Report, then I showed it to my Primary care Dr. who sent me to a breast specialist, and then he sent me for the MRI and when I got the MRI CD back he said my case was too complicated for him and sent me to a breast surgeon. I am 55 and I have very dense breasts I have been quite nervous for the last 3 months waiting for all these test results. Reading others postings on this website has really helped me out. I'm not sure if this is the right section to post, I hope it is. Log in to post a reply",
