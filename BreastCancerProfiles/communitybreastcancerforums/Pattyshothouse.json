I'm looking for someone with an similar experience. Last month, I had a sudden onset of stabbing pain in my right nipple. I had discharge, first it was clear then green. Was sent for diagnostic mamo and ultrasound.  Absolutely nothing showed, they said I was fine.  I said I am not fine I have pain and green discharge.  Was then sent to a  breast surgeon. He took a smear of the discharge and ordered me an MRI of both breasts even though my problem was with the right one. I had my MRI last week and today I went for follow up for the results. He said, There is a 7mm mass directly under my nipple. The doctor believes it is a papaloma. But, he said he can't be sure so he sent me for a biopsy. He said they will do a utlra sound guided biopsy, I said, But the last ultrasound they found nothing and said I was fine. The diagnostic mamo said I was fine. I knew I wasn't fine because it feels like I'm being stabbed in my nipple with a knife and have discharge. So, off I went today, same day as MRI results,  I go in, and they can not find the mass with the ultrasound, surprise! They send in another doctor to try to find it. She says I know where to look because I have the MRI but we can not pick it up. Next step would have been MRI guided biopsy, This doctor who does biopsy says because of how close it is to my nipple it will be almost impossible to do the biopsy even with the MRI. She say's the best thing to do is just forget the biopsy and have the surgery to remove this thing then send it to pathology. She was calling the breast surgeon to tell him.  When the surgeon told me my results for the MRI he also said the smear he sent to pathology showed no signs of cancer cells. I don't really remember what he said but he said it had \"junk \" in it.  I'm not sure if it was the word junk but something like that.  Has anyone had or know of someone who has a mass but they can't get to it to do a biopsy because of how close it is to the Nipple? Is it ok to just go in and remove it without really knowing what your dealing with? I'm worried if he cuts and it happens to be something bad; won't it spread?  I posted under this thread cause I honestly don't know if it's benign or not since they cant biopsy me.  Thanks Log in to post a reply",
