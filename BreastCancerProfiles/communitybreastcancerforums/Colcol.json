I had to have cardiac testing done because I had open heart surgery when I was two to repair a hole in my heart, and they just wanted to verify everything was okay before I had my BMX. Also, before my BMX I did a round of IVF to have some frozen embryos available for me after I completed the tamoxifen treatment. The message boards have been a great help to me.",

In June I had a lumpectomy and in July I had the sentinel lymph node biospy done, which thankfully came back clear. On 10/11/12 I had a bi-lateral mastectomy w/reconstrustion and the latissimus dorsi flap. I got my final pathology report from the mastectomy tissue and my breast surgeon said I made the absolute right decision because the report showed pre-cancerous cells in both breasts. My Mom was diagnosed at 55 with breast cancer and she is a survivor. I also tested negative for the BRAC1 and 2 gene. I will say each day since my surgery does get easier. I went home with 4 drains had two removed last week and hopefully the last two get removed tomorrow. Another good board to look at is youngsurvival.org.",
