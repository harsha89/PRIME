Stage 3 in 2010 my daughter was 1 then 12/12/12 stage IV attacked. I lurked back then (2010) joined (2012) and already I have a new outlook on my prognosis. Thank you all!",

My onc said some patients will be in some pain until the day they die ( I am one) depending on the severity and type of pain.  I too see a pm and it's a team of residents. I take quite a few pills used for bone and nerve (neuropathy as well) pain.  I take 20mg methadone in the morning, 10mg in the afternoon and 20mg at night.  Break-thru I take either 8 or 16mg of dillaudid every 4hours as needed.  Unfortunately my reoccurrence also left me with a lot of nerve pain as we'll.    I take 60mg Cymbalta every morning and 400mg of Nuerotin 3x a day.  I also take meloxicam for inflammation when needed as well.  Last but not least 1mg Xanax prescribed for 3x a day but I only take at night to sleep along with 5mg of Valium.  Normally I do not take the Valium it makes me nervous ha.  So do you wonder how I can get all that and take but I never ever am pain free except when I am lying down.  I worried that my Drs would think I was a druggie (I imagine some people might on this board as well)  but as my pm Dr. Said, \"if you stumble, fumble, and out of control or high than you are taking to much and you are mentally addicted.  Right now my body is defendant on them which is a huge difference.\"  I had to hear those words to know that I'm in charge of my body the CEO if you will and our oncologists are or should be working for us at this point.  Stage IV to me gives us that right and it's all about Quality of Life.  I was given a week if not days Jan 31, 2013 when I was sent home with pain at level 20.  Hospice came in and everything to prepare for that day.  Here I am June .... Lol unsure some day in June 2014 all because I chose quality.  If I have to take 20 pills oh yah I have had several rad treatments, a cocktail of perjeta and herceptin every 3 weeks then a Xgeva injection to help strength in my bones every 6 weeks analog eith treatment as well as a daily Arimidex (which helps give me pain but keeps me on this side of the grass too) last but not least I just had the gamma-knife done from a new brain met.  If I need more or something else make your onc listen if ever your onc does not and they say no than you stand up for yourself!!  PS all these drugs I take (trick is to take on time even if u think you don't need it because you want to lead it not chase the pain) help me play with my 5 yr old daughter and allowed me to see a graduation.  It was preschool but reality is I might not see her HS one but I did see this one :-). I honestly have no clue if I made any sense but I hope I did.  Chemo Brain ;-) Main point YOU are your OWN ADVOCATE be smart be loud and BE PROUD!!  Good luck to all never give up  XO Jacquee'",
