My doctor can see a shape of something that is concerning so I had an MRI on Friday. That said, this is the first time an u/s has not been able to tell exactly what it is. I really think it just goes to show that sometimes you will need those extra tests and sometimes you will be fine. Best Best of luck, I know it can be scary! Cleo ",

Having been through this many times over the years, this is the first time a definitive was not given to me at an U/S appointment and my doctor , who is a breast specialist, seemed to think a biopsy would happen at that appointment. To be honest, I felt incredibly dismissed by the radiologist. And what she told me was not exactly what she told my doctor. Anyway, from I saw on the u/s with my doctor was a odd shaped shadow of something. I am hoping the MRI will give a clear picture of what is there or where they will need to biopsy, as my doctor has already told me will probably want one. Sorry that was a lot. I am just really stressed and now i have a sick kiddo at home. Just a lot going on. :)",

Anyway, I am going to start looking into the remaining doctor at the practice or into others in the area. I think I will hold off on the biopsy for now and wait for the three month follow up. i do wish I would have gotten the chance to sit down with my doctor and go through the images so that she could explain what everything is rather than the large seas of white at times. That will be something I look for in the next place. :)",

My doctor said since I had noticed it growing, I can still go ahead with a biopsy or just wait three months and have a follow up then to see if things still look the same I guess. Oh and I learned my doctor is leaving the practice. So, I don't know. I am thinking I will wait. I have never had breast dense tissue present itself so obviously before or get bigger, but her feels good with what she sees. I do have a rec for a great breast specialist in my area and since my doc is leaving, I think I will give them a shot to handle my care in the future. :) Log in to post a reply",

When I saw my breast specialist doctor last week, she checked on her computer if my insurance will cover an MRI given how dense my breasts are and family history of breast cancer and she was happy to see that they will. Great. I had an u/s on Monday and they still cannot see the lump clearly so her recommendation is an MRI. As luck would have it, I was on Day 5 of my cycle, so we scheduled the MRI for tomorrow. I got a call today saying my insurance has not given approval yet. If you have experienced this, is it worth calling them to see what the hold up is about? My husband was approved right away for an MRI on his knee. I don't want this put off and I really do not want to wait another cycle. I get the sense that my doctor wants things to move quickly too. Just a bundle of nerves and frustrated. Log in to post a reply",
