Different surgeons have different personalities, and sometimes I am a bit of a nervous patient who needs someone a little more user-friendly, which is why I am asking. Given that I am asking for positive information and not asking for any negative, I hope it is acceptable for me to be asking this question here. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "lizardbreath wrote: I wanted to post to: A.  Share My Info, B.  Send Good Wishes, and C. Maybe Get Some Good Wishes. After much gnashing of teeth, I started my neoadjuvant chemo - dose dense A/C - on Wednesday.  So far, so good.  My role model is my mom - she is four months ahead of me on this journey, just having started her \"T\" cycle (after A/C) a couple of weeks ago. As some of you know, I refused to use a port.  It took some doing, but I found an onc who would do Adriamycin without a port, and my first chemo - this past Wednesday - went well.  There was a bit of flaring in my arm, but the nurse stopped for a moment, flushed through some saline, the flaring reduced, and we marched ahead.  ONWARD.  The chemo cycle took about two hours, and it went just fine.  Thank God.  I'll keep praying for good veins, and I'll keep drinking water to keep the veins \"juicy\" (I got that phrase from someone else on here.). Quite frankly, WAITING for chemo and making the decision to do chemo was grueling.  Sitting in the infusion chair and watching it start was a bit of a relief. I took all of the tips from here that I could find - suck peppermints, get Zofran and compazine and ativan (sp?) to have on hand, take Claritin after Neulasta, drink lots and lots and lots of water, use a heating pad if they cannot find a vein, bring something to listen to on headphones, take pills BEFORE the pain or nausea hits - and I am doing fine so far.  A bit of cramps, but that might be from my anticipating the constipation and drinking prune juice the night after the chemo (TMI?  Sorry!).  Not sure. I got accupuncture the night after chemo, which was my first time ever doing accupuncture, and I slept the entire next day.  Perhaps I overdid it with the accupuncture.  I am ready for bed early tonight (at 8:15 p.m.!), though, in fairness to the dog, I think she should get a short walk first.  It's only fair! Moreover, everything I have read says that, to the extent possible, exercise or just moving around a bit is really really important during chemo, for mental health and physical health reasons. So, I'll go leash the pup.  Thanks for the support and the good information.  Hopefully my \"first chemo\" report might help someone else. Log in to post a reply",
