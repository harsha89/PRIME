I had a bronchoscopy yesterday, so it's broth, juice, water, and frozen fruit bars.

      "Content": "chocolatesalad wrote: I'm ER+/PR+, HER2- My estradiol had been >11.7 after oopherectomy(on January 8) and a few subsequent tests were consecutively >11.7.  It jumped to 86 on my most recent labs(Monday). My doc appt. is tomorrow so I find out why, hopefully.  FSH is 22.6 and LH is 0.9 I started Faslodex on April 9. I'm wondering: are the results inaccurate, is the AI no longer working because I quit Afinitor, or (?)  I need to lose 25 pounds--I know fat can contribute to extra estrogen, as well--so please no diet lectures. lol.  Am hoping I can stay on the Faslodex because the SE's are so mild compared to my experience with Afinitor. Though of course will do what I must. Has anyone else experienced a spike in their estradiol when switching to Faslodex--and then perhaps a decline, soon after? I've read on many posts that in general faslodex takes time to \"work\". Am wondering if that also includes its effects on estradiol?  I'd appreciate it if anyone can share their experience with spikes in estradiol after switching treatment/ and their resolution. Thanks so much. Blessings to all. Surgery 4/15/2002 Mastectomy: Left Targeted Therapy 2/14/2013 Afinitor (everolimus) Dx Stage IV, PR+, HER2- Dx ER+ Log in to post a reply",
