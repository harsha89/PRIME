If you weren't told that permanent hair loss was a possibility, your hair has come back but very thin or not at all, if you will have to wear a wig, please contact me. My BC was early stage, no lymph node involvement and found out that there was no indication for using Taxol. Very frustrated and don't want anyone else to go through this. Feel vain because it's just hair but didn't have to do it and probably didn't have chemical benefit.",
