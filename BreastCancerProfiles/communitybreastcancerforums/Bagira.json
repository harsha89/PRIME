Just like you, my OBGYN thought it was a cyst, but she ordered a ultrasound. Ultrasound, however, revealed that it wasn't cyst, but a very \"bad looking\" lymph node, possibly cancerous. They then did the mammogram (w/ double apron to protect the baby), and the core needle biposy. After 6 long days the results were in - NO CANCER, just reactive lymph node (actually I had several of them, two were biopsied). I now go every 3 month for follow ups, I had since had my baby and the lymph nodes are stable, but still there. Hopefully yours is just a cyst, they should see it on ultrasound.",

They looked very suspicious on the ultrasound (I was rated as 4C BIRADS, which is 50-80% probability of cancer) Largest two have been biopsied (core neeedle biopsy), and it showed just reactive lymphoid tissue. Almost a year later, they are still there, no changes though, so my doctor is not concerned any more, although he still wants to monitor them every 6 month.  From what I read (and I was obsessed about lymph nodes for quite some time), ultrasound can frequently pick up lymph nodes and can tell if they are concerning or not (it has to do with how lymph node looks - shape, whether or not there is fatty helum, whether or not there is abnormal blood flow, size, etc..). If the lymph nodes look concerning, then biopsy is needed, because cancerous and just reactive lymph nodes can look similar on imaging. If your doctor didn't recommend follow up, then probably your lymph nodes looked normal. However, if you are concerned, see if they can do needle biopsy, or at least follow up after 3 months or so to check for stability.",

I was given a BIRADS score of 4C. At that time I was 16 weeks pregnant, so I think that's why they did the biopsy the same day. The radiologist was very concerned, and I could tell she thought it was cancer. She never found any other areas of interest in my breast though. The type of biopsy they did was core needle biopsy. They took 6 samples from two different lymph nodes. The pain wasn't bad at all, but part of it was due to me being in quite a shock, so I didn't really care about the pain, I just wanted to know if I had cancer. The recovery was fine afterwards as well, I was able to resume my normal activites the next day. After 6 days of unbearable waiting I was told that the results were reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, so basically lymph nodes reacted to something, no cancer found. I was still sent to breast surgeon, who did exam, and send me for a blood test and chest X-Ray to rule out lymphoma. All the tests came back OK, so he just watched lymph nodes for enlargement for the remainder of my pregnancy He originally planned to take one of them out afterwards (excisional biopsy, which is the most accurate, even though core needle is pretty accurate too, 95% or so), but then he felt like they started reducing in size and he basically told me that I am fine. I went for a 2nd opinion to gynecologist-oncologist, he repeated mammo and ultrasound, and since lymph nodes were stable, he told me to come back in 6 month. I just had another ultrasound couple months ago, and was told that lymph nodes are alittle smaller, but to come back again in 6 month. I still worry (what if something got missed!), I had asked about removing the node, but doctor wants to wait til I am done breastfeeding (actually, he doesn't really think I need it, but he will do it if it makes me feel better). I did a lot of reading about lymph nodes, and found out that by imaging alone (like ultrasound, MRI) you can't distinguish inflamed lymph node and malignant one. And yes, there are many reasons why lymph nodes can enlarge, and sometimes they don't go down to normal size after enlargement. Good luck to you, and its great that you have a positive outlook.",
