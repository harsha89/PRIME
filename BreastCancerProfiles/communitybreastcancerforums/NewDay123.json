Breast lump is ~ 4-5 cm on one side only. This is considered Stage IIA. My oncologist did not order an MRI. He seemed rather rushed. Should I be getting an MRI? Would it help with anything? Oncologist has decided chemo first, then surgery. A bit worried about not getting good advice because who knows which doctor is good, and knows what is best? But I guess because BC is so common now (unfortunately), the treatments are pretty typical? I'm glad you have these forums here. Thank you.

What can I do now to spend some time with the family and just save up some good memories for them. Sigh. I try to think that this is just something my family and I are going to have to go through. We're going to make the best of a bad situation. Nothing else we can do except try. We're here. I'm sure others will chime in too. Best to you and your family. Hi live_deliciously... thanks for the welcome. It IS good to not feel alone in this. :)",
