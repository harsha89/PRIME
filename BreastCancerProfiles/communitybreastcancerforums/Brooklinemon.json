    "Content": "Brooklinemon wrote: I'm hoping for some advice about two different treatment recommendations. I was diagnosed with stage 1b IDC, micro met to sentinel lymph node, all other nodes clean. Strongly estrogen positive (>95%) but progesterone negative (<1%). HER2/neu negative, too. Grade 2, mitosis score 1 but no Ki67 test results. Oncotype score 23. Primary tumor is 1cm. One onc suggests tam only, says stage 1b cancer not likely to be responsive to chemo. Second onc recommends chemo based on progesterone negative status and oncotype score. Suspects luminal B, though tumor does not seem have a high proliferation rate or high grade. Don't want to have chemo if it's not likely to have any effect, but also don't want to have just tam if chemo likely to have greater effect (if this were luminal b). Also, second synchronous primary, .9cm, estrogen + (>95%) and progesterone positive (20%) and HER/neu negative, too. That one was grade 1, mitosis score 1, too. Would appreciate your thoughts.
