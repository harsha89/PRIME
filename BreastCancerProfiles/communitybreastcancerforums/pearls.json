    "Content": "pearls wrote: Ive free from ca L. breast for 14 1/2 yrs. In Sept. 07 I was at work with what I thought was a cold, the cold got worse and so I thought that I got the flu. It did not abate and went to my doctor where she had me off for 2weeks. In the interim I had a mammography for laying about and I decided to have this checked out, so off I went to have one done. My chest got worse and so off I went to the doctors to ask what does this report mean, and our worse fears were confirmed on 4/12. The first ca was a lobula and the 2nd one was a ductal. The doctor also said: oh, by the way, you have pneumonia with a collapsed lung and this information knocked me to a hoot, where Im still in shock and in a daze with it all. Tomorrow is New Years Eve and I feel like my life is over. I am 62yrs old and working towards a retirement, I am single with no partner or family. so Im finding all this difficult to cope with. I just rang Life-Line as Im finding that I am in a deep depression and don't know what to do next. Invasive ca were found. tumor was cut within the margins (same breast) and one lymph gland was free of any invasion. No treatment has been specified and masectomy isnt due until June 08; in the meantime I have invasive ca cell thats eating me up into deeper depression. Any suggestions?
