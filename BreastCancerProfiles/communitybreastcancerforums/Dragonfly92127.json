During radiation I used Emu Oil for the burns.  It did a beautiful job soothing the pain, inflammation, and healing the burns.  No other cream or ointment came close.  More than 1 ½ year latter I am still using the oil at night before I go to bed. I feel it mkes a difference and today I got confirmation.   Saw a new PS today for mods to my recon and she was amazed at the heath of my skin.  She said \"Really you've had radiation? I've never seen radiated skin look so beautiful and healthy; whatever I am doing keep it up.  That's amazing\".  Actually mentioned it several times. I use Pure Emu Oil by Jurassic Secret; get it at Jumbos' or Henrys.  It's about $10 a bottle....took the bed wrinkles out of my chest as well.... You know from sleeping on your side with big boobs. I do remember how scary RADs were...They Suck!

I have a skin saving mastectomy, with close margins, and 1 positive internal mammary node. The plan is for full chest radiation.  My expander is filled to 850cc, over filled for recon.  On last chemo visit my Med Onc asked \"how is the radiologist going to get around that thing?  Are you going to deflate for rads?\". I had not heard of this before. What has been your experience for the actual radiation procedure taking into consideration your expander and how full were/are you?  What was the recommendation of your Rad Onc? Anyone made to deflate for Rads??? I want my new breast but I want to live more!

I wanted to go this year as a supporter for the walkers but I felt afraid, uncomfortable, somehow like I no longer belonged...  This weekend my friend and walking partner from the walks called and asked me to go with her... I was overwhelmed by how grateful the walkers were to see me there with my little bald head and that chemo glow as one walker put it.  I was also overwhelmed by all of the walkers and survivors who stopped to give me a hug and offer me encouragement. On the dark side were the walkers who looked at me with a little fear in their eyes.  I was wearing my blue victory shirt from the 2003 walk.  I used to be one of them and I know that they thought that someday they could be me. It made me realize how vocal we/I need to be about the disease.  How many of us have no family history, no reason what so ever for this to affect us and it does anyway.  I was one of those people who thought I knew the symptoms of breast cancer but ignored my own symptoms for a year when the mammogram came up negative.  I was satisfied that breast cancer had no reason to touch me.  I was wrong. If you have the opportunity to do the walk it's an amazing experience - 60 miles just isn't that far when you are walking with the energy of 4000.    I am looking forward to walking in 2008 with my friends and family who will now be walking in support of me.  I believe in my heart that I will beat this and the positive energy I feel will eat up the positive node still in my chest.  I will walk the 60 miles in 2008 in support of all of you...this time as a survivor.

I am getting 28 sessions of IMRT and have been FREAKING OUT about the whole radiation thing.  In my first two sessions I felt heat on my face. The second treatment it was really intense and afterward the treatment my cheek was pink and my eye felt wind burned for most of the weekend.  I called this AM to tell the technicians what I experienced expecting them to tell me I was nuts. The tech did say it was pretty impossible for a beam to reach that far off but we would conference this afternoon with the Dr.  I got there this afternoon and they were waiting for me... and not only did my DR take my concern completely seriously he had them run tests during my treatment checking for excessive scatter and then the IMRT planner came in and verified all of the alignments. One of two things will be discovered...either I imagined it all and I am a whiny baby as we say or it's real and the machine need to be repaired...regardless my Dr  and the techs took it seriously and they did everything possible to assure that everything was perfect.  Dr.  told me that I needed to be 100% not just 99.9% confident in my treatment. That I needed to watch out for myself and be my own best advocate and raising any concern immediately was the best thing to do. I am so grateful words can't even begin to describe.  BC sucks and if I have to go thru radiation I can't ask for more than the way I was treated today. I really felt my anxiety release today. Additionally...DH was welcomed in to my first session and he was able to stay with me anytime the techs were in the room setting up then follow them into the control room for my actual treatment. All we had to do was ask...
