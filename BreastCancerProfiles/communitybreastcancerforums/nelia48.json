I was diagnosed a year ago with  stage 3b, a HUGE tumor, and lymph node involvement.  I had let it go a very long time (7 years), and it was breaking through the skin.  Didn't need a biopsy for lymph node involvement ---- they could feel it!  After biopsy of the tumor, I had to do the chemo first to shrink the tumor.  Then surgery and then radiation.  Surgery showed 5 out of 15 nodes positive.  I'm telling you all this because I just had a PET scan last week, and it came out clean with no spread anywhere.  So yes, the lymph nodes did their job and caught it and kept it from spreading. Before starting chemo, etc., I had a chest xray, bone scan, and an MRI.  They saw no spread anywhere at that time either.  So don't panic!  Take a deep breath!  I know your thoughts are racing, thinking the worst, etc., etc.  But this is all doable.  I'm 61 years old, did the chemo, lost my hair, went through surgery and radiation, and here I am, getting on with life.  If you have any questions whatsoever, you can send me a private message and ask away.  I'd be glad to help in any way I can!",

I'm with you, Kim.  I don't want to talk about the percentages.  None of us will never know which side of the percentages we are on anyways.  It only causes ulcers and nervous breakdowns! Cora",

It did help, though, when I started taking a prilocec every day. The Carnation Instant Breakfast drinks are a great nutrion boost and tasted good to me.  I also ate a LOT of Cream of Wheat cereal made with milk instead of water, and chicken noodle soup.  The little pudding cups were life savors.  Sherbet was great for a while, but later on seemed to take on a bitter taste. I came to this conclusion:  Any foods that had mixed flavors were terrible or I could not taste them at all.  For instance, spagetti sauce was one that was way off.  Too many mixed things in there.  And soups with lots of veggies and tastes were no good.  The more simple the food was, the better it was.  Sometimes, just a piece of toast and a scrambled egg were just fine.  Forget any of the breakfast meats, like sausage, bacon, etc.  No good.  And it all changed from one chemo treatment to the next.  Seemed like what I ate at the beginning, I couldn't eat at the end.  You just have to try stuff.  When all else fails, drink an Ensure!",

I had 5 out of 15 nodes positive, and one of the nodes had a problem and was all wrapped around one of the shoulder nerves and he couldn't get it loose, so had to cut the nerve.  He was afraid I would have problems with the shoulder and arm, but it ended up that I did not and it's ok.  Everything healed up just fine, and before I knew it, I was worrying about radiation and surgery was left in the dust. The only major problem I had that no one told me about was constipation!!!!!!  If you take pain meds, be SURE to take something to prevent that!  I can't stress that enough!",
