The radiologist said it was just a clogged duct... So I googled ways to clear it up.. Warm water/Epsom salt... They worked a little..(He gave me all the options I could do and I decided to wait till it becomes a probelm)... It started hurting pretty bad again so I went back to a different Doctor. I told him what the other dr said and he pulled the records and looked at it and he agreed. He referred me to a breast surgeon to have it done. I've been waiting on an appointment for a 2 months now because it's not a neccessary which is understanable. But now my breast has this weird bruise discoloration by my nipple. Should I be concerned? Does anyone know anything about this? Any similar stories? Log in to post a reply",
