Triple neg, Stage 1, Grade 2 with clear nodes and margins from the tumor 1.6cm. I am starting chemo on the 20th (watching the inauguration from the infusion room) - \"Can I do it? Yes, I can!\"  I am apprehensive and trying to ready myself for 4 treatments of A/C every 2 weeks followed by 4 treatments of T every 2 weeks as well. I guess I just need some boosting up in the morale zone:) - I can't sleep much now and can't imagine much less. I have 3 yr old twins who attend school all day so I am a bit concerned with the spread of infection. Any thoughts? I know everyone's course is different so, I guess I'll just hold my breath and dive in. Glad I found all of you, Gail ",

I had my 1st treatment yesterday (A/C) and had my Neulasta shot today. Everything went flawlessly in through my power port and I am becoming more used to this little 'alien being' living in my chest. Last night I felt a bit light headed and held off a mild headache...no nausea that couldn't be controlled with a few crackers. I'm kind of waitng for the shoe to drop in 24 hrs or so with Neulasta SE's - how about you?",

I am waiting:) Otherwise, still just mild headache - and eating crackers when I feel a bit nauseated, kind of like being pregnant:)  Keeping well hydrated and 'regular' thanks to Senekot. Year of the Hat- I, too, had my 1st A/C and feel dizzy & tired. 3 more then 4 T. Alo, Renrel, & Holtbolt- all sounds okay. Let's hold out for only mild SE's...I can't use Biotene because i have an allergic reaction to Aloe. I'm doing the salt/baking soda regimen. Family photos on Saturday then the waist length hair comes off next week...before it starts falling out. Yikes, pls post scarf, turban sites if anyone has good recommendations.",
