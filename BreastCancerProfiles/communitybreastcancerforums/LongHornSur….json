Not sure if my tumor size was already at the Stage III size or whether it got there a month or so later when we were really able to image it properly. I was preggars at the time so could only do an ultrasound and small needle biopsy. Only found out about mets this month and they came on fast! Been NED for awhile now. We are going to treat this aggressively so docs a striving for NED again. I know what you are facing is so tough. It's more than OK to get tired of this fight. Hope you can keep finding the spark and inspiration to do what's best, for you. Please let us know how we can help.",

Sometimes technicians make comments that they really shouldn't without realizing the effect they may have on the patient. Hope you get the news you are hoping for.",

Hope you celebrated like crazy. :) Unfortunately the tumor in my lung is cancer and the nodes that lit up are probably the cause of my rib pains. There seems to be a spot on my left hip bone, but the Onc. doesn't think it's necessary to biopsy that. Am going to start a chemo protocol and try the PARP inhibitor if I get selected for it in a clinical trial. Halve already talked with some folks in a local metastatic support group, via telephone. Already lining up my resources to fight this again!",

I hope this Monday morning to get more news about my condition, prognosis and treatment plan. I normally don't ask prognosis numbers, but I will need to have as much information as possible when discussing this with our foster/adoption caseworker. Perhaps I can do short-term care to give other foster parents some time off. If I am expected to remain reasonably healthy, I might advertise for in-home child care. I am listed with the state. Perhaps I can have the experience of caring for someone else's infant while they work. I would love to hear about anyone who has had lung mets in remission for a long time. I wonder if adoption is possible for long term remission?  ",

My oncologist feels there is a chance that the lung lesion could come back as negative for cancer. This pre-biopsy scan is not giving me any comfort. I will have at least one core biopsy in a day and a half. I guess it's not really official until the pathology report comes back. Hope I get lucky this time.",
