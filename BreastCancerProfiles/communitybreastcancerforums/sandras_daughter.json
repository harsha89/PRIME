    "Content": "sandras_daughter wrote: My mom had a double mastectomy on 10/29 following a diagnosis of 2.5cm, Grade 3, HER2+, ER/PR- local biopsy on her right breast.  She also had TEs put in at the time of her surgery.  We have lost all faith in her surgeon and oncologist, and feel that a mistake was made during her surgery which possibly the surgeon tried to cover up, but I'm not sure so would appreciate input.  Following Mom's surgery, surgeon came to waiting room and told me that 3 of her lymph nodes were enlarged and he felt sure that they were positive, but did not mention any problems with dye test or otherwise.  Namely, we got the idea that he did all he was supposed to.  When we visited the onco for her post-surgical follow up and to get results yesterday, the onco first blundered by writing down in his \"illustration\" and inputting in his computer model \"probabilities/success of treatment\" program that Mom was ER/PR+; when asked if the surgical biopsy came back different than the original, he looked through her chart and said, \"oh yeah, you're right.\"  He then began asking us about her ax node dissection results.  Her prior visit to the general surgeon did not provide her with this info, nor remotely mention the possibility or need for additional surgery.  Onco called gs to ask him about her surgery/reports because the info sent to the onco by the gs was incomplete and showed biopsy results \"pending.\"  After onco talked to gs, he returned to the room, told us that there was a problem with the dye test, and that the gs removed 3 random sentinel nodes, but did not do any ax nodes.  The onco said that he and the gs \"agreed that it would be prudent and indicated\" for mom to undergo an additional surgery for ax node dissection.  I guess my big concern is that I am under the impression that this should have been a part of her mastectomy surgery.  Now, the gs is calling Mom scrambling to schedule this second surgery, and she simply does not feel like undergoing another procedure at this time.  At our initial pre-op visits with surgeon, he outlined that lymph nodes would be taken to assess if and how much the cancer had spread, that they would be biopsied, etc.  I didn't know to ask about sentinel nodes or axiliary (sp?).  Now for the onco treatment - Mom does not want to have chemo (doesn't really \"understand\" why she needs it - I've done research on her cancer, but she has post-mastectomy brain drain/depression (I guess) and said she can't concentrate to read what they have sent to her (she's only 65, normally intelligent able to comprehend), and the onco didn't really explain her cancer to her.  She is adamantly opposed to having chemo due to other's people's stories (with other types of cancer and other types of chemo), and insisted that she would only consider it if she could have a test to rule out the cancer being elsewhere....  So, a PET scan is scheduled for 12/1...  Nonetheless, she doesn't trust or like the surgeon or oncologist any more -- I've been with her on her appts, and I can't say that I do either.  The gs had a wonderful bedside manner before surgery and was a total ass afterwards.  The onco has repeatedly made mistakes and forgotten what he has told us on previous appts./visits, some of which he even wrote down in my notes... Is it time to replace the whole team (except the ps - we still love him), or are we just stupid and second guessing these medical genuises?  Is a second surgery often performed after mastectomy to do the ax nodes, or am I imagining things thinking that most everyone has this done at the same time?  Namely, that a pathologist should have been on standby to definitively confirm cancer (despite the surgeon's visual that he \"knew\") in the lymph nodes?  Whose fault is all of this?  Surgeon?  Failure of oncologist to communicate with surgeon to manage mother's care?  What on earth?  A second surgery after Mom just went through hell on the first?  She doesn't do surgery well, or actually the drugs associated with it; painkillers make her terribly nauseous, strong antibiotics made her sick, weak and caused sores in her mouth and associated symptoms, she hated the drains, immobility, etc.....  Now go through it again - more surgery, more drains, more drugs and more immobility?  Then while weakened and not feeling good begin chemo?  None of this adds up to me -- I'm very angry that they have/are putting her through this... What is best route to get a new \"team\"?  Obviously, we want a good one...  We're in Georgia, and understand that the Winshape Cancer Center at Emory Univ. is excellent, but it appears they need a physician referral....  Don't know that we want to get one from the gs who I believe botched her surgery/care or the onco who I now believe to be an inattentive idiot....  (numerous other things the onco told us re: her treatment that he has now \"forgotten\" - such as timetable for beginning chemo, telling us he wanted her to completedly recover from surgery, now wants her to have ax dissection and begin chemo right away, presumably before she even heals, etc., etc.  Any advice/insight would be greatly appreciated.  I'm new to all this, and perhaps am imagining that a ball was dropped...  What do you all think?  What should be our next step?  Thanks in advance!
