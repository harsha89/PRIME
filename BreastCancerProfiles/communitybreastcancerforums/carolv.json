At first the rash looked more like bug bites but has never itched. Since then I've had my regular mamography, but do not have the results yet. Also I've had my regular pap smear. The ob/gyn said it appears to be an infection that has gone into my chest wall!  She prescribed anti-biotics and pain pills. My mother and great aunt had breast cancer. I had a benign lumpectomy a long time ago, so I am very concerned about this. What should I do now?",
