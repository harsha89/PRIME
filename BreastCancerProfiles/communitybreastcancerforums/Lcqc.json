I am currently breastfeeding my 6.5 month old son I thought the lump was normal due to breastfeeding then i learned that milk ducts don't stay full constantly. I had an ultrasound almost a month ago and he found the lump and a swollen intramammary lymph node, I left feeling fine because radiologist said he thinks it's a Galactocele and that nodes can get swollen when breastfeeding. He didn't sound confident in that but I didn't think much of it. Then I got my CBC results back and I have high lymphocytes, high immature granulocytes, high ipf and mpv, so I started googling and that's when I started to realize maybe it's cancer. I got a copy of my u/s report and it says the lump is oval solid cystic mass measuring 17x6x10 mm. The intramammery lymph node is 6x5x8 mm. Birads 4 (no letter) Off to google again and I found a radiology website that says that lymph nodes with a cortex thicker than 3mm are a \"strong predictor of malignancy\". Now I am convinced it's cancer. Between the lymph node, the lump and the blood work what else could it be? My biopsy is in 4 days. I've been an emotional roller coaster. My hubby says I'm reading the report differently than it really is and I'm okay. He says it's a Birads 4 just so they can do a biopsy and the radiologist used to the words \"mildly suspicious\" so not to be worried. My questions are.. Has anyone had or seen a swollen lymph and lump both turn out to be nothing? Any ideas on my blood work? Breastfeeding and the biopsy they said it's ok to continue nursing but I'm nervous.
