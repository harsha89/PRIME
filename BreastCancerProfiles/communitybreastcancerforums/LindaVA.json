I have bone mets and some mass in my chest that is between my lungs. I was taking oxycodone and it was controlling pain for about 4 houirs. My Dr prescribed oxycontin(long acting) 2x a day. It really seems to help more that the oxycodone. maybe you can do this when you're off chemo.",

I think you deserve to have this grief session for a while. My 2 sons are soon to be 27 and 30 but neither one is married. I grieve for the fact that I likely won't live to see my sons get married or have grandchildren and that I won't grow old with my husband of 36 years. You are so lucky to have Rosa and I hope you will soon be able to concentrate on enjoying every minute you have with her and making many happy memories with her and your husband.",

This is terrible news and you deserve to feel anyway you happen to feel. Give yourself permission and don't feel ashamed of how you feel. Let me know if God gives you an answer for your question! Personally, I think that God weeps with us and I can't believe in a God that sends this beast upon us as part of his plan for us. I know he will be holding you in his loving arms as you start your new treatment and I will be praying for you.",

My confirmed diagnosis of metastatic disease was confirmed on Friday the 13th of May. I'm not normally supersticious, but my diagnosis that my so called DCIS BC cancer had come back in my lymph nodes was on Friday the 13th of January, 2006. There is mets to bone, liver, lungs, and a mass between my lungs.We won't know about the brain until I have an MRI next Thursday. We are also  doing a liver biopsy next week to confirm that the cancer is BC and to test for receptors to see if it's still the same. ER + Her 2 + My onc wanted me to get started on treatment right away so I received Herceptin and Abraxane yesterday. The plan is weekly for now. He'll change this if my biopsy says something different. I did AC, Taxol and Herceptin for my 2006 adventure. In retrospect I have had symptoms for over a year. The thing about it is I was told if it was a metastases the pain would not go away and not get better. This is what the literature says and my onc told me.I am here to say that it is absolute Bullsh_t!!!! I have had pain where my liver is located that would hurt off and on for a week. Then not comeback for 3 or 4 months.Then go away after a few days or a week. I would have pain in my neck for a week and it would go away then come back in 4 or 5 months and then go away. The same with my back. I have mets in all these areas. I never mentioned them to my Dr. because they didn't meet the criteria for concern. I'm sure I'll have lots of questions, but my main concern right now is should I get a port put in? I didn't have one before and had no problems. I do just have one arm to use because of lymphedema in the rt arm. Of course with metastatic disease I can count on always being in treatment. I would love to hear what you ladies do. Thanks for your help and support. Linda in Virginia Dx 5/13/2011, Stage IV, ER+/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

Chemo has made it worse. My friend sent me something from Whole Foods called \"Chewable Papaya Enzyme with Chlorophyll\". It seems to help with break through heartburn. It is made by\"American Health\". The directions say to chew 3 tablets or just suck on 1 or 2 tablets. I just suck on 2 until it's dissolved in my mouth when I need it. I looked online and see that a number of places carry it.You might try it.",

I am so grateful that my 2 sons are grown. It sounds like you have gone through a lot of crap to get to this point and are still not sure exactly what you're dealing with. Listen to these wise women on this board and I will be sending love and positive energy your way!! Please keep us posted. I will also pray for wisdom for you talking to your younger children about this whole thing. It sounds like you need to be more sure of what's going on and what the plan is before you can really figure out the best way to talk to your younger children about what is going on with Mom. Right now you really don't know what to tell them and I would hate to think about you stressing out about this with all that you must be going through right now.",
