Cancer or another benign lump? My mother had breast cancer, she is in her 5th year of remission. Most doctors tell you that breast cancer doesn't hurt, however; my mother's did!  After seeing two doctors who told her to take Tylenol for the pain, her persistence resulted in cancer.  Did I mentioned that she had a mammogram that did not show anything! Thank God she is stubborn and requested an Ultrasound.  She had radiation and chymotheraphy.  She is doing great and has dedicated herself to the cause. At 35, I requested from my doctor to do the same for me and ordered an ultrasound, this is how the first lump was found.  By the way, I also had a Mammogram and nothing showed!  My doctor decided that I should have a yearly ultrasound and Mammogram, this is also how the second lump was found; through the ultrasound that is!  I've had two needle biopsies.  It's been two years since my last ultrasound/mammogram since I became pregnant with our second child and couln't have them while pregnant and after since I breastfed him for a year.  It's been 9 months since I stopped breastfeeding and frankly didn't make the time to schedule it, until now.  The pain and burning is off and on, the burning is specially stronger around the nipple.  I know that my pain and burning sensation is probably nothing serious, however; I cannot discard the fact that I am a high risk.  But I am also wondering if it can be scar tissue?  Can anyone help?Thanks!
