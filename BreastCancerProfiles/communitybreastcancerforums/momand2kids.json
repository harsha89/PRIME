And work was the one place where I felt I could \"get away\" from cancer...... so, I only told my very immediate colleagues who needed to know because it would impact them, and they all covered for me with everyone else. For me, only when treatment was over, was I able to talk about it more broadly. This ultimately worked for me, but everyone really has to do what works for them. best of luck!",

I did not want to talk with people about it while I was going through it--- and the wigs were great.  You can get a little cold during the chemo administration, but they have blankets and other things to help you.   My hair is growing back wildly- probably about 4 inches long now-I stopped wearing the wig after 7 months (I cut my hair long before it fell out).  I am healthy, healthy, healthy and you will be too once they get this out of you......

Lots of things were delayed due to the holidays-- and no one on my medical team was overly concerned (meanwhile I was going out of my mind). I ended up with a lumpectomy, chemo, radiation and 5 years of hormonal drugs. I am off the drugs now and doing just fine and consider myself cured. Some things that helped in those early, \"hurry up and wait\" days. Ativan (for anxiety--didn't take it much, but loved having it), Ambien (for sleep--I took a half of one every night for a while--I found I really needed my sleep to cope with the days and the information), digital voice recorder (for all dr. visits--I still use this--it was suggested by my surgeon and it has made all the difference-- I just turn it on and then we can have a discussion-- so if I go to the visit alone- no problem (I never went alone, but now I do!) Exercise (just always helps) and meditation (another thing that always helps).  Good luck-- when you have all of your information, you will definitely feel more in control and once you start making decisions, things will move along. ",

I had 4 rounds of AC-- over the course of 8 weeks--- I had a standard dose--- so I am not sure what a low dose would be--- but I suspect the side effects are somewhat the same..... If I read your note correctly, there is only a 1% difference with chemo?  If that were the case, I would not do it-- but you have got to be comfortable with that.  My surgeon and onc both told me that I could go either way on it.... but I knew I would have to sleep at night and I definitely have slept very well since then. I started chemo in Jan 09-finished in late February--- had very few side effects --- lost my hair-- but it is back in spades now.  I would not do anything differently-but again, you have to be comfortable with the decision.  The pathology might help you, but it sounds like you have lots of information already-- and you would probably take tamox or an AI---sounds like you are in great shape. best of luck with the re-excision... ",

So now, , 6 months later, here is what I have learned.  I take glucosomine chondriton and vitamin d3 for the stiffness--and the thing that really helps it is exercise--so I swim, use the elliptical trainer and bike--- yoga also helps.  I have found that the se's are much less now, or I am adjusting to them-but I do fine that they are almost invisible on days that I exercise--so I am pretty much exercising every day. As for the vaginal dryness, my onc recommended Replens (you can get it in the drugstore), or coconut oil,KY jelly.  Still working on that one.... I really don' t have any significant hot flashes, although I do have a couple each day--but I would have been having those anyway--- I know some people have experienced lack of sleep or thinning hair--that has not been my experience.  I also found, for some reason, that taking it at lunchtime works better for me--- not sure why--- you will have to play around with it and figure out what works for you. Like you, I like to know what is going to happen-but I decided not to bother to read about the side effects since I knew I was going to take it, no matter what.... It has continually gotten better over the past few months as my body has adjusted and I have ramped up my exercise.  A number of us also eat prunes each day for bone health.... good luck!",

We told them what they needed to know when they needed to know it. We told them I had a lump that was cancerous and I was going to have it removed. We then told them that we had to wait to hear from the dr. about treatment. They both had had classmates with cancer so they kind of knew what the possibilities might be. When we decided on chemo, we told them-- but truth be told, I worked throughout, got a great wig-- and generally did not talk about it outside the house (except for my close friends and bc network) The kids take their cues from you and from the very beginning they saw this as a problem that had a solution... never did they think I was going to die (nor did I ).... we kept them on their schedules of school, activities, etc. The harder part is other people who think it is their right to know. Everyone has to do what works for them-- but I can tell you that no parent at my kids schools knew anything..... one of the challenges of telling lots of people is that you have to talk about it alot or know that they are gossipping as you mentioned. The up side is that people can be really helpful. One of my book club buddies was having an mx around the same time--people brought her dinner, etc. People can be very kind... you have to decide what YOU need. I did not tell alot of people, only people who could be helpful to me..... many of my colleagues did not know until I was long out of treatment. That worked for me, may not for you. But it is important to know that no one has a \"right\" to know this other than you and your immediate family. People walk the earth with all sorts of medical issues that we don't know a thing about. You have that same right to keep it to yourself. Or share it with everyone you know or something in between..... But you get to decide and if you decide to say nothing, that is ok too.... There were some people in my life who \"knew\" something was up and most decided that if I wanted them to know, I would tell them so they did not pry. There were a couple who were just way too nosy--- pissed me off.... so I never told them, ever...... gotta do what works for you. Just remember, you cannot \"untell\" someone-so during this difficulty period when you are not sure what to do, perhaps doing nothing until you have your plan is a way to go.  Once we had a plan, if we shared it was just \" had a lumpectomy, going to have some treatment, and all will be fine\"..... good luck",

I work full time and I had decided not to say too much to my colleagues so I needed a wig that looked just like my full, thick hair.... and the human hair wig did.  After my first AC treatment, I had the hairdresser buzz my head and I wore the wig home.  After my last AC treatment, h shaved my head completely (there was still hair there somehow).  I wore the wig from January to June...  As my hair grew back, it grew back in this wild riot of curls... for almost 2 years after treatment, the curls just kept coming--I loved it--never had curly hair. Ironically, just today I was at the salon for my monthly cut and it looks today EXACTLY as it did the first day I arrived there in tears about losing my hair.   I am not an accessories person so I knew hats and scarves would not work for me, but I did have a hat I wore to bed at night (it gets really cold with no hair).  I never took the wig off, other than to go to bed at night.... don't really know what I looked like bald, although the hairdresser said I had a \"nicely shaped head\".... This is a hard part--- your head will tingle for a while then it will subside.  The other important thing to know is that no one really pays attention to your hair.  I thought everyone would notice and all people said was \"wow, your hair looks so great \"--because the great thing about wigs is that they always look good-no bad hair days.  Made me wonder what I had looked like before!!!!! hang in there--this too will pass ",

I did have a pre-surgery MRI to check out the other breast.  I also have an annual MRI and a mammogram--- since I had had a clear mammogram 6 months before the lump was found.  My onc and I just talked about the MRI-they do have lots of false positives, although over the past 3 years, the ones I have had have all been clear. But I also had a slow growing cancer, so if it were to recur, it would probably take a long time before it could be seen.  However, all that said, MRI's are a good technology for dense breasts and I think it makes sense to have a full breast MRI before the surgery if possible. Why not know everything you can now..... Good luck",

The waiting is the most difficult part. Call the surgeon's office and see if they have a cancellation list---get on it--- that might move the appointment up so you don't have to wait 2 weeks, but know that 2 weeks is a fairly normal wait to get into see a bc surgeon. I would suggest a notebook or a voice recorder to take with you to the appointment so you can focus on what the surgeon says. In the meantime, if you are really anxious, ask your doc for a little ativan-- really takes the edge of waiting.... Good luck ",

I did 4 rounds of chemo-- had two small children and a full-time career--it was not easy, but I have to say, I sleep soundly every night---I know I did all that I could--- and my onc and surgeon ultimately agreed with me--they did not say I had to have chemo but they said things like \"if you were my sister, I would twist your arm to do it\".... It is ultimately your decision.... and I think it really depends on how you will feel about it-- will you be relieved to have skipped it or will you be anxious because you did not do it. I did 4 rounds over 8 weeks... did radiation and 5 years on an AI with ovarian suppression for 3 of those years. There really was not more to be done.... I do think age matters a little--so if you were 76 you might decide to forgo chemo. Not saying it was easy and I was lucky, did not have too many difficult side effects, but there are some, as there are with the hormonal drugs.... but as someone said, it is good that we have these options, and that is what they are, options.... you get to choose. For me, the oncotype pushed me over the edge.... so I was able to calculate my distant recurrence odds--so for me (not sure I remember it perfectly) without chemo, I had something like an 18% chance that it could return. Having chemo reduced that number to 8 or 9%..... I thought it was worth it .....  There really are no guarantees and I am hopeful that since I had a slow growing bc that maybe it won't come back or travel anywhere else..... Good luck-these can be hard decisions-but listen to the data then to your gut.... you will know what to do when you need to know it.",

All this said, no one knows what can happen.  So this is a decision that you really have to be comfortable with---for me, the line in the sand was \"what decision can I make that will allow me to sleep at night?\"  and I have been sleeping soundly ever since!!! Best of luck- we all know how hard this is--- don't feel rushed- you have some time to decide.  Let us know if we can help in any way. By the way, I feel fabulous now!  Radiation actually wore me out far more than chemo.  Keep us posted.",

One of the positive things about having had some health challenge before bc is that you have some coping and management skills if you need them. Sounds like you are focused on the positive, good hospital care, etc. It is a stressful time as you get tested and wait for results; we all understand that-and we refere to it as the worst time in the process since you have no information.

My other concern, which is far more serious, is , if I go off for a short period of time and somehow have a recurrence?  I am stage 2--- but that is the risk part that I am not sure about..... sigh, none of these things are easy....",

Worked through most of it-- and they honestly probably don't remember much. They will take their cues from you.  We presented breast cancer as a problem we were going to solve with the doctors and they accepted that.  Truth is, most people are not \"sick\" with breast cancer.  I did have chemo, but really just had some low days, not \"sick\" so that the kids would see.  And, kids tend to be pretty self-absorbed.

I can only tell you my tale- had a lumpectomy and an onco score in the low 20' s(how great is it that I cannot even remember it).  The trials were just getting started and my numbers fell into the \"gray area\" which frankly, makes it much harder to decide.  I was 48,pre menopausal and had 2 young children, full time career, etc.... to say that I did not want to do chemo was an understatement. My onc (who is fabulous) and my surgeon (also fabulous) did not tell me what to do--and I think that is important to understand..... they gave me the data and I had to decide..... what I saw was that without chemo,I  had a 15% chance of recurrence and with it, the chance dropped to something like 7%.  Took me 1 minute to decide to do chemo....  My onc is a big believer in the hormonal therapies--she says they are the most powerful weapon for ER/PR+ situations.  I believe her. But, no one could tell me if there were little cancer cells loose in my body--- I had no node involvment, no LVI.... but the single deciding factor for me was \"will I be able to sleep at night if I DONT do this?\"  Now, for me, the answer was no... for others the answer might be yes.   So, I went forward--4 rounds of chemo-- I did work through most of it... had radiation.... and through it I kept thinking that these treatments could cause more problems--then someone said to me \"treat the cancer you have now--- don't try to anticipate the future\" and that really helped. It was hard, no fun, but I am 4 years out and I barely remember it and I consider myself, as does my onc, cured of that breast cancer.   The oncotype made a difference for me.. I had already decided that if the score was higher than 12, I would opt for chemo.  After I chose, both my surgeon and MO told me that they would have done the same thing.   Once you have all your data, the decision really will be more clear to you.  I wish you the best of luck.",

I am not trying to sell you on chemo-there are side effects and everyone does not tolerate it as well.  I just think with the information you now have you need to really reflect on what is going to work for YOU.... and as much as you can, project how you will feel about it either way.

I would also suggest that you think about anti-anxiety meds, maybe ativan just to get you through this part--- it is only a short while- and it can help you clear your mind.  You need your rest and your strength for this-- and anxiety can sometimes prevent us from getting enough rest.....

I have a mammo every year and clinical exams with her, my pcp and my gyn-so 3 times a year a professional is doing a breast check. I was having annual MRI's-I decided to go to every other year--- sometimes there is just too much information. As I get further out (over 6 years) I am less concerned--and as I understand cancer better I can see that sometimes, less is more. There are so many false positives that create anxiety--as an example, I had a lung ct last winter to try to figure out why I could not stop coughing. Ultimately it was due to two nodules on my thyroid. But along the way they found a tiny nodule on my lung--- so I had to get a pulmonary doc and I have to have a ct scan every 6 months for the next two years because that is their protocol--even though he is certain that it is a benign infection. I find these scans anxiety provoking--- and cannot wait until I don't have to do them any more. I will say, when I was first finished with treatment, I wanted monthly check ups and tests. Now, a mammogram and a periodic MRI are plenty for me. I also know my body and I can tell when something is up--- and before I was dx, I knew something was wrong--- not saying I can dx myself, but I do try to listen closely--- but not get to crazy over it--hard to do, I know-- and you might feel differently as you get further out from your dx and treatment. but, if it is not enough for you, you can ask for more, or get a new doc there are many here who do get regular blood draws....

My recommendations:  Take all the nausea drugs they recommend--I tend towards nausea, so I was religious with those--drink lots of water/gatorade, etc.  I found \"white foods\" helpful for nausea--pasta, oatmeal, etc.   Some people can exercise--I am a regular exerciser, but I gave myself the 8 weeks off during chemo--when I was not at work, I slept--only went out if it was a kids' school thing..... really tried to turn down the noise in my life...... it was winter and cold and snowy, so I often just lit a fire in the living room and sat..... As for hair, I shaved it in February and started going wigless (with very short hair) in late June (I know I always wanted a timeline so hopefully this helps you). GOOD LUCK!!! YOU CAN DO THIS!!!",

However, I had the oncotype dx test done after the surgery and I had a mid range score  in the gray area-- so , bottom line- I did four rounds of chemo and had radiation.  After all that, my risk of recurrence is projected in the single digits, but I know that after gathering lots of info---  I cannot speak to the issue of mastectomy, other than it is permanent, so if it is not medically necessary and you are not an anxious type of person, starting with a lumpectomy might be a way to go--only you can tell that..... but do get more info. best of luck",

I am sure they will have more information for you.  Usually they need the pathology to figure out chemo (often the oncotype test can be helpful here) ER/PR+ indicates estrogen fed tumors, which make the hormonals that much more powerful....  good luck",

I am not sure what my ER/PR% were--- but I had 2 different opinions at two cancer centers, so I went with that.   The experience of instant menopause through lupron and femara was a bit of a shock and I do acutely feel the lack of estrogen in my body--- and I think I would still have to take femara even if I had my ovaries out, so I figure I can wait.  I generally see someone every 3-4 months (onc, pcp, gyn) and we talk about these things each time.   I am hoping to go off the lupron by the summer to test to see if I am actually in menopause..... then I would just be down to femara.....

While I hope none of this comes to pass (I keep reminding myself that the radiologist said \"I don't think it is cancer') I am preparing for the worst.   In the meantime, unlike last time, I am not falling into an emotional heap.  Last time I cancelled all non-essential activities during the diagnostic phase, did not want to see or talk to anyone unless it was about bc, which left me a small group since I told so few people. Now, going to my college reunion, dinner with friends, work, professional conference..... I simply refuse to let a .5 mm spot on my mammogram dictate my entire life. There will be plenty of time for that after a diagnosis.  For now, I consider myself a healthy person who had a questionable mammogram.

Had a clear MRI in May, so I dont' expect anything exciting on the mammogram, but then again, last year they found something (cyst) that they insisted on taking out.... sigh.... hope you are all well--beautiful day here in the northeast.... ",

I am 6.5 years out and rarely even think about bc-- but I remember how helpful it was when I was new here and people like me came back and reassured me, so here I am. Someone told me early on that it would take about a year of my life-- and in many ways, that was correct. There are lots of highs and lows- and in the beginning, as the information starts to take shape, it is so stressful. My suggestions are: get a prescription for ativan---keep it with you-- try to go to work if you can, be strategic about who you tell -this is your private info and you don't have to share if you don't want to. Know that the info does shift from biopsy to surgery, etc. Not alot, but sometimes people (like me) are surprised when the biopsy said 1 cm and the surgical pathology said almost 2cm. Surgical pathology is the act from which all things flow.... which is why we are always all so anxious for the surgery. You may have to make a surgical decision--- there is lots of info here about mx vs. lumpectomy--others have said it better than I can.... It is worth getting second opinions.... maybe about the surgery, maybe about the treatment. This is all so scary that we all want it over asap so it is tempting to make really quick decisions. Try to step back if you can--there is plenty of data about # of women with your dx, etc. This industry has come along way--- there are tests that help you decided about chemo, there are shorter radiation periods, genetic testing--- you will get the info you need over the next few weeks, but it will feel like decades as you wait.... I have no good suggestion (except the ativan) because I am soooo impatient, this part drove me crazy. But honestly, once you have results and a plan, you will be in the next phase which is much more manageable. There are incredibly smart people on this board-- so come back often--there is a lobular group as well... join us!!! Good luck ",

You can always get a second opinion on the treatment--- for many, just taking out the affected area is enough.. mastectomy is not a given.... breast preservation surgery is really the norm now whenever possible.  It is just up to you to decide what you can handle....and it should be your choice.  At 63 it seems to me you have a lot of living left to do--- I have found the hormonal therapies to be more challenging than chemo or radiation or the surgery... everyone is different; You will eventually settle on what will work for you---- don't rush.. you have time to think about this.",

I encourage you to bring a digital recorder and another person to your appointments. It is so helpful to hear all the good things the dr. are saying--mine told me it was eminently curable, it was a bump in the road--- but I couldn't hear that--thankfully my h and my recorder did!! When my mind would go to the crazy place, I would just play that tape.... and it helped (along with some Ativan!). I had a mammogram 6 months before my lump was found--it is astonishing how this can happen, but it does, and quite often. Which means you are in good company-- and please do read and re-read Beesie's posts. They are very helpful (and I did not even have DCIS). I found focusing on one step at a time was helpful. 1. surgery 2. recover 3. deal with pathology 4. decide on treatment 5. do treatment 6. Get on with my life..... and all of that happened. Not easy, but not impossible. We somehow manage to deal with that we do not want to!!! ",

I remember, by the time Christmas came, I just stopped worrying about it.  I had had a lumpectomy with pretty good pathology, no nodes and I figured that I could probably go either way on the chemo--no matter what the oncotype score--so I worked hard to enjoy my kids, friends and family during the holiday and viewed myself as cured from the surgery--- it was not easy, but the worry was exhausting me--- so I made sure to get outside every day--- and just try to find some peace in my own mind... which is really all that matters.   The thing you are anxious about is chemo.  The oncotype will give you some good data as to whether you would benefit from any chemo--- you may or you may not.... what was most surprising to me was that I had to push my doctors to tell me what they thought once the results came in.  Only if it is above 30 or 35 will they definitively say \"chemo\"  below that, in the gray areas, they don't \"tell\" you what to do..... and certainly if it is really low, they will recommend against it--but many here who have had low scores have wondered if they should go forward anyway... it is not easy and while it is nice to have additional information, that can sometimes also be overwhelming...  Let me reassure you--when the time comes to make a decision, you will have all the information you need and you will know what you need to do for you and your situation..... you really will....if you have any anti anxiety meds, it is worth leaning on them at this point if you find it all to be too much--- because it can really feel that way.   Happy Holidays---- let us know--hoping for a 0 on the oncotype for you....",

Like a prior post here- I can tell you my timeline was lumpectomy in November, chemo in Jan/Feb, radiation in March/April/May and 5 years of hormonal drugs.... I worked throughout most of the treatment my kids were 7&12 at the time... it was not easy, but it can be done.  but you may not need all of that or may decide not to do all of that--- once you have all of your data, you can make an evidence-based decision with the recommendation of yourdr.  Always ask\"If I was your favorite sister, what would you recommend?\"   I still have all of the recordings on my voice recorder... I can hear the fear in my own voice as I talk with the dr.  So much I did not know-- so terrified that my life was over.  Truth is, they really know what they are doing in breast cancer--- and the type you have is very very common.... We all know what you are going through-- please be sure to come back and let us know as you gather more information.  My new favorite mantra from Robin Roberts' book is \"Focus on the solution, not the problem.\"  That is what you will be able to do once you have all of your information.",

No nodes and I am doing just fine now. It takes time to accept that this has happened. For me, very early on , I decided to frame my experience as lucky it was found, lucky I had access to good medical care, health insurance, support....  I know this approach doesn't work for everyone but I adopted it after reading a post from the Stage 4 group. Someone said: If You spend all of your time worrying about this and it advances, you have wasted that time. And if it never advances and you jive to a rise old age and have worried about it all that time, you haven't enjoyed your life. I took this to heart but it took a while.

No matter what, think about getting a second opinion--you may want to research surgeons in your area-- if you can go to an NCI cancer institute that is always helpful-but lots of folks here have gone to their local hospitals and have done fine.  I would recommend a breast surgeon, not a general surgeon.  Tell us where you live and I am sure there are people here who can make recommendations.  It is hard not to get to far ahead of yourself---but we often recommend not spending too much time on the Internet---- get a notebook, write down your questions, bring a digital voice recorder to you appointments and bring another person who can help you \"hear\" what is being said. it is sometimes helpful to have a prescription for an anti-anxiety med--- I had the scrip and carried the pills around in my pocket for 4-6 weeks during the diagnosis and planning stages.  Just knowing I had it helped me relax--but this is a very stressful time and you are right at the beginning---don't try to tough it out--- get what you need.   I won't pretend to know the answers to all of your questions, but you would be surprised at the number of us that had clear mammograms and within months were diagnosed..... so don't assume you are her2+or that it is really aggressive..... it may very well not be..... Just know that there is another side--- you will get to it--- the best advice I got was \"this will take a year of your life then you will be done\" and that was completely true.  The other side is much sweeter and life is, in many ways, much better.  So, just keep that in mind as you gather your information and make your plans.... be your own best advocate- and if you cannot, make sure you have someone with you who can.   You can get through this...... keep us posted",

I had a digital voice recorder at every meeting- made such a difference and really helped me when I re-listened to make decisions that worked for me. I had a 2.5 lump that was contained,nothing in my nodes and clear margins.  They recommended a lumpectomy with radiation and hormonal therapy.  My oncotype came back in the \"gray\"area, which said that I had an 85% chance of it never returning--- but by having chemo, I essentially pushed that to about 92% or better--I jumped at it--but I know there are many who would not have and for those people, 85% was good enough.  I have 2 young children, I needed to do it for them and for me. don't get ahead of yourself on this-if you need chemo, we can help--- and the hair problem is easily solved--not sure where you live, but there are many places that make human hair wigs--I had 2 and literally, almost no one noticed (I worked through the whole process).  Likewise, we can help you if you need radiation or hormonal drugs. for now, you have done all you can-- rest assured that your surgeon will carry you through this next part--- once you have your pathology report, then things can be decided. all the best",
