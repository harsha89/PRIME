I am trying to think positive but this is just the hardest thing ever. Hang in there--you are in my prayers and I am hoping for good results.  My results will come about the same as yours--tomorrow or Thursday.",

My fear is focused on the wire placement.  My breast is still sore from the stereo and the thought of someone putting a wire in there makes me want to scream! Also, I have never had general anethesia before and I am scared about it--particulary the side effect of death! I'm a big mess today!  I had the attitude of wanting to get it over with--now I just want to run away!!! Thanks for allowing me to vent!  I have gone full circle from my very first post--I'm really scared--again!  Log in to post a reply",

Dukemom, Thank You so much for your kind offer to pm me and I would love to hear from you if you're up for it.  Otherwise, I will be thinking of you and praying for you on Monday.  Take good care of yourself and make lots of cookies--eat a few before the MN cut off for food and drink!!!  You're right--we'll get through this OK.",
