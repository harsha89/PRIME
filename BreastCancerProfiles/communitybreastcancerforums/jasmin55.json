It will be a total of 8 rounds every 2 weeks. As for the side effects I guess I can't complain, so far I feel a bit nauseous on the first day and then tired during the first week after treatment but after that I feel ok :) Having no hair is a whole new experience but so comfortable when taking a shower! Best wishes to all! we will get through this!Â ",
