Everything the radiologist told my husband and me after the ultrasound was a blur. From the moment he said he was very concerned about the three spots and wanted to do biopsies, I kind of spaced out. He mentioned something about having surgery sooner rather than later. They are going to expedite the process or something.",

I had already decided to have a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy and so I began routine tests prior to meeting with a surgeon. I had also felt a small lump on my left breast a few weeks prior. On Wednesday 8/30, I had a screening MRI of the breasts and a 3D mammogram. The tech took me back for an ultrasound of my left breast and I knew something was up when she had a radiologist come in and scan both my breasts. My 12:30 mammogram appointment lasted four hours. The radiologist sat me and myhusband down and said he was very concerned with many spots. I have insanely dense breasts and most of the spots were ruled out as cysts. The lump I felt is very concerning to the doctor, along with 2 others in my right breast. I am having two of the three masses biopsied with ultrasound guidance this coming Tuesday 9/5 and I am of course terrified. This was supposed to be routine screening and here I am, 29 years old, going in for biopsies. If the first two are benign, then the third will be done with an MRI guided biopsy. If either of the first two are malignant... then I begin some kind of treatment. This sucks! My plan was to chop em off and be done with it, but they won't let me off that easily it seems.

I will ask next time I see them in Tuesday for the biopsies. I've been off work for the week on a \"staycation\" so my husband and I have tried to stay busy doing fun things to take our minds off of it. Thanks for the well wishes, and I'm hoping your mass is benign, too!",
