The first round was a success in in terms of nausea (I took all my nausea medications prescribed, but haven't have to resort to their \"in case of emergency\" Stemetil tablets yet). Slight queasiness was about as bad as I got. The fatigue was something else though. The first few days were fine, but then I crashed and slept almost constantly for about 3 days in a row. I did haul myself out of bed to walk the dog 4 times a day (and to eat very little), but I wasn't happy until I was headed back to bed. I then had a day where I felt perfectly fine and got a lot done (too much actually) and crashed the next day. Today is another feeling fine day, which is why I'm actually posting here - I finally have the energy. I'm slightly apprehensive about the 2nd round as I have it in my head that the first is kind of easy, and then it's going to get subsequently more difficult. I've taken a leave of absence from work, and I'm in awe of anyone who can continue working to any degree while going through this - I don't feel horrible, but I don't think I'm anywhere near having the ability to concentrate of anything for several hours a day. Finding this whole thread incredible helpful - thank you all!",

      "Content": "Nov 22, 2014 01:29PM - edited Nov 22, 2014 01:30PM by lucyshoe ThatCameraGirl: I'm another Day 3-4 extreme fatigue girl. I'm on day 9 of my 2nd infusion now and I still haven't quite regained a full day of feeling okay this week. I didn't know I could be so tired or sleep so much. I remember a couple of days of feeling absolutely amazing in the 2nd week after the first infusion, so I hope they're coming soon again. This week has been all about a persistent cough and a constantly dripping nose - extremely annoying, but I still haven't experienced any nausea so I shouldn't complain too loudly (and I should continue to knock on wood that my good fortune continues) I've never told my backstory here, so I'll give the Cole's Notes version now: I'm 48, single and live alone with my dog, Daisy. I've been working at home as an editor for a legal publisher for the last 6 years or so (been with the company for 13 years). I'm on leave until the end of my radiation sometime next year. I'm lucky that one brother lives right across the street from me with his wife (if you'd told us when we were teens that we'd be willingly living in such close proximity, we'd have never believed it!) and I have dinner at their house every night since starting chemo. Although since I've never been very good at feeding myself nutritiously I might just keep showing up long after I've recovered! My other brother lives just 5 minutes across town. My dad's 12 year old prostate cancer moved to his brain early this year, and he moved himself into a long-term care facility right before his surgery. He's been quite cognitively affected by the tumour and the surgery/radiation so I'm glad he made that decision for himself and there is no way on earth he'd be able to live on his own. My mom passed two years ago after a very brief (three month) tangle with pancreatic cancer. I was diagnosed with my cancer on my birthday this year. I'd felt a lump for maybe the previous six months but hadn't paid much attention and only remembered to ask my doctor to take a feel for it as I was leaving a regular appointment in June. After that it was mammogram, biopsy, and all the rest. Here's the thing that's interesting about my diagnosis though. In March of 2013 I suddenly developed hives. Really bad hives. There was a lot of stress at the time: it was the anniversary of my mom's death, my job was being off-shored and so I was shifted to a new department with new responsibilities; I had just put my dog down, and I had a run-in with a co-worker who lost her job in the shuffle and was angry at me that I had managed to stay employed. I took anti-histamines but they had no effect. I had to travel out of town to train for my new job and got very sick at the same time so was just getting by by dousing myself with OTC cold meds. The hives were really debilitating though - painful and moving to new areas of my body every day. When I got back to town I went to my doctor who tried all the usual things to no avail -- went to allergists, had biopsies of my skin and was finally just put on high doses of prednisone. Stayed on Prednisone for the next year. Any time I tried to wean down too far I would break out just as badly, and sometimes even on the Prednisone. if I worked out too hard I'd break out anyway (when I did, I was unrecognisable, I was so swollen). Gained lots of weight on the Pred. of course. Eventually the diagnosis was just chronic idiopathic urticaria - meaning - everyone was baffled. From my reading, it could disappear overnight, or it could hang on for years, or hang on for life - no way of knowing. Then came this year and the lump in my breast. Once we knew that chemo would be part of program, my doctor was anxious to try to at least wean me down off the Prednisone. I started again right after my lumpectomy and was a little shocked that with the trauma to my body the surgery caused I didn't immediately have another outbreak of hives. I kept taking it down a mg at a time - and within two weeks of my first surgery I was off the Prednisone completely. It was as if once the tumour was removed, so too was the cause of the hives. I haven't had a single hive since (though I still get nervous every time I get an itch anywhere!). Every doctor and nurse I've talked to through this whole process has been fascinated by the correlation, and unfortunately it's not something that can be proven, but everybody seems to agree that somehow the hives were triggered by the growth (or appearance) of the tumour. I sort of had a feeling for most of the last year that even though it seemed completely random, that my body was trying to tell me something. Unfortunately, neither I nor my doctor could ever figure out what it meant. Anyways, because of the Prednisone, and now the chemo, I'm working on my 2nd year without a working immune system, but I've been surprisingly healthy so far. Actually, other than the SE from the chemo, I feel better now than I have since late 2012. That's definitely making this treatment a lot easier for me to take. At least this feels like it has an end date after which I know I'll start to feel even better. Thanks for listening - sorry for the novel! I had a brief spurt of energy, I guess! ",

Weird and interesting - there's obviously a lot our bodies are telling us we have yet to interpret correctly. I think I had a small episode of chemo brain yesterday. I had just come in from outside and was hot so tossed all my headgear aside. I have lost about 90% of my hair and now I look like I have my Great Uncle Johnnie's infamous comb-over. I tried to shave the remaining bits off but the electric razor hurt a bit and so I'm scared to go back and try. It keeps falling so I figure the rest will drop eventually - I can wait. Anyways, a few minutes after I got changed into something comfortable the doorbell rang and I had the door fully open to the UPS guy and his trainee when I realized I'd not put a cap back on my head. Not only that, but because I'd been hot and sweaty when I came in, I knew what was left of my hair was probably sticking straight up like a sad little mowhawk. ARGHGH! I froze for a second and then figured it was too late to slam the door so I just acted all casual, like, yeah - this is how I always answer the door! The guy wasn't sure it was me and had to ask (I've had him come before) to make sure but other than that to his great credit he didn't blink an eye to what must have been quite an alarming sight. I actually had to pay for delivery so shut the door to get my wallet. My cap was sitting right there and I considered for a second putting it on, but then I figured it was too late anyways and would just make my discomfort even more obvious. I could hear them talking through the closed door and froze again trying to hear what they were saying, but he was just explaining to the trainee how to process a VIsa payment. When I came back out, we finished the transaction and he even stayed for another minute or so making small-talk and not betraying even a little that anything was amiss. When I got back inside I just laughed and laughed. I've been so careful up to now not to offend anyone's sensibilities with my mostly bald head, but really, people won't die if they see it. And some can obviously be quite cool about it. Ironically, they were delivering two new cloche hats I'd ordered online. And not a moment too soon apparently!",
