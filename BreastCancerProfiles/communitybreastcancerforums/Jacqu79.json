Well today I'm 13 days post op and feeling great!  I had my final drain removed today.  It was still draining quite high (100ml since Sunday) but my surgeon doesn't usually like to leave it in longer than 10 days due to infection risk, so has taken it out and is just keeping an eye on things incase I develop a seroma. I also had my dressings removed today, so this is the first time I've seen my new boobs and WOW!!!!!  I keep going for a peek in the mirror!  They're fantastic!  I'm not too sure about my abdominal scar yet, but it's still early days and things have to settle down a bit I guess.   Hope everyone else is doing well!  Thinking about y'all!

I've also been getting \"electric shock\" type pains which I'm putting down to nerves healing.   I saw my PS last Thursday and I'd developed a seroma in my abdomen, so had to have it aspirated.  She removed 650mls of fluid from my tummy!!  I'm due back on Thursday to have it drained again and as it's swollen and distended I'm assuming there's quite a bit gathering there again!  The good thing is, my tummy is still numb, so I didn't feel a thing!  I'm also struggling to get comfortable to sleep  I seem to start off in bed, then wake up during the night (usually soaked with sweat!) and move on to the couch.  I can't wait to sleep on my side either! Hope everyone else is recovering well too. Jacqueline.xxx ",

Just a quick post at the moment to say I'm now 10 days post bilateral mastectomy and DIEP reconstruction and I'm finally home!  All went well, though I don't think I'd prepared myself for just how major this surgery actually is!  I'm still exhausted!  I had 3 drains removed 4 days post op, but still have an abdomen drain in my groin which is at the moment is sitting at 80mls.  My surgeon doesn't usually let you leave hospital until they're all removed (they're removed once they drain below 50ml), but I was starting to go stir crazy, so she let me go home this morning, but I have to go back and get my drain checked and emptied tomorrow. I still haven't seen my new breasts properly as she keeps dressing on for 3/4 weeks!  They seem fuller than before, but I'm not sure if that's down to swelling, also my tummy isn't as flat as I expected it to be, but I'll have to wait and see how things look once the swelling goes down. Paula I'm glad everything went well for you and hope everyone else is ok. Jacqu.xxx ",
