Keep going strong!! And keep thinking positively!  I know that is so important.   Lots of cyber hugs are coming your way!! God bless. L:)",

You are such a blessing to each other.  God bless you! L:)",

So I'm a bit apprehensive about the switch. HOpefully it won't be an issue.  I am tired of feeling tired of sick 3 days out of each week:)  It can get better, right? L:)",
