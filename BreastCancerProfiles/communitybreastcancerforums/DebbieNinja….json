My plastic surgeon says that is is nerve damage (neuropathy) from the surgeries. It does feel like a stabbing pain. There are medications that you can take to help with this type of pain. I was originally on gabapentin for nearly 3 years before I was switched to Lyrica. Check with your plastic surgeon. This is a common occurrence after multiple surgeries.",
