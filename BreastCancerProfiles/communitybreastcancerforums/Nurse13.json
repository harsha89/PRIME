My doctor just figured it was due to hormonal changes so I let it go for a couple months until it got to the point of me not being able to wear a bra. I saw my doctor and she said it was an abcess, so we did the typical I&D(incision and drainage)I had 5 seperate abcesses that all came back sterile and no infection. I have been on antibiotics several times. We finally got them healed, and I had my baby. About a month into breast feeding two more appeared. Same story with the test all sterile no infection. I asked to make sure it wasn't IBC, my doctor seems confident it's not but it still scares me. We had to open one and aspirate the other. Since I was BF my baby my healing took a long time and had to have it packed everyday for a month and a half while BF. I also developed a cord that ran from my scars down to my hip that caused pain raising my arm if stretching. That scared me because I didn't know what it was. I did get it taken care of and it went away. Finally i got my incision closed and continued BF all seemed good. Well I just now noticed a harder lump under one of my scars, hoping its scar tissue, and a softer abcess type in a new spot. I see my doctor thursday and hoping all is ok. I just wish it would go away but am unsure and felt I needed to express myself with others that may have similar problems, since everything I find is no one knows much about it and I'm even in the medical field, it just opened my eyes that we don't have everything figured out in what our bodies do.

I got pregnant in dec 2013 and right around conception developed a lump in my left breast. We thought it was just hormonal changes so I let it go until May 2014 and my doctor said it was abcesses I ended up having 5 seperate abcesses so we went the I&D route one being deep enough for surgery. Got them healed had my baby in September then a month into breastfeeding got two more opened one aspirated the other did packing for a month in a half. It took that long due to BF, had milk going into the cavity. I finally got them healed,but now they have returned. I have been on antibiotics and all my test show sterile abscesses. My doctor also says its not cancer but it is still stressful and depressing i have been dealing with it for more than a year now. Sorry it was long just felt i needed to share.",
