I had a swollen lymph node on the left side of my neck last month, which is now less pronounced, but still there. An U/S done yesterday showed enlarged milk ducts ( I have been lactating from both breast, without elevated prolactin levels, for the past year.) My doc also mentioned a cyst and what may be a fibro adenoma ( this was biopsied in 2005.) Are there any other known conditions that would cause my breast to swell so suddenly? Thanks for your help! BTW- i am 39, white, had thyroid cancer in 1997, have a Pituitary adenoma and an adrenal adenoma that are non- functioning.  My mother died at age 54 of breast cancer, her only symptom was a swollen left breast.  She was stage 4 when diagnosed (1989) She lived three years...

I realize that I will not be dignosed via a discussion board, but was hopeful that someone knew of another possibility for the swelling.  I have not nursed in 9 years, but started to lactate again last year.  I was sure it was related to the pituitary tumor, however, recent tests indicate that it is not.  I will continue to stay positive and await more tests... thanks again for the support!",
