I was so upset when I heard I would lose it.  The first thing I said to anyone who would listen was \" I wish I didn't have to lose my hair\".  I did cut it to just below my chin a few weeks before chemo started.  It started falling out in hunks about 2.5 weeks after my first treatment. I had to shave it as it was getting everywhere.  I had my husband do it and not right to the scalp but maybe number 2's or 3's I think.  I never did lose that stubble.  Today 2 months post chemo I have peach fuzz all over the top of my head in places that were almost completely bald and the back well it is completely covered although short.  What is up with it growing mullet-like though I hate that. Bad thing for me is my stylist goes on maternity leave mid-July, right about the time I might need her to shape my very short hair.   I did buy a wig and wear it quite often, now with the extreme heat though I wear it less at least close to home.  The picture of me is with my wig on by the way.   ",
