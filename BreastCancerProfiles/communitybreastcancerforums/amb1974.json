I've always had lumpy breasts and perform regular self exams, but this one feels different and has appeared suddenly in the past few days. I have very small breasts (A cup) and can actually see the outline of it through my skin. It's about 1 1/2 cm long with irregular edges and is very mobile. I'm close to menstruating so it's impossible to tell if the pain is just PMS or the lump itself. There was no history of any cancer in my family at all until about 5 years ago when my 1st cousin developed BC at the age of 46. By the way, I'm 38.  I'm terrified because I currently have no health insurance and doctors/clinics in my state demand payment in full up front.  I know every lump needs to be checked, but does this sound like it could be cancerous?
