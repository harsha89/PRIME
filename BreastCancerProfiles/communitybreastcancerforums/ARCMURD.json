      "Content": "ARCMURD wrote: I had a stereotatic bx back in November for a cluster of microcalcifications that came back benign. They recommended a follow-up diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound in 6 months. That mammogram is coming up next month and I can't help but wonder what they'll find. I know it's no use to worry, but I felt so relieved when my bx. came back benign, and now I feel like this is hanging over my head again. I am curious, though, if they are doing the mammogram as a new baseline, to just see if that area is stable, or both. Also, if they did happen to find more cals can they tell by using the diagnostic mammogram whether they are benign or not? Just praying that I don't end up with another bx. I wish none of us had to go through this. Thanks in advance. Donna Log in to post a reply",
