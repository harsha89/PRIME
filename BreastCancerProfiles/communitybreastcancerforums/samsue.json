Luckily we had some unused office space where I could close the door and chill. Good luck with your decision.... everyone is different.",

My rad dr had me use only aloe and later into the treatment gave me radia-guard to use. He said if my skin broke down to use a triple antibiotic to ward off infection. These helped the itching and burning. After the skin started to peal, similar to any 3rd degree burn, the pain seemed to lesten. Probably somewhat mental because it didn't look so bad! The pains under the arm and at the incision he said was due to the nerve endings being radiated and reacting - which seemed to lessen in time. It's hard to say but the time really went by fast! I went for my treatment at 7:20 AM then went in to work from 8-5. The best advice I was given was \"and this too shall pass\" Yes, some days were better than others....

You were right in going in and speaking to the tech, gosh, can't believe how she could think she was helping! I was lucky also to get my results right away. They saw something and had me come in for an ultrasound within a week. When I had the lump, the surgeon called me the next day. I didn't have a needle biopsy - and after the second sentinel and lump redo.. they had results right away. The hospital that I go to does frozen sections and sometimes holds the surgery up until the path report is completed that way they know if they need to do anything more. Can't imagine waiting as long as you have stage1 Welcome to the newbie's - glad you found this website... it's been a lifesaver for many.",

Our office has project managers and \"we're\" their support group... they would fall flat on their faces if they didn't have us around. They have never hired a woman as a project manager! I just leave the work at work now and get outside in the yard as much as possible. Nature does wonders for my soul. I think because we are women that we have this \"nurturing/fixing\" mentality sometimes and feel we have to do better when we are already better. Fear an anxiety used to follow me around as constant companions. Now, I take time for myself.... and talk to the ladies here. Better company!",

The ladies there are very informative and have so much info. Have you seen a therapist yet? Lymphedema isn't something you would want to put off. Granny, I finally found a bra that works for me... soft cup, no under-wire and a large band that goes around the ribs. Got it at Coles. I've been wearing the sports bras for 1 1/2 years now. They are my staple and found a couple that really work for me and don't hurt. I mainly bought them at WMart. They have the ones that fasten in the front with the straps over the shoulders instead of \"sport\" type straps. Also they have the \"uni\" that I really like when I'm at home.... doesn't hurt. I also use melatonin because it's one of the vitamins that was recommended for sleep and prevention of BC.",

One thing I did do and wish I hadn't was carry my small phone in my bra... yep, I didn't have a holster for it and when I went to baseball games or sometimes even at work, I would \"hide\" it in my bra. Right side, right BC. I'm baking some pumpkin \"pie\" right now. I don't like the crust so I just bake the pumpkin using my recipe for the filling. Instead of canned milk, I use almond milk, two eggs and honey. I like lots of spice so add enough to give it a \"kick\". Can't wait until it's ready to eat!",
