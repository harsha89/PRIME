It showed the cluster clearly and I had a wire guided excisional biopsy- the surgeon and I agreeed that it was better outside of my body. Thankfully, it showed fibrocystic changes! I have bc history on my father and mother's side. In Dec. I had a follow up on that breast and the radiologist found somenthing that appears to be benign, so I go back in May. I bet its scar tissue from the lumpectomy. Anyway, bottom line: most likely benign- 80% chance. Good luck, and please somehow try not to panic- I know it's near impossible, but don't worry until you have to. The odds are absolutely on your side.",
