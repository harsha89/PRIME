I have very short hair and thin eyebrows at 10 wks PFC. Decided to try my first no-hat outing today. Didn't get any out-and-out staring, but caught most women glancing, looking shocked and then determinedly looking away. My take: some might be offended by the GI Jane look. But I think most flash on CANCER OMG THAT WOMAN HAD/HAS CANCER and are extremely uncomfortable. Unsure whether I'll go hatless again until I've achieved a decent pixie in a couple of months. But it was an interesting experiment.",
