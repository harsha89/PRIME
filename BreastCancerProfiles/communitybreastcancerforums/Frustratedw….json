I do use a cream the Dr. gave me 3x day and like you not 4 hrs before. They told me the tattoo would be like an ant bite. I felt they lied lol. I don't feel the radiation at all. Good luck. Wanted to add that I am tired much sooner than I expected. It is very different than being tired with the chemo. If I rest I feel better where the chemo was a never ending tired.",

My surgeon had to put in a drain about a month after surgery for a seroma. I have had the tube in for 5 weeks and I am wondering if this has happened to anyone else. If so how long did you have to have the drain in? It is keeping me from having the radiation.",

The surgeon said to use it as little as possible. Thanks for your response Fe Princess It is very scary. My surgeon did warn me he did not put a drain in right away either. Not sure if it would have helped or not. I wouldn't care except it is delaying the radiation. Thank you for answering .",

Fe Princess I don't think I ever answered your question. I don't know the stage, I didn't want to know, afraid if it was to far I wouldn't fight as hard. I do know ER/Pr+ and HER2+. I had it in both breasts. The other side was ER+ PR- and HER2+. I was very blessed in that I had 6 tcph and had total response in left side. The other semi complication was the DR. didn't get clear margins on the right and had to go back. He did get clear margins the second time. I'm on herceptin now along with armidex(sp) and hopefully I'll get the radiation going in the next week or so.",

I unfortunately had cancer in both breasts and ended up just having to have lumpectomy on both sides. I did develop a seroma on the other side however, it was very small and reabsorbed right away. The surgeon said that it is not common to get one. In fact I posted on a group on facebook that I belong to and only one person responded that they had one.",
