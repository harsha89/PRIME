    "Content": "kristinpianista wrote: Hi, I'm curious about this. I'm the patient of a \"famous\" doc at ucsf, and haven't seen her in the flesh since last August, and am not scheduled to see her until at least June. I do see her nursing staff monthly, and they consult her on all decisions, but I feel a bit ignored. I am stable since last May, have been off chemo since September and currently get tamoxifen, zolodex, and zometa, so I'm definitely still in treatment. I'd love a reality check. I have my monthly appointment with her nurse tomorrow and am considering throwing a hissy fit. What do you think? Thanks, Kristin .
