Re your comment: \"since she was equivocal x 3 and knew of her chromosome 17result (done on Oncotype) thought maybe they had sent oncotype for further info.\" Tinyfrog said the tumor was \"positive on a test called Chromsome 17 probe\", and that the HER2 status is now being reviewed by the tumor board. She also said: \"If they [the tumor board] decide to go with HER2-, then she [the MO] will run the oncotype.\" It seems from this, that she has received a test that assesses HER2:CEN-17 ratios, but has not yet received the Oncotype test. The wording above in bold font might be read to suggest that chromosomal CEN-17 testing is \"done on Oncotype.\" For the benefit of other members who are not familiar with these tests, I note that the Oncotype test and tests that determine HER2:CEN-17 ratios are distinct tests conducted for different purposes. The Oncotype test for invasive disease is a a gene expression profiling test (\"GEP\") that relies on quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (\"RT-PCR\") to measure the levels of messenger RNAs (\"mRNAs\") transcribed from 16 cancer-related genes and from 5 control genes (\"21-gene test\"). Computer-based methods are used to calculate a \"Recurrence Score\" (\"RS\") from the mRNA expression data, and the recurrence risk information associated with the particular RS is used to inform decisions about whether to add chemotherapy to endocrine therapy in hormone receptor-positive, HER2 negative disease. The Oncotype test provides no information about HER2:CEN-17 ratios. BarredOwl",

With a bilateral oophorectomy (because of your BRCA2 status), you would be considered post-menopausal and would have the choice of tamoxifen or an AI. These have different side effect profiles. You can discuss the relative pros and cons of these with your MO in light of your medical history and diagnosis. The selection of an appropriate chemotherapy regimen requires the expertise and training of a medical oncologist, so it will be helpful for you to have an initial recommendation from your MO about specific regimens they feel are suitable for consideration in your specific case. You can ask about pros, cons, and side effect profiles, and whether any particular regimen(s) may be preferred in their view, and if so why. That will help you focus your research, and you may also consider a second opinion if you wish. Here is more information about the validation studies featured in your node-negative Oncotype report and another study with an aromatase inhibitor, if you are interested. In the node-negative (\"N0\") Oncotype report, the first section of the report provides your Recurrence Score and the average 10-yr distant recurrence risk with 5-years of tamoxifen that is associated with that particular Recurrence Score (to the left of the graph). This information comes from the results of Paik 2004, which was an Oncotype validation study that used archived (stored) tissues for Oncotype testing that were from node-negative patients who participated in the NSABP B-14 trial (\"B14\") for whom long-term distant recurrence data was available. The first graph in the node-negative report is based on Figure 4 from this study, which illustrates the relationship between Recurrence Score and 10-year distant recurrence with 5-years of tamoxifen alone. The NSABP B-14 trial was a tamoxifen trial, so the patients had received 5-yrs of tamoxifen. Paik (2004): http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa041588 The second section of the node-negative report concerns the potential benefit of adding chemotherapy, and is based on the results of Paik 2006, another Oncotype validation study. This study used archived tissues and distant recurrence data from the NSABP B-20 (\"B20\") trial, in which node-negative patients received tamoxifen alone or chemotherapy plus tamoxifen. See e.g., Figures 4 and 3B. Paik (2006): http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/24/23/3726.full.pdf Another validation study looked at the test in patients who had received 5-years of the aromatase inhibitor Anastrozole. This study used samples and 9-yr recurrence rates from the tamoxifen arm and the anastrozole arms of the ATAC trial, in node-negative and node-positive postmenopausal women with localized breast cancer. \"Prediction of Risk of Distant Recurrence Using the 21-Gene Recurrence Score in Node-Negative and Node-Positive Postmenopausal Patients With Breast Cancer Treated With Anastrozole or Tamoxifen: A TransATAC Study\" Dowsett (2010): http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/28/11/1829.full.pdf Best, BarredOwl",

Imaging can raise suspicions, but until the biopsy results are in, there is some possibility of a benign condition. Sometimes, it can be helpful to take someone with you to the appointment to have a second set of ears and another notetaker, assuming they are a calm and organized trusted person. You may also prefer not to take anyone. The doctor will review the key findings of pathology report with you. However, you can request copies of the radiologist's written reports from all of your recent imaging and a copy of the written pathology report, so you can review these yourself at home and keep them in your files. (Sometimes, they prefer to provide the pathology report after the doctor reviews it with you.) Good luck! Sending positive thoughts your way. BarredOwl  ",

Many members here consulted two or three different plastic surgeons, and found that they have different skill sets and can take quite different approaches regarding timing, etcetera. Your surgeon's education, residency and fellowship (if I recall correctly) appeared to be that of a Breast Surgeon, not a plastic surgeon. For example, the plastic surgeon I consulted was Board Certified in Plastic Surgery (American Board of Plastic Surgery). His training included an Internship in general surgery; Residency in plastic surgery; and Fellowship in Hand/Microsurgery. He performed plastic surgery as essentially all of his practice. I note that this page from Johns Hopkins regarding oncoplastic surgery seems to suggest that Plastic Surgeons typically perform the plastic procedures on both breasts: http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/breast_center/treatments_services/reconstructive_breast_surgery/oncoplastic_surgery.html \"At the time of your lumpectomy, the surgical oncologist will remove the tumore [sic] and the lymph nodes. The plastic surgeon will perfom a bilateral breast reduction or lift, removing breast tissue from the cancerous breast as well as modifying the normal breast.\" In my quick scan of the review article you previously posted, I did not find any information as to who was the lead surgeon on the various aspects of each surgery or whether a plastic surgeon participated or not. Theoretically, these examples may not be her work product at all, she may have only observed or assisted, or a plastic surgeon may have participated. In any event, if your breast surgeon plans to perform all aspects of your planned surgery and reduction, please be sure to inquire how many oncoplastic procedures she has done as lead surgeon (with no assistance from a plastic surgeon); how many contralateral reductions she has done by herself (with no assistance from a plastic surgeon); and how many of each such procedures she does annually on average and in 2016. Be sure to request photos of the results of her work (as lead surgeon, and without assistance from a plastic surgeon) from the past year (the same procedures you are having), and inquire whether the photos represent typical outcomes or show the optimum result. With certain types of oncoplastic procedures, if the pathology reveals inadequate margins, re-excision to achieve adequate margins may not be an option, and a mastectomy may be required (conversion to mastectomy). Please be sure to inquire about what would be the next step in the case of inadequate surgical margins, if you have not already done so. In the event that a mastectomy (and reconstruction) were needed, would you still have sought a reduction of the healthy breast? We are all different. These are just some things that I would be thinking and asking about. My best wishes to you as you move forward. BarredOwl",

      "Content": "Jan 12, 2017 08:05AM - edited Jan 12, 2017 08:06AM by BarredOwl Hi jrow7: I am sorry about your recent diagnosis. It was very shocking to me at first. It is hard to believe, but I felt a lot better after I met with the breast surgeon and had a better understanding of what I was dealing with, and as a plan forward was developed. I agree that it appears that both IDC (\"invasive ducal carcinoma\") and DCIS (\"ductal carcinoma in situ\", a form of \"non-invasive\" disease) are present. This is very common. This page from the main site here illustrates the difference between non-invasive DCIS (confined to the interior of the duct) and invasive breast cancer (which has broken through the wall of the duct into surrounding breast tissue): http://www.breastcancer.org/pictures/types/dcis/dcis_range?utm_medium=OBWidget&utm_source=OB It could be clearer, but if I am reading the report correctly, it is saying that in terms of size, the largest focus of IDC is quite small at 0.3 cm in greatest dimension (3 mm). The IDC is said to be \"moderately differentiated,\" a term which typically indicates \"intermediate grade\" or \"Grade 2\". Please confirm it with your team. The grade determination is based on there being \"no tubule formation, moderate to marked nuclear pleomorphism, and up to 9 mitoses/10 high power fields.\" For more information about the determination of \"histologic grade\" for invasive breast cancer using Nottingham Histologic Score (\"Elston Grade\"), see this page from Johns Hopkins: http://pathology.jhu.edu/breast/grade.php The report also mentions: \"There are foci of lymphovascular invasion identified.\" My understanding is that the pathologist looks at the lymph vessels and the blood vessels in the vicinity of tumor for signs of lymphatic invasion (breaking into a nearby lymph vessel) or vascular invasion (breaking into a nearby blood vessel). If they see signs of either of these in the sample, they note \"lymphovascular invasion\" (\"LVI\") is \"identified\" or \"present\". Here is a brief explanation and illustration from the main site here about LVI: http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/diagnosis/vasc_lymph_inv \"LVI\" is an in-breast phenomenon and is not the same thing as lymph node involvement. If you are located in the United States, it is likely that additional tests may be done on the DCIS to determine estrogen receptor (\"ER\") status and progesterone receptor (\"PR\") status. In addition, the IDC will likely be tested to determine ER, PR, and HER2 status. You will probably learn more about these in your consultation at the breast center. In your next appointment, be sure to ask if the above is the complete pathology report or if there is a longer version available. Also inquire whether any addenda or supplements with ER, PR and HER2 status will be made available in due course. You will learn what you need to know as you move forward, and will find a lot of information and support here. General Comment: Microinvasion and \"LVI\" are distinct: Please note that jrow's report does not contain the word \"microinvasion\". However, others may see this word in their pathology reports and should please note that \"microinvasion\" refers to a specific size of invasive breast cancer, specifically a tumor that size-wise only is \"T1mi\", where the tumor ≤ 1 mm in greatest dimension. The word \"microinvasion\" in a pathology report does not mean that lymphovascular invasion (\"LVI\") is present. These are two totally separate phenomena. Invasion of any size (invasion of the breast tissue surrounding a duct) can be present without LVI (when the cancer breaks into a nearby lymph channel or blood vessel). The pathologist separately notes whether LVI is \"present\" (or \"identified\") or is \"not present\" (or \"not identified\"). Best, BarredOwl",

Be sure to request a copy of the radiologist's report for your records (not just some form letter), to obtain the radiologist's professional opinion regarding your current level of density. Here is a brief two-page intro to density from the Mayo Clinic explaining four levels. The two highest categories (heterogeneously dense and extremely dense) are considered \"dense\": http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogr... Here are pictures, showing examples of the four levels (almost entirely fatty at left (good); extremely dense at right): http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogr... Because the fibroglandular tissue is dense, it appears white on a mammogram. Unfortunately, areas of concern also appear white. So dense tissue can make it hard to detect a problem (can't see white against a white background). The higher levels of density can also confer some increased risk of breast cancer, although this is still being studied. In some states, you must be informed of density. BarredOwl",

She states: \"If you or your doctor are uncertain about whether you've got a lump or just lumpy breasts, it's probably not a bad idea to check it out further\" [with a specialist]. While mammograms are more effective in fatty breasts, a negative finding by mammography does not override the suspicion raised by a clinically palpable lump. There may be an error in the interpretation of a screening mammogram, or a tumor may be mammographically occult (invisible by mammography). Such a lump, should be further investigated by other imaging (e.g., ultrasound). Even if you had a negative mammogram, if you have any concern about a lump or lumps, please have a clinical breast exam. Usually your OB-GYN or primary care physician can conduct such an exam. If they are concerned, they can refer you to a specialist for further evaluation. BarredOwl",

The pathology report will include the information regarding the kinds of cancer cells seen, such as for example, invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), the most common kind or something else. The pathology report should also include the results of various tests for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), and in the case of invasive breast cancer, results of HER2 testing. \"HER2\" is also sometimes called HER2/neu, c-erbB-2, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (EGFR2). Here is a section from this site about pathology reports. At the bottom of the page, there is a good .pdf pamphlet, which you can download and print. It is very comprehensive, so not all of the tests will have been done on the biopsy samples. http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/diagnosis/get...

Please note that I am not a doctor and have no medical training. There may be no IBC. There may be no breast cancer. I don't know. It still seems formally possible to me that it could be ordinary breast cancer, with associated Paget's disease (some nipple symptoms). Paget symptoms can be associated with underlying breast cancer, such as DCIS or invasive ductal carcinoma. Some doctors are not very familiar with Paget disease of the breast, because it is not very common. Please read this: http://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/paget-breast-fa... I am not sure how old you are [Edit: Sorry, 25 yrs old). Mammography may be less effective in younger women who tend to have more breast tissue density. Density can reduce sensitivity of detection (may miss some disease). Dense tissue appears white by mammography, and may obscure the signs of cancer, which ordinarily appear white against a black background. In other words, you may not be able to see a white flag in a snow storm. Decreased sensitivity is a limitation of the technique, but it is not a reason to deny a person a mammogram. In fact, my DCIS was diagnosed by mammography despite an \"extremely dense\" (highest category of density) breast. I would request a mammogram. If the cost of care is an issue, there may be a local equivalent of the American Cancer Society in your country, that may be able to help you with such issues by directing you to whatever resources may be available for possible mammography screening.

I am wondering if it is another type of breast condition that may be screen-detectable by mammography. Mammography would seem to be a reasonable step that may identify an issue, and might provide an explanation for continuing symptoms that have not otherwise received a medical diagnosis. Mammograms may detect issues that are not visible on ultrasound: http://www.cancer.org/cancer/breastcancer/detailed... \"Ultrasound has become a valuable tool to use along with mammography because it is widely available and less expensive than other options, such as MRI. Usually, breast ultrasound is used to target a specific area of concern found on the mammogram. Ultrasound helps distinguish between cysts (fluid-filled sacs) and solid masses and sometimes can help tell the difference between benign and cancerous tumors. In someone with a breast tumor, it can also be used to look for enlarged lymph nodes under the arm. The use of ultrasound instead of mammograms for breast cancer screening is not recommended. However, clinical trials are now looking at the benefits and risks of adding breast ultrasound to screening mammograms in women with dense breasts and a higher risk of breast cancer\". I do not question the use of ultrasound in the first instance, but having received a negative result, I do not understand why a mammogram would not be indicated.

Unfortunately, only a trained medical doctor who has conducted a current clinical examination and taken a proper history from you can provide some kind of diagnosis and advise you properly as to the significance (if any) of the pink area. Your neck nodes have been checked by a doctor and you are now scheduled for a thyroid ultrasound, so that will be evaluated. MRI is very expensive in the US, so it is often, but not always, preceded by mammography and ultrasound. There may be some cases where MRI would be recommended, but I do not know what those are (and could not know if they would apply in your case or not). BarredOwl",

The MammaPrint test is based on a 70-gene prognostic signature (\"gene expression signature\") proposed by investigators at the Netherlands Cancer Institute in 2002 (van 't Veer LJ, et al., \"Gene expression profiling predicts clinical outcome of breast cancer,\" Nature, 415(6871):530\u20136 (2002)). http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11823860 A MammaPrint Fresh version (using fresh tissue) received 510(k) approval in June, 2007 and has been marketed in the US since 2008. The test provider recently adapted the test for use with formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues, which are more convenient to use. The \"MammaPrint FFPE\" version of the test received 510(k) approval in January, 2015. However, the underlying technology is essentially the same as the older version of the test approved in 2007, and in fact, the basis for approval was a finding of \"substantial equivalence\" to the predicate \"MammaPrint\" test. I should also clarify that the output of the MammaPrint or MammaPrint FFPE test is a classification as either \"high\" risk or \"low\" risk. FDA documentation for the test provides that (emphasis added by me): \"The MammaPrint® FFPE result is indicated for use by physicians as a prognostic marker only, along with other clinico-pathological factors,\" and further, that \"MammaPrint® FFPE is not indicated as a standalone test to determine the outcome of disease, nor to suggest or infer an individual patient's likely response to therapy. Results should be taken in the context of other relevant clinico-pathological factors and standard practice of medicine.\" It is my understanding that the MammaPrint or MammaPrint FFPE test output does not provide individualized risks, but only provides information about the average risk associated with the high risk cohort or the average risk associated with the low risk cohort. The actual recurrence risk of a specific individual may not be the same as the average risk of their cohort. BarredOwl",

In certain circumstances, it may be medically appropriate to depart from what consensus guidelines provide. Thus, for any particular individual, the ultimate decision regarding any intervention should include consideration of the relevant clinical and pathological factors, as well as personal medical history, family history, age, and co-morbidities, etc. Such decisions include a risk/benefit analysis. One should inquire about estimated personal risk of loco-regional recurrence, estimated risk of distant recurrence, the purpose of the intervention, the risks associated with the intervention, and the estimated benefit of the intervention in terms of risk reduction that may be achieved in her case. The possible risks of treatment must be weighed against the possible benefits, in light of one's personal risk tolerance.

There is some associated DCIS (quite common), but the IDC will determine treatment. As I mentioned yesterday in another one of your threads, for a woman in her early fifties, with lumpectomy for invasive ductal carcinoma now determined to be 1.5 centimeters, a course of radiation is quite likely to be recommended. You and your mother can ask her radiation oncologist for an estimate of the risk reduction benefit of radiation in her particular case to help you both understand the potential benefit it offers her in terms of reducing her risk of loco-regional recurrence. It may be substantial. Given the size of the tumor (1.5 cm IDC) and hormone receptor-positive status, endocrine therapy (e.g., tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor) will likely be recommended in accordance with guidelines from National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the American Society of Clinical Oncologists (ASCO). At this time, there is not enough information available to reliably predict whether chemotherapy and/or HER2-targeted therapy will be recommended or not. As SpecialK noted, the results of HER2 testing were equivocal, necessitating \"reflex testing\", in this case to be done by SISH. The results of the SISH test are not available at this time. If determined to be clearly HER2-positive by SISH, then the patient would have IDC, 1.5 cm (15 mm), node-negative, hormone-receptor positive, HER2-positive disease, and under current treatment guidelines for breast cancer from the NCCN (Version 1.2016), for tumors >1 cm with those specific features, the guidelines recommend chemotherapy plus HER2-targeted therapy (trastuzumab), so in the ordinary case, that would be the likely recommendation received (if HER2-positive): Adjuvant chemotherapy (category 1) with trastuzumab (category 1) I note that the use of MammaPrint test is not included in the NCCN guidelines (Version 1.2016) (or relevant 2016 ASCO guideline) in the possible situation of a HER2-positive tumor that is \"T1c\" in size (T1c Tumor > 10 mm but ≤ 20 mm in greatest dimension). However, one should not hesitate to inquire about any test to obtain current expert advice. If determined to be clearly HER2-negative, then the patient would have IDC, 1.5 cm (15 mm), node-negative, hormone-receptor positive, HER2-negative disease. If this was the situation, then the OncotypeDX test for invasive disease would be an excellent option, in accordance with both NCCN and ASCO guidelines, and may potentially provide very useful prognostic and predictive information helpful in decision-making about chemotherapy. The Recurrence Score information will be used to inform the choice of (a) endocrine therapy versus (b) endocrine therapy plus chemotherapy. I am a layperson only. The above is for information only, and all information above should be confirmed with her providers to ensure receipt of accurate, current, case-specific expert professional medical advice.

Breast surgeon #2 agreed with this approach, and given my zero interest in reconstruction, she achieved flat and smooth (without the aid of plastic surgeon.) Unfortunately, others have not been so lucky and it is an outrage. There are members here where who specifically requested no reconstruction, and asked to be made as flat as possible, but their breast surgeon did not comply with that request (i.e., made no attempt at flat). Instead, the surgeon substituted his judgment and intentionally left large amounts of extra skin for the purposes of a delayed reconstruction, because he thought the woman would change her mind or he thought she should seek reconstruction because of his value system, despite her express wishes and statements to the contrary. If you have any doubt that your wishes will be respected, do not hesitate to find a different breast surgeon. Be sure your surgeon understands that you will not change your mind and and respects your wishes to be as flat and smooth as possible. Until such time as the medical profession does a better job in this area, to avoid any possible misunderstanding, some here have recommended documenting the choice of non-reconstruction and the desire for a surgical result that is as flat and smooth as possible and feasible in writing in your medical records, and/or on your surgical consent form. Request copies of all such documentation for your records. It is also good practice to remind the surgeon of your choice in pre-op. Best, BarredOwl",

Unsure of this test as I was preparing for the Oncotype score.\" It sounds like you may have received a MammaPrint test (Result: \"High Risk\"), and perhaps in addition, a BluePrint test (Result: Luminal-type B). The following tests are part of a test suite (set of three tests) offered by Agendia Inc.: (1) \"MammaPrint\" (different versions rely on tumor tissue prepared in different manners) (a) \"Mammaprint\" (done with fresh frozen tumor tissue); OR (b) \"MammaPrint FFPE\" (done with Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded tissue) (2) \"BluePrint\" (for molecular subtype); (3) \"TargetPrint\" (re how active the ER, PR and HER2 genes are). The output of the MammaPrint or MammaPrint FFPE test is a classification as either \"high risk\" or \"low risk\". FDA documentation for the MammaPrint FFPE test provides (emphasis added by me): http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/K1... \"The MammaPrint® FFPE result is indicated for use by physicians as a prognostic marker only, along with other clinico-pathological factors.\" \"MammaPrint® FFPE is not indicated as a standalone test to determine the outcome of disease, nor to suggest or infer an individual patient's likely response to therapy. Results should be taken in the context of other relevant clinico-pathological factors and standard practice of medicine.\" It is my understanding that the MammaPrint or MammaPrint FFPE test output (\"High Risk\" or \"Low Risk\") does not provide individualized risks, but provides information about the average risk associated with the high risk cohort or the average risk associated with the low risk cohort. (The actual recurrence risk of a specific individual may not be the same as the average risk of their cohort.) In the US, the MammaPrint test has not been used as much as the Oncotype DX test for invasive disease. This may reflect a number of considerations, including the ability of Oncotype Recurrence Scores (RS) to independently predict benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy, in addition to providing prognostic information regarding recurrence risk (although chemotherapy benefit is not currently clear in the intermediate range). (Standard ranges for Recurrence Scores are low risk RS <18; intermediate risk RS = 18 to 30; high risk RS ≥31.) In addition, it may also reflect the differing treatment of the tests in consensus guidelines from NCCN (which favor OnctoypeDX) and from ASCO (which did not include MammaPrint, pending further validation by MINDACT): ASCO 2016 Guideline: http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/early/2016/02/05/JCO.2015.65.2289.full The MammaPrint test is the subject of the MINDACT trial. Results of the primary analysis will be presented in the next few days at the AACR meeting, and may be of great interest to you: Agendia Announcement: http://www.agendia.com/mindact-results-will-be-pre... \"Primary analysis of the EORTC 10041/ BIG 3-04 MINDACT study: a prospective, randomised study evaluating the clinical utility of the 70-gene signature (MammaPrint®) combined with common clinical-pathological criteria for selection of patients for adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer with 0 to 3 positive nodes\" will be presented during the AACR Annual Meeting 2016 (16 \u2013 20 April, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA \u2013 www.aacr.org). If you do not already have copies of your test reports, please ask for copies so you can independently confirm the actual results obtained (classification as high risk, Luminal-type B, etc.), and see exactly what the report states about recurrence risk, etc. If you have any questions about the implications of your \"high risk\" and \"luminal-type B\" classifications and how they should be viewed, do not hesitate to discuss it further with your medical oncologist.

Specifically, according to information from the ACR, in ultrasound, the margins or outer border of a mass are described as either (a) \"circumscribed\" or (b) \"not circumscribed.\" If \"not circumscribed\", they can be further specified as indistinct, angular, microlobulated or spiculated. With regard to orientation, I found information that the \"orientation\" of a mass can be described as \"parallel\" or \"not parallel\". If one were an ultrasound specialist, the findings in your report of a \"parallel\" orientation and 1:00 axis (a possible clock reference) probably contain the answer to your question about the orientation of the longer 1.1 cm dimension. It is probably best to discuss the implications of the ultrasound findings and any questions you may have about them in your upcoming meeting with the surgeon. Remember to take a copy of your report with you, and write down your questions in advance so you don't forget to ask them. Hoping for a benign result for you. BarredOwl",

In parallel, you may also wish to obtain a second opinion review of all imaging and pathology to date, to obtain professional confirmation that breast cancer has been appropriately eliminated. They could also provide you with their professional advice re whether any further imaging would be of value (now or within a certain period of time), in light of the factors you noted. It would be best to look for a center of excellence, with a comprehensive breast center, where they will have experience in evaluating IBC cases. For example, if you are reasonably near an NCI-designated cancer center, that is a great option. You may need to travel a bit farther, but it is worthwhile to tap into that expertise. http://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-role/cancer-cen... Others have recommended NCCN-member institutions: http://www.nccn.org/members/network.aspx If interested, confirm insurance coverage of a second opinion, and be sure to confirm the institution/doctors are in network. Contact them to ask about their process and how to go about collecting/sending any materials they may need to review (e.g., actual pathology slides sent overnight, copies of imaging, written reports, etc.) In my case, with a diagnosis of extensive DCIS and a recommendation for unilateral mastectomy from a reputable regional hospital in the Boston area, I sought a second opinion at Mass General just to confirm. I was rather stunned when they confirmed the initial diagnosis, but ordered a diagnostic mammogram for an area of suspicion on the other breast. This led to biopsy, and diagnosis of bilateral breast cancer. IBC is a more challenging diagnosis, so it would not be unreasonable at all to pursue a second opinion. There is value in peace of mind, even if the result is confirmatory. BarredOwl",

Routine blood work cannot diagnose breast cancer. You must go and get checked out. A breast change should be evaluated a doctor (e.g., primary care physician, OB/GYN). Breast cancer is diagnosed by a combination of clinical breast examination, imaging (e.g., mammogram, ultrasound), and tissue biopsy. Make an appointment with the doctor. Before the appointment, write down all the changes and symptoms you see or feel in the breast area and underarm. Take the list to your appointment to make sure you report all changes and symptoms.

I don't think they are actually being destroyed, but they are definitely being fired on all cylinders. The fear and worry of the unknown can be overwhelming. I had serious difficulties focusing and thinking clearly during the diagnostic phases. From other threads, it sounds like you have had a diagnostic mammogram, an ultrasound, and are awaiting a biopsy to be done on 9/15. Is that correct? One thing to keep in mind, is that until surgery, the size of a biopsied and malignant lesion is not really finalized. Imaging can give a general, but not a super precise guide about size. [Edited to correct error: According to information from the ACR, in ultrasound, the margins or outer border of a mass are described as either (a) circumscribed or (b) not circumscribed. If not circumscribed, they can be further specified as indistinct, angular, microlobulated or spiculated.] Hope others who had an ultrasound can advise you regarding this question: When reading the measurement of your mass, which comes first, height? Depth? Or width? How do you know if it's \"taller than wide?\" Is there any reference to a clock face or caliper measurements in your report? Any reference to a long axis running in a particular direction (e.g., medial to lateral)? BarredOwl  ",

Luckily, Leaf has provided a link with information on the possibility of a fibroadenoma regressing. I'm not sure what was observed about the lymph node or where it was located (e.g., intramammary (in the breast), axillary (under the arm)). Sometimes, an imaging report will just mention something that was seen by the radiologist in or near the area of interest, merely as an incidental observation (basically, \"I saw a node in the area\"). Other times, a report may mention something, because it is not completely normal in appearance (for example, \"enlarged node\" or \"X mm node\"). Not being totally normal can still be benign as in 614's case, for example, due to local inflammation or something. It is always a good idea to confirm things with a professional, in case there is another explanation or interpretation. It is also an excellent way to ensure active consideration of such issues. I recommend you start making a follow-up question list, and include the question of a possible referral for genetic counseling, possible explanations for the \"missing\" lump, and for the observed \"node\" (is this normal? what are the possible implications?). You can take up these questions plus any others you have when you meet with the doctors to discuss the results of the MRI. Meanwhile, I would be inclined to contact the gynecologist's office immediately, remind them what contraceptive product you are taking, inform them of all current breast symptoms and lumps, of the imaging and work-up that is underway, and ask them for a recommendation of when you should be seen to discuss it and possible alternatives (in case they might recommend you come in right away).

There was no expert interpretation or correlation with what had been seen in the original imaging, and what she thinks she saw. So I am not that surprised that what she saw has not been confirmed. Has a radiologist prepared a written report for the most recent imaging? Be sure to get a copy of that, and for all prior imaging, and confirm that the surgeon's advice is consistent with any recommendations from the radiologist. MRI is quite sensitive, so maybe that will yield more information or some clarity. Being young, it could be fibrocystic or some benign thing. Being young can sometimes present some hurdles to the idea of breast cancer (as a lower probability event), so you need to advocate for yourself as you are doing. Successfully I would say as you are scheduled for the MRI. With a strong family history, including some early onset disease, have you asked about a referral to a genetic counselor? They would do a formal familial risk assessment and advise you about whether genetic testing is recommended, as well as explain the pros, cons and limitations of testing. Good luck!

I provided some information on the second opinion process in my second post above. The second opinion should be at an independent institution. As I mentioned, the second opinion place will help you to arrange for your copies of your medical records, copies of mammograms, ultrasounds, the actual pathology slides, etc. to be sent to them. They will review the actual images and slides independently and provide you with their opinion about them and their meaning. As part of the process, they will also determine whether any further imaging and/or testing is recommended in their professional opinion. Remember to ask about a consultation with a Medical Oncologist. As you may know, prior to surgery, stage can only be estimated roughly. The actual stage will be determined following surgery, after the surgically removed tissues are examined by a pathologist. A \"sentinel node biopsy\" is also performed to remove a few axillary (underarm) lymph nodes that are examined by the pathologist as part of the staging process. In the meantime, if you are in the US, you are entitled to copies of your medical records. Please be sure to request copies of all written reports of the radiologist from your mammograms, the ultrasound, and the ultrasound guided biopsy for your records. Also request a copy of the pathology report from the biopsy, and any addenda or supplement to that report. These materials should contain the results of tests for ER, PR and HER2 status. With IDC, all three of these should be tested prior to finalizing your surgical plan. Good luck! BarredOwl ",

      "Content": "Sep 27, 2016 11:35AM - edited Sep 27, 2016 11:40AM by BarredOwl Hi Summer2016: Did you have reconstruction? Even without reconstruction, bilateral mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy (\"SNB\") can sometimes lead to arm, shoulder, and other issues that cause pain. I recommend that you contact the office of your breast surgeon to report your pain symptoms and request an evaluation and/or appropriate referrals (e.g., qualified lymphedema therapist/physical therapist). Be sure to tell them that some exercises are causing you severe and lasting pain, and ask if it may be better to dial back each exercise to the point of gentle stretch with no pulling or pain, and/or reducing the number of repetitions, or even skipping certain exercises (doing only what you can do until you can be evaluated). I had no reconstruction, but I could not raise my arms even to shoulder height. I simply could not do some exercises. I was advised that if my range of motion did not return within three weeks, to seek a referral for physical therapy. Because of range of motion problems (both sides), possible frozen shoulder (left side), and axillary cording (both sides), I obtained a referral to a physical therapist (PT) who was also a certified lymphedema therapist (CLT) with experience treating breast cancer patients (PT, CLT-LANA). Here is some very general information about possible causes of pain, not in any order: (a) Lymphedema: As you may know, lymphedema can occur following surgery and/or node removal due to disruption of lymph channels. Excess fluid (lymph) can collect in tissues causing edema (swelling). This can also cause pain and heaviness in the arm or other affected site. Lymphedema can occur in some cases following SNB. The risk of lymphedema is a life-long risk (it may appear any time, even years later), and once it appears, it is a life-long condition. It should be treated as soon as possible to bring it under control, because it can be progressive. For some basic introduction to the risk of developing lymphedema and the condition itself, please see this site. There is also information on self-care and risk reduction steps that you can take to try to avoid or control it. http://www.stepup-speakout.org The site recommends limiting stretch to the axilla (underarm) in the post-surgical period. (Interestingly, I did not receive that advice from my surgeon, but for me it was a moot point as I could not even raise them to shoulder height.) http://www.stepup-speakout.org/riskreduction_for_lymphedema.htm \"Limit your arm movement to shoulder height for the first 10-14 days post-op to allow the efferent and afferent vessels to connect during the limited time of lymphatic regeneration.\" It is a good idea to obtain a referral to a certified lymphedema therapist (\"CLT\") for a baseline evaluation either before surgery or shortly after, including baseline arm measurements. A therapist can also provide guidance about self-care, appropriate preventive measures, and safe approaches to exercise. Here is some information about how to find one, or your breast surgeon may be able to refer you to one: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm (b) Cording or Axillary Web Syndrome \"Cording\" can also cause arm pain. In my case, it severely limited range of motion. I also experienced pain when moving or extending my arm, but not at rest. The pain was along the inside of my underarm, elbow and wrist. Often, you can clearly see a \"cord\". Here is some information about it: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Cording_and_Axillary_Web_Syndrome.htm (c) Frozen shoulder or other shoulder problems Frozen shoulder can occur after breast surgery, causing pain and restricting range of motion. Some shoulder problems can lead to pain in the medial upper arm (outer side). I had this on one side, and physical therapy was very beneficial. (d) Post-mastectomy Pain Syndrome (\"PMPS\") or nerve-related issues As noted by others, nerves are impacted by surgery, which can lead to pain problems. For example, with PMPS, pain is typically localized to the anterior/lateral chest wall, axilla, and/or medial upper arm according to this information: http://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome (e) Scar tissue or adhesions These may cause pain along the scar line, chest, and underarm area. A physical therapist may use techniques such as gentle massage of the scar area or myofascial release methods. There may be other causes of pain, so it is best to check in with your breast surgeon, find out what is going on, and obtain treatment. BarredOwl",

This is extremely fast. Naturally, you feel you are not ready and are being pushed. From the information you provided, there does not seem to be any medical necessity for such a hurry. I would call them first thing in the morning, and cancel the surgery. Explain that you are not ready to proceed with such a major surgery only two days after diagnosis, and you would like time to obtain a second opinion regarding your diagnosis and treatment plan, unless there is a medical basis for the urgency (which has not been communicated to you). You can reschedule for a few weeks from now if you wish. While I do not think you should wait months, it is very common for people to take a few weeks to obtain a second opinion with a diagnosis of IDC. When you arrange for a second opinion, the opinion will include a review of copies of all imaging (e.g., mammogram, ultrasound, MRI), a pathologist will review the actual slides of tissue from your biopsy (slides are sent overnight), and you can obtain another opinion regarding treatment, including whether a mastectomy is appropriate. Sometimes, additional images may be recommended. You can ask for a breast surgeon, radiologist and medical oncologist to consult with you. Sometimes, people receive chemotherapy type treatments before surgery, which is why a person might consult a medical oncologist before surgery. This is done most often with triple negative (ER negative, PR negative, HER2 negative) disease or with HER2+ disease. Do you know your estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 status? If not, that would be another reason for a second opinion: to get a better understanding of your diagnosis and understand the available treatment options. BarredOwl",

There are a couple of sections (see list at upper left), so be sure to review them all. http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/second_opini... It would be best to look for a center of excellence, with a comprehensive breast center. For example, if you are reasonably near an NCI-designated cancer center, that is a great option. You may need to travel a bit farther, but it is worthwhile to tap into that expertise. http://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-role/cancer-cen... Others have recommended NCCN-member institutions: http://www.nccn.org/members/network.aspx If interested, confirm insurance coverage of a second opinion, and be sure to confirm the institution/doctors are in network. Contact them to ask about their process and how to go about collecting/sending any materials they may need to review (e.g., actual pathology slides sent overnight, copies of imaging, written reports, etc.) They will help you. Once you have that additional input and opportunity for discussion, you will feel better. You may choose to be treated by the current team or may find you would rather pursue treatment with the second opinion team. I sought a second opinion, and it changed my treatment plan. I choose to be treated by the second opinion team. BarredOwl",

For example, margin sizes are an additional consideration for post-mastectomy radiation under NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer (Version 2.2016; Chart BINV-3, \"LOCOREGIONAL TREATMENT OF CLINICAL STAGE I, IIA, OR IIB DISEASE OR T3, N1, M0\"). Also, under NCCN Guidelines applicable to invasive breast cancer, post-mastectomy radiation is considered with \"1\u20133 positive axillary nodes\" (Chart BINV-3). ASCO has recently issued a relevant guideline regarding post-mastectomy radiation therapy ('PMRT\") for certain types of invasive disease, which supports an individualized case-specific risk/benefit approach. As noted by ASCO: \"Thus, the decision to recommend PMRT requires a great deal of clinical judgment.\" \"Postmastectomy Radiotherapy: An American Society of Clinical Oncology, American Society for Radiation Oncology, and Society of Surgical Oncology Focused Guideline Update\" - Invasive disease setting http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2016.69.1188#ref-3 Guidelines should be used for background only and are not a substitute for expert medical advice.

(It is out of 50 right?) Her chances of recurrence with chemo and tamoxifen - 10%, without chemo and just radiation and tamoxifen 24%\" Hi GinaDexter1982: Be sure to obtain a copy of your Mom's node-negative (N0) OncotypeDX report for your/her review and records. It is essential to confirm the information provided about her Recurrence Score against the actual report itself (and not a summary in a patient portal), since the recommendation for added chemotherapy is based in large part on this result. (1) Source of the 24% Risk Estimate with Tam Alone: Please confirm it, but the 24% estimate with Tamoxifen alone was probably taken directly from her node-negative (N0) Oncotype report. (See the first graph in her Oncotype report and the Recurrence Risk information printed to the left of first graph on her report.) For purposes of illustration only, here is a link to a SAMPLE node-negative (N0) report from Genomic Health: http://breast-cancer.oncotypedx.com/en-US/Professional-Invasive/Ordering/ReadingTheReports/Node-NegativeReport Here is a screen shot of the first graph in the SAMPLE report for a person with a \"Low Risk\" Recurrence Score of 10, which is associated with a 10-year Risk of Distant Recurrence (after 5 Years of Tamoxifen) or \"Tam Alone\" of 7% (printed to the left of the graph):   You can see that 10-year distant recurrence risk (on the vertical Y-axis) increases as Recurrence Score (on the horizontal X-axis) increases. Eyeballing the graph, a Recurrence Score of 36 looks to be associated with about a 10-year risk of distant recurrence of about 24%. ===> Please check your Mom's report to confirm the \"10-year Risk of Distant Recurrence with Tam Alone\" associated with a score of 36. It will be printed to the left of the first graph. Please note that this 10-year recurrence risk is the risk of distant (metastatic) recurrence. The recurrence risk information provided in the first graph of the node-negative (N0) Oncotype report is based on the results of a clinical trial in a group of patients who were assigned to receive 5-years of tamoxifen, and their observed rates of distant recurrence over 10 ten years according to their Recurrence Scores (Paik (2004)). The first graph in the node-negative report is based on Figure 4 of Paik (2004): Paik (2004): \"A Multigene Assay to Predict Recurrence of Tamoxifen-Treated, Node-Negative Breast Cancer\" Main Page: http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa041588#t=article Free PDF: http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa041588  (2) Range of Possible Recurrence Scores of the OncotypeDX test for invasive breast cancer is 0 to 100 Re: It is out of 50 right? NO, it is out of 100. Although the first graph only includes scores up to 50, the Recurrence Score can be a value from 0 to 100. There are some members here with Recurrence Scores above 50, although this is not very common. According to Paik (2004) (linked above), which is the source of the first graph in the report: \"The range of possible recurrence scores was 0 to 100 . . .\" (page 2819, first full paragraph) \"The recurrence score on a scale from 0 to 100 is derived from the reference-normalized expression measurements in four steps.\" (Figure 1, legend) According to the notes in the sample node-negative report: \"The Recurrence Score result is calculated from the gene expression results and ranges from 0-100.\" (Second sentence in notes above the graph) This should be printed above the first graph on your Mom's report. See also, the notes below the first graph of the SAMPLE report above, which indicate the scores are from \"0-100\":  A score of 31 or higher is considered to be in the standard \"high risk\" category.  (3) Potential Benefit of Added Chemotherapy: Please confirm your understanding that the chances of distant recurrence over 10-years \"with chemo and tamoxifen - 10%\". Please ask whether her \"residual risk\" after chemo plus tamoxifen is estimated to be about 10% per your understanding, OR, whether you may have misunderstood and it is estimated that the potential \"risk reduction benefit\" of added chemotherapy is about 10%. The node-negative report includes a second graph that addresses potential benefit of added chemotherapy as compared with Tam alone. Here is what it looks like in the SAMPLE node-negative (N0) report on-line:    This data is taken from a different clinical trial (Paik (2006)) that assessed 10-year risk of distant recurrence according to Recurrence Score in two groups of patients who received either: (1) Tamoxifen alone (solid curve); and (2) Tamoxifen plus chemotherapy (dotted curve): Paik (2006): \"Gene Expression and Benefit of Chemotherapy in Women With Node-Negative, Estrogen Receptor\u2013Positive Breast Cancer\" Main Page: http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/jco.2005.04.7985 (Free PDF available under \"PDF\" tab) The difference between the Y-axis values on these curves for a particular Recurrence Score provides some insight into the potential risk reduction benefit of added chemotherapy for those in the standard \"high risk\" range.  (4) Endocrine Therapy: Tamoxifen or Aromatase Inhibitors (\"AI\") for Post-menopausal women These are pills. Under clinical guidelines from NCCN, adjuvant endocrine therapy is administered after adjuvant chemotherapy. Post-menopausal women with hormone receptor-positive disease (ER+ and/or PR+) formally have the option of Tamoxifen or an Aromatase Inhibitor (Letrozole (FEMARA); Anastrozole (ARIMIDEX); or Exemestane (AROMASIN)). Both are effective and reasonable options. However, AIs show some advantage when compared with Tamoxifen, based on head-to-head trials comparing various AIs to Tamoxifen. They also have different side effect profiles, so personal medical history, including co-morbidities, are possible factors in the choice. Although the Oncotype reports currently feature \"validation\" studies in which Tamoxifen was used, this reflects historical and practical considerations of clinical trial design. In current practice, the use of Oncotype Recurrence Score information does NOT restrict her choice of endocrine therapy. For example, a later Oncotype \"validation\" study was conducted in patients who had received 5-years of the aromatase inhibitor Anastrozole. This study used samples and 9-yr recurrence rates from the tamoxifen arm and the anastrozole arms of the ATAC trial, in node-negative and node-positive postmenopausal women with localized breast cancer. \"Prediction of Risk of Distant Recurrence Using the 21-Gene Recurrence Score in Node-Negative and Node-Positive Postmenopausal Patients With Breast Cancer Treated With Anastrozole or Tamoxifen: A TransATAC Study\" Dowsett (2010): http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/28/11/1829.full.pdf If her MO is recommending Tamoxifen, then ask why Tamoxifen is preferred over an AI in her particular case. If he suggests that an AI is not an option for a person receiving an Oncotype test (which is not true), then you can refer him to Dowsett (2010) or show him a copy, and then seek a second opinion about endocrine therapy.  (5) Second Opinion Should you wish to seek a second opinion, please do not be deterred by the need for some travel. She can still choose to seek the recommended care locally. One can request the second opinion MO to confer with her treating MO. As noted above, many look for an NCI-designated Cancer Center for a second opinion (confirm in-network): https://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-role/cancer-centers/find If traveling for a second opinion, call several days ahead to confirm that all records and materials have been received by the second institution and forwarded to the proper doctors. In addition, take copies of critical documents with you to the appointment, such as all pathology reports from all biopsies and surgeries (any addenda or supplements thereto), including ER, PR and HER2 test results, and a copy of her Oncotype report.

Not sure if this helps, but my reading of the report is that you had a screening mammogram with indeterminate findings, resulting in a BIRADs score of 0: \"BI-RADS: 0 Incomplete Need Additional Imaging Evaluation\". Now a diagnostic mammogram will be done to get a better look at the the three distortions and an ultrasound may be possible later as well. The BIRADs scoring system is explained here: http://www.cancer.org/treatment/understandingyourd... I copied over what is says about the zero score: \"X-ray assessment is incomplete Category 0: Additional imaging evaluation and/or comparison to prior mammograms is needed. This means a possible abnormality may not be clearly seen or defined and more tests are needed, such as the use of spot compression (applying compression to a smaller area when doing the mammogram), magnified views, special mammogram views, or ultrasound. This may also suggest that the mammogram should be compared with older ones to see if there have been changes in the area over time.\" Basically, more imaging is needed before making an estimate of the likelihood it is benign or not. (Compare the descriptors for the additional categories which have an assessment and conclusion.) Hope all goes well for you. Keep us posted. BarredOwl ",

I am a layperson with no medical training, but some initial questions that come to mind are: (a) Are you and your cousin's test results truly different? Or could one of her \"positive\" mutation(s) be the same as your \"unclassified\" variant? The situation should be reviewed to confirm that the current interpretations are accurate. The question arises because different test providers may have more or less information available to them about specific variants, and may or may not agree on the proper classification of the exact same variant. Also, over time, more information may become available about a particular variant (either supporting or refuting a prior classification), so that a person who is tested later may receive different information about the same variant (even with the same test provider). In the case of an actual conflict in classification of a genetic change, some medical genetic expertise may be required to review the information from providers, current available pre-clinical and clinical evidence regarding the variant, and advise you appropriately. If you and your cousin are willing to share results, a genetic counselor or medical geneticist could work with you to evaluate the results and help clarify the situation. (b) If as a result of the investigation in step (a), your variant is still considered \"unclassified\" or a \"VUS\", then the questions become: What is your estimated risk of breast cancer based on your family history (properly interpreted in light of all available genetic test results and what they do or do not say to a professional with the relevant training in medical genetics)? And, is this level of risk sufficient to warrant a recommendation for prophylactic bilateral mastectomy in your case (e.g., based on current consensus guidelines)? The magnitude of the estimated risk and appropriateness of the recommendation is another fact-specific medical genetics question that only a professional can advise you about. My personal feeling is that given the complexity of this very specialized field, a recommendation for prophylactic mastectomy based on family history (even if very strong) may warrant seeking a second expert opinion. (Some insurers might even require one.) If you are in the US, a good option is to look for additional genetic counseling and advice at an NCI-designated cancer center near you: http://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-role/cancer-centers/find Obtaining answers to all your questions, and the opportunity for additional discussion via a second opinion will hopefully increase your understanding of the test results, family history, estimated risk, and appropriate risk reduction options, and provide additional perspective and input of value to help you reach a decision about what is best for you. Good luck! BarredOwl",

Thus, even with mastectomy, there is a small risk of loco-regional recurrence (e.g., in the breast or regional lymph nodes). In addition, mastectomy is a local treatment only. It removes the tumor. However, the tumor was in there a long time before it was removed. During that time, some tumor cells may have left the breast via the lymph and/or the bloodstream, and settled at distant sites, raising a risk of distant recurrence (i.e., metastatic recurrence). The risk of this having happened is greater with more agressive disease, such as HER2-positive disease and/or with lymph node involvement. Systemic therapies, like chemotherapy, HER2-targeted therapy (if HER2-positive), and endocrine therapy (for hormone receptor-positive disease) are used to address the risk of distant recurrence. Because she has hormone receptor-positive disease (in her case both estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and progesterone receptor-positive (PR+) disease), she is a candidate for endocrine therapy. As I explained above, with a greater the risk of distant recurrence, more intensive approaches to endocrine therapy may be warranted (e.g., ovarian suppression plus tamoxifen or an AI; or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy plus tamoxifen or an AI).

The breast has small blood vessels and lymph vessels going through it. Either system may be used by tumor cells to escape the breast. If they have the capability to do so, cancer cells may break into a nearby lymph channel in the breast and travel through the lymph system to regional lymph nodes. Cancer cells may also break into a local blood vessel and travel elsewhere via the bloodstream. The pathologist looks at the lymph vessels and the blood vessels in the vicinity of the tumor for signs of lymphatic invasion (breaking into a lymph vessel) or vascular invasion (breaking into a blood vessel). If they don't see signs of either of these in the sample, they may note \"lymphovascular invasion\" (\"LVI\") is not identified. BarredOwl",

If you have not already done so, please obtain a copy of the actual pathology report for your records so you can see exactly what it says. You did not mention surgical margins at all, but if they were inadequate, that might suggest re-excision. (I am not sure.) This is another reason to obtain a copy of the pathology report. You are right to be concerned about the possibility of over-treatment (and concomitant risks) in the face of unclear pathology findings. Rose50 makes an excellent point about the option of seeking a second opinion from another institution, preferably one with extensive experience in evaluating breast cancer pathology, such as an NCI-designated cancer center. http://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-role/cancer-cen... Second Opinion: What you have been through is exhausting, but it may be worthwhile to seek a second opinion, particularly regarding the interpretation of the pathology and the surgical recommendation of re-excision and sentinel node biopsy (\"SNB\"). For example, if the second opinion pathology review led to a conclusion of pure atypia, it seems possible that neither re-excision nor SNB would be recommended. If invasive cancer were definitively identified in the pathology review, then SNB at least (with or without re-excision) may be indicated. Another possibility it that the recommendation of re-excision would be confirmed for some reason, but in the absence of a definitive diagnosis of invasive disease, you might have the option of deferring sentinel node biopsy. I am just a layperson, so there may be other outcomes. Here is a link to a recent study of interest illustrating why a person might want to seek a second opinion about their pathology results (click at upper right to get past the ad to get to the article). Note that atypia presented a higher degree of diagnostic challenge: http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid... The above JAMA article was summarized by breastcancer.org here: http://www.breastcancer.org/research-news/study-on... Some patients choose to seek a second (or third) opinion about one or more of their (1) imaging, (2) pathology, (3) surgical options, and/or (4) post-surgical treatment options. Some seek a pathology review only. Others seek a more complete review of all imaging (mammograms, ultrasound, and MRI (if any)), all associated written reports, and a fresh review of the actual pathology slides (which are sent overnight to the other institution), plus an independent recommendation regarding surgical and/or post-surgical options. If you'd like to learn more about the process, BC.org has a good section about second opinions if you haven't seen it already. There are multiple sections about second opinions, so please see the menu at upper left of the link to review them all. Apparently, some insurance plans may actually require a second opinion. Also check that the proposed second opinion institution and doctors are in-network. http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/second_opini... Sentinel Node Biopsy: My comments below are based on my understanding that atypical cells have been discovered, but it is unclear whether invasive disease is actually present or not. I mentioned above that even if re-excision is indicated, you might have the option of deferring sentinel node biopsy until you have a definitive diagnosis of invasive disease. I realize that deferring SNB could entail a third procedure; however, you might be able to avoid an SNB altogether. As you may know, lymphedema can sometimes develop after SNB, the risk of it showing up is a life-long risk (it may appear years later), and once it appears, it is a life-long condition. Each patient must weigh the risks and benefits as they come to a decision. You can discuss this with your current surgeon, whether or not you decide to seek a second opinion. You may wish to ask the surgeon what the various US consensus treatment guidelines, such as the National Comprehensive Cancer Center (NCCN) or American Society of Clinical Oncologists (ASCO) guidelines recommend with regard to sentinel biopsy in the absence of a definitive diagnosis of invasive disease. If the recommendation for SNB is not within the guidelines, please request an explanation of why it is being recommended in your case. Note that in patients with excision in an anatomic location (e.g., tail of the breast), which could compromise the performance of future SNB procedure, an SNB procedure may be considered. You should ask the surgeon this question to confirm the option to defer SNB is available in your case. If an SNB is indicated, please also be sure to discuss what will be done if some positive sentinel nodes are found during the SNB surgical procedure. For more discussion about SNB in the absence of a finding of invasive disease, please see this discussion (the focus there was pure DCIS, a non-invasive cancer): https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/68/topic/... Experience of Surgical Team in Sentinel Node Biopsy: With regard to sentinel node biopsy (\"SNB\" or \"SLN\" biopsy), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (\"NCCN\") breast cancer treatment guidelines (Version 3_2015) state: \"An experienced SLN team is mandatory for the use of SLN mapping and excision.\" I think that generally a breast surgeon who specializes in the treatment of patients with breast cancer (as close to 100% of their practice) would be the best choice and most likely to have a lot of experience with sentinel node biopsy (versus a general surgeon who does some breast surgeries). I also believe that a breast surgeon specializing in the treatment of patients with breast cancer would also be preferred for re-excision. In my case, I sought a second opinion about my imaging, pathology, and surgical recommendations at Mass General. The pathology (DCIS) was confirmed, but the radiologist disagreed with the interpretation of the imaging. This ultimately led to the diagnosis of bilateral breast cancer (previously thought to be unilateral), and a change in surgical recommendation from unilateral to bilateral mastectomy. I am only a layperson, and there may be errors in my comments or understanding. So please consider this as information only, subject to confirmation with your doctors. I hope it helps you come to an informed decision about your next steps. Don't hesitate to ask us more questions if you need to. BarredOwl  ",

By definition, the tissue of the breast (stroma) has been invaded. Invasive disease (where cells have broken through the wall of the ducts or lobules into surrounding breast tissue) can occur without any lymphovascular invasion (\"LVI\"). Prior to your surgery, perhaps the absence of clinically suspicious nodes (no enlargement on clinical exam); the absence of evidence of LVI on breast biopsy (assuming vessels were seen in the biopsy sample); and normal imaging findings (regional lymph nodes seen were normal in appearance) means there was no basis to be suspicious of lymph node involvement. These are favorable findings, but are not conclusive and do not exclude the possibility of lymph node involvement. That is why a sentinel node biopsy was done. They can use a radiotracer to find the sentinel node(s). When your results are in, be sure to request complete copies of the pathology reports from all biopsies and surgeries, including any supplements or addenda thereto (e.g., containing ER, PR or HER2 testing) and review these yourself.

Is it possible that a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of both ovaries and Fallopian tubes) would be adequate? Regarding your new test results, only a genetic change that is known to confer significant risk of breast cancer or other cancers is definitively bad. Some types of genetic changes may not confer increased risk, or it may not be known if they do or not. Various changes in a particular gene are not created equal: - Some genetic changes are harmful and are referred to as \"pathogenic\" mutations. However, different pathogenic mutations in the same gene may confer different levels of risk for cancer or other conditions. The particular mutation and what is known about it must be considered. - Some genetic variation in genes is normal (blue versus brown eye color), and these changes are sometimes referred to as \"polymorphisms\". There may be evidence that a particular change does not appear to confer increased cancer risk, based on clinical studies of families that carry that specific polymorphism and it may be considered \"neutral\". - The risk associated with some genetic changes is unknown and these are called \"Variants of Unknown Significance\", also referred to as \"variants of uncertain significance\" or \"VUS\"). Such genetic changes have not been adequately characterized. So the associated risk could be near 0%, or some intermediate level, or near the highest level associated with other known pathogenic mutations. It is not known. Are any of the above terms found in your report? Something that \"is not clinically significant\" probably is not a \"pathogenic\" or deleterious variant, but there is not enough information here for us to tell, and you should seek professional advice Will you be meeting with a Genetic Counselor to review the results of your test? If not, please strongly consider requesting a referral to a Genetic Counselor to discuss your results. Such a specialist can advise you about the type of BRIP genetic change found, whether adequate evidence is available about it to conclude that the change is \"not clinically significant,\" and provide you with advice in light of your existing breast cancer diagnosis and any family history. (Occasionally, even in the absence of a pathogenic mutation, personal and family history alone may independently support enhanced surveillance and/or certain risk reduction measures.) BarredOwl",

She cannot assume the surgery is not required or not recommended, merely because it was rescheduled. Here is some general information. As farmerlucy notes, clinical factors (e.g., age) and pathological features of disease that may indicate a higher risk of recurrence inform recommendations for more intensive approaches to endocrine therapy. In general, initial endocrine therapy options may include one or more of the following, depending on various factors, such as type of cancer (e.g., DCIS, IDC), recurrence risk profile, and co-morbidities: Pre-menopausal: (a) Tamoxifen alone; or (b) Tamoxifen plus Ovarian Suppression (to suppress/shut down ovarian function, e.g., with a second drug); or (c) Ovarian Suppression (\"OS\") plus an Aromatase Inhibitor (\"AI\") (in pre-menopausal women, use of an AI requires added OS to shut down ovarian function; using both is intended to stop estrogen production from all sources) If oophorectomy is received, see post-menopausal options Post-menopausal (this includes patients whose ovaries have been removed by bilateral oophorectomy): (a) Tamoxifen; or (b) Aromatase inhibitor Tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, and the drugs used to induce ovarian suppression have different side effect profiles. Oophorectomy has different health impacts. The choice between tamoxifen alone and other more intensive approaches is a personal risk/benefit analysis, that must be made in consultation with a Medical Oncologist (\"MO\") in light of one's risks of loco-regional and distant recurrence, risk of new disease, menopausal status, and overall health and presentation, including medical history or co-morbidities that may be potentially relevant to the particular side effect profiles of a specific drug or intervention. She should ask her MO and/or a second opinion MO to explain the more intensive approaches, their associated side effects, and obtain opinions about whether her specific case warrants the more intensive treatment(s), in light of her risk profile. If her MO is not responsive to her questions, she should not hesitate to seek a second opinion from another MO. By training and experience, the MO should have an expert understanding of the available options, such as tamoxifen, an aromatase inhibitor, an ovarian suppression drug, and/or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (\"BSO\"). They should outline which options are suitable for her to consider, their potential benefits in terms of reducing recurrence risk, and their side effect profiles or risks. They should make a recommendation about which approach is best for her in their opinion, and why it is best. This will help her make an informed decision. Genetic testing results may provide further information that are pertinent to personal risk of new disease. Certain genetic testing results (e.g., a pathogenic mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2, or other genes) and/or very strong family history of certain types of cancer may separately warrant consideration of \"risk reduction surgery\", such as oophorectomy.

You do not need to share any additional information with us. But it is important for your friend to know the answers to these questions, so she has a good understanding of her diagnosis, because it affects her risk profile and shapes the treatment advice she will receive. For example, I don't know what \"IDS\" is. Did you mean to say that she has \"invasive ductal carcinoma\" (\"IDC\")? Is she considered to have early stage invasive breast cancer (Stage I, II or III disease)? I see she had bilateral mastectomy (left, right). Did she have bilateral disease? If not, what was the reason for removal of the second breast? Certain genetic test results and/or strong family history of certain cancers may lead to a recommendation for prophylactic mastectomy and prophylactic oophorectomy (specifically, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (\"BSO\")). In such a case, the BSO would also help reduce the risk ovarian and fallopian tube cancer. I see she has post-mastectomy radiation, suggesting either lymph node involvement and/or small surgical margins. What are the features of disease and nodal status (on each side if she has bilateral disease)? What was the actual size of the tumor from the surgical pathology report? (T0, T1, T1a, T1b, T1c, T2, T3) Was there any clinical evidence of lymph node involvement on either side? What type of lymph node biopsy was done? (Sentinel node biopsy or other?) What were the results of the lymph node biopsy (see surgical pathology report, N0, N1mi, N1, etcetera)? How many nodes were involved, and what was the extent of node involvement (isolated tumor cells? micrometastasis? macrometastasis?), if any. As you may appreciate, the treatments received also affect residual recurrence risk and whether more intensive approaches to endocrine therapy may be indicated. Did she receive any HER2-targeted therapy (trastuzumab, sold under the tradename HERCEPTIN))? In the US and Canada, for IDC, even for the very smallest ER+PR+HER2+ tumors (Tumor ≤0.5 cm including microinvasive) and negative nodes (\"N0\"), some consideration would be given to adding HER2-targeted therapy (trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN)) to chemotherapy. For ER+PR+HER2+ IDC where the Tumor is greater that 1 cm (in longest dimension) OR Node positive (one or more metastases >2 mm to one or more ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes), our local guidelines recommend: => Adjuvant chemotherapy plus trastuzumab followed by endocrine therapy (category 1) She is pre-menopausal and \"Now her doctor says that she needs oophorectomy.\" What type of \"doctor\" recommended oophorectomy? Is this their area of expertise? A \"medical oncologist\" is a specialist whose training includes drug treatments for breast cancer, including the various approaches to endocrine therapy (using drugs and/or ovarian ablation methods such as surgery) in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients. An expert in \"medical genetics\" (e.g., Genetic Counselor) should have specialized training in genetics and genetic and familial risk assessment, such that they can advise about inherited risk, genetic testing, genetic test results and what is known about any specific mutation found, and appropriate surveillance or risk-reduction surgeries, based on a person's complete risk profile. A surgical gynecologist may know how to do the surgery, but may not have the required training that a medical oncologist or medical geneticist would have regarding whether the surgery is appropriate to consider or not. If the advice was from a gynecologist or surgical gynecologist (and not based on a gynecologic concern), further input should be sought from a medical oncologist. If genetic test results or suspicious family history of cancer are considerations, she should seek advice from a Genetic Counselor or other medical professional with medical genetics training. What to do? As I mentioned above, the best way to probe medical advice is to seek additional discussion and explanation from her medical oncologist, and/or to seek a second opinion about things such as: (1) Please explain my recurrence risks, the purpose of endocrine therapy, and list all options for endocrine therapy that are suitable in my case; (2) What are the risks and potential benefits of each suitable option, in light of my personal medical history? Do the potential benefits outweigh the possible risks? (3) What exactly is the preferred or recommended approach in my specific case? Include a description of any proposed surgical treatments and continued drug treatments. For example, are they recommending the removal of both ovaries and fallopian tubes by a \"bilateral salpingo oophorectomy\" (\"BSO\"), plus continued endocrine therapy with an aromatase inhibitor? (4) Why it this approach preferred in my specific case over other options? For example, why is BSO plus an aromatase inhibitor preferred to other approaches, such as ovarian suppression (with a drug) plus an aromatase inhibitor (a second drug)? I hope this information can help your friend as she seeks additional information and advice about the treatment plan that is best for her.

Sometimes, with IDC where the tumor is greater than 0.5 cm in size, and ER+ PR+ HER2-, no LVI, and negative nodes (N0), chemotherapy may still be considered or recommended. This is because even sentinel node biopsy is not a perfect method, and there can still be some risk of undetected distant spread. Tests such as the OncotypeDX test for invasive disease (for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative disease) or MammaPrint (more common in Europe) are sometimes used to obtain more information about estimated recurrence risk and help inform decision-making regarding whether to add chemotherapy to endocrine therapy (e.g., tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor) or not. Hopefully, you will have the opportunity to meet with a medical oncologist to discuss possible testing and options thoroughly prior to any further treatment.

Under our local NCCN guidelines, the main considerations for selection of systemic treatments (chemotherapy, HER2-targeted therapy, and/or endocrine therapy) for invasive breast cancer are histology (e.g., ductal, lobular, etc.), lymph node status, tumor size, hormone-receptor status, and HER2 status. Factors such as LVI, grade, Ki-67 (if measured), etcetera may be considered in closer cases. DCIS or \"ductal carcinoma in situ\" is often found in association with IDC. In contrast to IDC, DCIS is a \"noninvasive\" disease that is confined to the inside of the ducts (has not broken through the walls of the duct), and so DCIS does not pose a risk of distant spread. If the mastectomy margins with respect to both the DCIS and IDC are 6 mm from inferior and >10 mm all other margins (please confirm it with your team), then the mastectomy appears to have adequately addressed the DCIS component, and the features of the IDC will determine treatment along the lines you have noted. I would recommend that you join the \"Triple-positive Group\" thread, but I see you have already found them. :) https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/80/topics/764183?page=1000 I have no words of wisdom, but send you my best wishes as you move forward with treatment.

Unfortunately, breast cancer in the absence of any family history is quite common. Concerning breast changes should not be discounted merely because of a past history of benign changes. This is a situation where past is not prologue (i.e., a prior benign result is not predictive of future results). Lastly, breast cancer is not bound by the timing of medical appointments, and so-called \"interval cancers\" may occur / be discovered between routine screening or follow-up monitoring visits. The changes you describe since your May appointment clearly warrant action. Please don't hesitate to contact your healthcare providers to inform them of the recent changes, and to request an appointment for a clinical exam and possible further evaluation at this time to figure out what it might be. Hopefully, it is something benign, but it must be checked out now. BarredOwl",

Please ask your medical oncologist (\"MO\") to explain it again, if you are not sure of the type or how they were determined. Please also ask what specific clinical and pathologic factors indicate to your MO that the tumor is \"very aggressive\", and weigh in favor of his recommendation for chemotherapy, to ensure you understand the basis for the recommendation. In general, the number that medical oncologist's typically focus on when weighing risk / benefit in treatment recommendations is the size of the \"risk reduction benefit\" (e.g., ~10% or the difference between recurrence risk with a specific treatment (e.g., 34%) and residual recurrence risk without that specific treatment (e.g., 24%) (34% - 24% = 10 %). This is a personal decision made after weighing medical advice and information about potential benefit and potential risk, in light of your personal risk tolerance. Although this is from an older book, this explanation still holds today: \"Thus, the higher your risk, the greater the need for treatment and the bigger the benefit you can reap from the treatment. At the same time, when making treatment decisions, potential side effects should be part of this equation. The possibility of experiencing side effects remains the same no matter what your risk is from the cancer. The higher the risk of your disease, the more likely the potential side effects will seem worth that risk in order to gain the benefits from the treatment. \" Excerpt From: Carolyn M. Kaelin & Francesca Coltrera. \"Living Through Breast Cancer.\" (2005) One recent 2016 ASCO guideline states (without citation): \"Several studies have suggested that the odds of fatal, life-threatening, or permanent life-changing toxicities [associated with chemotherapy] are at least 2% to 3% in healthy women who participate in prospective trials.\" Advanced age and/or certain co-morbidities may place some patients at greater risk of severe side effects. Please confirm this estimated risk of severe adverse events with your Medical Oncologist to ensure accuracy, currency, and applicability to your situation and recommended chemotherapy regimen, in light of your presentation and any co-morbidities (which may alter personal risk profile relative to an average observed in healthy women). In general, note that a ~10% risk reduction benefit numerically outweighs a potential risk of severe adverse events of ~3% risk by 3-fold. As you can see, the estimated size of the risk reduction benefit (estimated ~10%) is quite important, which is why it is useful to understand how your MO arrived at the 34% and 24% numbers. If you wish, and if you have time (ask your MO), you may find a second opinion to be helpful for obtaining additional discussion and expert professional input regarding your risk / benefit profile, and an independent recommendation. Best, BarredOwl  { Edited quote to indicate [associated with chemotherapy] Usually, the focus of benefit of chemotherapy is on reducing distant recurrence risk. Please seek confirmation of your understanding of the estimates provided. Does adding endocrine therapy reduce risk further? }",

The literature is large and not entirely consistent and there may be technical issues in determining the percent of cells that stain positive for Ki-67 protein. If outside materials or information (publications or posts on this board) influence your thinking about treatment options, be sure to confirm accurate understanding and applicability to your particular case with your Medical Oncologist. Ki-67 is a protein that is a marker of cell proliferation or cell growth (a higher percentage suggests more dividing tumor cells). In general, rapidly dividing cells may be more responsive to chemotherapy. The 2015 St. Gallen panel commented: >> \"There can be little doubt that Ki-67 scores carry robust prognostic information [24], and that high values predict the benefit of addition of cytotoxic chemotherapy [25], but definition of a single useful cut point has proved elusive both because Ki-67 displays a continuous distribution [26], and as a result of analytic and preanalytic barriers to standardized assessment [27].\" In other words, despite the results of studies which report some prognostic and predictive value, there are technical issues with determination of Ki-67 percentages by standard IHC methods, including interobserver variability (different results when different people perform the test on the same sample) and lack of reproducibility across laboratories, as explained in detail here: >> Polley (2013): \"An International Ki67 Reproducibility Study\" >> http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/105/24/1897.full >> (Free PDF available via link) Also, different studies use different values as cut points or cut-offs between what is considered \"low\" or \"high\" Ki-67. All of this makes it difficult to rely on the results of clinical studies in which Ki-67 was determined in other labs and to interpret the clinical significance of a Ki-67 test result based on such studies. Accordingly, some institutions no longer perform Ki-67 testing (at this time), and clinical consensus guidelines (e.g., from ASCO) do not generally support the broad use of Ki-67 protein (determined by standard IHC) to guide adjuvant chemotherapy decisions. Please ask your medical oncologist for his views on the significance of your Ki-67 result and how it should be weighed in connection with your treatment decisions. Best, BarredOwl",

Oncologists do this routinely (without the use of the RSPC tool). For some reason, today I cannot locate any information on the RSPC tool on the current Genomic Health website, although it sounds like you found it. I do not know how medical oncologists currently view this tool. In the link you provided to the 2014 meeting poster (note that posters are not peer-reviewed publications), you can see that the poster describes the effect on risk stratification by the tool (how it modified recurrence risk estimates either upward or downward) in a small group of patients. But that is observational in nature and is quite a different question from clinical validation and whether or not the revised estimates provided by the tool have or have not been demonstrated to be more reliable than the original estimates in predicting recurrence risk (as determined by measuring distant recurrences in patients according to RSPC estimates). The RSPC tool was briefly discussed in a 2016 article about a different test: http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/108/11/djw149.full \"Recently, GHI [Genomic Health, the commercial test provider] began providing an online Recurrence Score Pathology-Clinical (RSPC) calculator for use in node-negative patients that combines RS with clinicopathological variables including age, tumor size, grade, and planned adjuvant hormonal therapy. Tang et al. reported a greater separation of low- and high-risk patients and reduced number of patients in the intermediate-risk group when classified by RSPC (17). Nevertheless, GHI [Genomic Health, the commercial test provider] recommends that RSPC should only be used as an \"educational tool\" together with RS result to enhance the understanding of the score in the assessment of DR risk (18). It should be noted that while integration of clinicopathological factors with molecular features greatly enhances the prognostic power of risk assessments, this has not been shown to increase predictive information regarding chemotherapy benefit (17).\" You may wish to inquire if the above is consistent with the current information available to physicians on-line regarding the tool, and what caveats or limitations regarding validation are provided in the materials available to physicians. The scope and quality of validation (which speaks to reliability) of any such supplemental on-line tools would be a point of discussion with an expert medical oncologist or in a possible second opinion.

So my question remains - am I currently at 16% or 11%?? The first graph is used to estimate risk with Tam Alone. This data is from a trial in which all 668 patients received Tam Alone. The second graph is used to estimate the potential benefit of added chemotherapy. This data is from patients enrolled in a different trial in which \"A total of 651 patients were assessable (227 randomly assigned to tamoxifen and 424 randomly assigned to tamoxifen plus chemotherapy).\" So only 227 patients received Tam Alone in this trial. As between the two graphs in the node-negative Oncotype report, I believe that the 16% estimate from the first graph is seen as the more reliable estimate of your 10-year distant recurrence risk with Tam Alone. Please confirm it with your MO.  (2) Re your remark: \"My confusion stems from an additional page that was provided to me, which provided a combined risk that considered my Oncotype score, age, tumour size, node status and hormone receptors.\" I am not familiar with an additional page and have no information about it. Ask your MO about it, for example: -- Is it from the test provider or your treatment center? Is it based on validated methods? -- Is the risk estimate in the Additional Page the same type of estimate as that in the First graph of my Oncotype report (i.e., 10-year risk; distant recurrence risk; with 5-years Tam Alone) or some other type of risk estimate? Please explain. -- Point out the 16% estimate in the First graph and ask your MO why the estimates differ and which estimate(s) you should rely on for your decision-making. --If you seek a second opinion, ask them to review these materials and questions with you. I am glad to hear the Tumor Board is reconsidering your case in light of the additional information. BarredOwl",

(Do not rely on a verbal or copied/summary information in a patient portal.) From other posts, it sounds like your current treatment center has a Tumor Board (a multidisciplinary panel). If they did not have the Recurrence Score at the time they considered your case, do request they consider this new information and provide an updated opinion. In parallel, arranging for a second opinion at an independent institution in more specialized circumstances such as yours seems advisable, if there is time before recommended treatments should be initiated per your medical oncologist. You may not be similarly situated to other non-pregnant, node-negative patients with similar recurrence scores in a number of ways or in timing of treatments. The medical advice you receive is case-specific, in light of your specific clinical (e.g., age, pregnancy, co-morbidities) and pathologic factors. For example, in another post, you noted: \"I am 19 weeks pregnant so I am told I can't get rads or hormone therapies until after I deliver.\" (In this thread, you note you are now 22 weeks (5.5 months along)). In contrast, others in this thread who are not pregnant who may decline chemo can immediately begin radiation and anti-hormonal therapy (either concurrent with or shortly after radiation). Keep in mind that the recurrence risk information from the Oncotype report (for invasive disease) assumes receipt of endocrine therapy. This is because the recurrence risk information in the reports is based on clinical studies in which all patients were assigned to 5-years Tamoxifen (either Tamoxifen alone or Tamoxifen plus chemo). =====> You may wish to inquire with your Medical Oncologist if the recommendation for chemotherapy in your case may be based in part on their recommended delay initiating anti-hormonal therapy until after your delivery. (Also ask for a list of the various considerations they feel support the recommendation for added chemotherapy in your case and write them down.)  Are you node-negative based on the results of a sentinel node biopsy? If so, then you would have received a node-negative Oncotype report. If not, please advise. The below applies only if a person is known to be node-negative (\"N0\") as determined by sentinel node biopsy. ESTIMATED RISK OF DISTANT (METASTATIC) RECURRENCE: Re your comment: \"Just got my oncotype score of 25, with an overall recurrence risk of 11%.\" That 11% does not sound right. Please confirm this understanding with your Medical Oncologist (\"MO\"). The FIRST GRAPH in the node-negative (\"N0\") Oncotype report for invasive breast cancer is the one that is typically used to estimate 10-year Risk of Distant Recurrence After 5 years Tamoxifen (with \"Tam Alone\") according to Recurrence Score. Please confirm it with your MO. There may be a variety of reasons for this, an obvious one being that the Tam Alone group in the study featured in the FIRST GRAPH (668 patients with Tam Alone) was much larger (nearly three times) than the Tam Alone group in the study featured in the second graph (227 patients with Tam Alone). Accordingly, the 10-year risk information from the first graph is the one used in practice to estimate 10-year distant recurrence risk with Tam Alone (no chemotherapy). =====> The best estimate of the 10-year Risk with \"Tam Alone\" associated with your Recurrence Score of 25 is printed to the left of the FIRST GRAPH in your report. Please check your report for the 10-Year Risk % with \"Tam Alone\" next to the first graph. (I think you will find that the 10-year risk with Tam Alone in your report is larger than 11% and is probably around 16%.) Eyeballing the first graph from the sample node-negative report available on-line suggests that the 10-year risk with Tam Alone for a Recurrence Score of 25 would be around 16%. (Find your Recurrence Score on the horizontal X-axis, move straight up to the solid bold curve, then move left to read off the value for 10-Year Distant Recurrence Risk with Tam Alone on the vertical Y-axis.) FIRST GRAPH from Node-negative (\"N0\") sample report on-line here: http://www.oncotypeiq.com/en-US/breast-cancer/healthcare-professionals/oncotype-dx-breast-recurrence-score/interpreting-the-results   For more information about the study results featured in the first graph of the node-negative report: The recurrence risk information provided in the first graph of the node-negative (N0) Oncotype report is based on the results of a clinical trial in a group of patients who were all assigned to receive 5-years of tamoxifen, and their observed rates of distant recurrence over 10 ten years according to their Recurrence Scores. The first graph in the node-negative report is based on Figure 4 of Paik (2004): >> Paik (2004): \"A Multigene Assay to Predict Recurrence of Tamoxifen-Treated, Node-Negative Breast Cancer\" >> Main Page: http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa041588#t=article >> Free PDF: http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa041588  Potential Benefit of Added Chemotherapy: The node-negative report includes a second graph that addresses potential benefit of added chemotherapy as compared with Tam Alone. Here is the second graph from the sample node-negative report on-line:  This data is taken from a different clinical trial that assessed 10-year risk of distant recurrence according to Recurrence Score in two groups of patients who received either: (a) Tamoxifen alone (solid dark line); or (b) Tamoxifen plus chemotherapy (dark dotted line): >> Paik (2006): \"Gene Expression and Benefit of Chemotherapy in Women With Node-Negative, Estrogen Receptor\u2013Positive Breast Cancer\" >> Main Page: http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/jco.2005.04.7985 >> (Free PDF available under \"PDF\" tab) In the second graph, the difference between the Y-axis values on these curves for a particular Recurrence Score provides some insight into the potential risk reduction benefit of added chemotherapy for those in the standard \"High risk\" range (RS = 31 to 100). You can see that as Recurrence Score (\"RS\") decreases, the curves move closer and closer (apparent potential benefit of added chemo decreases) and the confidence intervals (lighter lines surrounding each curve) begin to overlap more and more (more uncertainty in the benefit as RS decreases). However, as noted in Paik (2006), these results do not exclude a clinically important benefit from chemotherapy treatment in the standard intermediate range (RS 18 to 30). In addition, there might be certain subsets of patients who may benefit more than the group as a whole. Thus, the on-going TAILORx trial in node-negative patients is seeking to determine whether those with Recurrence Scores of 11 to 25 or some subset of these patients may derive benefit from added chemotherapy (or not).  Second Opinion: Many look for an NCI-designated Cancer Center for a second opinion (confirm in-network): https://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-role/cancer-centers/find This may include a review of actual pathology slides (sent overnight) and all related reports and ER, PR and HER2 test results by a Pathologist and consultations with a Medical Oncologist and Radiation Oncologist. You can still elect to receive treatment at your current center if you prefer. Once you have made appointments and sent materials for a second opinion, be sure to call ahead to confirm that all records and materials have been received by the second institution and forwarded to the proper doctors. Also take copies of critical documents with you to the appointment, such as copies of all pathology reports from all biopsies and surgeries (any addenda or supplements thereto), including ER, PR and HER2 test results, and a copy of your Oncotype report. I am a layperson with no medical training, so please confirm all information above with your Medical Oncologist to ensure receipt of accurate, current, case-specific expert professional medical advice.

The standard ranges have not been changed. Because the TAILORx trial is on-going, the standard ranges are still in effect (RS low <18; intermediate 18 to 30; high ≥31). For the purposes of the TAILORx trial, because patients deemed intermediate risk would be assigned at random to receive either endocrine therapy alone or chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy, to minimize the potential for undertreatment, the definitions of low, intermediate, and high risk were slightly revised as compared with the standard ranges in use in clinical practice [citations omitted]. In my layperson's understanding, the revised ranges selected for the purposes of the trial are \"investigational\" until demonstrated otherwise: http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1510764... \"To minimize the potential for undertreatment of the participants enrolled in our trial, the recurrence-score ranges used in our study differed from those that were originally defined as low (≤10 in our study vs. <18 in the original definition), intermediate (11 to 25 vs. 18 to 30), and high (≥26 vs. ≥31). The recurrence-score strata derived for the trial were based on prior studies that indicated that the risk of recurrence of breast cancer at a distant site at 10 years after diagnosis and a 5-year course of tamoxifen could be as high as 10% among patients with a score of 11 (point estimate, 7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5 to 10) and up to 20% among those with a score of 25 (point estimate, 16%; 95% CI, 13 to 20), indicating a risk that was substantial enough for a recommendation of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with a score of 11 or higher.\" No results from the TAILORx trial for the groups scoring either 11 to 25 or 26 and above have been published as of this date, because the trial is on-going. Therefore, we are still awaiting TAILORx trial results for its \"intermediate\" and \"high\" risk groups, and the standard ranges are still in effect (<18; 18 to 30; ≥31). Nevertheless, patients with a Recurrence Score (\"RS\") of 26 to 30 should not hesitate to discuss the rationale for the TAILORx trial design with their Medical Oncologists to understand whether and how it should be viewed in the context of their individual situation, as it reflects considerations of the magnitude of recurrence risk associated with particular RSs on the high end of the standard intermediate range. The best anyone can do is to make an informed decision based on the evidence available at the time, in consultation with their medical oncologist. BarredOwl",

If your diagnosis was pure DCIS, Stage 0 (with no micro-invasion or invasion), then this is what the National Comprehensive Cancer Center (NCCN) guidelines (Version 3_2015) say about HER2 testing (emphasis added): \"Although HER2 status is of prognostic significance in invasive cancer, its importance in DCIS has not been elucidated. To date, studies have either found unclear or weak evidence of HER2 status as a prognostic indicator in DCIS. The NCCN Panel concluded that knowing the HER2 status of DCIS does not alter the management strategy and routinely should not be determined.\" Thus, at least under this guideline, HER2 testing is not considered necessary with pure DCIS.

Anyway, the single-gene score for ER and PR is not a percentage, and the results cannot be directly compared with the results of IHC. Usually, the validated pathology methods (\"IHC\") used to measure Estrogen Receptor protein and Progesterone Receptor protein look at whole cells. Results are reported as percent positive cells in a field of view (i.e., some cells are stained by a \"molecular tag\" and are seen as \"positive for staining,\" and some cells are not stained). The percentage of cells that do stain is reported. Oncotype uses a completely different method (\"qRT-PCR\") to measure ER and PR mRNA from ground-up cells (obtained by microdissection I believe). It gives a numerical score in \"units\", where particular unit values falling below a specified positive/negative cut-off of X units are considered \"negative\" by Oncotype (if the arrow/triangle falls in the orange range at left). As you can see, IHC versus Oncotype use completely different analytical methods and sample cells in a different way. They measure different molecules: ER protein versus mRNA. The numerical outputs are reported in different \"units\" and cannot be directly compared: percent positive cells versus score in unit values. These methodological differences can lead to apparently differing degrees of positivity, which is very confusing for patients. I do not know off-hand how concordant IHC testing for ER and PR is when looking at IHC on biopsy versus IHC on surgical samples. You may want to inquire about that and/or research it. If you are concerned (or will be worrying) that there might be some difference between biopsy and surgical samples (e.g., due to possible tumor heterogeneity, sampling artifacts), you could seek an expert pathology review and possible further ER and PR testing (if they agree that it is indicated). I understand a number of places will conduct such a pathology review (if your state permits). For more information about this option, see this page (Pathology Opinions and Paragraph 4 of Treatment Opinions): http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/second_opinion/where BarredOwl ",

What kind of testing are you having: BRCA1 and 2 only or a multi-gene panel test? Also, have you and/or will you be meeting with a genetic counselor? I ask because different genes confer different degrees of risk(s). Consensus guidelines are not available for all of the genes that may be tested. Thus, with some genes, prophylactic mastectomy is not yet recommended, although a patient might still choose it for various reasons. I do agree with Sjacobs that it comes down to: What is the level of risk conferred by this particular mutation in this gene? What is my overall risk of a new cancer or recurrence, in light of this mutation, my presentation, and family history? (A genetic counselor can conduct a personalized risk assessment for you.) Then, assuming the gene and mutation are adequately characterized, what are the recommended screening and/or risk reduction options for deleterious mutations in this particular gene (e.g., enhanced screening, chemoprevention, prophylactic bilateral mastectomy (PBM))? How effective/reliable are these? By how much would chemoprevention and/or PBM reduce risk? What level of risk can I live with? I had BRCA1/2 testing only. At the time, I was diagnosed on the right side only (unilateral, multifocal disease), was pre-menopausal (52), my family was small, and I had one first and one second degree relative with cancers typical of HBOC (hereditary breast and ovarian cancer) syndrome, plus other types of cancers in the family history. I had learned in parallel with my diagnosis that I had one heterogeneously dense and one extremely dense breast, which can increase risk and impede detection. I had seen my mammograms, and I was concerned about the limitations of screening in my case. I realized that even if the BRCA test came out negative, I might still have some unidentified genetic pre-disposition. So, during the waiting period, I actually thought more about what I would do if I had a negative result: Would I go forward with the recommended unilateral mastectomy and continue with screening the other side, or would I seek contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM)? I was leaning towards CPM. As fate would have it, on the very day I got the good news about the genetic testing results, as part of a second opinion (which recommended another diagnostic mammogram), I got the bad news that I would need a surgical biopsy on the other side, which led to a diagnosis of bilateral breast cancer and indicated bilateral mastectomy. Formally speaking, I note there is yet another option, and that is mastectomy without reconstruction. That is what I chose, after researching my options. If you are curious about that, this is an excellent website (created by a member of BC.org), with personal stories about why people chose that route (see menu at right): http://breastfree.org I am hoping for clear negative results for you!

I am glad you will be seeking a face-to-face second opinion, and agree with your reasons for wanting one. Benefits of the second opinion process may include an independent review of imaging results including mammograms, ultrasound, and MRI (interpretation of disease/extent of disease), review of actual pathology slides, and test results; and a second expert evaluation/opinion regarding treatment plan, plus an opportunity for additional discussion of possible treatment options, associated risk/benefit, quality of evidence, and your questions and concerns. Although you may seek treatment with your original providers, it is good idea to choose a second opinion place with an excellent reputation, in case you decide to seek treatment with the second opinion provider. I also sought a second opinion prior to commencing treatment. In my case, additional imaging and biopsy were requested that led to diagnosis of cancer in the other breast. I sought care with the second opinion group (Mass General in Boston). I do not have personal experience with a medical file review, but some members here have done that. For breast cancer treatment in the US, many recommend seeking treatment or a second opinion from an NCI-designated Cancer Center (NCI = National Cancer Institute). A list of these can be found here (scroll down): http://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-role/cancer-cen... Dana Farber in Boston (member of PartnersHealthcare) and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, which you mentioned, are listed here and have excellent reputations, as do Johns Hopkins and University of Texas M.D. Anderson. This page from Breastcancer.org has information on the second opinion process. There are links to additional sections at upper left: http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/second_opini... This page mentions some on-line second opinion services, including PartnersHealthcare (an organization that includes Dana Farber, Massachusetts General Hospital, and others in Boston, MA), Cleveland Clinic, Johns Hopkins (Baltimore, MD), and M.D. Anderson (Texas). Some are said to handle international patients, but if you are interested in one of the others, do not hesitate to contact them to see if they now are also handing international cases. http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/second_opini...

Please correct me if that is not right. Please note that it is not possible to conclude from a mammogram alone that LCIS or DCIS is present. Imaging can raise suspicion to a certain point, where a biopsy is recommended. The tissue from a biopsy is examined by a pathologist to determine definitively whether a lesion seen by mammogram is benign or not. Luckily, the large majority of biopsies do turn out to be benign. Please contact the facility where you had the mammogram, and request a copy of the radiologist's full report (not a form letter or summary). The report will include a description of the observations, and a \"Bi-rads score\", which is a rough estimation of the risk of malignancy. It will also include the radiologist's recommendations. Secondly, ask what are the recommended next steps, in view of the suspicious result on mammogram. Possibilities might include further imaging by ultrasound, a biopsy, and/or consultation with a breast surgeon. You will find a lot of support and information here. BarredOwl",

Had your surgeon not ordered the Oncotype test prior to learning of the additional node involvement, it seems likely that your Medical Oncologist might not have ordered it all (due to having 4 positive nodes). In general, for node-positive invasive breast cancer, when there are \"one or more metastases >2 mm to one or more ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes\", the NCCN guidelines for breast cancer (Version 2.2017 dated April 2017) only include the use of the Oncotype test in select patients with no more than 1-3 involved nodes: >> \"The 21-gene RT-PCR assay recurrence score can be considered in select patients with 1\u20133 involved ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes to guide the addition of combination chemotherapy to standard hormone therapy.\" As of this date, in general, with 4 or more positive nodes, decisions regarding chemotherapy are based on standard clinical (e.g., age, co-morbidities) and pathologic (e.g., histology, tumor size, nodal status, ER, PR and HER2 status) criteria. In the typical case, under current guidelines from ASCO and NCCN, prognostic tests like Oncotype (or other tests) are not usually used (or relied upon) in those with 4 or more positive nodes. There may be appropriate exceptions. The rationale for systemic chemotherapy is the risk of undetectable micrometastases at distant sites. This risk is increased in lymph node-positive disease, and a greater lymph node burden can present higher risk. Radiation therapy is a loco-regional treatment (breast, axilla). Radiation therapy cannot reach rogue cells that have already escaped to distant sites prior to surgery, and the risk of this having occurred (which increases with nodal involvement) is the basis for recommending systemic treatments such as chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy. (For additional explanation, see this post: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/145/topics/829335?page=5#post_4988495) The website of Genomic Health (the commercial test provider) indicates there are three different Oncotype reports for invasive disease: http://www.oncotypeiq.com/en-US/breast-cancer/healthcare-professionals/oncotype-dx-breast-recurrence-score/interpreting-the-results (a) node-negative (N0); (b) Node-positive (1-3 N+); or (c) Node-positive (≥ 4 N+). Be sure to obtain a complete copy of your Oncotype report (not some summary in a portal) and confirm that the report says it is a Node-positive (≥ 4 N+) report. If not, your MO can request the proper report for from the test provider for your records. As you can see, although its use is not currently supported by clinical guidelines from NCCN or ASCO, the company will run the Oncotype test on samples from patients with 4 or more positive nodes, and can provide a Node-positive (≥ 4 N+) report with prognostic information based on a clinical validation study by Albain (2010) that included some patients with ≥ 4 positive lymph nodes (pdf version available here ResearchGate version). However, whether your medical oncologist would rely on the test results is a separate question and will depend on things like his views about the quality and scope of clinical validation available for the Oncotype test in patients like you; the position of clinical consensus guidelines in light of same (which do not currently support its use); his assessment of your distant recurrence risk profile; and the potential benefit of added chemotherapy in your particular case (be sure to ask about potential benefit). If you think you may want a second opinion, I recommend that you start lining that up now to avoid possible treatment delays. Many look for an NCI-designated Cancer Center if feasible and in-network: https://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-role/cancer-centers/find. One may still seek treatment locally. I am a layperson with no medical training. Please confirm all information above with your Medical Oncologist to ensure receipt of current, accurate, case-specific, expert professional medical advice.

      "Content": "Jan 26, 2016 03:49PM - edited Jan 26, 2016 04:36PM by BarredOwl Hi Emma: You didn't really provide much information about yourself, such as where you are located, your age, estiimated stage, histology (e.g., ductal), size of tumor, ER, PR, HER2 status, or clinical evidence of node involvement, other than being \"recently\" diagnosed. When you refer to your \"physician\" do you mean your \"Medical Oncologist\"? Presumably, your physician is a medical oncologist by training, is licensed to practice medicine in your location, and is affiliated with a reputable medical institution, so their qualifications are clear. Since you didn't mention surgery and referred to seeing how the \"tumors react\", are you talking about receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (i.e., chemotherapy before surgery)? If so, it may indeed be possible to check for tumor response to treatment and to make a change in regimen, if indicated. This possibility of checking for response, or what you refer to as \"trial and error\", is an advantage of neoadjuvant therapy in certain settings. This is not a defect in a proposed neoadjuvant treatment plan, but a potential advantage. Unfortunately, medical oncologists cannot predict with certainty whether or not a particular patient will have a complete pathological response (pCR), indicative that the tumor responds to the drug. That your oncologist admits that she cannot be certain which is the best treatment at the outset, and that there may be a change, strikes me as an honest and accurate response. Please note that following a \"protocol\" can be part of sound medical practice. Oncology is evidence-based medicine. Consensus treatment guidelines exist, such as those promulgated by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) in the US. These guidelines are routinely used by medical oncologists, because it is important to know what treatments are within the standard of care. Oncologists who keep up with current research may also incorporate more recent information, because the standard of care evolves with time and new reliable clinical information. In certain cases, there may be sound medical reasons to depart from the guidelines. But in many cases, it may indeed be appropriate for a medical oncologist to follow such guidelines or standard of care. It is possible that more than one drug regimen may be within the standard of care. Guidelines may indicate that one or some regimens are considered as preferred in the usual case, or if none is preferred and/or there is more than one reasonable option, then the sound medical judgment of the oncologist applied to the specific case and patient preference may come into play, in a discussion of risk/benefit. As noted above, your oncologist has seen you in person, has access to all your records, is familiar with your personal and family medical history, including age, co-morbidities, other drugs you are taking (possible drug-drug interactions), and overall presentation. You can certainly ask your oncologist to please clarify the reasons why she feels Taxol (or the Taxol-containing regimen she recommended) may be the best choice for you in the first instance, and why she recommends it over a Taxotere-containing regimen in your specific case. You may also wish to inquire whether the guidelines address the question. You have edited your post since this morning, but I think you mentioned that you provided a pathology report to the BELONG-associated person, who spoke with you by telephone about the best chemotherapy regimen for you. As noted above, this is a non-standard, unproven method of providing reliable medical oncology advice, and is subject to many possible issues relating to the quality of the source of the information and the quality of care. Such issues raise a reasonable concerns that the information provided may be inherently unqualified and/or unreliable. The BELONG-associated person can only speak to the basic information in the pathology report (size, ER, PR, HER2 status) and what you may have remembered to disclose in the call. They can say this other drug is also used in this setting, but even if true, that does not mean it is a better choice. They can discuss generalities about known side effects of various drugs set forth in the FDA approved labels (which by the way, are easily accessed on the internet by anyone regardless of relevant medical qualifications (if any)), but they cannot determine whether these side effect profiles militate in favor of one drug over another in your specific case, if they are not familiar with your complete personal medical history. The specific area of expertise and training required for chemotherapy decisions is that of \"Medical Oncologists\". What are the credentials of the the BELONG-associated person, and how could you independently verify that the person you spoke to is the person you spoke to (not just someone posing as Dr. Joseph Smith), is truly a medical oncologist by training, and is licensed to practice medicine in the country you are located in? What consensus treatment guidelines are they familiar with? Please note that different countries use different guidelines, and what is common elsewhere, within differing healthcare systems, economic and regulatory constraints, may not be the most common treatment and/or best practice in the United States. If you would like a second opinion from a qualified medical oncologist, please ask your current providers if you can safely take the additional time to do so, and then seek out expert advice in person at an independent institution. If you need information about the second opinion process, please let us know. BarredOwl",

Another way of saying this, is that the test has \"prognostic\" value (provides information about average risk), but has not been shown to be \"predictive\" (of benefit of chemotherapy) throughout the standard intermediate range. In the Paik 2006 study, they were comparing a group that received tamoxifen alone versus a group that received tamoxifen plus chemotherapy. The difference in average 10-yr risk of distant recurrence between these groups falls off with the lines getting closer as Recurrence Scores decline, and getting farther apart as Recurrence Score increases (Figure 4, solid red and blue lines; Second graph in the node-negative report). Here is the original Paik 2006 study and how it characterized the results for the intermediate group: Paik (2006): http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/24/23/3726.full.pdf \"Patients with intermediate-RS tumors did not appear to have a large benefit [from chemotherapy], but the uncertainty in the estimate can not exclude a clinically important benefit.\" \"The magnitude of chemotherapy benefit appeared to increase continuously as the RS increased. A clear cutoff point for RS, below which there is no demonstrable benefit from chemotherapy, cannot be accurately defined.\" \"The benefit from chemotherapy was less clear for patients in the intermediate-risk group (relative risk, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.24 to 1.59; 1.8% increase in absolute risk).\" \"Patients with tumors that had intermediate RSs (RS, 18 to 30) did not appear to receive a substantial benefit, but the uncertainty in the estimate (relative risk, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.24 to 1.59) can not exclude a clinically important benefit from chemotherapy treatment.\" It is possible that there are differences in this regard within the intermediate range (benefit might differ by score). This is discussed more here: Genomic Health explanation: http://intermediate.oncotypedx.com/en-US/The-Recurrence-Score-Result/How-An-Intermediate-Recurrence-Score.aspx The question of whether some with intermediate Recurrence Scores (\"RS\") may indeed benefit from the addition of chemotherapy is a key point of on-going investigation in the much larger prospective, randomized TAILORx trial. In that trial, those with RS of 11 to 25 were randomized to receive endocrine therapy alone or endocrine therapy plus chemotherapy. In the trial, \"those with a score of 26 or higher were [all] assigned to receive chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy.\" Regarding the study design: http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1510764#t=article \"Patients with a mid-range score of 11 to 25 were randomly assigned to receive either chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy or endocrine therapy alone because the benefits of chemotherapy were uncertain in this group, yet the risk of recurrence was high enough to suggest that chemotherapy might be beneficial.\" They are conducting a multimillion dollar trial, because a clear cutoff point (by Recurrence Score) below which there is no demonstrable benefit from chemotherapy has not been defined.

MRI is \"magnetic resonance imaging\". It depends upon magnetism (as in big, noisy, clanking magnets). It does not rely on radioactivity and does not use a radioactive dye. It may use a contrast agent. I felt a cool sensation in my arm as the contrast agent was injected and nothing else. I was not sedated, and only local painkillers were used.

Imagine a fruit (a big chunk of tissue removed by lumpectomy or mastectomy) with a pit somewhere inside of it (tumor). The margin sizes are the distances from the outer edges of the pit to the nearest outer edges of the fruit. When the margin sizes are very small or involved, it means the cancer in the breast was located very close to the edge of tissue removed. This raises suspicion that all of the cancer cells might not have been removed and that there may have been more cancer cells nearby that were left behind in the breast, which may increase risk of recurrence. While a mastectomy removes most breast tissue, it is not possible to remove all breast tissue. Thus, local recurrence may occur even with mastectomy.

      "Content": "May 18, 2016 02:38PM - edited May 18, 2016 03:17PM by BarredOwl Hi jerseyDaddy: Regarding tamoxifen, my understanding is also that its mode of action is \"cytostatic\" (versus \"cytotoxic\"), due to its ability to inhibit the growth-stimulating effects of hormones on tumor cells by blocking hormone action on receptors in breast cells. Nevertheless, and as noted by Barbe, it can be an effective therapy, and with IDC also, endocrine therapy may be recommended beyond five years. The questions of whether further surgical excision and/or radiation should be recommended (or not) are within the areas of expertise of the breast surgeon and radiation oncologist (RO), and they would be most familiar with the relevant studies. They are not the area of expertise of medical oncologists (MO). It would not be unreasonable to seek additional input and discussion on your question of whether re-excision is feasible and/or advisable from the breast surgeon, or if not, what factors support the conclusion. It sounds like perhaps the MO asked an RO for input on the question of radiation, and passed the conclusion on to you. I guess I would be wondering if the RO had carefully reviewed your wife's imaging and complete surgical pathology findings before opining on her case (preferred), or if he just provided his input on selected pieces of information provided by the MO (less preferred). In any case, you may prefer to set up an appointment with the RO in person to ensure active consideration of all relevant information, obtain discussion of her estimated recurrence risk and insight into the relevant clinical and pathological factors, and the factors which he feels weigh against radiation in your wife's specific case. You may also ask the RO for some discussion of the what various studies have found, and the current state of research in this area, as a number of studies in the setting of DCIS and mastectomy have been published since the 2012 link you posted that may further inform medical advice. A margin of 0.5 mm is on the small side, and the clinical evidence in this area (margins of DCIS with mastectomy) is relatively complex. You have not mentioned your wife's age, which may affect understanding of recurrence risk. Under the circumstances, it would also be quite reasonable to seek a second opinion about treatment from an independent institution, including a review of the pathology slides (nice confirmation to have), and consultation with second opinion breast surgeon and radiation oncologist regarding possible re-excision and/or radiation. If they do not concur, that is important information to have. If they concur with the advice you have received, you will still find value and it can help reduce second-guessing oneself down the line (regardless of outcome). My situation is slightly different (about 1 mm from the posterior margin in one focus of DCIS), and I regret not seeking a second opinion at the time. If you happen to be in New Jersey, USA, you might consider an NCI-designated cancer center: http://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-role/cancer-cen... Surgery and radiation are local treatments. Unfortunately, even with negative nodes (N0), hormone-receptor postiive, HER2-negative IDC may present some risk of distant spread. The results of the Oncotype test for invasive disease are used to assess distant recurrence risk and inform decision-making on the question of whether to add chemotherapy to endocrine therapy. If the Oncotype results fall in a gray area, you might add a medical oncologist to your second opinion.

You probably wouldn't be the first to seek a reasoned explanation for the advice you are receiving, and your wife is entitled to one. It is possible that members of the same practice/same institution may be influenced by each other, follow similar internal guidelines, and/or be hesitant to contradict the recommendation of a close colleague or senior colleague. For these kinds of reasons, if of interest and when there is time (medically and under insurance (e.g., in network)), obtaining a second opinion from providers at an independent institution can be of added value. You might start the ball rolling on the second opinion now to avoid potential delays, because it may take some lead time to get on the appointment schedule and arrange for forwarding of copies of all imaging to date (and earlier comparison imaging, if any), actual pathology slides from biopsy and surgery, etc., all ER, PR, HER2 testing, and associated written reports for advance review. The Oncotype report, which is about 3 pages in a standardized format, can be transmitted later when it comes in. The second opinion place can provide guidance re what is needed and logistics.

Institutional practices might also play in. Please ask your radiologist to be sure about what is recommended in your particular case, and immediately make your appointment to ensure timely follow-up. The American College of Radiologists (ACR) has a document which discusses BI-RADs scoring for density and for mammographic findings here. To access the document, click on \"2. Reporting System\" under \"BI-RADS Mammography 2013\": https://www.acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/PDF/QualitySafety/Resources/BIRADS/01%20Mammography/02%20%20BIRADS%20Mammography%20Reporting.pdf Regarding BI-RADs 3 follow-up, the free content has this information: \"A probably benign finding is not expected to change over the suggested period of imaging surveillance, but the interpreting physician prefers to establish stability of the finding before recommending management limited to routine mammography screening. . . . . .Refer to Figure 155 (see page 152) [NOT INCLUDED in free content] at the end of the Guidance chapter for an illustration of the recommended algorithm for follow-up examinations during the entire mammographic surveillance period. While the vast majority of probably benign findings are managed with an initial short-interval follow-up (6 months) examination followed by additional examinations until long-term (2- or 3-year) stability is demonstrated, there may be occasions in which a biopsy is done instead (patient preference or overriding clinical concern).\" By the way, it also indicates that the category 3 assessment should be based on a \"diagnostic\" mammogram, and not a \"screening\" mammogram: \"All the previously cited studies emphasize the need to conduct a complete diagnostic imaging evaluation before making a probably benign (category 3) assessment; hence, it is recommended not to render such an assessment in interpreting a screening mammography examination.\" BarredOwl  [Edited to make link operational.]",

If so, then I would follow the recommendations of the radiologist. It seems to me that the question falls squarely within the expertise of the radiologist, who classified his findings as BIRADs 3. What is the basis for the \"doctor's\" departure from the recommendation of the radiologist? Because a \"BIRADs 3\" rating means a short follow-up is recommended, per the American Cancer Society: http://www.cancer.org/treatment/understandingyourd... The findings in this category have a very high chance (greater than 98%) of being benign (not cancer). The findings are not expected to change over time. But since it's not proven benign, it's helpful to see if the area in question does change over time. Follow-up with repeat imaging is usually done in 6 months and regularly after that until the finding is known to be stable (usually at least 2 years). This approach helps avoid unnecessary biopsies, but if the area does change over time, it still allows for early diagnosis.\" If you have not done so already, please obtain a copy of the radiologist's report for yourself (this is distinct from a \"letter\"), so you can see for yourself the description of findings and the actual recommendations of the radiologist. You can also look to see if you have any issues with density (\"heterogeneously dense\" or \"extremely dense\"), as this may obscure possible findings on a mammogram, and would further support the use of an additional imaging modality (ultrasound). Density can also increase risk. BarredOwl  ",

Screening mammograms can also find microcalcifications (tiny deposits of calcium) that sometimes indicate the presence of breast cancer. Mammograms can also be used to check for breast cancer after a lump or other sign or symptom of the disease has been found.

Diagnostic mammography takes longer than screening mammography because more x-rays are needed to obtain views of the breast from several angles. The technician may magnify a suspicious area to produce a detailed picture that can help the doctor make an accurate diagnosis.\" Here is some information from BC.org regarding screening vs. diagnostic mammograms: http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/ask_e... And from the American Cancer Society: http://www.cancer.org/treatment/understandingyourd...

This is because the test for invasive disease is designed (and validated) for use in patients who will receive endocrine therapy (i.e., who are hormone receptor-positive). It is used to help inform the decision between: (a) endocrine therapy plus chemotherapy; or (b) endocrine therapy alone. The Oncotype Reports currently feature the results of early validation studies in which patients were assigned to receive either: (a) 5 years of Tamoxifen Alone; OR (b) Chemotherapy plus 5 years of Tamoxifen. Therefore, the information about recurrence risk in the current Reports reflects risk with a specific endocrine therapy (Tamoxifen). However, in light of other clinical evidence, in practice, patients receiving the test will receive a case-specific recommendation for endocrine therapy that is appropriate to their particular situation (e.g., Tamoxifen, an Aromatase Inhibitor). Here is an example of a later Oncotype validation study conducted in patients who had received 5-years of the aromatase inhibitor Anastrozole. This study used samples and 9-yr recurrence rates from the tamoxifen arm and the anastrozole arms of the ATAC trial, in node-negative and node-positive postmenopausal women with localized breast cancer. >> \"Prediction of Risk of Distant Recurrence Using the 21-Gene Recurrence Score in Node-Negative and Node-Positive Postmenopausal Patients With Breast Cancer Treated With Anastrozole or Tamoxifen: A TransATAC Study\" >> Dowsett (2010): http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/28/11/1829.full.pdf The prospective TAILORx trial, in node-negative (N0), hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative disease, permits a variety of endocrine therapies. The 5-year results for those with Recurrence Scores of 0 to 10 assigned to receive endocrine therapy alone were reported here: >> \"Prospective Validation of a 21-Gene Expression Assay in Breast Cancer\" >> Sparano (2015): http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1510764#t=article >>QUOTE: \"In the low-risk cohort of 1626 patients, endocrine therapy included an aromatase inhibitor in 963 patients (59%), tamoxifen in 560 (34%), sequential tamoxifen followed by aromatase-inhibitor therapy in 13 (1%), ovarian-function suppression in 44 (3%), or other or unknown therapy in 46 (3%).\" Recurrence Score is determined by tumor biology and gene expression levels from 16 cancer-related genes and 5 control genes. It is a fixed value. Various validation trials have demonstrated a relationship between Recurrence Scores and certain types of recurrence risk in those receiving various endocrine therapies. The reports feature the results of earlier studies. However, our understanding of the implications of a particular Recurrence Score for recurrence risk may be improved or refined over time, as additional clinical trial data accumulates from more robustly designed trials, such a TAILORx (node-negative) and RxPONDER.

A further excisional biopsy might be recommended, for example, if the results of the minimally invasive biopsy are unclear and/or further sampling is needed (e.g., ADH with suspicion for DCIS). However, an excisional biopsy is not a mandatory step between minimally invasive biopsy and surgical treatment (e.g., lumpectomy or mastectomy), for example, if the result is clearly malignant. I had stereotactic core-needle biopsy (two sites), which indicated extensive DCIS spanning the breast, and the next step was mastectomy. Hope your results are clearly benign. BarredOwl",

My experience illustrated the point that excisional biopsy is not generally a required step between minimally-invasive biopsy and definitive surgical treatment. BarredOwl",

      "Content": "Jul 21, 2017 06:27PM - edited Jul 21, 2017 06:45PM by BarredOwl Hi Chloe3278: I think you may be worried that the original pathology was actually incorrect and there was no DCIS there in the first place? It is possible to misdiagnose DCIS, because in some cases, it seems there can be some difficulty in distinguishing atypia from low grade DCIS. See for example, this paper: Elmore (2015), \"Diagnostic Concordance Among Pathologists Interpreting Breast Biopsy Specimens\" http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2203798 You mentioned that in addition to the first pathology review, \"3 other pathologists also confirmed the presence of DCIS\" in the tissue samples obtained during the augmentation procedure. That consensus might tend to suggest that DCIS was present in the original tissues provided for pathology review. Nevertheless, please do not hesitate to seek a further opinion from a pathologist at an independent institution. For this purpose, many look for an NCI-designated cancer center if feasible (e.g., in-network): https://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-role/cancer-centers/find. Actual pathology slides are sent overnight and examined. On the other hand, sometimes (although not very often), a small surgical biopsy (or even minimally-invasive core-needle biopsy) manages to remove all of the cancer that was present, and no further disease is found upon surgery. So another possibility might be that your original diagnosis was correct (DCIS was present), but that the first procedure removed all areas of disease. In another thread you mentioned that, \"Plastic surgeon found lumps and decided to get tissues sent for a biopsy (This is not his job, yet he saved my life). I got the results back yesterday and got told i have noninvasive low grade DCIS.\" It sounds like this was not a minimally-invasive biopsy and this could potentially be a case in which the first procedure fortuitously got it all. If DCIS was present, but they got it all in the first procedure (without realizing it), a recommendation for more surgery might still have been supported by the combined findings of all imaging and pathology. For example, sometimes if biopsy-proven disease is found in more than one place and/or if other imaging findings are suggestive of additional disease, a person could appropriately receive a recommendation for more surgery. Another possible reason for more surgery would have been positive or small surgical margins in the first procedure (i.e., the presence of DCIS at or very near the edge of the tissue samples examined, suggesting the presence of additional disease remaining in the breast). For a short explanation and illustration of margins, see this explanation of \"margins\" on the Main Site. It is possible that the recommendation you received may have been a sound recommendation based on the type of information available at the time, even if it turned out they were wrong. To explore this, if you seek a second opinion at an independent institution, you may also wish to provide copies of all imaging (mammography, ultrasound, MRI) and related written reports and request an independent review by a Radiologist and a Breast Surgeon. I understand that genetic testing was planned, and if still appropriate, certain findings may ultimately support the treatment you received. Clinical guidelines recommend genetic counseling before any testing. Hope you can get some clarity. BarredOwl",

Otherwise, between treatments, maybe she can prepare food ahead of time and freeze it, so she can just warm things up when does not feel like cooking. Sometimes mastectomy is medically indicated. When it is not required, then lumpectomy plus radiation is as effective as mastectomy in terms of overall survival. This is a fact, so it seems like your mom's aunt is not very knowledgable about breast cancer and is causing her undue stress and anxiety by saying these things. Probably the aunt has no idea why neoadjuvant chemotherapy was recommended to your mother, and has no understanding of the potential benefits and valuable information about response to chemotherapy that may be obtained from this treatment plan. Maybe you can show your Mom these discussion boards so she can join and connect with others with similar diagnoses who are going through neoadjuvant (pre-surgery) chemotherapy, and find some support. If she has troublesome symptoms from the chemotherapy, she should tell the oncology nurse. The nurse can work with her to adjust supportive medications to ease the symptoms. BarredOwl",

That kind kind of surprised me, since they are experts. They now take blood pressure at follow-up visits on my leg, because I ask them to. When I can insist, as with routine blood pressure, they can take it from my leg or not at all. I just say, \"I am at risk of lymphedema on both sides, can you please use a leg?\" The calf gives higher readings. The last time, the nurse at my PCP did not know how to take a leg reading, but the PCP found a thigh cuff (used for people whose arms are too large for the arm cuff). She put the stethoscope thingy behind my knee and got an accurate read from the popliteal artery. Yeah! She was worried it wouldn't fit me (105 lbs), but it did and worked. I'll know next time to ask if they have a thigh cuff. I was not happy about it, but had a hand-IV and arm blood pressure readings on the left (1 node) for a colonoscopy at a hospital that had a policy that foot IVs are only used after axillary dissection, not sentinel node biopsy. Luckily, nothing bad happened. If it is argued that there is no evidence that x causes LE, note that is not the same as definitively saying it is safe and does not cause it. Lymphedema can occur in some cases with SNB, the risk of it showing up is a life-long risk (it may appear years later), and once it appears, it is a life-long condition. Your wife should inform herself about the risks, unknowns and types of precautions so she can make informed decisions. BarredOwl ",

You noted that the tumor has roughly doubled in size in one week, but did not specifically state which clinical staging result was made first: \"Preliminary diagnosis: T2N2M0 or T1N1M0 (different opinions - because of biopsy taken from tumor, the tumor has grown twice its size during a week - so you see, already no clear opinion. also some say there is one node affected, others say its conglomerate with more than one node).\" If the first clinical staging was T1N1M0, and then after that the tumor doubled in size (and possibly the clinical presentation of the nodes changed), it is formally possible that at a later date, a clinician evaluating your mother would perceive clinical staging as more advanced T2N2M0 disease. In other words, if the first opinion was T1N1M0, but disease burden rapidly increased and this increase manifested clinically, then the opinions may not necessarily be in conflict (the situation changed). In contrast, if the first opinion said T2N2M0 and the later opinion said T1N1M0, then there would seem to be a difference of opinion. It is a good idea to ask for the exact names of the drug or drugs she will be receiving so you can ask specifically about them and find people here who may have received the same drug regimen. With ER+PR+ disease, endocrine therapy will likely be recommended at some point. There are a variety of different approaches / interventions, and some are more intensive than others. The recommended options generally depend on menopausal status (including whether the patient has already received oophorectomy, or receives a recommendation to consider bilateral salpingo oophorectomy), and related risk/benefit considerations, such as the magnitude of the risk of recurrent or new disease, the potential benefit of the proposed intervention(s), the side effect profile of those, and patient age and medical history (including certain known health risk factors). In your mother's case, the recommendations may also take into consideration the BRCA1 mutation (if it is known to be a pathogenic mutation). Has your mother received Genetic Counseling? If available, through consultation with a Genetic Counselor she can learn more about the types of cancers that may be associated with the particular mutation she has and the estimated life-time risks for such cancer(s). She can obtain advice regarding appropriate options for managing risk in her case, as well as whether genetic testing would be recommended for her children and other blood relatives. BarredOwl ",

Please discuss it with your Medical Oncologist. As noted above and in your other thread, I am unaware of any published validation study in the adjuvant setting that has assessed or reported on differences in distant recurrence risk based on MammaPrint Index values falling within the same risk category. If you are were provided with a reference that demonstrates such differences, please share the link. I note that prognostic information derived from a biomarker test should not not be heavily based on the same data set used to develop the test or its clinical classifier, but should be based upon the performance of the test in an independent data set to the extent possible. See item (4) of the table below, taken from a 2016 ASCO biomarker guideline which included a discussion of the reliability of the evidence supporting such tests, and in which \"[t]he panel followed the proposals made by Simon et al [9] for determining whether a biomarker test has clinical utility\": ASCO Biomarker Guideline 2016:http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2015.65.2289 Note: This guideline was issued prior to publication of the MINDACT results, and may not reflect current clinical practice, particularly in node-negative, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative invasive breast cancer.  In other words: Febbo (2011): \"NCCN Task Force Report: Evaluating the Clinical Utility of Tumor Markers in Oncology\" http://www.jnccn.org/content/9/Suppl_5/S-1.long \"For larger datasets, identifying a priori a \"discovery\" or \"training\" subset of samples and a \"validation\" or \"test\" subset of samples is common practice. The assay's characteristics are tested and refined in the discovery subset and, when the assay parameters are fixed, applied to the validation subset. Although this minimizes bias and overfitting within the dataset, a concern remains that characteristics specific to the dataset being used may result in validation that does not generalize to other sample or patient populations. Thus, independent validation sets are required for the most rigorous clinical validation of an assay.\" Use of data from the \"training\" set (used to discover or establish the test) to prove the prognostic or predictive capabilities of a biomarker test is not very sound. Proper clinical validation is the basis for reasonable reliance in clinical decision-making, and ordinarily should be based on testing performance in an independent validation set, followed by a peer-reviewed scientific publication. In the absence of adequate clinical validation, such differences would be a reasoned hypothesis. It would also have been a reasoned hypothesis to expect a different, more definitive result for the Clin Low-Genomic (MP) High group in the MINDACT trial, but this is not what was observed.

One might expect a similar representation of ILC in the various validation studies for Oncotype and for MammaPrint. ILC tends to give low or intermediate Oncotype Recurrence Scores. Re: \"I guess bottom line is I have to try and find out what my % recurrence risk would be with hormone alone, but none of them were able to say.\" Perhaps if you ask for any type of estimate or range, with all associated caveats and limitations, they might take a shot at it. Can the prognostic information from the Oncotype report be used, or do they feel it is an underestimate?  Re: \"Everyone who achieves a high risk MP score is 29% high risk without ANY treatment, (as per pg 1 of MP results), and everyone has that same 94.6% DMFI at 5 years with chemo and hormone. These two points are made in the Summary Pages:     These values were measured in different studies (one from a study predating MINDACT and one from a subset of MINDACT patients) in different patient populations and cannot be directly compared. The 29% is a \"10-year risk of Recurrence [if] Untreated.\" The term \"Recurrence\" is vague. Is it a distant recurrence estimate or any recurrence (loco-regional and/or distant)? Unfortunately, I could not find the data points (22% at 5 years; 29% at 10 years) in the cited reference (Reference (1), Buyse et al.). Perhaps Agendia has more information about this. Not everyone has the same 94.6% DMFI at 5 years with chemotherapy (\"CT\") plus endocrine therapy (\"ET\"). The illustration shows that the 94.6% number was obtained from a group of patients who were all \"ER positive, HER2 negative, Lymph Node negative patients (ER+/HER2-/LM0) from the MINDACT Trial.\"  Re: \"Although I guess the potential benefit with chemo would be that 94.6%?\" That is a relatively nice statistic (good outcomes can be achieved in this group with ET + CT), but as you noted, it reflects the combined effect of ET + CT. Be careful not to confuse the observed percent DMFI (a single data point) with the potential benefit of chemotherapy, which would be determined (for example), from the difference between distant recurrence risk with ET alone versus risk with ET + CT. The benefit represents the amount of risk reduction attributable to CT. I am sorry that I cannot be more helpful. While I have a basic grasp of the mechanics of the tests, the clinical research publications are hard for me to understand. I do not know how the various results are interpreted by experts and applied in practice, so I cannot provide you with any real guidance other than to suggest questions or areas of inquiry. Given the less common diagnosis of ILC and your unanswered questions and concerns, if you have time and if feasible (in-network, etc.), you may wish to consider seeking a third opinion from an NCI-designated cancer center (see link in my prior post). If you choose to pursue a further opinion, then as part of the process, you may also wish to request an independent pathology review (actual slides sent overnight). BarredOwl",

You mentioned: \"For example, my score of -.090 will have an 18% 5yr recurrence risk, (according to where the dots fall), whereas someone with -.350 or closer to -1.0, may have a larger than 29% risk . . .\" Here you are discussing the 5-year risk, and (assuming I am reading the report correctly), I note that the sample \"High Risk Luminal-type (B)\" summary report on-line shows an MPI of -0.350 with around ~21% risk at 5-years (left dot) (distant recurrence risk without any systemic treatment). At 10-years, it shows an MPI of -0.350 with around ~27% risk at 10-years (right dot) (distant recurrence risk without any systemic treatment).     Re: \" . . .but according to the study, everyone in the high risk group has 29% on their summary report as per Agendia, even though the dots [at right] are positioned differently, based on individual scores.\" Here, the 29% risk is a reference to the 10-year High Risk group average (distant) recurrence risk if Untreated shown in the middle box at left in the \"High Risk Luminal-type (B)\" summary report:  As mentioned in my previous post, archived reports provide the confidence interval for that 29% group average: the MammaPrint \"High Risk\" population average 10-year distant recurrence risk if untreated is 29% (95 % CI: 22% - 35%). Edited to add: As I noted earlier in the thread, you can see that the 29% risk estimate in the middle box at left above includes a citation to Reference (1): Buyse M, et al. J NatlCancer Inst. 2006 Sep 6;98(17):1183-92. Unfortunately, I could not find the corresponding data point (i.e., High Risk Group Average 29% at 10 years) in Buyse et al (2006): Buyse et al. (2006): \"Validation and Clinical Utility of a 70-Gene Prognostic Signature for Women With Node-Negative Breast Cancer\" Main Page: https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/98/17/1183/2521732/Validation-and-Clinical-Utility-of-a-70-Gene Free pdf available. Without more information, the strength of the estimate is somewhat unclear to me (e.g., How many High Risk patients were used to determine the risk estimate? What disease features are represented? etc.) BarredOwl",

It is hard to be an unusual case, but you are being very proactive and thorough in your approach. I did not have the Mammaprint test, but I did some reading to try and learn a little more. Regarding the minus 0.350 number, I found this chart (see top panel): http://www.agendia.com/media/24Feb15_High-Risk-Lum... It also contains the words \"High Risk Population Average\" with a citation to Reference 1 (Buyse et al). If the - 0.350 number is actually an average, this might suggest that patients tend to have smaller negative values. However, without more information, it is hard to tell if the average is distorted by a few outliers (what is the range and distribution?). Also, I checked Reference 1, and I have not been able to find support for the statement that the - 0.35 number is a \"high risk population average\". I am looking on a screen, so maybe you will have better luck: Reference (1):http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/98/17/1183.... Reference 1 contains the following statement: \"The previously established classifier defined good prognosis as a probability of 5-year distant metastasis\u2013free survival of more than 90% (5). The gene signature risk classification was given as a dichotomized value only: high or low risk.\" Reference (5), which explains microarrays and the development of the \"classifier\" (including some sort of mathematical algorithm) used to stratify patients as high or low risk, is here: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v415/n6871/fu... This is just a guess, but it is possible that various clinical validation studies have applied the classifier, and so are informative only with respect to the risk associated with either \"high\" or \"low\" risk cohorts, rather than the risk associated with any specific patient values. It looks like there is an on-going clinical trial (MINDACT). The design of the trial is discussed here, if you have not already seen it: http://www.nature.com/nrclinonc/journal/v3/n10/ful... I note that Reference 1 (Buyse et al.) also contains the following statement: \"Raw microarray data and clinical information are available at the European Bioinformatics Institute ArrayExpress database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/), accession number E-TABM-77. Normalized microarray data were archived by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, where a study statistician (MD) reviewed and independently applied Agendia's proprietary analysis program to the normalized microarray raw data to reproduce the risk classification. The risk classification agreement between Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and Agendia was assessed by independent study statisticians (MB, MA, FP). The concordance between the risk classification produced by Agendia and the external team was 100% as verified by the independent statisticians.\" I did not have the guts to follow that link! As you know, I am just a patient/layperson, so please raise your question and confirm anything above with your doctors as is your usual excellent practice. BarredOwl",

      "Content": "Aug 28, 2015 01:59PM - edited Aug 28, 2015 04:19PM by BarredOwl Hi: My understanding is that the binary MammaPrint test does not provide individualized risks, but only provides the average risk associated with the high risk cohort or the average risk associated with the low risk cohort. In addition, I am still of the belief that the index number (e.g. -.035) is a calculated number and is not itself a personalized percentage measure of risk. These tests look at the expression levels of 70 genes. The combined expression levels form an expression pattern or profile. The number is a value on a scale from -1.0 to +1.0 reflecting the correlation of the patient's expression profile to that of a low risk template profile. The number appears to be generatedfrom the patient's microarray data by a software program which uses an algorithm. The program takes the expression data from 70 genes (\"sample expression profile\") and assesses its degree of similarity to an established low risk expression profile (\"template\", which is a \"the mean expression profile of 44 tumors with a known good clinical outcome\" or low risk profile). After this correlation step, the output number places one in a cohort, and risk is determined as a cohort (which is the average risk of the cohort). My above comment is based on the following. Here is a direct link to the Review Memorandum from a page from fda.gov: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/k1... At page 4-5 of that document is the following quote (emphasis added): \"Data analysis is performed according to a specific MamnmaPrint ® FFPE algorithm (MammaPrint® Index, or MPI). The algorithm calculates the correlation of the sample expression profile to a template (the mean expression profile of 44 tumors with a known good clinical outcome) and determines the molecular profile of the sample. This algorithm is designed and programmed by Agendia and compiled into a standalone software program, \"X- Print Analysis Software\". The \"X-Print Analysis Software\" loads a data file (CSV) which is created by the laboratory technician by extracting specific information from the laboratory database. The \"X-Print Analysis Software\" reads the CSV file, opens the Feature Extraction Software data files (TXT), performs quality control checks, determines the sample expression profile, calculates the correlation of sample profile to the \"Low Risk\" template profile on a scale of -1.000 to +1.000 (MammaPrint® FFPE reportable range), compares the calculated correlation to a pre-defined cut-off value and determines the samples prognostic profile (i.e., Low Risk, High Risk, Low Risk Borderline, or High Risk Borderline).\" One reason for reporting individual MPI values is because, as explained on page 12, some values are considered \"borderline\": \"The \"borderline region\" refers to a range of MPI numbers surrounding the clinical classification threshold. In this region the clinical classification result accuracy potentially falls below the overall predetermined analytical accuracy of 90%.\" According to Table 10 of the FDA document linked above, the \"borderline\" cut-offs are different, depending on which test was conducted, either \"MammaPrint FFPE\" (conducted with formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples) or \"MammaPrint\" (conducted with fresh tissue samples). Regarding such \"borderline\" values, the Physician's Brochure states (emphasis added): http://www.agendia.com/media/M-ROW-010-V2_Breast-C... MammaPrint and MammaPrint FFPE The MammaPrint result is given as \"Low Risk\" or \"High Risk\" for risk of recurrence. The MammaPrint Index of a sample can fall within a pre-defined area around the classification threshold in which the MammaPrint result has <90% classification accuracy (i.e., borderline sample). When a sample is considered to be \"borderline\", it is clearly indicated on the MammaPrint analysis report. BarredOwl ",

      "Content": "Feb 20, 2016 10:18PM - edited Feb 21, 2016 12:49AM by BarredOwl For others reading this thread, it is important to note that Nibaum is HER2-positive. I believe that the Oncotype test was ordered before her actual HER2 status was known. To ensure there is no confusion among patients receiving the Oncotype type, the specific concern first noted by SpecialK above in the thread (with links), and highlighted in the FDA document linked by barcelonagirl, relates to the HER2 score (\"Oncotype DX HER2 RT-PCR\") and its use for determining HER2 status, where it may yield false-negatives for HER2 status. To my knowledge, the concern first noted by Special K and highlighted in the FDA document does not relate to the Oncotype DX multi-gene Recurrence Score (\"RS\"), which is the central output of the Oncotype test for HER2-negative patients (whose HER2-negative status has been appropriately determined by IHC and/or FISH). barcelonagirl, it looks like you were diagnosed in 2012 with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, node-negative disease, and that you first received the Onctoype DX test for invasive disease (which would appear to be consistent with NCCN and ASCO guidelines today). You obtained an intermediate Recurrence Score, and then obtained a MammaPrint test, which you found helpful. Please note that the NCCN guidelines can be quite specific in some ways regarding various multigene tests and the use and limitations of such tests and their outputs in various patient subsets. Regarding what current NCCN guidelines actually \"include,\" please download a .pdf copy of the current NCCN guidelines for Breast Cancer (Professional Version 1.2016) available at NCCN.org and review the content relating Oncotype DX for invasive disease (also referred to in places as the \"21-gene RT-PCR assay\") and relating to MammaPrint. Be sure to review what is and is not included in the charts at the front (e.g., Charts BINV-5 through BINV-9, especially Chart BINV-6, and footnotes (cc) and (dd)) and in the associated text in the Discussion (currently under revision). Please note the differing treatment of the \"21-gene RT-PCR assay\" (i.e., OncotypeDX for invasive disease) versus all other such multigene tests (e.g., MammaPrint) in the NCCN guideline. Please also note the very distinct treatment of all multigene tests in the node-positive setting. As noted in the thread above, there appears to be some difference of opinion among experts regarding the MammaPrint test and its use in clinical practice today, as illustrated in the new ASCO guideline, published on February 8, 2016: \"Use of Biomarkers to Guide Decisions on Adjuvant Systemic Therapy for Women With Early-Stage Invasive Breast Cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline\" 2016 ASCO Guideline: http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/early/2016/02/05/J\u2026 The distinctions made about MammaPrint in the ASCO Guideline seem nuanced and the brief explanations densely packed. As I stated above, it assumes a high level of understanding of the test outputs and underlying research, which we do not have. As a result, it is not clear to me what an expert medical oncologist might advise today regarding the use and value of MammaPrint in any specific case, such as in the case of a patient with HER2-positive disease, particularly in the T1a or T1b subset. A patient interested in the MammaPrint test should always consult their Medical Oncologist regarding the suitability of the test in their case. They should seek independent expert professional medical advice regarding scope and quality of validation of the test applicable to their specific circumstances. They should also specifically inquire about the information in the 2016 ASCO guideline, for example, regarding validation and use of the test, and appropriate use of test outputs (if any). This is to ensure receipt of accurate, current, case-specific information and objective expert professional medical advice. As for reaching out to Agendia without a current recommendation from one's medical oncologist, patients should be aware that Agendia representatives are not familiar with all aspects of their diagnosis or risk, and may lack relevant medical qualifications. In addition, as the commercial provider of the test, Agendia's representatives may not be entirely objective. BarredOwl",

In general, the actual tumor size may differ from the estimated size. Similarly, actual lymph node status may differ from what clinical and imaging assessments suggest. Clinical consensus guidelines for the treatment of hormone receptor-negative, HER2-positive IDC provide different options or recommendations for chemotherapy plus HER2-targeted therapy, depending on tumor size and lymph node status. (Additional clinical and pathologic factors may also be considered.) Thus, information essential to the question of systemic treatment in your case will be obtained from surgical pathology. Clinical consensus guidelines do not recommend the use of either the Oncotype or MammaPrint test for ER- PR- HER2+ disease. Instead, treatment recommendations in this situation are typically based on standard clinical and pathologic features (per the above paragraph).  (A) OncotypeDX for Invasive Breast Cancer (\"21-gene test\"): This test is used for disease that is (1) hormone receptor-positive; and (2) HER2-negative: Commercial Provider's (GenomicHealth) formal \"eligibility\": http://www.oncotypeiq.com/en-US/breast-cancer/healthcare-professionals/oncotype-dx-breast-recurrence-score/is-your-patient-eligible Those with ER- PR- disease would not be eligible. Those with HER2-positive disease would not be eligible. This is because the test for invasive disease is designed (and validated) for use in patients who will receive endocrine therapy (i.e., who are hormone receptor-positive). It is used to help inform decision the decision between: (a) endocrine therapy plus chemotherapy; or (b) endocrine therapy alone. For those who are formally eligible, in practice, the test may not always be recommended (or if done, may be accorded less weight) in those who are formally eligible but who have lymph node metastases. This is because the formal \"eligibility\" of the commercial provider may be broader in some aspects than what clinical consensus guidelines include or recommend. There are differences in how the test is viewed by NCCN and by ASCO in those with (a) node-negative (pN0) disease; (b) nodal micrometastasis (pN1mi); or (c) 1 to 3 nodal metastases.  (B) MammaPrint (\"70-gene test\") for Invasive Breast Cancer The formal eligibility requirements from the commercial provider are broader than what is included in clinical guidelines. NCCN guidelines (Version 2.2017) do not include use of the MammaPrint test in those with HER2-positive disease. Similarly, a recent ASCO Biomarker Guideline Update does not recommend use of the MammaPrint test for HER2-positive disease, explaining that: 2017 ASCO Guideline Update re MammaPrint in view of MINDACT trial: http://ascopubs.org/doi/pdfdirect/10.1200/JCO.2017.74.0472 \"Given the small HER2-positive subgroup in MINDACT and the known substantial benefit women with HER2-positive tumors derive from the addition of anti-HER2 agents to adjuvant chemotherapy, the Panel concluded that the data do not support use of the MammaPrint assay to decide whether a patient with HER2-positive breast cancer may safely forgo adjuvant chemotherapy.\"  I am a layperson with no medical training. Guidelines provide what is done in the usual case, and there may be special situations or exceptions. Therefore, please confirm the above with your team as you are planning to do. Anyone interested in these tests should not hesitate to ask their medical oncologist about them to ensure receipt of current, case-specific, expert professional medical advice. BarredOwl",

Is the recommendation based: (a) solely upon the presence of the ILC; (b) solely upon the isolated tumor cells; or (c) on both the ILC and isolated tumor cells. I am confused by your reference to \"isolated tumor cells in 2 of 3 lymph nodes, negative for malignancy.\" For example, if they were \"tumor cells\" and had features that correspond to the ILC tumor, then they would be malignant cells. On the other hand, if they were \"benign epithelial cells\", then \"tumor cells\" would seem to be a misnomer. Please seek clarification on this question, a detailed explanation of how the cells in each node were characterized by the pathologist, using cytologic and immunohistochemical staining (IHC) techniques, and what is known about the \"tumor cells\" in each node from each assessment performed. If the pathology report contains conclusory statements, then the pathologist may need to be consulted for full details. Some possible information that may be available about the isolated tumor cells includes: - Were the isolated cells determined to be epithelial cells, which would be consistent with breast luminal epithelial cells. Such breast epithelial cells could be either benign or malignant. Certain cytokeratin stains may have been used to assign epithelial origin. - What was the cytologic appearance of the isolated (epithelial) cells in each node? Was their appearance consistent with benign breast cells or malignant breast cells (e.g., based on nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, nuclear size, hyperchromasia, other features?)? - Were any stains used to determine if the isolated cells were \"ductal\" or \"lobular\"? (e.g., peripheral versus perinuclear staining with CAM5.2, or other suitable stain) What are the implications? - Was the ER and/or PR status determined on the isolated tumor cells and is it consistent with the ER and/or PR status breast ILC tumor? What are the implications? How did they get there? Please confirm it with your MO, but the presence of isolated tumor cells in a node may have several possible explanations, including (i) displacement and transport of benign breast epithelial cells; (ii) displacement and transport of malignant tumor cells (due to \"iatrogenic displacement\" during biopsy and benign transport (clean-up of cellular debris from biopsy)); or (iii) true metastasis to the lymph node from an invasive carcinoma. In some individuals, cytology and IHC can be used to eliminate scenario (i) as a possibility. In practice, it is not possible to distinguish between scenarios (ii) and (iii). Because of this, endocrine therapy may be offered as an option or recommended. The purpose of treatment, risk / benefit, and your personal risk tolerance will be factors in any decision. If there is a multidisciplinary tumor board at your institution, perhaps they would consider your case? You may also wish to seek a second opinion, including pathology review. BarredOwl",

It sounds like you didn't get a chance to demonstrate the dimpling on the right side to the breast surgeon, and it's not clear to me if you mentioned this right-side symptom to him or not. In any case, you are worried that the dimpling may signal a potential issue, despite lack of findings on mammography and ultrasound on the right. For example, was there something seen on mammography or ultrasound, the interpretation of which might potentially be viewed differently (with more suspicion) with the added knowledge of a clinical symptom (dimpling)? Would knowledge and/or clinical examination by the surgeon of the dimpling on the right (alone or with other factors) lead to a recommendation for additional imaging at this time (e.g., MRI) or a recommendation for follow-up imaging in three or six months? I have no idea. I think you need the expertise of a medical professional to answer your question. Please contact the surgeon to ask your specific question, and to ensure you receive current, accurate, case-specific expert professional medical advice in light of all current clinical symptoms and imaging data. If you have not already done so, I would also recommend that you request copies of the radiologist's reports from the ultrasound and mammogram (not a form letter or summary), so you can see exactly what they say. These will include a description of observations, a Bi-Rads score (estimate of risk), and recommendations for follow-up if indicated. They may also include information regarding density, which can reduce sensitivity of mammography. Best, BarredOwl ",

The first time I had a suspicious result on mammography, it warranted a biopsy under BI-RADs criteria and that led to my diagnosis. I'm not really clear on your current active symptoms, or the imaging concerns being actively monitored at this time. However, having a series of concerns for many years, must be very trying. Sometimes, continued follow-up is indicated and is appropriate under \"BI-RADs criteria\", which are based on clinical evidence. A new issue may appropriately lead to an additional period of follow-up. If under applicable criteria, the risk of malignancy is deemed by the radiologist to be sufficiently low, a biopsy will not usually be recommended. That is pretty general, but none of us here is qualified to figure out what may or may not be going on with you. I note that breast tissue can be found next to, above, and underneath the actual breast. So, if you have a lump beneath the axilla and next to the breast, that no one will evaluate or explain clearly to you why it is of no concern, you may find a second opinion useful. Also, it sounds like you don't have a lot of confidence or trust in your current team, but based on your history, you may continue to have need of a skilled team from time to time. Perhaps a next step would be to seek a second opinion review at an independent institution. This can entail a review of all imaging to date, written reports of the radiologist, and related medical records. If the second opinion team is a good one, you may choose to seek continuing care with them Judgment and experience are factors in the interpretation of imaging by radiologists and in the related clinical evaluation by a breast surgeon. For a second opinion, I recommend that you look for \"breast surgeon\", who (a) specializes in the treatment of patients with or at risk of breast cancer as essentially all of their practice, and (b) is affiliated with a university or hospital-based \"comprehensive breast cancer center.\" Be sure to confirm insurance coverage and in-network status. Some people look for an NCI-designated cancer center nearby: https://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-role/cancer-centers/find Best, BarredOwl ",

      "Content": "Feb 6, 2018 04:52AM - edited Feb 6, 2018 06:40AM by BarredOwl In the large majority of cases, when the OncotypeDX test for invasive disease is recommended, the test is performed on sample(s) of tumor tissue obtained from surgical treatment. This is because the results from surgical pathology may affect eligibility for the test. I agree that the original poster (\"OP\") (who has not yet had surgery) does not need an OncotypeDX (\"21-gene\") test at this time. However, she should take up the question of an Oncotype test (or suitable prognostic test) with her Medical Oncologist after her surgical pathology results are available. This will include consideration of: (1) the formal eligibility requirements of the commercial test provider (Genomic Health); and (2) the more stringent recommendations regarding the test under applicable clinical consensus guidelines from NCCN and ASCO. Under clinical consensus guidelines for breast cancer from NCCN (Version 3.2017), in addition to hormone receptor status, HER2 status, and lymph node status, the size of the tumor can be a consideration. For example, for a person whose final surgical pathology is IDC, node-negative (pN0), hormone receptor-positive (ER+ and/or PR+), HER2-negative, the Oncotype test is NOT included in NCCN guidelines IF the Tumor ≤ 0.5 cm (less than or equal to 5 mm) in largest dimension. Note that the OP's current estimated (pre-surgery) tumor sizes (4mm and 3 mm) are each technically below this size threshold. As guidelines address the typical case and there may be appropriate exceptions, patients should not hesitate to seek case-specific expert advice from their Medical Oncologist. That said, most of those with very small (i.e., Tumor ≤0.5 cm), node-negative, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative invasive disease do not receive the Oncotype test, because they ordinarily have a relatively low risk of distant recurrence. Given that the potential benefit of chemotherapy is proportional to risk (smaller benefit with lower risk), the estimated chemotherapy benefit may not be seen to sufficiently outweigh the risks of chemotherapy in such case. Endocrine therapy alone (if recommended) would ordinarily be sufficient. BarredOwl",

For example, after the second opinion, you may still choose to seek all treatments locally, or perhaps you would seek surgical treatment in Seattle (e.g., lumpectomy), but would have radiation locally. It sounds like you have some questions about your diagnostic work-up that have not been answered to your satisfaction. A second opinion at an independent institution is a very good way to probe the sufficiency and quality of the work-up and of the recommendations received to date, as well as to further explore any questions or concerns you may have. A second opinion review can include one or more of: a review of all imaging by a Radiologist; review of pathology slides by Pathologist; consultations with a breast surgeon, Radiation Oncologist, and/or Plastic Surgeon (if reconstruction or oncoplasty is of interest to you) or other specialist. Sometimes, additional diagnostic work-up, such as further imaging and/or biopsy may be recommended, or perhaps referral to a Genetic Counselor or other medical genetics professional for a more thorough genetic/familial risk assessment (in light of your personal medical history and a more complete family history (including breast and other types of cancers, ages at onset, multiple primaries, ethnicity, etc.). If the second opinion differs in a material way from current advice, and you wish to be treated locally, the results can be shared with your current team. In my case, I was initially diagnosed with unilateral breast cancer. I sought a second opinion. As part of that, a Radiologist reviewed all mammography and MRI results from the first institution, and she felt that some microcalcifications in the mammograms on the \"good\" side warranted a closer look by diagnostic mammogram. This led to another biopsy and new diagnosis of bilateral disease, substantially altering my treatment plan from unilateral to bilateral mastectomy. (I sought treatment and follow-up at the second opinion place.) Best, BarredOwl",

SNB requires intact lymph channels, so as to identify the sentinel node(s) with a tracer and/or dye. Surgery in the underarm area involving a lymph node or \"tail of the breast\" might disrupt the lymph channels in the area, and if cancer is found, might prevent a successful sentinel node biopsy at a later date (which requires intact lymph channels). If SNB cannot be done, more extensive removal of nodes (axillary lymph node dissection) would be needed, which greatly increases the risk of complications, such as lymphedema. So, please ask your surgeon whether the area of the proposed surgical biopsy in your case raises this type of concern, and if so, and whether there might still be other options available besides surgical biopsy: (a) You mentioned \"She was shocked that they did not do the ultrasound sitting up because it is obviously there.\" I would have thought that ultrasound \"sees\" things regardless of posture, but if sitting up makes the lump visible, I suppose it would make the area of concern easier to identify, and enable the technologist to focus the ultrasound exam on that area. In light of her surprise, please ask the surgeon whether she would recommend a repeat ultrasound in a seated position, in case it could enable an ultrasound-guided core-needle biopsy, instead of a surgical biopsy. (b) The main imaging modalities for diagnosis of breast cancer are mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (\"MRI\"). Please also ask whether an MRI may be indicated in your case, and might enable an MRI-guided minimally-invasive biopsy. (c) Lastly, ask if a Fine-needle aspiration may be worth a try, prior to resorting to a surgical biopsy. If cancer is found, depending on the features, sometimes systemic treatment is recommended before surgery (\"neoadjuvant\" treatment), which may shrink the tumor and enable less extensive surgery, as well as provide information about whether the treatment is working (shrinks the tumor in whole or in part). If a tumor is surgically removed first, this option is no longer available. This is another reason to probe whether minimally-inavasive biopsy may still be an option for you or not. BarredOwl ",

Then you had an MRI, which identified additional areas of suspicion, but these have not been biopsied. The only way to know if a suspicious area on MRI is cancer or not is to biopsy the area and have a pathologist examine the tissue. MRI is very sensitive and yields \"false positives\" more than other kinds of imaging. This means that an area of suspicion identified by MRI, might actually be benign on tissue biopsy. (I had two areas biopsied by MRI that were benign.) Sometimes, a person might simply prefer to have a mastectomy rather than lumpectomy (with possible re-excisions), and possibly avoid radiation therapy by mastectomy**. However, if you are wishing you could have a lumpectomy, then did they tell you that it is not feasible or not practical to biopsy one or more of the areas identified by MRI? For example, are the suspicious areas each in different quadrants of the breast and distant from the area of disease found by biopsy? If you wish you could have a lumpectomy, you could ask the doctor if there is an MRI-guided biopsy strategy that could yield helpful information (e.g., a benign finding) that may make lumpectomy an option for you. Also, if you wish, you could seek confirmation of the recommendation for mastectomy through a second opinion at another hospital. The second opinion entails a review of the pathology slides (sent overnight), all imaging to date, including the MRI, and the recommendation for mastectomy. It is possible that the recommendation for mastectomy would be confirmed, or that additional imaging or biopsy might be recommended before settling the surgical plan. BarredOwl **Occasionally, even with mastectomy, certain pathology findings on the surgical samples might lead to a recommendation of radiation.",

General Information: The main rationale for systemic drug treatment (chemotherapy; HER2-targeted therapy (for HER2-positive disease); and/or endocrine therapy (for hormone receptor-positive disease) as indicated) is the risk of distant (metastatic) recurrence. While node-negative (\"N0\") status is a favorable pathologic finding and is generally associated with a lower likelihood of suffering distant metastatic recurrence. It is not a guarantee that no cells have left the primary breast tumor and reached distant sites. Even with node-negative (N0) invasive disease and no lymphovascular invasion (\"LVI\"), it is still possible that in the years before surgery, a few rogue cancer cells broke off from the breast tumor, and moved to distant sites via the lymphatic system or via the blood stream. A few rogue cells or clusters of cells at a distant site(s) are a form of \"micrometastatic\" distant spread that is NOT detectable by conventional tumor staging procedures (lymph node biopsy) or whole-body scans. Thus, such undetected distant micrometastases may be present, even when scans are negative, nodes are negative, and there is no LVI observed. This is because these methods are not 100% accurate in determining whether any tumor cells have moved to distant sites, and cannot exclude the possibility. The risk that current undetected micrometastases may grow and become clinically manifest as recurrent metastatic disease at a later date provides the rationale for systemic therapy: >> Pantel, J Natl Cancer Inst (1999) 91(13): 1113-1124 - [parenthetical notes added by me] >> \"Because the goal of [post-surgical, systemic] adjuvant therapy is the eradication of occult [undetectable] micrometastatic tumor cells before metastatic disease becomes clinically evident . . .\" Whether such treatment(s) is warranted or not in the individual case depends on estimated individual distant recurrence risk, based on standard clinical criteria (e.g., age) and pathologic criteria (e.g., tumor histology, tumor size, lymph node status, hormone receptor status, HER2 status, etc.), and optionally, information from prognostic tests such as Oncotype (if indicated).  The Oncotype Test for Invasive Disease \"Assumes\" Receipt of 5-years Endocrine Therapy: Be sure to obtain a copy of your Oncotype report for your review and records. The Oncotype test and reports were designed for use in certain hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative patients in whom distant recurrence risk warrants consideration of or a recommendation for chemotherapy, and therefore whom would also receive a recommendation for endocrine therapy under current clinical consensus guidelines for the treatment of breast cancer. The risk information shown in the Oncotype reports reflects risks determined in clinical studies of patients who were all assigned to receive five years of Tamoxifen (either Tam Alone or Tam plus chemotherapy). This type of information goes to question of whether or not to add chemotherapy to endocrine therapy. Thus, the risk information provided by the test \"assumes\" or \"reflects\" the level of risk in those receiving five years of endocrine therapy. A person's risk would be higher than shown in their report if they were to decline endocrine therapy. Those who wish to better understand the potential benefit of endocrine therapy alone versus no additional treatment in their particular case should discuss this question with their medical oncologist.

You can still schedule your surgery on the assumption of a surgery-first treatment plan, and see if the Medical Oncologist concurs with the plan. I say this because in another post you mentioned, \"I have two separate tumors in the same breast rather far apart from each other.\" What are the (a) type; (b) size; (c) grade; and (d) ER, PR, and HER2 statuses for each of the tumors (as they could be different)? Also, your profile is currently showing Stage IB. Did you have clinical evidence of lymph node involvement or a lymph node biopsy? Stage IB requires some limited lymph node involvement. Specifically, Stage IB requires a nodal status of \"N1mi\" (micrometastases (greater than 0.2 mm and/or more than 200 cells, but none greater than 2.0 mm)). See for example, this summary from the AJCC regarding staging (Chart at page 1, bottom center, lines 3 and 4). https://cancerstaging.org/references-tools/quickreferences/Documents/BreastMedium.pdf I am not sure what type of biopsy you had, but sometimes, people are confused by size designation (e.g.,\" T1b\" Tumor > 5 mm but ≤ 10 mm in greatest dimension). But that is a size designation only (and not a stage assignment). See the link above, at page 1, top center for \"T\" size information. Best, BarredOwl",

Under the TNM system, with multiple tumors, tumor size (T) for staging is based on the single largest tumor. There are two types of staging: \"clinical\" and \"pathological\". The latter is more definitive. From the information you posted, it looks like the pathologist assigned a \"clinical stage\" of \"Stage I\". This assignment is provisional or preliminary in nature, because in this case, it is based on clinical findings and breast biopsy only, and may not reflect the whole picture. I understand no lymph node biopsy has been done, but with no clinical signs, you are clinically node negative (\"N0\"). The report is NOT saying you are Stage IB, because \"T1b\" refers to the size of the tumor only, not the stage. These are the various \"T\" size designations under the TNM system: https://cancerstaging.org/references-tools/quickreferences/Documents/BreastMedium.pdf T1mi Tumor ≤ 1 mm in greatest dimension T1a Tumor > 1 mm but ≤ 5 mm in greatest dimension T1b Tumor > 5 mm but ≤ 10 mm in greatest dimension <== This is the size of the largest one in your case T1c Tumor > 10 mm but ≤ 20 mm in greatest dimension T2 Tumor > 20 mm but ≤ 50 mm in greatest dimension T3 Tumor > 50 mm in greatest dimension Pathological stage (the definitive stage) is noted as \"TBD\" (i.e., to be determined). The \"pathological stage\" will be assigned based on what the surgical pathology and axillary staging (e.g., sentinel node biopsy) reveal about the actual tumor sizes and actual lymph node status. As I noted above, in the best case scenario, if after surgery the biggest tumor was still \"T1\" size (e.g., T1b or T1c), and you were found to be purely node negative (\"N0\") and M0, then your \"pathological stage\" would be Stage IA (T1 N0 M0). Again, that would be the best case scenario, and other outcomes are possible. Sending good vibes your way for the best possible results. BarredOwl",

The second opinion may very well be consistent with the advice you have already received. If it differs in some way, it would be quite important to know it, so as to make the best decisions. You can cross that bridge if and when you come to it. You may find the choice is easier than you expect. I sought a second opinion in Boston, and while it agreed with first about the problem on the right, they found a new problem on the left. Not surprisingly, I chose to be treated at the second opinion place. Unless you have a specific need for endocrinology and breast surgery expertise (that could not be met by adding an endocrinologist to your treatment team), then please note that many here chose a breast surgeon whose practice focuses almost entirely on the treatment of patients with breast cancer or at risk of breast cancer.

In the US and Canada, the radiologist will review the mammograms and may assign a \"Bi-Rads\" score, based on the level of suspicion raised by what he sees. The Bi-Rads score can provide a very rough estimate of the likelihood of malignancy. The radiologist may also make further recommendations for additional imaging (e.g., ultrasound), tissue biopsy, and/or follow-up imaging in 3- to 6-months time. She might also be referred to a Breast surgeon (specialist) at some point, who considers all clinical information and imaging results and makes a recommendation re next steps. She can request a complete copy of the radiologist's report from the mammogram for her review and records. If there is an area of concern to be biopsied, one cannot be certain of malignancy until a pathologist examines the tissue. The good news is that of those recommended for biopsy, around 80% have a benign result. It is very stressful and worrisome, but it is important to take things step by step. You can find a lot of information on the main site and ask questions here as more information comes in. Best wishes, BarredOwl",

Please keep in mind that we are layperson patients with no medical training, and she should look to her treating team for medical advice. Here is a link to a summary document from the American College of Radiology (\"ACR\") regarding mammography and ACR BIRADs categories: http://www.acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/PDF/QualitySafety/Resources/BIRADS/01%20Mammography/02%20%20BIRADS%20Mammography%20Reporting.pdf Please note that there are separate Bi-Rads systems for categorizing (a) density; versus (b) likelihood of malignancy. (a) Density: In your friend/relative's case, based on the reference to \"heterogeneously dense\" and \"Type III\" designation in the report, it looks like density on both sides corresponds to ACR type \"c\": \"The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses.\" Because fibroglandular breast tissue is dense, it appears white on a mammogram. Unfortunately, areas of concern also appear white. So dense tissue can make it hard to detect a problem (can't see white against a white background). The higher levels of density may also confer some increased risk of breast cancer, although this is still being studied. You can read more about density categories and see representative images that illustrate the different degrees of density in the ACR document above. (b) Findings: The report starts by listing nodular findings in descending order of concern, followed by listing calcifications and microcalcifications in descending order of concern. On the left, two intermediate density nodular lesions, measuring approx. 12 mm each in upper, outer quadrant (BIRADS IVb), and a small cluster of \"pleomorphic microcalcifications\" in central aspect of the left breast with associated small soft tissue shadow (BIRADS IVb) are moderately suspicious. As explained in the ACR document, Category 4B designations are associated with a >10% to ≤50% likelihood of malignancy. These very broad categories are not very helpful to patients. One way to look at Category 4B finding is that more likely than not, it will be found to be benign. The right nodule (6 mm) is given Category 3 (probably benign), a designation associated with a very low chance of malignancy of > 0% but ≤ 2%. In the ACR document, a Category 3 designation alone may lead to a recommendation for \"Short-interval (6-month) follow-up or continued surveillance mammography.\" You can read more about Category 3 in the ACR document. Consistent with a Category 4 designation, tissue biopsy of the lesions on the left is recommended. \"USG\" is probably \"ultra-sound guided\" and \"FNAC\" is \"fine-needle aspiration cytology\". She may wish to request additional explanation of the proposed biopsy procedure and what it entails. For example, it is not clear to me how the \"pleomorphic microcalcifications\" on the left would be located for purposes of USG biopsy, unless visible by ultrasound (currently unknown) and/or associated with a palpable lump.

But I hope they do not find anything else from the upcoming surgery on the left. When you meet with the oncologist, be sure to remind them of the planned surgery on the left, as your treatment plan might be affected by findings from the left surgical pathology (although hopefully not). It may be worthwhile to meet now. You can get answers to your questions and ask if any further testing is needed for the right findings. I am not clear on your initial or current diagnosis and various ER PR and HER2 statuses of DCIS and IDC from biopsy and surgery. I assume if you were initially staged as Stage IA, then both DCIS and IDC were present in the biopsy. Be sure to obtain copies of the full pathology reports from biopsy and from all surgeries, and all supplements or addenda (with ER, PR, HER2 testing, etc.) Compare the findings for the DCIS from the biopsy with those of the DCIS from the surgical pathology. If there is any difference in the findings relating to the DCIS, such as ER or PR status, point it out to the oncologist, request review and an explanation, and ask if further testing is recommended to resolve any differences. Compare the biopsy findings for the IDC with those of the IDC from the surgical pathology. If there is any difference in the findings relating to the IDC, such as ER status, PR status, or HER2 status, point it out to the oncologist, request review and an explanation, and ask if further testing is recommended to resolve any differences. Is there an error, or is multifocal IDC present (multiple tumors with different properties)? In the latter case, what are the implications for treatment? There is a very helpful pamphlet \"Your Guide to the Breast Cancer Pathology Report\" available in .pdf at the bottom of this page to download and print and annotate: http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/diagnosis/get... Also be sure to check the margin sizes for both the DCIS and IDC separately (distance from DCIS to edge of tissue, and distance from IDC to edge of tissue), and ask your breast surgeon to confirm that all margins are adequate.

Different diagnoses present different risks. That's why even a small difference in diagnosis can lead to a different treatment recommendation for one person vs. another.\" Lumpectomy plus radiation is an effective treatment plan. In addition, being estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) will give you the added option of anti-hormonal therapy (also called \"endocrine therapy\", e.g., tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor), which is also good. Be sure to request a copy of your pathology report from the biopsy for your review and records. It is good practice for understanding the surgical pathology report. You'll find a lot of information and support here as you move forward with your plan. Take care, BarredOwl",

The coordination of the implementation for a new staging system is critically important to ensure that all partners in patient care and cancer data collection are working in synchrony. In order to ensure that the cancer care community has the necessary infrastructure in place for documenting 8th Edition stage, the AJCC Executive Committee, in dialogue with the National Cancer Institute (NCI-SEER), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the College of American Pathologists (CAP), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN, the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB), and the Commission on Cancer (CoC), made the decision to delay the implementation of the 8th Edition Cancer Staging System to January 1, 2018. Clinicians will continue to use the latest information for patient care, including scientific content of the 8th Edition Manual. All newly diagnosed cases through December 31st 2017 should be staged with the 7th edition. The time extension will allow all partners to develop and update protocols and guidelines and for software vendors to develop, test, and deploy their products in time for the data collection and implementation of the 8th edition in 2018. The AJCC is working together with all of its members as well as software vendors to make this transition as smooth as possible for the oncology community.

For example, if the biopsy showed the IDC was ER negative, PR negative, HER2-positive (ER- PR- HER2+), but the surgical pathology showed the IDC was ER+ PR+ HER2+, then you would wonder whether (a) you are understanding the reports correctly, or (b) if there is a pathology error somewhere (error in conducting the tests, error in interpretation of the tests, or error in reporting of the results for the biopsy or surgery), or (c) if there are actually two different types of IDC present with different features. This should be clarified, because there can be implications for treatment. If there were two types of IDC present, I would also want to know what the sizes of the two tumors were, if known or knowable. The ER PR status affects treatment under National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for breast cancer (Version 1.2016). For example, the guidelines provide that for Node-negative (N0), Hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive IDC, Tumor >1 cm: Adjuvant endocrine therapy + adjuvant chemotherapy with trastuzumab (category 1) But the following is generally provided for Node-negative (N0), Hormone receptor-negative, HER2-positive IDC, Tumor >1 cm: Adjuvant chemotherapy (category 1) with trastuzumab (category 1) If ER+PR+ IDC is indeed present, adjuvant endocrine therapy (e.g., tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor) would likely be recommended. If you are not satisfied with the explanations you receive or just want confirmation, you can also seek a second opinion review of the pathology slides at an independent institution once the results from the left-side surgery are back. I will be hoping for the best possible outcome for you. BarredOwl",

Such treatment is within the area of expertise of medical oncologists (and not breast surgeons). With IDC, factors such as the extent of disease (e.g., large primary tumor), \"triple-negative\" (ER-PR-HER2-), and/or \"HER2-positive\" status may lead to consideration of \"neoadjuvant\" (pre-surgical) therapy. However, it is also used in other situations. In the appropriate case, with extensive disease, neoadjuvant treatment may cause shrinkage of the tumor and may permit the option of lumpectomy plus radiation instead of mastectomy. Another potential advantage of neoadjuvant treatment is that it can provide information about \"pathological response\", meaning they can monitor during treatment and at later surgical removal, if the tumor responds / responded to the chemotherapy regimen (shrinks or disappears completely (i.e., \"pathological complete response\")). If the response is not adequate, this information allows a switch to a different regimen. If you would like case-specific, expert professional advice, please do not hesitate to meet with the medical oncologist prior to surgery. I am a layperson, so perhaps I am missing something, but a person who has no clinical evidence of lymph node involvement, with widely separated tumors considered to be \"multiple\" tumors by a pathologist applying AJCC criteria, in whom surgical pathology reveals the largest tumor to be \"T1\" in size, with no node involvement (\"N0\"), and no clinical or radiographic evidence of distant metastases (\"M0\"), would be deemed Stage IA (T1 N0 M0), according to AJCC. This still seems formally possible in your case (as are higher stages, because lymph node status cannot be predicted from negative imaging and negative clinical findings). BarredOwl",

This would also be the case in the USA, Canada, and the UK, considering lymph node status alone. The various guidelines do not differ in that regard (with more than three positive lymph nodes). gb2115: Amelia received case-specific advice that she is not eligible for either the OncotypeDX (\"21-gene\") test or the MammaPrint (\"70-gene\") test. These tests would not be indicated for a person with 17 positive lymph nodes under applicable consensus guidelines in the US or under formal eligibility criteria from the test providers either. Other patients in Europe with different pathologic features may indeed be eligible for and may receive the MammaPrint test under their local consensus guidelines. Patients should seek case-specific advice from their Medical Oncologist, any may be interested in consulting the current texts of their local guidelines for their information. Multiple guidelines may be in play, including regional European as well as national guidelines. The policies of health authority payors may be a separate question. ESMO's guideline (European Society for Medical Oncology) for primary breast cancer in 2015 provided very generally: \"Gene expression profiles, such as MammaPrint (Agendia, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), Oncotype DX Recurrence Score (Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA), Prosigna (Nanostring technologies, Seattle, WA) and Endopredict (Myriad Genetics), may be used to gain additional prognostic and/or predictive information to complement pathology assessment and to predict the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy. The three latter tests are designed for patients with ER-positive early breast cancer only. The clinical utility of Mammaprint and Oncotype DX is still being prospectively evaluated in large randomised clinical trials such as MINDACT for Mammaprint, WSG PLAN B trial, TAILORx and RxPONDER for Oncotype DX.\" Since the, the primary results of MINDACT have been published and local guidelines may have changed. See for example, this press release from Agendia (the provider of the MammaPrint test). More recently, the St. Gallen International panel noted in 2017: \"The Panel agreed that a number of gene expression signatures served as prognostic markers in the setting of adjuvant endocrine therapy in node-negative breast cancers, including the 21 gene [OncotypeDX] recurrence score, the 70 gene [MammaPrint] signature, the PAM50 ROR score, the EpClin score, and the Breast Cancer Index. The Panel endorsed all of these assays for guiding the decision on adjuvant chemotherapy in node-negative tumors as they all identify node-negative cases at low risk, with an excellent prognosis that would not warrant chemotherapy [23\u201327]. [NOTE: Our local ASCO guidelines are more nuanced than this, and do not broadly support the use of the MammaPrint test in all cases.] Nodal status is a strong prognostic factor regardless of gene expression signature. The Panel agreed that gene expression signatures offered information that can refine the prognosis for node-positive breast cancers. However, the Panel did not uniformly endorse the use of gene expression signatures for making treatment decisions regarding adjuvant chemotherapy in node-positive cases. The 21-gene recurrence score and the 70-gene signature have now been evaluated in prospective studies including small numbers of node-positive cancers. In the prospective trial (MINDACT), only patients with node-negative, or one to three positive nodes were included. Patients with low-risk tumor scores and a limited degree of nodal involvement appear to have a good prognosis with or without chemotherapy [28, 29].\" In the US, the various guidelines from ASCO and NCCN also differ somewhat in what they provide regarding the use of these tests node-negative versus node-positive disease. Here as well, patients should seek current, case-specific expert professional advice from their Medical Oncologist. BarredOwl",

The Oncotype test for DCIS is not always offered for a variety of reasons. For example, if the results of any biopsy or surgery showed the presence of invasive disease (e.g., microinvasion), the test would not be indicated. In this regard, be sure to obtain complete copies of the pathology reports from all biopsies, surgeries and any re-excision(s)) for your review and records.  General Information - Oncotype - Invasive disease test versus DCIS test: Note that the tests for invasive disease and for DCIS differ in the number of test genes used, they are used in different patient populations (different \"eligibility\" requirements), for different purposes, and their recurrence risk ranges are also different. Because of these differences, if a person has invasive disease (e.g., IDC, ILC) and received the test for invasive disease, then their Recurrence Score cannot be compared to DCIS scores. Invasive Disease (\"21-gene test\"): The Recurrence Score for invasive disease relies on the mRNA levels of 16 cancer-related genes and 5 reference or control genes from a sample of the tumor. It is used in patients with invasive disease that is hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, regardless of type of surgery, to inform decision-making regarding chemotherapy (endocrine therapy alone or endocrine therapy plus chemotherapy). The standard recurrence risk categories for the test for invasive disease are: Low-risk (Recurrence Score < 18) Intermediate-risk (Recurrence Score 18 to 30) High-risk (Recurrence Score ≥ 31)  DCIS (\"12-gene test\"): The Recurrence Score for DCIS relies on the mRNA levels 7 cancer-related genes and 5 reference genes (a subset of the genes used in the invasive test) from a sample of the tumor. It is used in patients determined by surgical pathology to have pure DCIS (no invasive disease) and who were treated by local excision (also known as breast conserving therapy or lumpectomy) (with or without tamoxifen), to aid in decision-making regarding radiation therapy. Eligibility for the DCIS test does not require any particular receptor status. The standard recurrence risk categories for the DCIS test are different, with \"high risk\" starting at a higher score: Low-risk (DCIS Score < 39) Intermediate-risk (DCIS Score 39\u201354) High-risk (DCIS Score ≥ 55)  The Oncotype test for DCIS: For those with pure DCIS (in one breast) treated by breast conserving surgery alone, the DCIS test generates a \"Recurrence Score.\" Based on certain trial data, individual Recurrence Scores have been correlated with certain average rates of ipsilateral recurrence at 10 years (any event (invasive or DCIS); and invasive only). This type of information is \"prognostic\" in nature (i.e., it speaks to recurrence risk). The \"eligibility requirements\" for the test for DCIS versus the test for invasive cancer are not the same. Regarding Oncotype for DCIS, the eligibility requirements of the commercial provider are described here (my [edit] in brackets): \"Eligibility\" for DCIS test: http://breast-cancer.oncotypedx.com/en-US/Professional-DCIS/WhatIsTheOncotypeDXBreastCancerTest/WhichPatients - For women with ductal carcinoma in situ treated by local excision [also known as breast conserving therapy or lumpectomy], with or without tamoxifen. A sample report from the DCIS test can be found here: Sample report for DCIS test: http://breast-cancer.oncotypedx.com/en-US/Professional-DCIS/Ordering/ReadingReports When indicated, the Oncotype test for DCIS is usually performed on surgical samples, after surgical pathology establishes pure DCIS in a breast treated with lumpectomy. The above is probably a broader statement than what occurs in practice in the clinic at this time. This may reflect in part the characteristics of the patient populations in which the DCIS test was evaluated (limitations in \"clinical validation\"), and that (to my knowledge as a layperson) the DCIS test is not included in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for Breast Cancer (Version 2.2017). The DCIS test may not be recommended to some patients: - This may reflect that the test is not included in consensus guidelines for DCIS. - In some patients with pure DCIS, the test may not be seen as sufficiently reliable if their pathology differs in significant ways from that of the patient populations in which the test has been studied (a question regarding the \"scope of validation\" of the test). - In some cases of pure DCIS, certain clinicopathologic features may weigh strongly in favor of radiation. The test is not a stand-alone test. It is used to provide prognostic information about recurrence risk without radiation, and its outputs are considered along with other clinicopathologic factors that affect personal risk profile. In certain cases, these other factors may easily dominate the calculus (making the test of no added value). The outputs of the test for DCIS currently do not provide a recommendation about radiation, and do not predict efficacy of radiation, per one commentator: \"Of note, in contrast to the Oncotype DX 21-gene array and systemic therapy, the DCIS Score defines a risk of recurrence (prognostic) but conveys no information about the effectiveness of WBRT (predictive).\" All information above should be confirmed with your Radiation Oncologist. Anyone interested in the Oncotype test for DCIS should not hesitate to ask their Radiation Oncologist for current professional advice regarding eligibility and the potential utility of the test in view of their particular presentation and current clinical evidence.

      "Content": "Apr 13, 2017 11:56PM - edited Apr 14, 2017 12:12AM by BarredOwl In case other surgeons have said the same thing about the DCIS test, and other patients may be unduly concerned, given that the DCIS test is not included within our local consensus guidelines, taken alone, the fact that a breast surgeon does not recommend use of the Oncotype test for DCIS in connection with the question of radiation therapy (not his formal area of expertise), should not be a significant cause for concern. You can always discuss it with your Radiation Oncologist after the full surgical pathology is back, assuming you are still \"eligible.\" Regarding margins for DCIS with breast conserving surgery, our local NCCN guidelines for breast cancer (Version 2.2017) were just updated this month: \"MARGIN STATUS IN DCIS The NCCN Panel accepts the definition of a negative margin as \"No ink on the tumor,\" from the 2016 SSO/ASTRO/ASCO Consensus Guidelines on Margins. For pure DCIS, margins of at least 2 mm are associated with a reduced risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) relative to narrower negative margin widths in patients receiving WBRT. The routine practice of obtaining negative margin widths wider than 2 mm is not supported by the evidence. DCIS with micro-invasion (defined as no invasive focus >1 mm in size) should be considered as DCIS when considering the optimal margin width. For patients treated with excision alone (without radiation), regardless of margin width, the risk of IBTR is substantially higher than treatment with excision and whole breast radiation therapy (even in predefined low-risk patients). The optimal margin width for treatment with excision alone is unknown, but should be at least 2 mm. Some evidence suggests lower rates of IBTR with margin widths wider than 2 mm.\" Here is a link to the recent 2016 SSO/ASTRO/ASCO guideline: \"Society of Surgical Oncology\u2013American Society for Radiation Oncology\u2013American Society of Clinical Oncology Consensus Guideline on Margins for Breast-Conserving Surgery With Whole-Breast Irradiation in Ductal Carcinoma In Situ\" Morrow (2016): http://ascopubs.org/doi/pdf/10.1200/JCO.2016.68.3573 This guideline does not apply to the setting of DCIS with mastectomy.

Ki-67 is a protein that is a marker of cell proliferation or cell growth (a higher percentage suggests more dividing tumor cells). In general, rapidly dividing cells may be more responsive to chemotherapy. The 2015 St. Gallen panel commented: \"There can be little doubt that Ki-67 scores carry robust prognostic information [24], and that high values predict the benefit of addition of cytotoxic chemotherapy [25], but definition of a single useful cut point has proved elusive both because Ki-67 displays a continuous distribution [26], and as a result of analytic and preanalytic barriers to standardized assessment [27].\" In other words, despite the results of studies which report some prognostic and predictive value, there are technical issues with determination of ki-67 percentages by standard IHC methods, including interobserver variability (different results when different people perform the test on the same sample) and lack of reproducibility across laboratories, as explained in detail here: Polley (2013): \"An International Ki67 Reproducibility Study\" http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/105/24/1897.full (Free PDF available via link) Also, different studies use different values as cut points or cut-offs between what is considered \"low\" or \"high\" ki-67. All of this makes it difficult to rely on the results of clinical studies in which ki-67 was determined in other labs and to interpret the clinical significance of a ki-67 test result based on such studies. Accordingly, some institutions no longer perform ki-67 testing (at this time), and clinical consensus guidelines (e.g., from ASCO) do not generally support the broad use of ki-67 protein (determined by standard IHC) to guide adjuvant chemotherapy decisions.

Considering lifestyle factors, I implemented some dietary changes, lost a few more pounds (after surgery), and I have kept it off for now. After a life-time of weighing myself to make sure my weight was not creeping up, for the past three years, I have been weighing myself to make sure I don't lose any more weight. If I visit my mom, I can still pack on a few pounds in a short time, but it comes off quickly when I resume my more spartan diet. With a diagnosis of DCIS-MI, your prognosis is very similar to that of DCIS. Ordinarily, with this type diagnosis, one would not receive any scans. Were there some symptoms of concern on the part of medical personnel that led to the testing (e.g., CT), and is that why you are seemingly questioning the negative test results? It would seem like the tests further support no evidence of disease and the good prognosis. Members in your other thread suggested that continuing anxiety may be a factor. I would also note that fat tissue is not inert and can impact metabolism. In other words, it works to maintain itself. Having shed some pounds, if you were eating a healthy diet to begin with (limited added sugar, lots of vegetables, etcetera), even if you have made no significant changes in diet, perhaps you have established a new, lower set point. In this case, if your weight is now a healthy weight (e.g., normal BMI), and if you have no other physical symptoms of concern, you may wish to look into approaches to relaxation (e.g., mindfulness, yoga, Tai Chi, Qi-Gong). On the other hand, if you are not at a healthy weight (underweight), you can consult with your primary care physician about it, and request a referral to a nutritionist (to ensure adequate protein, other nutrients, etc.). Similarly, if you have any other physical symptoms (e.g., thinning hair, other), then check in with your primary care physician to exclude other possible explanations. BarredOwl",

It sounds like you have made a few changes which could explain it, particularly with a robust exercise regimen like yours! Exercise, less added sugar, and less alcohol are all healthy steps. The combined caloric reduction and impact on metabolism of reducing sugar (e.g., sugars raise insulin and promote fat storage) can be surprisingly effective to control weight, even with a more moderate exercise program. I am 5'2\". Pre-diagnosis, I was ~122, and now I am ~105. I never drank much alcohol, but made comparable changes (I cut out fruit juice (~100 -120 calories/day, 22-36 g sugar per cup), stopped drinking milk (100-200 calories per day), and cut some added sugars (e.g., avoiding certain processed foods and dessert foods)).

I have had a stereotactic core needle biopsy guided by mammography (two areas sampled). I did not have any sedation and I was okay. When they position you, make sure you are comfortable and inform them if you are not. For example, I am slim, and the table was hard, so I asked for some padding under my ribs. The area is numbed. The mammogram compression was slightly uncomfortable (involves more than the numbed area), so I informed them and they backed off. With a stereotactic device, there was no digging around. They used mammography to localize the specific area and \"place\" a positioning device, under local anesthetic. The positioning piece directed the sampling part of the device. The radiologist told me what she was doing throughout the procedure (\"We are discussing how to access the second site\", \"We are looking under the microscope to confirm that we got calcifications, etc.\") You do need to generally be still, but only very still when the sample is taken (seconds). There is a noise (\"rat-a-tat-tat\") when a sample is taken, but I was warned when it would come, so I would not be startled and I could not feel it. There was a team of nurses, and one very kind nurse stood at my shoulder during the entire procedure, distracting me by chatting with me, and helping me stay relaxed. I wore a sports bra, and they gave me little ice packs, which I used the first day. The ice packs were better than tylenol. I had no palpable lump either. Unfortunately, my suspicious calcifications turned out to be DCIS, and upon surgery, a small area of invasive cancer (1.5 mm) was found. BarredOwl",

The following assumes you received both the MammaPrint and BluePrint tests. Please advise if that is not the case. If not, the following may not apply to your case. A combined MammaPrint /BluePrint result of Luminal-type (B) reflects a MammaPrint \"High Risk\" score. As explained in the sample BluePrint report on-line for Luminal-type subtype (please confirm when you receive your personal reports): http://www.agendia.com/media/24Feb15_BP-Luminal.pdf \"Luminal-type breast cancers can be sub-stratified into \"Luminal A\" and \"Luminal B\" using the MammaPrint categorical result of \"Low Risk\" and \"High Risk\", respectively, in combination with the BluePrint Luminal molecular subtype.\" In other words, the subtype of \"Luminal-type\" as determined by BluePrint can be further divided into two sub-categories (either Luminal-type (A) or Luminal-type (B)) based on the MammaPrint risk category: - If the MammaPrint result is \"Low Risk\", then the result is Luminal-type (A). - If the MammaPrint result is \"High Risk\", then the result is Luminal-type (B). So if a person is Luminal-type (B) by MammaPrint / BluePrint, then they had a MammaPrint \"High Risk\" result. Please be sure to request an explanation of your results, and obtain copies of all documents provided by Agendia (test provider), including: (a) MammaPrint (FFPE) Result Depending on the MammaPrint result, either a \"High Risk\" or a \"Low Risk\" report will be received. See for example, this MammaPrint FFPE \"High Risk\" sample report (USA): http://www.agendia.com/media/25Sep15_MP-High-Risk.pdf There is a field for \"Additional Comments,\" so it is essential to obtain a copy of your personal report. (b) BluePrint Result Depending on the \"molecular subtype\" result according to BluePrint, you will receive one of the following three reports: a \"Luminal-type\" report, a \"HER2-type\" report, or a \"Basal-type\" report. See for example, this BluePrint \"Luminal-type\" sample report (USA): http://www.agendia.com/media/24Feb15_BP-Luminal.pdf There is a field for \"Additional Comments,\" so it is essential to obtain a copy of your personal report. (c) Summary of Results One of the following four reports will be received: (i) Summary Page Low Risk Luminal-type A; or (ii) Summary Page High Risk Luminal-type B; or (iii) Summary Page High Risk HER2-type; or (iv) Summary Page High Risk Basal-type See for example, this \"Summary Page High Risk Luminal-type B\" sample report (USA): http://www.agendia.com/media/High-Risk-Luminal-62116.pdf (d) Any additional documentation received (e.g., summary sheets regarding MINDACT trial results) The \"Summary Page High Risk Luminal-type B\" report includes some data from an earlier, relatively small study (Knauer (2010)) with the 88% and 76% data points you mentioned (see page 2, top). There are limitations to this particular study, and any medical advice you receive regarding the potential benefit of chemotherapy will not be based solely on these findings, but on more recent studies as well, including the recent MINDACT trial results, in light of your individual circumstances, including considerations such as \"Clinical Risk\" classification (per MINDACT, as applicable), the settings of lobular breast cancer and recurrent disease, and possible implications of the \"Luminal-type B\" status determined by this method. I am a layperson with no medical training. Therefore, all information above should be confirmed with a medical oncologist to ensure receipt of accurate, current, case-specific expert professional medical advice. Best, BarredOwl",

So, it is possible that it is not needed in your particular case. I am a layperson, so do not hesitate to ask your providers whether it may be informative in your case or not, if you have any concern. If a biopsy shows malignancy, MRI is the more sensitive modality. I was diagnosed in 2013. So far so good. There was a malignant result on the right (\"DCIS\"), and my main reason for seeking a second opinion was to confirm the surgical recommendation on the right (which it did). But they found a problem on the left (low probability event). Regarding future screening modalities (mammography, ultrasound, MRI, 3D-mammography) and frequency of screening, I would recommend consulting a medical professional to obtain an estimate of your life-time risk of breast cancer, and work with them to develop a screening program appropriate to your risk that takes density into account. Typically, the levels of density that raise concern for possible reduced sensitivity of mammography are \"heterogeneously dense\" and \"extremely dense\". Re time for scheduling the biopsy, are you in the US or elsewhere? BarredOwl",

[This] new proposed staging system, while providing an improvement in grouping patients with similar prognoses, is complex, and its incorporation into clinical practice may require special software or electronic tools [21].\" Regarding the advantages of their own approach: >> \"Our proposed risk-score point-based system provides refinement and builds on the anatomic AJCC system. This score system has several advantages over the \"prognostic staging\" described in the eighth edition of the AJCC staging manual. It is simple and easy to calculate; in addition, the information needed to calculate it is available in most pathology reports. This risk score modification will be easy to incorporate into routine clinical practice and reflects the current use of endocrine and HER2-targeted therapies. Furthermore, because this risk score does not change the current TNM system, it will still provide a common language with which to communicate with colleagues when biological data is not available, or to compare outcomes from retrospective cohorts.\" They invite adoption of their system in the future: >> \"In order for our staging systems to remain current and useful, we must make efforts to incorporate clinically relevant biological information in a simple form that is easy to use in daily practice. Our risk score incorporating ER and HER2 should be considered as a simpler alternative to the proposed eighth edition AJCC \"prognostic stage\" in upcoming revisions.\" I guess only time will tell.

Unfortunately, to my knowledge, no \"alternatives\" or supplements have ever been established by reliable clinical evidence to cure cancer. Obviously, if there were such an alternative or supplement, it would not be a secret, you would not have to research long and hard to find it, and all of us here would be telling you about it and using it as a medication prescribed by our doctors. Please do not waste your time searching for an alternative cure. Complementary interventions, such as mindfulness, may be very helpful. You may also find mindfulness helpful in dealing with stress and worry as a caregiver. See e.g., Full Catastrophe Living (Revised Edition): Using the Wisdom of Your Body and Mind to Face Stress, Pain, and Illness\" by Kabat-Zinn and Hahn: http://www.amazon.com/Full-Catastrophe-Living-Revi... With lumpectomy for invasive ductal carcinoma (according to another thread estimated pre-surgery to be stage I or II), a course of radiation is quite likely for a woman in her early fifties. Once the pathology is in, you and your mother can ask the radiation oncologist for an estimate of the risk reduction benefit of radiation in her particular case to help you both understand the potential benefit it offers her in terms of reducing her risk of loco-regional recurrence. It may be substantial. Whether (a) chemotherapy, (b) HER-targeted therapies (e.g., trastuzumab/HERCEPTIN), and/or (c) endocrine therapy (e.g., tamoxifen, an aromatase inhibitor) will be indicated or not will depend on the specific features of her disease determined by pathology and associated tests, including the tumor size, lymph node status, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 status of her disease. In some cases, additional tests might be indicated and they can inform treatment decisions (e.g., OncotypeDX test for certain types of invasive disease). Meanwhile, you can download and print the .pdf pamphlet \"Your Guide to the Breast Cancer Pathology Report\" at the bottom of this page, which may be very helpful to you when the results come in: http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/diagnosis/get... You can help your mother a lot simply by spending time with her, listening to her, allowing her to express her fears without discounting them, by going with her to appointments (if possible), taking notes, helping her to understand her diagnosis and the medical advice she receives, and supporting her during any further treatment. Hoping for the best possible pathology results for your mom. BarredOwl",

There can be limitations with minimally-invasive biopsy (e.g., restricted sample size, etc). For \"triple-positive\" tumors greater than 1 cm (M0), the NCCN guidelines recommend endocrine therapy and chemotherapy plus trastuzumab (regardless of nodal status). As noted above, this is a \"category 1\" recommendation, meaning the highest level of consensus under NCCN guidelines (\"Based upon high-level evidence, there is uniform NCCN consensus that the intervention is appropriate.\"). Generally, the use of pertuzumab (PERJETA) in the ADJUVANT setting was incorporated into the NCCN guidelines for treatment of breast cancer in 2014, per an ASCO Post article: http://www.ascopost.com/issues/may-15-2014/nccn-clinical-practice-guidelines-in-oncology-2014-updates/ The current version of the NCCN guidelines (Version 1.2016) regarding ADJUVANT therapy (in the non-metastatic (M0) setting) applicable to ductal carcinoma, hormone-receptor positive, HER2-positive, node-negative (N0) disease, where the Tumor >1 cm provides for adjuvant endocrine therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy with trastuzumab, with the following footnote regarding the addition of pertuzumab in certain subsets: (bb) \"A pertuzumab-containing regimen can be administered to patients with ≥T2 or ≥N1, HER2-positive, early-stage breast cancer.\" T2 = Tumor > 20 mm but ≤ 50 mm in greatest dimension N1 = Micrometastases; or metastases in 1\u20133 axillary lymph nodes; and/or in internal mammary nodes with metastases detected by sentinel lymph node biopsy but not clinically detected*** The guidelines are not mandatory, and in appropriate cases, patients and their doctors may depart from what they provide. Note that the NCCN guidelines include some uses which are not approved by FDA and are considered \"off-label\" (and may require insurer approval). In particular, the FDA-approved label for pertuzumab (version approved March 22, 2016) includes certain uses in the metastatic setting and neoadjuvant setting. It does not appear to include use in the adjuvant setting by my layperson's read. See \"Indications and Usage\" at page 1, column 1. See also, commercial site: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2016/125409s109lbl.pdf http://www.perjeta.com On the question of adjuvant pertuzumab (Perjeta) in your case, possibly reasonable minds could differ. You may wish to inquire if there is a \"tumor board\" (multidisciplinary board) where you are receiving care, and if they would consider your case. The addition of such an agent is not without risk, so if considered, the risks must be weighed against the potential benefits. In the interest of being fully informed, don't hesitate to ask about the nature of the evidence available (or extrapolated from) for its use in the adjuvant setting (e.g., that led to incorporation into the NCCN guidelines), and whether there is any evidence for an improvement in event-free survival (e.g., recurrence) or overall survival in any setting. You may want to join the triple-positive group here for more input from others who have experience with targeted treatments and can share their pre-treatment scan experience: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/80/topics/764183?page=985#idx_29545 As I am a layperson with no medical training, be sure to confirm all information above with your team to ensure you receive accurate, up to date, case-specific, expert professional advice. Hope you continue to make good progress towards a treatment plan that is right for you! BarredOwl  [Note: The above information is NOT a summary of all adjuvant uses of pertuzumab, and does not exclude its use in patients with different features than those recited. Anyone interested in whether pertuzumab is an option for them should always ask their MO, to ensure accurate, current, case-specific expert professional medical advice.]",

As a layperson, I don't know enough to interpret ISH test results with confidence. Actually, I am not sure anyone here could reliably advise you on your question, because it is not clear what all the numbers represent or the kind of test(s) that were conducted (Raw numbers? Single-probe average HER2 copy number? Dual-probe HER2/CEP17 ratio and average HER2 copy number?). It looks like you are about to start chemotherapy, with a regimen presumably based on being HER2-negative according to your profile (i.e., no HER2-targeted therapy). If you have any concern about your HER2 status (which would affect the drugs you receive), please contact your MO immediately and ask your MO to explain your HER2 test results to you to your satisfaction.

Some nerve regeneration can occur, but it takes more time. Prior to surgery, I watched a you-tube video about one woman's post-surgical experience. She was only very recently out of surgery, and was exploring the area for sensation. She did not like a large area of numbness on one side of her chest at all. I vividly remember her declaring: \"Unacceptable!!\" I am almost two-years out from a double (BMX). Full feeling has returned across my entire chest (quite early), and weird sensations have finally stopped. This is quite variable as you can see from other posts above. The backs of my upper arms still have some weirdness, but they are not numb. (I still run my fingers gently along the skin on the back of my arms, hoping to stimulate the local nerves and my brain neurons to get with it. Possibly not scientific, but it can't hurt.) The only areas where numbness has persisted is some of the skin of the underarm area. Numbness in the armpit area is a reason to take care with hair removal, to avoid nicks from a razor, as a lymphedema precaution. See e.g., https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/91/topic/...

Per the above recommendations, here is the list of \"NCI-designated cancer centers\" in the United States, which are very good options for second opinion review: http://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-role/cancer-centers/find One can arrange for a second opinion review of pathology slides only. Optionally, one may choose to seek a review of all imaging, pathology results (biopsy, surgery), including ER, PR and HER2 test results, and related reports, and obtain a second opinion regarding treatment options. Even if one must travel a bit, I think it is worth tapping into the available expertise (confirm covered by insurance and in-network), even if one ultimately chooses to receive actual treatment closer to home.

I am not sure of the source for your comment about \"my 80% chance now of malignancy.\" Radiologist's reports do not typically provide a numerical estimate of risk, and Bi-Rads category 4C is not associated with a specific risk of 80% malignancy. In this regard, this American College of Radiology (ACR) document includes some information regarding Bi-Rads categories. ACR - Mammography: http://www.acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/PDF/QualitySafety/Resources/BIRADS/01%20Mammography/02%20%20BIRADS%20Mammography%20Reporting.pdf Regarding Category 4 in general, the text states: \"[Category 4] is reserved for findings that do not have the classic appearance of malignancy but are sufficiently suspicious to justify a recommendation for biopsy. The ceiling for category 3 assessment is a 2% likelihood of malignancy and the floor for category 5 assessment is 95%, so category 4 assessments cover the wide range of likelihood of malignancy in between. Thus, almost all recommendations for breast interventional procedures will come from assessments made using [Category 4].\" Regarding Category 4C in particular, see \"Table 6\" where Bi-rads Category 4C \"High suspicion for malignancy\" still reflects a rather wide range of risk: \"> 50% to <95% likelihood of malignancy\" I know it is difficult, but with so much wobble room in that huge range and a threshold just above 50%, it is not very meaningful beyond saying \"it is more probable than not, so a biopsy is warranted.\" Try and hold on to the \"50%\" end of the range for now. Imaging has limitations, which is why a biopsy and pathology evaluation are needed to ascertain what is going on. Hoping for benign results for you! 🍀 BarredOwl",

I felt a lot better after I met with the breast surgeon for some reason, maybe because I finally understood from her explanations what DCIS is and that it has a very favorable prognosis. When you meet with the surgeon, you may wish to ask whether any further imaging is recommended to inform surgical planning. Sometimes, an MRI is done for this purpose. I am impressed that you have already completed the reading assignment from the Moderators! Here is some more excellent reading for you. I found this page with illustrations to be helpful for understanding the terms that describe the appearance of the cells in the duct, such as \"cribiform\", \"solid\", and \"comedo necrosis\". http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/types/dcis/di... Many new members find these famous posts from Beesie to be extremely helpful. You may wish to bookmark them and read them over a few times. (You may have to scroll a bit.) A layperson's guide to DCIS: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/68/topic/... Lumpectomy vs Mastectomy Considerations: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/91/topic/... Although you were tested for BRCA in the past, and were negative, you may wish to ask for a referral back to a Genetic Counselor to discuss the possibility of broader multi-gene panel testing and whether you might be interested in that or not. On the plus side, learning of a high risk mutation can inform choices about screening and/or treatment. On the other hand, caveats like the lack of consensus practice guidelines for pathogenic mutations in some genes, the absence of effective screening and/or risk management options for some associated cancers, the uncertainty if a variant of unknown significance is found, and relatively undefined risk presented by some genes can be worrying. Because of these latter concerns, I have only had BRCA testing to date, but many have chosen the option of broader panel testing. Good luck!

I did not receive this test, and so I have never received related medical advice. I am a layperson with no medical training. Below are my layperson impressions. Please confirm all information with your medical oncologist. Re your question: \"So am I correct in concluding that in my situation, chemo would not be helpful?\" Keep in mind that these findings reflect comparisons between groups of patients and statistical averages based on groups of patients (with confidence intervals \"CI\" in which the value is likely to fall). They provide odds, but do not speak whether a specific individual will or will not benefit from chemotherapy or to individual outcomes (who will suffer distant metastasis). Regarding the first paragraph you quoted (re patients at low clinical risk and high genomic risk, who underwent randomization either on the basis of their genomic risk (and therefore received chemotherapy) or on the basis of their clinical risk (and therefore received no chemotherapy)), they reported that the difference in 5-year rate of survival without distant metastasis between the two groups (each taken as a whole) was NOT statistically significant (P = 0.66; where a P value less than 0.05 would be considered statistically significant). There are some caveats to this finding. This aspect of the study was not a primary endpoint. It was a secondary analysis, and the accompanying Hudis and Dickler Perspective notes: \"Similarly underpowered was an analysis that showed no advantage of directing therapy on the basis of genomic risk among patients at low clinical risk.\" My crude layperson understanding of \"underpowered\" is that there were not enough patients included to achieve a statistically significant result for this particular secondary assessment. Note that according to Cardoso, the \"low clinical risk and high genomic risk [group] . . . included 592 patients (8.8%)\" (calculated on the basis of the corrected risk). I believe it is formally possible that had more patients been included, one might have been able to observe a statistically significant difference (maybe or maybe not). While no statistically significant benefit was observed, as structured, the trial could not entirely exclude the possibility of a potential benefit, because it was underpowered. Also, I believe that this comparison \"[a]mong patients at low clinical risk and high genomic risk\" included patients with relatively diverse disease features. For example, if you look at Table S13 in the Supplementary Appendix, it looks like some \"C-Low\" patients would have had HER2-positive disease, and some \"C-Low\" patients would have had node-positive disease. With such a diverse group, it seems possible that there might be some (unidentified) subgroups of patients or individual patients who may benefit from chemotherapy. In a recent Guideline Update, ASCO addressed the MINDACT trial findings in connection with the question of clinical utility of the test (whether to order the test in the first place in certain clinical low risk patients per MINDACT criteria), stating (emphasis added): ASCO Guideline Update - Krop (2017): http://ascopubs.org/doi/pdf/10.1200/JCO.2017.74.0472 [My Note: Guidelines address the general case, and there may be appropriate exceptions. Patients interested in this test should always seek case-specific medical advice from a medical oncologist as to whether the test may provide useful information in their particular case.] \"Recommendation 1.1.2 (update of Recommendation 1.7). If a patient has ER/PgR\u2013positive [estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PgR)\u2013positive], HER2-negative, node-negative, breast cancer, the MammaPrint assay should not be used in those with low clinical risk per MINDACT categorization to inform decisions on withholding adjuvant systemic chemotherapy as women in the low clinical risk category had excellent outcomes and did not appear to benefit from chemotherapy even with a genomic high-risk cancer (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). . . . Women with node-negative cancers and low clinical risk (as determined by using a modified version of Adjuvant! Online) had excellent outcomes regardless of genomic risk, and even those patients with high genomic risk did not appear to benefit from chemotherapy. Thus, in patients with node-negative cancers and low clinical risk, who will have an excellent outcome with endocrine therapy alone, MammaPrint does not provide significant clinical utility. Therefore, the MammaPrint assay should not be recommended to patients with low clinical risk who will receive endocrine therapy for hormone receptor\u2013positive breast cancer.\" I think the rather vague \"did not appear to\" language reflects that this secondary assessment was underpowered to detect a difference. In the second paragraph you quoted, in light of the results, I wonder why they added: \"In clinical practice, genomic testing is best used in combination with clinical\u2013pathological factors, since the gene signature has an added and independent prognostic value.\" You may wish to ask your MO how that fits in with the immediately preceding remarks. Are they making the distinction between the predictive value of the test (re chemotherapy benefit) versus the prognostic value of the test (there is a greater risk of distant recurrence observed among those with a high genomic (MammaPrint) risk result as compared with those with a low genomic risk result)? Please be sure to confirm your \"clinical risk\" categorization in your second opinion, because (as you know) accurate clinical risk categorization is critical to application of the MINDACT findings. I believe that grade may also be used in the determination of clinicial risk category according to MINDACT trial criteria. Also, do not hesitate to discuss any pertinent findings from MINDACT and the ASCO Guideline Update in your second opinion to confirm your understanding, applicability in your specific case, and to ensure that you receive an expert explanation, with any associated caveats and limitations. If chemotherapy is recommended to you, ask for a list of the factors that weigh in favor of the recommendation (e.g., prognostic information from test results; clinical factors; and/or specific pathologic factors, such as percent PR, etcetera). You may also wish to ask about the availability of any studies conducted in those who received both Oncotype and MammaPrint test, and whether there are any outcome data available at this time.

      "Content": "Sep 3, 2017 10:34PM - edited Sep 3, 2017 11:59PM by BarredOwl Hi LuvToCraft: I do not think you mentioned tumor histology. Was it invasive ductal carcinoma (\"IDC\") or something else? Only you can decide what is right for you, in light of the medical advice you receive, including information about your distant recurrence risk after all other treatments, the potential benefit and risk of added chemotherapy, and your personal risk tolerance. Re: \"I did receive a BluePrint score of Luminal B, (+0.57 from a scale of -1 to +1) which I believe, in addition to the Mammaprint .090 score, is what put me in High Risk on the assay.\" MammaPrint (70-gene test) and BluePrint (80-gene test) are separate tests. For a more detailed explanation, see this prior post or this short explanation: The MammaPrint test alone yielded the genomic \"High Risk\" result. Your MammaPrint test result should look like this sample MammaPrint High Risk report, with your value falling below zero (on the red side). Check for any \"Additional Comments\" in the field below. http://www.agendia.com/media/25Sep15_MP-High-Risk.pdf Please check your MammaPrint test result and confirm that the MammaPrint Index (\"MPI\") is a negative value: Minus (-) 0.090 and falls in the \"High Risk\" red zone below the clinical classification threshold of zero. BluePrint is a different test and is used to provide information about \"molecular subtype\" (i.e., Luminal, HER2-type, Basal). Your BluePrint test output would have been \"Luminal\" subtype. However, because your MammaPrint test result was \"High Risk\", the BluePrint \"Luminal\" result is further sub-categorized as being Luminal-type (B)-like. __________ When I said, \"The above observations may help explain in part the advice you received,\" I was referring to all of the information in my post, including the information in the Summary Pages re potential chemotherapy benefit. Despite the quote from Cardoso that you copied, the Agendia materials suggest a potential benefit among High Risk Luminal-type (B). Regarding the footnote, the only information I have is what is printed on the Summary Pages. I pointed it out as a possible area of further inquiry in view of the emphasis on your \"Clinical Low Risk\" categorization per MINDACT criteria in your thinking. Under NCCN guidelines for breast cancer (Version 2.2017), the addition of chemotherapy to endocrine therapy is an option for ductal, lobular, metaplastic or mixed histology, where the tumor is hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, node-negative and greater than 0.5 cm in size. Please note that I do not know if that footnote applies in your case or not, because you have not specified the tumor grade and I am not sure where you fall on the chart. As shown on the Summary Pages, among ER+, HER2-negative, node-negative patients with \"Well differentiated (Grade 1)\" tumors that are ≤ 3 cm, the Clinical Risk \"C-low\" does not have that footnote. You mentioned that one MO commented on the pathologic factor of tumor size (1.9 mm) as one factor weighing in favor of chemotherapy, so you may wish to ask that MO for more information about the footnote and tumor size. You can also ask for a complete listing of less favorable pathologic factors in your case (take notes). You have not mentioned grade in any of your posts, yet grade is one of the pathologic factors commonly considered in connection with chemotherapy decisions. The percent ER and percent PR (the percentage of cells that are positive) are other possible considerations. Lymphovascular invasion (if present) is another factor that may be considered. [Edited to add: You also mentioned bilateral mastectomy in connection with your risk profile; however, that is a local treatment and does not reduce your present risk of distant metastatic recurrence.] __________ Re: \"But not being sure if any benefits would be derived from chemo, in my situation, I am at a loss.\" The unknowns are very hard. Unfortunately, no individual patient ever knows if they personally will benefit from any treatment or may at some point suffer treatment failure. Even in situations where there is strong evidence of a clinical benefit, the benefit is never 100%. The statistical information is based on comparing rates or outcomes between groups of patients within a given time period, whereas an individual patient either suffers distant recurrence or does not. As such, statistical risk reduction information and estimates of potential benefit do not speak to individual outcome. However, the statistical information can provide information about odds and a means of weighing benefit against risks. The risks of severe adverse effects are also statistical in nature. While the incidence of severe adverse effects is quite low, they must be weighed against potential benefit. People can view the risks of treatment quite differently. Even in the same situation, some patients may have differing views on whether the potential benefits sufficiently outweigh the potential risks. Some patients (but not others) feel that they can live with the level of residual distant recurrence risk achieved with endocrine therapy alone. In connection with weighing the risks and benefits, if you have not received an estimate of the potential benefit of chemotherapy in your case, you may wish to ask if one can be provided (and how it is determined). If the size of the potential benefit is unclear, you may wish to ask your MO for their current best estimate of your 5-year or 10-year distant recurrence risk with an AI alone (and ask how it is determined). The potential benefit of added chemotherapy in reducing that distant recurrence risk is some fraction thereof and by definition less than that risk. How does it compare to the incidence of severe adverse events seen with CMF? BarredOwl",

Per \"archived\" sample summary reports (no longer in use), there is an associated Confidence Interval (\"CI\"). For example, the MammaPrint \"High Risk\" population average 10-year distant recurrence risk if untreated is 29% (95 % CI: 22% - 35%). A 5-year risk estimate for MammaPrint \"High Risk\" was also provided in sample \"archived\" reports:   In contrast, the average 5-year and 10-year recurrence risk among the MammaPrint \"Low Risk\" population is different:   LuvToCraft was informed that the 29% \"High Risk\" risk estimate is a \"distant\" recurrence risk if untreated. Indeed, the above \"archived\" summary reports each specify \"Distant Recurrence Probability without Treatment.\" The Agendia web site currently indicates that the above MammaPrint \"High Risk\" or MammaPrint \"Low Risk\" 10-year distant recurrence risk estimates \"if untreated\" or \"without Treatment\" are \"without any additional adjuvant treatment, either hormonal therapy or chemotherapy:\"   Again, the above risk estimates are based on data from patients who received either a High Risk or Low Risk MammaPrint (70-gene test) result. Unfortunately, Oncotype and MammaPrint risk category assignments are not always concordant in individual patients. Therefore, unless you received a MammaPrint test result, it not clear which of the above risk estimates (High risk or Low risk) applies to your situation. Those with pending treatment decisions should confirm the information above with their Medical Oncologist to ensure receipt of accurate, current, case-specific expert professional medical advice.

The information for physicians explains it as follows: \"MammaPrint provides a numerical index with a range of -1 to +1, that is overlayed with a binary Low Risk / High Risk clinical classification system. The clinical classification threshold was set by the determination of the largest population of Low Risk patients that can safely withhold chemotherapy.\" Here is the origin of that quote (click to read under the \"Development\" tab): http://www.agendia.com/healthcare-professionals/br... As for why they now report an individual number despite the binary nature of the test, it may be for particularity of detail, like: we did this assay, here is the numerical index determined from your microarray test result of 70 genes, and you can see that it falls in the \"high risk\" category.

      "Content": "Aug 2, 2016 05:54PM - edited Aug 2, 2016 06:21PM by BarredOwl Hi Lisey: There was a good deal of confusion at the start of the thread. \"Borderline\" has a specific meaning, and according to information provided by Agendia, if a result is considered \"borderline\" the report will clearly indicate it. Please see the small print on your personal MammaPrint FFPE report (dated 27 July 2016), in the section entitled \"Assay Description\". On my screen I had to enlarge it and its a bit fuzzy, but it appears to state: \"If a FFPE sample's MammaPrint Index (MPI) falls within a pre-defined area around the classification cut-off between - 0.050 and + 0.050, the classification accuracy is less than 90%. See MammaPrint Physician's Brochure found on www.agendia.com for more information.\" I assume your report does not indicate your result was a \"borderline\" result, and your MammaPrint Index (\"MPI\") of + 0.059 is outside of the specified range (if I am seeing it correctly on my screen). I note that the original FDA 510(k) document linked above in the thread gave a slightly different borderline range (-0.0575 to +0.0575) for MammaPrint FFPE. It is possible that the borderline range was updated by Agendia, and I would think the content of your more current report controls in this regard. Note that the \"borderline\" ranges are DIFFERENT for MammaPrint versus MammaPrint FFPE. Again, one should look to the content of their personal report. As explained above, the MPI value is a number between - 1.0 and +1.0 and is calculated by a computer algorithm: \"Data analysis is performed according to a specific MammaPrint ® FFPE algorithm (MammaPrint® Index, or MPI). The algorithm calculates the correlation of the sample expression profile to a template (the mean expression profile of 44 tumors with a known good clinical outcome) and determines the molecular profile of the sample. This algorithm is designed and programmed by Agendia and compiled into a standalone software program, \"X- Print Analysis Software\". The \"X-Print Analysis Software\" loads a data file (CSV) which is created by the laboratory technician by extracting specific information from the laboratory database. The \"X-Print Analysis Software\" reads the CSV file, opens the Feature Extraction Software data files (TXT), performs quality control checks, determines the sample expression profile, calculates the correlation of sample profile to the \"Low Risk\" template profile on a scale of -1.000 to +1.000 (MammaPrint® FFPE reportable range), compares the calculated correlation to a pre-defined cut-off value and determines the samples prognostic profile (i.e., Low Risk, High Risk, Low Risk Borderline, or High Risk Borderline).\" There is a single comparator or template profile, and it is a \"low risk\" template: '. . .calculates the correlation of sample profile to the \"Low Risk\" template profile on a scale of -1.000 to +1.000 (MammaPrint® FFPE ...\" The \"template\" is \"the mean expression profile of 44 tumors with a known good clinical outcome.\" In your case, the mRNA expression levels of 70 genes from part of the tumor sample were determined, and the combined information was used to generate a sample mRNA expression profile. Your sample mRNA expression profile was compared by computer program to the \"low risk\" template profile, which calculated an MPI value (reflecting a certain degree of correlation with the template profile). Your positive MPI value (+ 0.059) is above the clinical classification threshold of zero for MammaPrint® FFPE and reflects a particular computer-based measure of the level of correlation with or similarity to the low risk template profile. The value generated places you in the \"low risk\" category, with certain average risks of recurrence determined by various clinical studies for the low risk cohort. To my layperson's knowledge, no published study has correlated specific numerical values of MammaPrint Index (\"MPI\") with differing degrees of risk of recurrence. As always, be sure to confirm all information above with your MO and with Agendia. BarredOwl",

      "Content": "Aug 4, 2016 01:31PM - edited Aug 4, 2016 01:31PM by BarredOwl For completeness, I add the following comments. (A) If a report clearly states that a result is \"borderline\", it is necessary to discuss this with one's medical oncologist. Inquiries should also be made with Agendia regarding what the result means and the level of accuracy of any classification. (B) It is also possible that the MammaPrint Index (\"MPI\") number may fall within the borderline range defined on your report (see e.g., Assay Description section), yet would not be indicated as a \"borderline\" result. It is necessary to discuss this situation with one's medical oncologist, and to make inquiries with Agendia. Some information from Agendia indicates that a sample with a first MammaPrint Index falling within the applicable borderline range near zero is re-tested prior to final risk classification: \"Samples that lie within the borderline region and that are close to the threshold are more likely to switch classes with repeated analyses. In a diagnostic setting these samples will be performed in duplicate in order to obtain better outcome accuracy. A borderline sample will be re-tested from RNA onwards going through the following steps a second time: synthesis, amplification, labeling, hybridization, and scanning and XPrint analysis. After two QC-passed results are generated for a borderline sample, the MammaPrint® Index of both results will be averaged, and the final risk classification will be made according to the mean value.\" Possible questions for the MO and Agendia would include: Was my sample re-tested by Agendia? If it was re-tested, please provide an explanation of what the final result means. Does this mean that the final risk classification of either \"high risk\" or \"low risk\" (resulting from re-testing and averaging of scores) has >90% chance of being correctly classified? These two scenarios are quite uncommon. Most people's MPI will fall outside of the borderline range noted in their personal report. BarredOwl",

It can be visualized by mammography and can be seen in a surgically removed sample, but it cannot provide a detectable physical signpost during surgery. To locate a non-palpable tumor during the surgical procedure, surgeons use \"wire-guided localization\" or radioactive seed placement. Even though I had clips placed during various biopsies, prior to surgical biopsy (essentially a lumpectomy), they used a mammogram to visualize the area of concern, and inserted wires so the wires marked the area to be removed later by the surgeon (\"wire-guided localization\"). Radioactive seed placement is an alternative to the wire-guided method I had, in which radioactivity from the seed is used to localize a non-palpable tumor. Accurate localization of the tumor is important to achieving clean margins, and hopefully avoiding the need for a further procedure(s) (\"re-excision\" or \"resection\") to obtain clean margins.

To meet others who are \"triple-positive\" (ER+PR+HER2+), you may pop into this active thread to introduce yourself: Triple Positive Group: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/80/topics/764183?page=997#idx_29908 You will learn a lot as you go, and can ask your doctors questions to get the guidance you need to make decisions. You may want to enter some profile info here once you have all the details including, type/histology (e.g., invasive ductal, invasive lobular, etc), estimated tumor size, ER, PR, HER2 status, which helps members to provide useful relevant info. Take care, BarredOwl  ",

In turn, the scope of validation is generally reflected in \"eligibility\" requirements for the test and in what clinical consensus guidelines say about in whom it should be used. The commercial provider of the test lists the eligibility requirements here, as up to 3 positive nodes: Formal Eligibility: http://breast-cancer.oncotypedx.com/en-US/Professional-Invasive/OncotypeDXBreastCancerAssay/PatientEligibility In some patients with lymph node involvement, radiation is used instead of further axillary dissection. That approach appears to have benefit in terms of reduced morbidity, such as reducing the risk of lymphedema. However, when this approach is used, the actual number of positive nodes is not known. Accordingly, \"eligibility\" for the test is not clear. Moreover, if the actual number of positive nodes was 4 or more, then the associated recurrence risk with Tam alone (or with added chemotherapy) would be higher than shown in your Node-positive (1-3 N+ report). They have looked at that. See for example, Figure 6A-6B of Albain (2010): https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40683006_Prognostic_and_predictive_value_of_the_21-gene_recurrence_score_assay_in_postmenopausal_women_with_node-positive_oestrogen-receptor-positive_breast_cancer_on_chemotherapy_A_retrospective_analysis_of_a With 4 or more positive nodes, the NCCN guidelines (Version 2.2016) do not include use of the test, and instead recommend added chemotherapy. As usual, please confirm all information above with your treatment team. BarredOwl",

      "Content": "Jul 31, 2017 04:08AM - edited Jul 31, 2017 10:12AM by BarredOwl Hi Lisey: As you know, I am a layperson with no medical training, did not receive the MammaPrint test, and never received medical advice regarding the test. Guidelines do not mandate individual management, and there may be appropriate exceptions or more specialized situations. Thus, patients interested in the test should always seek current, case-specific expert professional medical advice from a Medical Oncologist regarding their clinical risk categorization per MINDACT criteria, and whether in light of same (and all other relevant information), the MammaPrint test may be informative in their particular case. Re: \"It's saying low clinical risk (by the standard definiition of size, nodes, grade) . . \" My layperson understanding is that while certain standard pathologic criteria of ER status, HER2 status, Grade, Nodal status and Tumor Size were used to categorize risk in the MINDACT trial, they used a specific methodology to weigh these factors (i.e., a MODIFIED version of Adjuvant! Online) for the purpose of assigning clinical risk category. The same categorization methodology must be used when considering the potential utility of the test before ordering it, as well as to properly apply the MINDACT findings in the individual case in those who received it. Thus, patients cannot \"intuit\" their clinical risk category from their layperson understanding of clinical risk. Re: \"I trust the genomic testing more than classical staging\" It is not a question of trust, but a question of clinical validation and demonstrated clinical utility. Evidence of superior performance over standard pathologic criteria is required. A gene signature is only as good as the quality and scope of clinical validation available to demonstrate its prognostic and/or predictive abilities in specific patient subgroups. Please note that the Guideline Update addresses different subgroups separately, providing separate recommendations for various types of node-negative and node-positive disease, because the specific findings and quality of the data available differs for these subgroups. The exact language of the guideline should be consulted. Re: \"People classified as low risk cliniically but high risk via mammaprint should have chemo, right?\" What might seem intuitive was not what was actually found in the MINDACT trial for certain sub-groups. For this \"discordant\" group (\"MINDACT Clinical Risk Low\" and \"MammaPrint Genomic Risk High\"), Cardoso et al reported [parentheticals added by me]: \"Among patients at low clinical risk [per specific MINDACT trial categorization methods] and high genomic risk, those who underwent randomization on the basis of genomic risk (and therefore received chemotherapy) had a 5-year rate of survival without distant metastasis of 95.8% (95% CI, 92.9 to 97.6), as compared with a rate of 95.0% (95% CI, 91.8 to 97.0%) among those who underwent randomization on the basis of clinical risk (and therefore received no chemotherapy) (adjusted hazard ratio for distant metastasis or death with chemotherapy vs. no chemotherapy, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.59 to 2.28; P = 0.66) (Fig. 2B). This finding does not show any advantage of directing therapy on the basis of genomic risk among patients at low clinical risk but high genomic risk, since these patients had no [apparent statistically significant] benefit from the use of adjuvant chemotherapy.\" This was a secondary endpoint and there are caveats. For example, an accompanying commentary stated, \"Similarly underpowered was an analysis that showed no advantage of directing therapy on the basis of genomic risk among patients at low clinical risk.\" Would the result have been different if the study had been more highly powered? There is no way to know one way or the other. Also, the \"low clinical risk\" group was relatively diverse, so while it was not possible to show improvement in outcomes among the group as a whole, it seems conceivable that there might be specific patients or sub-group(s) (as yet to be identified) who could benefit from added chemotherapy. That said, for those who have already received the test, there may be other useful information to be gleaned from Cardoso et al. and its appendix. Re: \"What about someone like me, classified low risk, but got an intermediate oncotype... Mammaprint I was low risk, but another poster with my identical stats (low risk clinicially, intermediate oncotype) had the mammaprint and was high risk, so did chemo.\" Without the actual statistics for the other person, I have no idea whether the other person would be considered \"clinical low risk\" per MINDACT criteria. An \"intermediate\" Recurrence Score (18-30) includes a relatively broad range of distant recurrence risks. Also, the advice you each received would have incorporated additional considerations (e.g., LVI, age, co-morbidities). On the one hand, you received these tests and related medical advice prior to publication of the MINDACT trial results or the 2017 ASCO Guideline Update. On the other hand, the MINDACT trial did not address this specific situation: No Recurrence Score information was available. At least one other study assessed the use of both tests, but I do not believe that clinical outcomes are available. Since you have no pending treatment decision, I am willing to agree with you that you would be considered \"clinical low risk\" under MINDACT criteria, but you should confirm it with your MO. In addition, having already received the test, I recommend that prior to your next follow-up appointment, you let your MO know in advance that you would like to know your \"Clinical Risk Category\" per MINDACT trial criteria, and to discuss the findings of Cardoso and its Appendices as they apply to your case.

As you received lumpectomy, a Radiation Oncologist can advise you regarding recommended timing for initiating radiation (a) with, or (b) without chemotherapy. General Information re Time to Chemotherapy (\"TTC\") in the \"Adjuvant\" (Surgery-First) Setting: There are various studies in this area. See for example: Chavez-MacGregor (2016): \"Delayed Initiation of Adjuvant Chemotherapy Among Patients With Breast Cancer\" http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2474437 \"Time to chemotherapy was defined as the number of days between surgery and the first dose of chemotherapy.\" They concluded: \"Given the results of our analysis, we would suggest that all breast cancer patients that are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy should receive this treatment within 91 days of surgery or 120 days from diagnosis. Administration of chemotherapy within this time frame is feasible in clinical practice under most clinical scenarios, and as medical oncologists, we should make every effort not to delay the initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy.\" I do not know how this guidance would be applied in the individual case, and expert advice should be obtained. Most studies in this area are retrospective and have various limitations. In addition, the results of various studies in this area are not consistent with each other in all aspects, and there are some important differences between sub-groups (e.g., triple-negative patients). Thus, regarding time to chemotherapy, patients should always seek current, case-specific expert professional advice, to ensure the complete body of evidence, including the most recent and reliable data that is applicable to their particular situation and diagnosis, is considered. Patients experiencing larger delays should not assume any window has closed and decline treatment, but should instead seek case-specific expert advice regarding initiation of treatment / the potential impact of delay.

It sounds like your sister received multi-gene panel testing using a test panel that included 19 different cancer predisposition genes. If a cancer predisposition gene has not yet been identified in your family, then her negative test result (while favorable for her) is considered an \"uninformed negative.\" It is possible for her to have breast cancer and yet to test negative, while other members of your family (e.g., a parent) might carry a pathogenic mutation in a gene conferring a predisposition to certain cancers (including a mutation in one of the 19 genes she tested negative for). (A \"true-negative\" is based on an identified mutation in a family member coupled with a negative test result for that mutation, and per NCCN guidelines indicates that: \"The person is not a carrier of a known cancer-predisposing gene that has been positively identified in another family member.\") The NCCN guidelines for \"Breast and/or Ovarian Cancer Genetic Assessment\" (Version 2.2017) contain a chart at the beginning entitled, \"CRITERIA FOR FURTHER GENETIC RISK EVALUATION\" (Chart BR/OV-1). The chart sets forth a long list of considerations which can lead one to: \"Consider referral to cancer genetics professional\" for genetic risk evaluation. You clearly satisfy at least one of the criteria for such a referral given your sister's diagnosis at age 39 (a first-degree relative), for example this one: \"An individual with no personal history of cancer but with . . . First- or second-degree relative with breast cancer ≤45 y\" The guidelines specify: \"First-degree relatives: parents, siblings, and children\" and \"second-degree relatives: grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, grandchildren, and half-siblings.\" In connection with the criteria for referral to a cancer genetics professional for risk evaluation, under NCCN guidelines, certain cancers in third-degree relatives can be factors that contribute to consideration of such a referral. For example, note also this (rather poorly worded) criterion, citing to note (d): An individual with no personal history of cancer but with > A close relative with any of the following: [d,f] . . . ≥2 individuals with breast cancer primaries on the same side of family with at least one diagnosed ≤50 y . . . As explained in note (d), \"Close blood relatives include first-, second-, and third-degree relatives.\" The guidelines specify \"third-degree relatives: great-grandparents, great-aunts, great-uncles, great-grandchildren, and first cousins.\" The list of factors is extensive and may differ based on whether a person has a diagnosis or not and by type of diagnosis. Depending on your specific circumstances, it is possible that other criteria may apply. For those who would like to access Chart BR/OV-1 for review of the criteria with a referring physician, a copy of the guideline can be accessed here at no charge with free registration: https://www.nccn.org/store/login/login.aspx?ReturnURL=https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/genetics_screening.pdf It is periodically updated, so as best practice, always access the latest version on the web. The above should be used to inform consultations with your medical providers and is not a substitute for case-specific medical advice. Again, the above-quoted criteria go to whether referral for genetic risk evaluation may be warranted. The NCCN guidelines also note that: \"The criteria for further risk evaluation and [for] genetic testing are not identical.\" As part of a genetic risk evaluation, a personal medical and family history is taken, a genetic/familial risk assessment is performed, and a recommendation will be made regarding genetic testing. If recommended, the scope of such genetic testing, as well as the pros, cons, and limitations of such testing will be discussed. The patient may pursue or decline any recommended testing at their option. Even if you do not pursue genetic testing, as part of the consultation, you may request an estimate of your lifetime risk of breast cancer that may further inform questions such as the timing of initiation of screening, mode(s), and frequency of screening.

      "Content": "Aug 4, 2016 03:45PM - edited Aug 4, 2016 04:41PM by BarredOwl Hi Lisey: Thank you very much for the update. The advice you received is consistent with the comments above \"that the binary MammaPrint test does not provide individualized risks, but only provides the average risk associated with the high risk cohort or the average risk associated with the low risk cohort.\" In other words, the recurrence risk estimates are based on risks determined for a group and are expressed as averages with confidence intervals (\"CI\"). The MammaPrint Index (\"MPI\") number appears to be generated from the patient's microarray data by a software program which uses an algorithm or \"classifier\". The program takes the mRNA expression data from 70 genes, determines the \"sample expression profile\", and assesses its degree of similarity to a standard low risk expression profile (the standard or low risk \"template\" profile is a \"mean expression profile of 44 tumors with a known good clinical outcome\"). The degree of similarity to the standard low risk profile is expressed as the MPI value between -1.0 and +1.0, with +1.0 being the highest degree of correlation. After this correlation step, the calculated MPI value is used to classify one as either \"high risk\" or \"low risk\" (relative to the \"clinical classification threshold\" of zero), within the accuracy of the test. The MPI value reflects the degree of \"correlation\" between the sample profile and the low risk standard or template profile. The output of the test is the final risk classification of high risk or low risk. Various clinical validation studies were performed to assess the \"prognostic\" ability of the test. They determined various types of average recurrence risk among a group of patients classified as \"high risk\" and among a groups of patients classified as \"low risk\". Thus, the average recurrence risks provided are based on risks determined for the high risk or low risk group as a whole. It is my understanding that the clinical validation studies did not look at how recurrence risk might vary within the low risk group according to MPI value. They did not determine how risk might vary within the high risk group according to MPI value. Thus, whether positive \"low risk\" MPI values closer to the clinical classification threshold of 0 are or are not associated with greater risk compared with those closer to +1.0, or whether negative \"high risk\" MPI values closer to 0 are or are not associated with lower risk compared to those closer to -1.0, is not known. One should be cautious about drawing conclusions in the absence of data. As the Agendia pathologist stated, \"they don't have a way of quantifying that difference so they just use averages.\" Again, they don't have a way of quantifying the difference, because it has never been determined in a clinical study. It may not behave intuitively, or as a continuous variable. They designed a binary test (high or low). They have not looked at the recurrence risks associated with individual MPI values, and therefore, they have not established differences in recurrence risk (or the size of such differences, if any, or the statistical significance of such differences, if any) between specific MPI values within the same risk category (e.g., Low risk, MPI +0.3 versus Low risk MPI +0.9). In my layperson's understanding, hypothesizing statistically significant differences in recurrence risk between different MPI values within the same risk category where none has been measured in a clinical study would be speculative.

The MINDACT publication is on point in noting: \"Ultimately, the decision to receive or forgo chemotherapy (or any other treatment) lies with each patient who is properly informed about the potential side effects and the potential benefits of such treatment. For the same risk\u2013benefit scenario, different patients may make different decisions.\" I did not face a similar decision, but I found it exhausting and challenging to consider the option of tamoxifen under my relatively unusual circumstances (isolated tumor cells on the DCIS side of unknown ER, PR or HER2 status) in which I was advised it would be equally reasonable for me to accept or decline it. Here are some additional observations. Please confirm all information with your team if it influences your thinking. I checked the Agendia website and see that they have revised the web site and some report content in light of the results of the MINDACT Trial. I noticed that the materials appear to treat Clinical High Risk / MammaPrint Low Risk (n = 1550 patients) and Clinical Low Risk / MammaPrint High Risk (n = 592 patients) somewhat differently. This likely reflects the quality and amount of the data for these groups. For example, the Clinical High Risk/ MammaPrint Low Risk group was the subject of the primary analysis, which met its objective, whereas the Clinical Low Risk/ MammaPrint High Risk group was not the subject of the primary analysis, and was a much smaller group of patients. For example, by my layperson reading, on this page, MINDACT results are featured for every group EXCEPT for the group considered \"Clinical Low Risk\" / \"Genomic (MP) High Risk\": Agendia Feature: Go to to www.agendia.com, and under the menu for \"Health Care Professionals\", click on \"The MINDACT Trial\" to access the feature entitled, \"LEVEL 1A EVIDENCE. MAMMAPRINT® IS THE FIRST AND ONLY GENOMIC ASSAY TO ATTAIN LEVEL 1A CLINICAL UTILITY EVIDENCE FOR CHEMOTHERAPY BENEFIT IN EARLY-STAGE BREAST CANCER PATIENTS\" The gist is that a low risk genomic result may lead to a recommendation to forego chemotherapy. ____________________________________________________________________________ Did you receive a BluePrint test? BluePrint categorizes patients into three groups: Luminal-type; HER2-type; or Basal-type. The MammaPrint result is used to further subdivide the Luminal-type into two subgroups: - BluePrint Luminal-type and MammaPrint Low Risk ==> Luminal-type (A)-like - BluePrint Luminal-type and MammaPrint High Risk ==> Luminal-type (B)-like In addition to your MammaPrint Result (High risk) and BluePrint test result (Luminal-type), you should have received \"Summary Pages\" for High Risk Luminal-type (B). If you do not have a copy of such a document, be sure to request copies of all test results and related documentation for your review and records. Regarding potential chemotherapy benefit in light of MINDACT, please compare the Sample Summary Pages issued in the US for LOW RISK LUMINAL-TYPE (A) versus HIGH RISK LUMINAL-TYPE (B) regarding predicted benefit of treatment at 5-years based on Reference (2) (Cardoso): (a) Low Risk Luminal-Type (A) Summary Pages: www.agendia.com/media/June2017_LR-Luminal_A-Summary-Pages_FINAL.pdf Note this section of the above document:  (b) High Risk Luminal-Type (B) Summary Pages: www.agendia .com/media/June2017_HR-Luminal_B-Summary-Pages_FINAL.pdf Note this section based on data from the ER+/HER2-/LN0 subset from the MINDACT trial and the comment regarding a potential chemotherapy benefit:  The DMFI (distant-metastasis free interval) value of 94.6% illustrated above with Chemotherapy plus Hormonal Therapy seems to be taken from the Supplementary Appendix of Cardoso (See the last line of Table S 9: Outcome by genomic risk when following genomic treatment strategy (G-low versus G-high), in the subgroup of HR+/HER2-/LN0 patients). In Table S9, the chemotherapy appears to have been ACT. Please see Table S9 and the legend to Table S9 for a discussion of the analysis and the assumptions. With statistical averages based on a group as a whole, there may be subgroup(s) who might benefit more or less. Regarding clinical risk, the reference to \"Clinical Low Risk\" category per MINDACT criteria can be misleading in some ways. Multiparameter tests like Oncotype or MammaPrint are typically used to further inform decision-making in patients in whom chemotherapy is being considered because using standard clinical and pathologic criteria their distant recurrence risk would typically warrant consideration of or a recommendation for chemotherapy in addition to endocrine therapy. Regarding \"clinical risk\", please also note that that High Risk Luminal-Type (B) Summary Pages include a \"double-cross\" footnote which indicates that certain patients categorized as \"Clinical Low Risk\" per MINDACT criteria would be deemed high risk clinically under some consensus guidelines:   The above observations may help explain in part the advice you received. Also, the advice received would not be based on the MammaPrint result alone, but a synthesis of all relevant information including those results in light of clinical and pathologic factors and Oncotype results as well. If you still have concerns or questions, do not hesitate to arrange further consultation(s) with your Medical Oncologist(s) to specifically discuss any outside information that is of concern to you. (I highlighted copies of research papers and took them to my appointments.) If in doubt and/or if you would like further input, you may wish to inquire whether there is a multidisciplinary \"Tumor Board\" at your current treatment centers that would consider your case. Optionally or in addition, if you have time before timely initiation of treatment (please confirm it with your team), you may wish to seek a third opinion, which some people pursue. Many look for an NCI-designated cancer center (confirm in-network): https://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-role/cancer-centers/find Although you may need to travel a bit, you can choose to seek treatment locally. Please take some time this weekend to give yourself a break and rest. I send my best wishes for information gathering and decision-making. BarredOwl",

If the average \"recurrence\" risk is being reported out differently according to MPI value (which is not entirely clear to me), then this is a relatively recent change. How is MPI Value Generated? These tests look at the expression levels of 70 genes from tumor cells using microarray technology. The combined expression levels form an expression pattern or \"gene expression profile\". The MPI value appears to be generated from the patient's microarray data by a software program which uses an algorithm. The program takes the expression data from 70 genes (\"sample expression profile\") and assesses its degree of similarity to an established low risk expression \"template\" profile: a comparator profile which is a \"the mean expression profile of 44 tumors with a known good clinical outcome\" or low risk profile. The MPI value is a value on a scale from -1.0 to +1.0 reflecting the correlation of the patient's expression profile to that of a low risk template profile, with values closest to +1.0 reflecting the highest degree of correlation to the low risk comparator. After the correlation step, the output (MPI value) places one in a cohort (High Risk (below zero, lower correlation) or Low Risk (above zero, higher correlation). Various clinical trials have assessed recurrence risk among High Risk patients. Regarding the 2008 article that you linked, my point was that it is not the last word on older, post-menopausal women receiving MammaPrint, given that there are subsequent studies. Conceivably, the results of subsequent studies might differ and alter understanding. I have not looked at that question and do not know the answer, so please ask your MO about it. As far as specific publications, re MINDACT, I was referring to Cardoso (MINDACT)(2016) which you have and which is the most recent trial, the largest trial and fully prospective. RASTER was an earlier, somewhat less robust study: Drukker (2013)( RASTER): \"A prospective evaluation of a breast cancer prognosis signature in the observational RASTER study\" Main Page: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.28082/abstract;jsessionid=0A0CC3A2280D41D5954641C8E78686B5.f04t03 PDF of article: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.28082/epdf Data Supplement: http://www.readcube.com/articles/supplement?doi=10.1002%2Fijc.28082&index=0&ssl=1&st=ffefc88d8aea779ee128301f3790cf9c&preview=1 Drukker (2014): \"Optimized outcome prediction in breast cancer by combining the 70-gene signature with clinical risk prediction algorithms\" Main Page: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10549-014-2954-2 PDF of article: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10549-014-2954-2.pdf See also Supplementary Material available at Main Page.  Expert professional understanding of the test outputs and related clinical trial findings seems critical to according proper weight to the test results and related treatment advice and risk estimates. Do your current MO's focus on the treatment of breast cancer patients or are they generalists? Given that they did not suggest the MammaPrint test to you, do you know if they have ever used the test before? If not, that might be another reason to seek a third opinion at a bigger more experienced place (e.g., NCI-designated Cancer Center). BarredOwl",

While the particular MammaPrint Index or \"MPI\" value (e.g., - 0.839) reflects the degree of correlation with a low risk template profile and is used to classify the sample profile as high or low risk (see discussion above, where negative values reflect a lower degree of correlation), to my layperson's knowledge, no study has evaluated or reported on the recurrence risks associated with individual MPI values (e.g., - 0.839) in the same risk category, and therefore, they have not established differences in recurrence risk (or the size of such differences, if any, or the statistical significance of such differences, if any) between specific MPI values within the same risk category (e.g., High risk, MPI - 0.3 versus High risk MPI - 0.9). *** I note the initial MINDACT trial results were recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), and may be of interest to you: Cardoso (2016): http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1602253 (The complete article is available for purchase) Hudis editorial (2016): http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMe1607947 (The complete article is available for purchase) Hunter perspective (2016) (starts part way down the page): http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMp1608282 You can purchase a one-day pass to the NEJM and download the complete pdf copies of the Cardoso paper and the Hudis editorial (plus anything else you want).

Occasionally, surgeons order the MammaPrint test, but often they are not familiar with how to advise patients based on the results, because this is not their area of expertise. Your surgeon may have had good intentions, ordering the test early so that the results would be available for your Medical Oncologist, or he may have ordered it before HER2 status was available (jumping the gun a bit, per the below). I note you had triple-positive disease (ER+ PR+ HER2+). Typically, the MammaPrint test is ordered by Medical Oncologists, because due to their training and experience, they are familiar with what clinical consensus guidelines for breast cancer provide about use of the test in various patient subgroups and current clinical practice. While HER2+ patients are formally \"eligible\" for the MammaPrint test, at the time of your treatment and as of this date, clinical consensus guidelines from ASCO and NCCN do not include the MammaPrint test for HER2-positive disease. (The current NCCN guidelines for breast cancer were issued in 2017, after publication of the MINDACT results.) Instead, under current ASCO and NCCN guidelines applicable to HER2-positive disease, recommendations about adjuvant systemic therapy, including chemotherapy, HER2-targeted therapy, endocrine therapy, are based on clincal and pathologic criteria. In light of the above, probably the reason your medical oncologist was not very interested in the MammaPrint test result is because (in accordance with clinical guidelines) the test result was not driving medical advice in your case. It looks like you received a recommendation for paclitaxel plus trastuzumab (Herceptin), which would be within treatment guidelines applicable your case. BarredOwl",

(2) The results of a recent exploratory subgroup analysis of MINDACT in small (\"T1a\" and \"T1b\" size), node-negative (\"N0\") tumors was presented at ESMO 2017, reporting a potential benefit of chemotherapy in the pT1aN0 or pT1bN0 Clinical Low Risk/Genomic High Risk subset. Here is a link to an ESMO Press Release which includes the text of the ESMO 2017 Abstract No. 1500_PR, Tryfonidis et al., \"Not all small node negative (pT1abN0) breast cancers are similar: Outcome results from an EORTC 10041/BIG 3-04 (MINDACT) trial substudy\". http://www.esmo.org/Press-Office/Press-Releases/Study-in-Early-Stage-Breast-Cancer-Shows-That-Even-Small-Tumours-Can-Be-Aggressive?hit=ehp The release mentions these node-negative tumors were \"less than 1 cm\" in size; however, standard tumor size definitions per AJCC criteria (7th Edition) would include tumors less than or equal to 1 cm in size (see below). Note that the Clinical Low Risk/Genomic High Risk group was relatively small (n = 196 patients): \"196/826 (23.7%) were CL/GH.\" No information on the statistical significance of the observations is included in the abstract, although confidence intervals are provided. This related EORTC feature includes some perspective from the first author: http://www.eortc.org/news/possible-benefit-of-chemotherapy-in-aggressive-small-breast-tumours-exploratory-study-from-the-mindact-trial/ Apparently in response to a question about whether all patients with such small, node-negative tumors should receive such testing, first author Tryfonidis replied: \"We cannot draw conclusions based on this analysis\" Says Tryfonidis. \"It is important to mention that this is an exploratory analysis in a small subset of the total MINDACT population . . . \" Meeting abstracts may be preliminary in nature, and the clinical implications (if any) as well as any potential caveats and limitations should be discussed with a medical oncologist. This is particularly true for an \"exploratory\" subgroup analysis. All those interested in this test should be sure to discuss with their Medical Oncologist whether such testing may provide useful information in their particular case. This should include a discussion of individual \"Clinical Risk categorization per MINDACT trial criteria,\" and the possible outcomes of such testing in light of the MINDACT trial findings and related 2017 ASCO Biomarker guideline update.

Also, you do not need to worry if you don't understand what I wrote above (or below). Sometimes articles help, sometimes not so much! These are about how the mammaprint assay was developed and tested in the clinic to prove its utility. Basically, I could not find anything which clearly answers Tshire's question. I thought I found some suggestion that the minus 0.350 might be an average, but I could not confirm this. The words \"High Risk Population Average\" could be referring to the 5-yr and 10-yr percent risks set forth right underneath them (22%, 29%) in the sample report. Since her high risk number is closer to zero, Tshire is wondering if her individual risk might differ from the high risk group in some way that could further inform her decision. I said that the assay is designed to be binary (high OR low), so it is possible that the particular level of risk associated with individual values (-0.115) might not be adequately characterized. However, there may be other studies, so this is a question for the expert oncologist. BarredOwl ",

High risk \"borderline\" is different depending on which assay was performed (-0.0575 to - 0.0 for MammaPrint FFPE OR - 0.0275 to -0.0 for MammaPrint).

I think you are citing some results of the RASTER trial, found here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC373462... \"The 5-year DRFI probabilities for 70-gene signature low-risk (n = 219) and high-risk (n = 208) patients were 97.0% and 91.7% (p = 0.03), respectively (Supporting Information Fig. 1). Importantly, this difference in outcome was observed despite the fact that in the 70-gene signature low-risk group 15% (33/219) of the patients received adjuvant chemotherapy, versus 81% (169/208) in the high-risk group.\" If so, I would just note that the 91.7% number is actually a five-year distant-recurrence-free interval (DRFI): \"For this analysis, we estimated five-year distant-recurrence-free interval (DRFI), comprising distant recurrence and death from breast cancer\". This would not count local recurrences by my reading (DRFI is different from disease-free survival). The trial results and assay results appear to focus on distant-recurrence. So for high risk patients, the probability of distant recurrence at 10-years was 29% without treatment (see sample report link from Tshire, top, \"Distant Recurrence Probability Without Treatment\"). Similarly, the Physician's Brochure linked above says: \"Patients classified as \"High Risk\" had a 29% chance to develop distant metastases at 10 years without adjuvant treatment.\" Do you agree?

(From the advice you received from your oncologist, I don't think it would be borderline, but the content of your report controls). I think you understand it in general, but I would make the following distinction about the template or comparator (the standard to which a test sample is compared to). The distinction is that (from the information I cited) there is no \"high risk template\" for the MammaPrint FFPE assay. There is a single comparator or template profile, and it is a \"low risk\" template: '. . .calculates the correlation of sample profile to the \"Low Risk\" template profile on a scale of -1.000 to +1.000 (MammaPrint® FFPE ...\" The \"template\" is \"the mean expression profile of 44 tumors with a known good clinical outcome.\" So, your negative number, which is below the clinical classification threshold of zero for MammaPrint® FFPE, means that the expression profile obtained from your sample is different enough from the low risk template profile that it is not classified as low risk (by this computer-based measurement). The value generated places you in the \"high risk\" category, with an average risk determined by clinical studies for the high risk cohort. Within the \"High Risk\" category, I am not aware of any data or evidence that establishes differences between the risks associated with different index values that fall within the high risk range (e.g., - 0.350 versus - 0.115). Consistent with this, you noted above that your oncologist did not assign any import to the particular index value, other than \"high risk\". You then asked why report the particular value. Some index values near the clinical classification threshold of zero are deemed \"borderline\" and \"[i]n this region the clinical classification result accuracy potentially falls below the overall predetermined analytical accuracy of 90%.\" As noted in my prior post, current reports will clearly indicate a \"borderline\" result.

You could check with the oncologist again in light of melb44's comment and her understanding.

Or does she have another type? Inflammatory Breast Cancer = IBC Invasive (or Infiltrating) Ductal Carcinoma = IDC Invasive (or Infiltrating) Lobular Carcinoma = ILC There are other less common types (e.g., mixed, metaplastic) You mentioned \"when they remove the lump they would also scrape out extra pieces.\" Surgically, you seem to be describing a \"lumpectomy\" (removal of a lump and some extra tissue around it to try to achieve good margins). \"Lumpectomy\" is a type of \"breast conserving surgery\", which does not appear to be a standard treatment for \"inflammatory breast cancer\" (IBC) based on my layperson's reading of the NCCN breast cancer treatment guidelines, general information from the NCI, or this organization: Surgery for inflammatory breast cancer: http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/types/inflammatory/treating/surgery If you are not really sure what kind of breast cancer she has, do not know what specific drug regimen she is receiving, or have any information about tumor histology, tumor size, ER, PR or HER2 status, etc, it makes me wonder if your Mom has chosen not to share certain details with you. This in turn, makes we wonder how old you are. It can be hard to gauge age from posts and you are certainly asking good questions, but registrants must be eighteen (18) years of age or older: Terms of use: http://www.breastcancer.org/about_us/bco_commitment/legal_terms If you are younger than that, then you should talk to your mother about your questions and concerns. Let her know you have questions about her treatment plan and ask how you can best help support her through treatment. Of course, if you are 18 or older, please do not hesitate to continue posting. However, it would be helpful if you could ask your mom to share a copy of her pathology report with you, as well as more information about her diagnosis and the advice she has received regarding treatment plan (neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant drug regimen(s), surgery, radiation, etc), so you can make your questions more specific to her situation and make it easier for people here to refer you to good sources of information and/or share relevant experience.

      "Content": "Feb 11, 2018 01:27PM - edited Feb 12, 2018 12:23PM by BarredOwl Hi DustieN: Georgia1 (and now also MelissaDallas as I was writing) have made the important point that you have jumbled the side effect profiles of different drugs together (Tamoxifen and Aromatase Inhibitors). The side effect profiles have some commonalities, but can be quite different in other ways. Also, you have not listed some important (if rare) side effects of Tamoxifen. The question of endocrine therapy (e.g., Tamoxifen, an Aromatase Inhibitor) is within the area of expertise of Medical Oncologists (\"MO\"). After your surgical pathology is available, you can ask your MO about (a) rare severe adverse effects versus (b) other more common side effects of the specific drug that he recommends for you. I also agree with dtad, that more information is needed before an informed decision about endocrine therapy can be made. Unfortunately, imaging is not definitive, and the results of the pathology from lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy may change understanding of your recurrence risk profile and the potential benefits of treatment. In general, the benefits of endocrine therapy are proportional to recurrence risks and risk of death, such that those at greater risk potentially reap larger benefit. Because of this, in order to make an informed decision about endocrine therapy (e.g., Tamoxifen) requires a case-specific risk/benefit analysis based on information from a Medical Oncologist familiar with your case and risk profile. This case-specific risk/benefit analysis may include a discussion of: (a) estimates of your various risks (e.g., risk of death; distant recurrence; local recurrence; new disease in the same or contralateral breast) after all other treatments; (b) estimates of the potential \"absolute benefit\" of Tamoxifen in reducing these various risks in your particular case; (c) information about the various risks of treatment, including the risk of severe adverse effects (in light of your personal medical and family history); and (d) how the benefit of (b) compares with the risk of (c), in light of one's personal risk tolerance. For those with a surgery first treatment plan, the information entered into PREDICT should be based on surgical pathology findings, which you do not have yet. Importantly, Version 2.0 of the PREDICT tool appears to provide information regarding 5-year and 10-year Overall Survival, which is typically a type of mortality assessment (death). Overall survival benefit is important. However, it typically measures whether the study participants are alive or not at a specific time-point, not whether they have remained disease-free or recurrence-free. Those who are alive may be disease-free, or they may be living with metastatic disease, living with a loco-regional recurrence or new disease (i.e., a new primary in the same or contralateral breast). Tamoxifen can potentially reduce the risk of these events. Thus, for patients with invasive breast cancer, consideration is also typically given to the potential benefit of endocrine therapy in reducing the risk of suffering a distant (metastatic) recurrence (which is not provided by PREDICT 2.0).

Please consult with the MO from the NCI-designated cancer center about this, and inquire whether the approach is sound or not. I suspect it is not. There is some reported correlation between Recurrence Score and Ki-67, such as this 2011 report in HER2-negative patients: http://www.nature.com/bjc/journal/v105/n9/full/bjc... I do not know if there are any subsequent studies that either confirm or undermine these findings. In any event, as Shetlandpony pointed out, there are members here whose Recurrence Scores were not consistent with actual Ki-67 values. In addition, as a HER2-positive patient, it is critical to note that all 53 cases analyzed in the paper were T1\u20132 N0 M0 (ER/PR-positive, HER-2-negative), and the results provide no information as to whether such a correlation can be found in HER2-positive patients. Regarding requesting Ki-67 immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing, like yours, some institutions no longer conduct Ki-67 testing (e.g., one recent experience from someone seen at Dana Farber in MA). Apparently, there may be methodological issues with the immunohistochemical (IHC) methods used to provide a semiquantitative estimate of the percentage of nuclei with positive Ki-67 protein staining. For example, the authors of this paper (cited solely for the method information) discuss the problem of \"interobserver variability\", which can result in different test results when different pathologists examine the same sample, or even when the same pathologist repeats the test: http://www.nature.com/labinvest/journal/v94/n1/ful... \"Ki-67, a marker of cell proliferation, is expressed in all phases of the cell cycle, except G0. This protein is localized to the nucleus and its expression is often quantified in terms of percentage of positive nuclei. This is usually a semiquantitative estimate determined by pathologists who count as many as 1000 nuclei to determine this proportion. The threshold for differentiating high and low Ki-67 reported by the literature varies widely from 1% to 28.6%. Another potential source of variability in this measurement is the field of view (FOV) selected by the pathologist for determining Ki-67. It is controversial whether the pathologist should choose hotspot areas or simply count all areas and average.\" . . . [Our new] method is most importantly objective, and therefore avoids some of the pitfalls of subjective analysis of percent positive nuclei, including interobserver variability and determination of a cut point between high and low expression. This method also enables efficient analysis of the entire biopsy, removing the subjectivity of hotspot selection. Averaging all FOVs also trended toward a marginally more sensitive and specific assay than considering only the maximum FOV.\" Lack of reproducibility would tend to undermine any prognostic value. I note that there also appears to be variation or concerns with the \"cut-off\" threshold to determine \"high\" or \"low\", and some possible lack of clarity around the prognostic significance of Ki-67 determined by IHC in some sub-groups. http://www.nature.com/labinvest/journal/v94/n1/ful... http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10549-01... http://www.nature.com/nrclinonc/journal/v12/n5/ful... I was not aware that Ki-67 was a commonly considered factor in the HER2-positive setting. Please ask the MO from the NCI-designated cancer center whether Ki-67 IHC testing is reproducible and prognostic in HER2-positive patients, and whether it can provide information of value or not. You also mentioned that at your request, \"my MO prescribed me Tamoxifen to take until chemo starts.\" I note that the NCCN guidelines for breast cancer indicate that: \"Chemotherapy and endocrine therapy used as adjuvant therapy should be given sequentially with endocrine therapy following chemotherapy.\" As soon as possible, please inform the MO at the NCI-designated cancer center that you have commenced endocrine therapy. Please request his recommendation re (a) when to stop endocrine therapy relative to commencing chemotherapy; and (b) when to re-start endocrine therapy later on. I have highlighted a number of areas of specific inquiry with the MO at the NCI-designated cancer center, but please confirm any information provided if used in your thinking. BarredOwl ",

I note your comment re the Aetna policy. I am surprised, because it is my layperson's understanding that NCCN guidelines do not provide for Oncotype in HER2-positive patients (Version 1.2016). Please expressly confirm this with your providers. The version of the policy (Number: 0352) that I see on-line tonight lists five requirements which must all be met (\"where all of the following criteria are met\") to satisfy \"medical necessity\". I am not sure I am reading the right document or not. I may not be understanding it either. The third criterion says \"less than 1 cm in diameter\", which is different from what you quote above. Your local oncologist's \"advice\" appears to reflect the fifth criterion in the event of a \"low\" score. Do you have a choice to elect treatment even if the score is low? Please check the exact language of your current policy in all respects, print it out, discuss it with your MOs to confirm whether the test was ordered on this basis or not, if so what does it mean, what options are available to you, and what the implications for payment are (for the test and for treatment), should you choose to proceed with treatment but get a low score. I am just a fellow patient, with no medical training. There may be errors in the information I have provided in this thread. Please be certain to confirm any and all information from me with an expert medical oncologist to ensure current, accurate case-specific expert professional advice and sound decision-making.

In the usual case, an \"equivocal\" result by IHC (IHC 2+) leads to \"reflex\" testing by (e.g., by FISH). If the reflex test is positive, the status is considered HER2-positive, and the NCCN guidelines for the relevant HER2-positive status apply. However, in my layperson's understanding, IHC 1+ is not considered equivocal. Assuming the IHC 1+ result was clearly negative, was not \"indeterminate\" and there was no quality concern regarding the test (e.g., specimen handling concern, concern re less representative biopsy sample), then a clearly positive FISH result may be considered a \"discordant\" result (conflicting). The ASCO/CAP guideline regarding HER2 testing mentions \"discordant\" results and some related concerns regarding treatment: Archives of Pathology pdf version of 2013 ASCO/CAP guideline: http://www.archivesofpathology.org/doi/pdf/10.5858... \" . . .there are limited efficacy data in the subgroup tested with both high quality IHC and FISH and found to have a discordant result between these two tests. Patients with such results constitute poorly studied subsets for which there is less confidence in the scores and actual benefit from trastuzumab therapy. Because the retrospective evaluation of the benefit from trastuzumab in patients with apparent discordance between IHC and FISH who were enrolled onto the first generation of trastuzumab trials included only a small number of patients in each of the discordant subsets, patients who would have qualified for enrollment in those trials should be considered for HER2-targeted therapy.\" The evaluation of HER2 results in less usual cases can be complex, so please confirm all information above with your medical oncologist. Please be sure to ask your medical oncologist about your HER2 status, and whether your test results might be considered \"discordant\" or not. If so, also ask about the implications for treatment recommendations. BarredOwl",

Unfortunately, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are not the only genes known to confer a genetic predisposition to breast cancer (and sometimes to other cancers). Those who test negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2 may wish to discuss with a Genetic Counselor the possibility of additional panel testing for pathogenic mutations in other genes (e.g., ATM, CHEK2, PALB2, PTEN, TP53, and/or others), the recommended scope of any further testing (i.e., which other genes), as well the pros, cons and limitations of any recommended testing. Patients may either elect to pursue or decline further testing. See for example, Desmond (2015), \"Clinical Actionability of Multigene Panel Testing for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Risk Assessment\" http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2425836 Lastly, in some families, despite a strong family history of breast cancer, no pathogenic mutation in any of the known genes is identified, suggesting that there are other genes that either alone or in combination may confer risk of breast cancer.

      "Content": "Nov 9, 2016 07:50PM - edited Nov 9, 2016 08:31PM by BarredOwl Hi DZF60: Do you have a copy of your node-positive (N1-3) Oncotype report? You should insist on receiving a copy for your review and records. Regarding whether to add chemotherapy in any particular case, I think this is a question that requires the expertise of a medical oncologist familiar with the details of the specific case. A second opinion may also be very helpful. A medical oncologist should be able to explain the meaning of your Recurrence Score (\"RS\") to you, and provide a recommendation in light of all relevant clinicopathologic features and the RS result. They should also be able to provide a clear explanation of the study results (and any associated caveats) featured in your report, and how they are viewed in clinical practice today (in light of any additional available evidence re the test that is applicable to your situation). In node-NEGATIVE (N0) patients, the clinical data shown in the Oncotype report that compares outcomes in those receiving endocrine therapy alone (Tam) versus endocrine therapy plus chemotherapy (Tam + Chemo) are as you would expect: the Tam + Chemo curve is lower across all scores, and the curves converge as Recurrence Score approaches zero. The data in the node-positive (1-3N+) report is from a different clinical validation study (the SWOG 8814 study) that was performed in node-positive patients (using different clinical endpoints, as explained in the notes above the graph), and the curves actually cross each other just above the cut-point between Low and Intermediate risk groups. Node-Positive (1-3 N+) Sample Report for Recurrence Score of 6:  Keep in mind that the 5-year risk shown in the node-positive report is an average (with Confidence Intervals (\"CI\")) and is based on the results of a validation study that compared outcomes from a group of patients who received Tam with a group of patients who received Tam + Chemo. In this Sample Node-Positive (1-3 N+) Report, with a Recurrence Score of 6, for Tam Alone, the average \"5-Yr Risk of Recurrence or Mortality after 5 Year of Tam\" measured was 8% (95% CI: 4% - 15%) and with Tam + Chemo the average risk was 11% (95% CI: 7% - 17%), oddly higher, but note that the Confidence Intervals (\"CI\") overlap. Check your printed report for the averages and confidence intervals associated with your Recurrence Score. In light of the large and overlapping confidence intervals, what does this mean about the average recurrence risks and what is the clinical significance, if any, to those with \"Low risk\" scores who receive a recommendation for chemotherapy? What have other subsequent studies shown about Recurrence Risk in patients like me? You need a trained medical oncologist to advise you regarding such questions to be sure you receive accurate information from a person with appropriate training, familiarity with the test, and all relevant studies available that may affect understanding of its import. To the extent that it may help you frame your follow-up questions, I provided my layperson thoughts about the cross-over and some information from the study publication in another thread: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/105/topics/812929?page=35#post_4784284 Please note that I am a layperson with no medical training. I never received an Oncotype test, and I never received related medical advice. There may be errors in fact or understanding in this and the linked post. All information should be confirmed with an expert professional medical oncologist to ensure receipt of accurate, current, case-specific expert professional advice. BarredOwl",

They will work with her to figure out the risk/benefit of any proposed intervention. But you are right to work towards understanding the content of the pathology report, since you and your mom will want to understand how the findings relate to her proposed treatment plan, and what is or is not recommended. There are different kinds of breast cancer, and they are not all treated in the same way. For example, pure DCIS is treated quite differently from invasive breast cancers, such as invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Please understand the type of breast cancer she has. In addition, even within a single type of invasive breast cancer, such as IDC, factors such as the tumor size, grade, margin sizes, node status, estrogen receptor (ER) status, progesterone receptor (PR) status, and HER2 status affect the likely treatment recommendations. Other types of tests may also inform decision making in certain cases. Please study the pathology report and look for these kinds of things. You can ask how they are factored in to any treatment recommendations. Make a list of questions about anything you do not understand (like from your post) and ask her doctors to explain what they mean, and whether or not there are any implications for her treatment plan. If she has invasive disease that is ER and/or PR positive and HER2-negative, ask if she is a candidate for the OncotypeDX test for invasive disease, as this may provide useful information for deciding about chemotherapy. Confirm with her doctors that the margins are adequate (for purposes of avoiding radiation). The moderators seem to have provided an older version of the pdf pamphlet (copyright 2010).

Size-wise only that is \"T2\" size tumor, and (as N0, M0) is Stage IIA. What I said above is correct. The radiation is required as part of the local treatment (radiation plus lumpectomy). For Stage IIA, ductal or lobular carcinoma, hormonal therapy and chemotherapy with trastuzumab (also known as HERCEPTIN) is standard of care for hormone-responsive, HER2+ disease. The hormonal therapy can help prevent the development of additional cancers in the breast. In addition, because it is a systemic treatment, hormonal therapy can help somewhat to limit the growth of cells that may have escaped to distant sites. Chemotherapy and trastuzumab are systemic treatments that can kill or cause killing of cancer cells that may have escaped to distant sites. Trastuzumab also inhibits growth of HER2-positive cells. Their major benefit is in reducing the risk of distant recurrence. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) was specifically developed to target HER2-positive disease. It is an antibody molecule and seeks out HER2-positive cells specifically. So it is tolerated pretty well, in general. It has changed the landscape for HER2-positive patients in a dramatic way. Today, the vast majority of patients with HER2-positive disease greater than 1 cm receive this treatment. As your doctor explained, without chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, you are at high risk for a distant recurrence. Such a distant recurrence would be Stage IV disease, which as you doctor said is incurable. Stage IV patients undergo treatment until their disease worsens (\"progression\"), requiring a different treatment, and so on. Unfortunately, many do not survive very long. Chemotherapy plus trastuzumab can potentially prevent this. I agree with 614 that the risk/benefit analysis with HER2-positive disease weighs very strongly in favor of treatment. My understanding is that chemotherapy is generally done before radiation. However, please introduce yourself and ask this question by posting a reply in the discussion at this link, where you can meet \"triple positive\" (ER + PR+ HER2+) patients like you: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/80/topics... That you are healthy in general is good, and you may tolerate treatment better. Today, there are many supportive treatments that help patients tolerate chemotherapy, such as very effective anti-nausea drugs. Patients work closely with their treatment teams to monitor symptoms, and address them as proactively as possible. But your best resource for this are the other \"triple positive\" (ER + PR+ HER2+) patients, many of whom have already completed these treatments and can support you and provide you with good information based on their personal experience. My best to you, BarredOwl",

This test is designed to inform the question of whether to add chemotherapy to endocrine therapy in certain patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative invasive disease (endocrine therapy alone OR chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy). The results can inform understanding of recurrence risk profile (with Tamoxifen treatment alone), and in some cases, provides some insight into the potential benefit of adding chemotherapy. In the large majority of cases, when the OncotypeDX test for invasive disease is recommended, the test is performed after surgery on sample(s) of tumor tissue obtained from surgical treatment. This is because the results from surgical pathology may affect eligibility for the test. However, she should take up the question of an Oncotype test (or suitable prognostic test) with her Medical Oncologist after her surgical pathology results are available. This will include consideration of: (1) the formal eligibility requirements of the commercial test provider (Genomic Health); and (2) the more stringent recommendations regarding the test under applicable clinical consensus guidelines from NCCN and ASCO.

If you are suffering from anxiety, please do not hesitate to discuss it with your surgeon, who may prescribe an anti-anxiety medication. Many patients find this extremely helpful during this stressful time. It sounds like your surgeon recommended an \"excisional biopsy,\" which revealed a small, ER+PR+HER2- \"ductal carcinoma with tubular feature, grade 1, 4 mm in size\". So far, your surgeon's judgment regarding the appropriateness of needle aspiration and then excisional biopsy proved correct, which is a good. You have also had an MRI, which is a very sensitive method used to assess the potential extent of disease. Because excisional biopsies are \"exploratory\" in nature, they are not intended or designed to achieve good surgical margins. If cancer is found, then a further surgical \"re-excision\" is quite common, as has been recommended for you. With a diagnosis of invasive disease, a \"sentinel node biopsy\" is also typically recommended (to check axillary (underarm) lymph nodes. If not, then I would be inclined to seek a second opinion to confirm that advice. The overall approach recommended for you is a \"lumpectomy.\" Most of the time, with some exceptions, lumpectomy is combined with a course of radiation, although those with more favorable pathology findings may be candidates for more limited types of radiation regimens. Therefore, many patients consult with a Radiation Oncologist prior to surgery to get an idea of what may be recommended (although the results of sentinel node biopsy and re-excision may lead to a different recommendation in some cases). If you have not already done so, you may wish to consult a Radiation Oncologist at your current treatment center. Lumpectomy (plus radiation when indicated) is an excellent choice for many. The other main surgical option is mastectomy. Many patients who receive a mastectomy can avoid radiation. However, sometimes certain pathology findings may lead to a recommendation for post-mastectomy radiation. Many find this post about Lumpectomy versus Mastectomy to be very helpful: Beesie's post Lumpectomy v Mastectomy (invasive disease): https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/82/topics/848049?page=1#post_4802494  You mentioned having received an ultrasound and MRI. Have you had diagnostic bilateral mammograms? Guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for breast cancer (Version 2.2016) recommend: \"The recommended workup of localized invasive breast cancer includes: history and physical exam; bilateral diagnostic mammography; breast ultrasonography, if necessary; determination of tumor hormone receptor status (ER and PR determinations); determination of HER2\u2013receptor status; and pathology review. . . \" Guidelines indicate what is generally recommended in the typical case. (Additional imaging or testing may be recommended in the appropriate case, as well as genetic counseling, fertility counseling, etcetera.) I raise the question about bilateral \"diagnostic\" mammograms, because I had bilateral \"screening\" mammograms, and a right \"diagnostic\" mammogram only, plus bilateral MRI. No left \"diagnostic\" mammogram was done by my first team (despite then current guidelines recommending it). In my second opinion, a left diagnostic mammogram was recommended, resulting in the diagnosis of bilateral disease (despite density). This was not detected by the prior MRI. Bilateral disease is not very common; however, as my case illustrates, bilateral diagnostic mammography and MRI can be complementary and may further inform surgical planning and success. If you have not received bilateral diagnostic mammography, in light of the recommendation in the NCCN guidelines, you may wish to ask your current team about it, and/or seek a second opinion review of all pathology, imaging, and treatment recommendations. Some patients choose to seek a second opinion, while others do not. It can be a reasonable choice not to do so. Most of the time, in what appears to be a routine case, the second opinion review and advice should be generally consistent with the first. If for some reason it is not (as in my case), then you would probably want to have that information to inform your decision-making and treatment plan! The challenge is that one cannot know with certainty what the outcome of a second opinion will be, which is part of their value. Also, when you are not sure about something or are uncertain about proceeding, a second opinion at an independent institution can be very helpful to further discuss available treatment options, to probe the quality of the work-up and medical advice received to date, and to obtain additional explanation and discussion. The process is educational and may give you added confidence in your treatment plan. General information about second opinions can be found on the Main Site here (see all six sections): http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/second_opinion/why By the way, if you choose to seek a second opinion, look for a breast surgeon who specializes in the treatment of breast cancer or patients at risk of breast cancer as essentially all of their practice, preferably located at a comprehensive breast center. If feasible, an NCI-designated cancer center (confirm insurance coverage and in-network) may be a good option: https://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-role/cancer-centers/find You will find a lot of support here.

In my case I had DCIS on one side, and a small IDC plus DCIS on the other. Here is an explanation of \"margins\" from this site that you may find helpful. The goal of the \"re-excision\" is to achieve adequate margins. In other words, to remove enough tissue so there is a \"margin\" or band of healthy tissue all around (a disease free-outer boundary). Such an area (margin) of tumor-free tissue suggests the whole tumor has been completely excised. See the explanation and illustration at the bottom of this page. This is the \"walnut\" and \"shell\" your surgeon described, in which the \"shell\" is the healthy, tumor-free \"margin\" he is shooting for. Margins: http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/diagnosis/margins Regarding the possibility of yet an additional procedure, as you already know firsthand, imaging has some limitations and disease is sometimes more extensive than expected from imaging. If the re-excision margins are involved or otherwise not adequate (suggesting possible tumor remaining in the breast), then, another re-excision procedure or mastectomy might even be recommended (or elected). More often than not, no further surgery is required. Sending good luck your way for nice margins. As best practice, be sure to request copies of your original pathology reports from the biopsy and all surgeries, for your review and records. You will learn more and more. Understanding your diagnosis will be helpful to you, as you move forward and consider what additional treatments are offered or recommended. BarredOwl",

As Hydranne noted, \"neoadjuvant chemotherapy\" given prior to surgery is very common with triple-negative disease, particularly with large tumors such as yours (now estimated to be 7 cms). A major advantage is that it can provide information about \"pathological response\", meaning they can monitor during treatment and at later surgical removal, if the tumor responds / responded to the chemotherapy regimen (shrinks or disappears completely (i.e., \"pathological complete response\")). This is valuable information. If the response is not adequate, this information allows a switch to a different regimen. In contrast, if you had surgery first to remove the local disease, and received chemotherapy post-surgery to address the possibility of distant spread, you would just have to assume the chemotherapy was working. With \"triple-negative\" disease, you do not have the option of endocrine therapy, so there is more of a premium on chemotherapy efficacy. If you receive neoadjuvant treatment, lumpectomy may be an option. However, you can still elect mastectomy at that time, if that is your preference. It is important to understand that radiation is sometimes needed even with mastectomy. However, perhaps by having neoadjuvant treatment followed by mastectomy, you can increase the chances that no radiation will be needed. Please ask your team for case-specific advice on this question. Please note that the findings of the recent \"90 days\" study do not apply to the neoadjuvant setting, as the study did not include any patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The patients included received no treatment at all while they awaited surgery. http://oncology.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?artic... \"Patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. . .\" There is a \"Triple-Negative Breast Cancer\" forum here where you can post and learn more: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/72 You may introduce yourself in the \"Calling all TNs\" thread here: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/72/topics... You can see from the profiles that many received neoadjuvant treatment prior to surgery. Sending good thoughts your way. BarredOwl",

      "Content": "Jul 26, 2016 12:49PM - edited Jul 26, 2016 01:23PM by BarredOwl markone: I second, third and fourth the advice above to seek a second opinion. Is she seeing a general surgeon (who does many different types of surgery) or is she seeing a breast surgeon, who specializes in the evaluation and treatment of patients with or at high risk of breast cancer as essentially their entire practice? The latter is preferred, and if you seek a second opinion, please find a breast surgeon specialist. Did you receive only a top-line summary of the pathology and imaging findings? If you are in the US, you are entitled to the complete copies of the original written reports of the pathologist and radiologist, and should request copies for your review. The office and/or medical records division should provide these to you on request or make them available via a patient portal. For example, a proper ultrasound and mammogram report will include a detailed description of what was seen, and assign a \"Bi-Rads\" score, which is a very rough estimate of the level of concern for malignancy. It will include an overall impression and a recommendation regarding further imaging, follow-up, and/or biopsy for use by the breast surgeon. Jumping straight to surgical treatment in the absence of a specific diagnosis or finding is unusual and risks over-treatment, which is highly undesirable in an 81 yr-old. This suggestion clearly warrants a second opinion. It is possible that the Fine-needle aspiration (\"FNA\") results were not clear or definitive, because of the small sample removed. If the FNA pathology was inconclusive, a further biopsy may be indicated, and the question is what type of biopsy as you asked: a minimally-invasive biopsy or a surgical biopsy? A suspicion of malignancy is just that, and a minimally-invasive biopsy could potentially show benign disease. In an elderly person, a minimally-invasive biopsy might be a preferred next step, rather than diving into a surgical (excisional) biopsy procedure. A second opinion will provide you with expert input and another recommendation on this important question. With something clearly viewable on imaging, ultrasound-guided or mammography-guided minimally-invasive biopsy is usually possible (e.g., core-needle biopsy). When it is not possible, there should be a reasoned statement as to why a minimally-invasive biopsy is either not feasible or not recommended. These types of biopsy procedures are very common, sample more tissue than FNA, and thus can be more successful in yielding key information that could inform the advice received regarding treatment recommendations, such as the presence or absence of malignancy. A minimally-invasive biopsy may reveal a condition that is not malignant, obviating further treatment at this time. Certain results might support a recommendation for an excisional biopsy alone (e.g., atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH)), without lymph node biopsy and its risks. These are essentially \"surgical sampling\" procedures that are done to check a larger area around an established area of ADH or other condition for possible malignancy (e.g., DCIS, or invasive cancer). A minimally-invasive biopsy may reveal the presence of malignancy, and important details such as the type of malignancy (non-invasive or invasive), histology (e.g., ductal, lobular, etc), estimated size or extent of disease, grade, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and, if invasive, then also HER2 status. In addition, if breast cancer is proven, in the case of certain types of invasive breast cancer, especially larger (2 cm or more) and/or HER2-positive or \"triple-negative\" (ER- PR- HER2-) disease, instead of proceeding to directly surgery, for various reasons, a medical oncologist may recommend \"neoadjuvant\" drug therapy before surgery (e.g., one or more of chemotherapy, HER2-targeted therapy, and/or endocrine therapy). This option (if indicated) would be lost by jumping immediately to surgical excision. At the end of the day, you do not have enough information and do not understand what you are dealing with and cannot make really an informed decision about next steps. Please seek a second opinion. If you are in the US, an NCI-designated cancer center can be a good choice. Otherwise, a metropolitan hospital with a comprehensive cancer center may be a good choice, and should have breast surgeon specialists on staff. http://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-role/cancer-centers/find Best, BarredOwl",

Further discussion seems to indicate your current question and concern is the possible conversion to ALND, following SNB. In your latest post, you said: \"Since they don't think my nodes are affected and I am getting the treatments the question is would ALND be overkill and worth the risk of lymphdema?\" But the question of ALND will NOT be based on the current understanding of your nodal status from clinical palpation and imaging. As you said above, from your second opinion: \"She said even with ultrasound and MRI they can't detect major lymph node mets all the time and that radiation only kills micro mets so they do SNB and Axillary dissection if needed.\" In other words, SNB is done first, and the results of the SNB will inform the question of whether further ALND is performed or not (either in the same or a subsequent procedure). Please ask the surgeon you will be using whether the nodes removed as a result of SNB will be evaluated by a pathologist intraoperatively (during surgery). If intraoperative pathology will be done on the nodes from SNB, then ask your surgeon for an explanation of how the information from intraoperative node pathology will be used during surgery. For example, what type of SNB results would lead your surgeon to perform further axillary dissection (ALND) during the same surgery? What type of SNB results would lead to no further axillary dissection in that surgery? What clinical guidelines and/or clinical trials would be followed in determining whether SNB (plus axillary radiation as) would be sufficient or ALND is done? If only SNB is done during surgery, will the nodes from SNB be evaluated in more depth after surgery? Could the results of the post-surgical node pathology lead to consideration of a subsequent ALND?

These correlated to a 5 yr risk of recurrence of approx 18%, and a ten year of approx 23%. So I guess what I can gather from this info is that the AVERAGE recurrence risk of 29% that is given for high risk, is for everyone within that (minus) -1.0 to 0.0 bracket. So since mine is -.090, the risk is somewhat lower, (not by much, but slightly), than someone e.g, in your above picture, with a .350 score, or even someone with a closer to 0.0 score.\" Based on positioning of the dots, the 5-year and 10-year values do appear slightly different as compared with the sample report. The original topic of this thread related to whether different \"high risk\" MammaPrint Index (\"MPI\") values are associated with differences in risk. At the time, we found no evidence for it. Since then, I have seen a few publications indicating that an \"ultralow risk\" group can be identified. You should ask your MO whether that risk information (~18% and ~23%) is indeed personalized (and not just some weird printing glitch) and if he knows what evidence supports it (either internal Agendia information or a scientific publication). __________ Re: \"So my untreated risk in 5 years without ANY treatment would be approx 18%, and perhaps with hormone therapy can be half of that? I would opt out of chemo with those figures.\" I don't know. Please confirm your understanding with your MO. Be sure to inquire what type of \"recurrence\" estimate is it? Is it a measure of distant recurrence risk or any recurrence? __________ Re: \"And a side note is that I had read somewhere that the benefits of chemo only kick in for the first 5 years, (as per the blue bottom graph showing 94.6%, and then from 5 to 10 yrs, your risks are the same whether you had chemo or not?\" Please ask your MO how it works over time. In general, Cardoso stated: \"We report 5-year median follow-up results. It is recognized that adjuvant chemotherapy exerts most of its beneficial effects early in the course of the disease (i.e., during the first 5 years), thus justifying our primary end point.24 Since the majority of tumors in our study population were considered to be \"luminal,\" with a continuing risk of relapse beyond 5 years, we acknowledge that long-term follow-up and outcome data will be essential, and we are collecting those data. Hazards for events can have a complex time de- pendence, and Adjuvant! Online and the 70-gene signature were validated for 10-year outcomes; therefore, the planned 10-year follow-up analysis may be of interest.\" __________ Re: \"Have you heard anything about the Prosigna/PAM50 (NanoString Technologies Inc.) I am going to ask my MO if he can request that test. It would definitely help me in my decision. I now have the oncotype showing no chemo needed, the MammaPrint showing a benefit with chemo, so this would be a definite deciding factor.\" I believe the test is included in the ASCO Biomarker Guideline and Update (Free pdfs under PDF tabs): 2017 ASCO Biomarker Update: http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2017.74.0472 See Table 1, Recommendation 1.10 re ER/PgR\u2013positive, HER2-negative (node- negative) breast cancer. 2016 ASCO Biomarker Guideline: http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2015.65.2289 Please confirm it with your team, but it appears that the PAM50 risk of recurrence (ROR) score (Prosigna Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay; NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA) is used \"in conjunction with other clinicopathologic variables, to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy.\" Also subject to confirmation with your team, it appears that Prosigna test provides an \"Intermediate\" risk output in node-negative patients. Per the \"Clinical interpretation of literature review\" of the 2016 ASCO Biomarker Guideline: \"The PAM50-ROR test assists with the decision about adjuvant therapy in patients with ER/PgR-positive, HER2-negative (node-negative) breast cancer.34-36 Chemotherapy should be considered for patients in the PAM50 high-risk group, but is not indicated for patients in the low-risk group. Future studies are needed to inform recommendations about adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with an intermediate PAM50-ROR.\" Consistent with the above, Tables 7 and 8 of the Package Insert suggest that test outputs differ by Risk Category, and that the test yields \"Low, Intermediate, High\" outputs in the node-negative setting. http://prosigna.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/LBL_C02223_06_Package-Insert-Prosigna-Assay-US.pdf  Patients should discuss with their medical oncologist the possible outcomes of any further testing and whether such further testing may or may not provide added clarity in their individual case. __________ Re: \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4603628/, entitled \"Identifying patients at high risk of breast cancer recurrence: strategies to improve patient outcomes\" and the quote: << Although there was a suggestion of benefit for chemotherapy added to endocrine therapy in high-risk patients, the level of evidence does not meet the threshold for determining clinical utility.>> (mammaprint) This paper was published in October of 2015 and predates publication of the results of the MINDACT trial in August 2016. There are a number of studies that show that different tests are not always concordant in individual patients. This is one possible reason why multiple tests may not necessarily clarify the situation for individual patients. The various tests have different designs, different outputs, and varying degrees of validated clinical significance in particular groups of patients, so such comparisons are not always straight-forward. For example, some commentary about one such study noted: \"Oncotype DX was validated in patients treated with tamoxifen, while MammaPrint is intended to be used to gauge risk of recurrence for patients ahead of systemic treatment.\" Unfortunately, none of these multiparameter tests has been shown to be a perfect predictor of individual outcome. They can help inform or refine predictions of recurrence risk and sometimes of potential chemotherapy benefit, further informing risk/benefit analyses, but the output is not always as clear a signal as patients would wish for. __________ Re: \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16720680/\" This is Paik (2006), one of the main validation trials of the Oncotype test. The results of this study (see Figures 3 and 4 of Paik (2006)) are reproduced in your node-negative Oncotype report (see graph and histogram in second section of the report regarding prediction of chemotherapy benefit). From the experiences of others here who received the Oncotype test for invasive disease, clinicians tend to use the first graph from the node-negative Oncotype report to provide average 10-year distant recurrence risk after 5-years Tamoxifen associated with Recurrence Score (10 year distant recurrence risk, Tam Alone), probably because the first graph in the report re \"Prognosis\" is based on the results from a larger group of patients (668 patients) from the NSABP B-14 trial who were all assigned to receive Tamoxifen. The first graph of the node-negative report is based on Figure 4 of Paik (2004): http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa041588#t=article You can ask your MO if the Oncotype risk information from the first graph of your Oncotype report (with Tam Alone) is still a suitable estimate of your 10-year risk of distant recurrence with endocrine therapy alone, or does information from the MammaPrint and/or BluePrint test alter understanding of your distant recurrence risk with endocrine therapy alone? (AIs are comparable or slightly more effective than Tamoxifen.) ________ Re: \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3089800/\" This article was published in 2008, before the 2013 publication of RASTER and well before the 2016 publication of MINDACT which included a large number of patients. Please ask your MO whether the observations in this early paper appear to be borne out in the older, post-menopausal patients in subsequent trials, such as RASTER or MINDACT.

Did you receive a BluePrint test also? The BluePrint test output is a molecular subtype classification as: Luminal-type; HER2-type; or Basal-type. Among those classified as Luminal-type, the MammaPrint risk classification (Low Risk or High Risk) is used to further subdivide Luminal-types into Low Risk Luminal-type (A) or High Risk Luminal-type (B). Do not hesitate to request confirmation of your \"Clinical Low Risk\" categorization according to MINDACT criteria from your Medical Oncologist (\"MO\"), as well as a discussion of the MINDACT trial findings relevant to your particular situation. You may also wish to inquire with your MO whether there is a multidisciplinary \"Tumor Board\" at your current treatment center that that would consider your case, in light of some of the remarks in the 2017 ASCO Biomarker guideline update. Optionally or in addition, if you have time before timely initiation of treatment (please confirm it with your team), you may wish to pursue a second opinion. Many look for an NCI-designated cancer center (confirm in-network): https://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-role/cancer-centers/find Although you may need to travel a bit, you can choose to seek any treatment locally. I hope your upcoming appointment is productive. BarredOwl",

I would have some concern that the first MO, who is not a specialist, is not very familiar with the Oncotype test for invasive disease, including eligibility requirements and guidelines regarding its use in particular patient subsets and/or clinically validated uses of the multi-gene Recurrence Score, or with the limitations of the individual HER2 score. The articles posted by SpecialK illustrate some controversy surrounding and possible deficiencies in the use of the individual HER2 score, which is derived from measurement of mRNA levels of many cells, and not of protein (IHC) or DNA (FISH). I do not believe that the HER2 result should be used to contravene HER2 status determined by FISH. Please consult with the MO from the NCI-designated cancer center about any proposed use of the Oncotype HER2 score in your decision-making, as there has been concern that it may underestimate HER2 leading to undertreatment. To my knowledge, HER2-positive patients are not eligible for the Oncotype test for invasive disease: http://breast-cancer.oncotypedx.com/en-US/Professi... OncotypeDX is a kind of biomarker test. In Oncotype for invasive disease, the biomarker is the gene expression pattern/profile of mRNA levels from 16 cancer-related genes (5 controls)). The mRNA expression data is used to compute a Recurrence Score, which is used to predict adjuvant therapy benefit and 10-year risk of distant recurrence. Very generally, biomarker tests like this are indicated for use in patients who share important clinical features with the patient populations represented in the studies used to design the test and used to establish the prognostic and predictive value of the test. The test has no proven prognostic or predictive value in other types of patients. In other words, if the test is not \"validated\" in other types of patients, it cannot be safely used to guide clinical decisions for those other patients. The scope of validation is reflected in \"eligibility\". In general, if a person is not \"eligible\" for a commercial biomarker test, it may reflect that the test either was never tested in such patients or not tested adequately in such patients, did not work as intended in such patients, or is still being tested in such patients (and may not work). The fact that HER2-positive patients are not eligible for the test likely reflects that the test is not or is not sufficiently validated in HER2-positive patients, and hence lacks prognostic or predictive value in HER2-positive patients. Similarly, consensus guidelines from the NCCN (Version 1.2016) do not include the use of the test for HER2-positive patients, but only in certain hormone-receptor positive, HER2-negative patients. I strongly recommend that you discuss with the expert MO from the NCI-designated cancer center the use and quality of validation of the Oncotype test in HER2-positive patients in general, and the proposed use of the Recurrence Score in your particular case. I have concerns that it may not be appropriate. BarredOwl",

Please inquire with your medical oncologists specifically whether current clinical practice guidelines for breast cancer provide for the use of the Oncotype test in your specific case or not. If the Recurrence Score is to be relied upon in any way, please also request an explanation of the quality and scope of validation of the Oncotype test in HER2-positive patients in general and in respect of HER2-positive tumors of the same size as yours, and whether any such evidence that is available is sufficiently robust to rely on for decision-making purposes in your particular case.

For information only and subject to confirmation with one's medical oncologist, the professional site from Agendia includes more specific eligibility requirements, and it appears that not everyone may be eligible. The information below also appears to be consistent with the Physician's Brochure applicable to the United States. http://www.agendia.com/healthcare-professionals/br... \"Mammaprint\" (fresh tissue) and \"MammaPrint FFPE\" tests are indicated for breast cancer patients that fulfill the following criteria:  The above reflect FDA requirements and it is possible that eligibility differed in the past for the Laboratory Developed Test. It is also possible that clinical practice may differ somewhat in scope (e.g., may be broader) from specific FDA requirements. Regardless of the above, any patient interested in the MammaPrint test should always consult their Medical Oncologist regarding their potential eligibility and suitability for the test, to ensure receipt of accurate, current, case-specific information and expert professional advice regarding eligibility (which may change over time).

The OncotypeDX test was ordered when you were thought to be HER2-negative and were considered to be \"eligible\" for the test. Eligibility generally reflects the scope of \"validation\" of the test (studies that confirmed the ability of the test to do its job in specific types of patients). Here is a summary page from the test provider regarding who is eligible: Eligibility: http://breast-cancer.oncotypedx.com/en-US/Professi... If a person is considered HER2-positive, they would not technically be \"eligible\" for the Oncotype test for invasive disease and the multigene Recurrence Score should not direct the decision regarding chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Nibaum confirmed this with her MO: \"As expected, the NCI MO told me that Oncotype DX is not validated for Her2+.\" Individual ER, PR and HER2 scores are also included with the Oncotype test results. The Oncotype test measures mRNA levels, whereas the pathology tests use antibody-based methods to detect receptor proteins and appear to be more sensitive. The individual Oncotype ER, PR, and HER2 scores are not typically relied upon for treatment decisions, when a person is clearly ER, PR positive by standard immunohistopathology and HER2 positive by FISH. I understand you had a node-negative (N0) IDC, that was 1.9 cm, ER+ , PR+, and HER2 +. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) issues consensus guidelines for the treatment of breast cancer, which reflect what is generally recommended. For IDC that is node-negative (N0), hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive and Tumor >1 cm the guidelines provide for: Adjuvant endocrine therapy + adjuvant chemotherapy with trastuzumab (category 1) In addition, it is noted that a \"pertuzumab-containing regimen can be administered to patients with ≥T2 or ≥N1, HER2-positive, early-stage breast cancer,\" where T2 Tumor > 20 mm but ≤ 50 mm in greatest dimension. Pertuzumab (Perjeta) is approved for use prior to surgery (\"neoadjuvant\" treatment), but occasionally some may receive it post-surgery in the adjuvant setting (an \"off-label\" use, with approval of insurer). As you are just at the junction of T2-disease, you may wish to inquire about whether (a) chemotherapy plus trastuzumab (Herceptin) would be best, or if (b) chemotherapy plus trastuzumab (Herceptin) and pertuzumab (Perjeta) should be considered in your case or not. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is given for a year, and may be concurrent with a shorter chemotherapy regimen. Endocrine therapy should follow chemotherapy. An aromatase inhibitor is likely to be recommended for post-menopausal women (including those with bilateral oophorectomy), and would follow chemotherapy (may be concurrent with herceptin). Again, it may be appropriate in the individual case to depart from what the guidelines provide due to personal medical history, age, etc. For example, it is noted that \"[t]here are limited data to make chemotherapy recommendations for those >70 y of age\", although individual patients may elect such treatment. Re your Question (2), my 1.5 mm IDC HER2 status was unknown, so I do not know what is typically done for scans in your case. My guess is that (as with post-treatment monitoring) there may be variation in individual practice. Because you have some findings (albeit low probability of a concern), please do not hesitate to discuss those findings specifically with your medical oncologist and inquire whether further scans are warranted in your case. Hopefully, other HER2-positive members can comment on what kinds of scans they received pre-treatment. I am a layperson with no medical training, so please confirm all information above with your medical oncologist to ensure receipt of accurate, current, case-specific expert medical professional advice.

My layperson understanding of AMAROS is that those who received ART (axillary radiotherapy) also received SNB. AMAROS does not appear to be a study about skipping axillary staging by SNB. It appears to be a study comparing [axillary lymph node dissection] to [SNB plus axillary radiotherapy] in sentinel-node positive patients (i.e., who received SNB) with T1\u2013T2 primary breast cancer and no palpable lymphadenopathy. Also, patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were not eligible (i.e., none were included in the trial), so the results of this particular trial may only apply to those with a surgery-first plan and the clinical and pathologic features of the study population. Please ask your team. I recommend that you discuss this study and any other outside materials that influence your thinking with the appropriate member(s) of your team to ensure applicability of the findings to your case, accurate understanding of the results, and accurate application to your situation (if indicated). At the same time, you can ask which studies speak to your case and for an explanation of the findings, [EDIT: and/or whether there are any relevant clinical trials enrolling patients that may be of interest].

In contrast, the MammaPrint test (Agendia) produces a MammaPrint Index (\"MPI\") value (on a scale from -1.0 to +1.0), which is further classified (relative to the clinical classification threshold of zero) as either genomic \"High Risk\" or genomic \"Low Risk\". See for example, the Agendia website (under the \"Development\" tab): >> http://www.agendia.com/healthcare-professionals/breast-cancer/mammaprint/ >>QUOTE: \"MammaPrint provides a numerical index with a range of -1 to +1, that is overlayed with a binary Low Risk / High Risk clinical classification system.\" By the way, regarding the timing of the MammaPrint test, if recommended in connnection with adjuvant chemotherapy decisions, the MammaPrint test is typically performed after surgical treatment and lymph node biopsy are completed, when full information pertinent to (a) eligibility for the test, and (b) Clinical Risk Category (\"Clinical High Risk\" or \"Clinical Low Risk\" per specific MINDACT Trial criteria) are both available. In my layperson's understanding, since MINDACT, in certain patients, it appears that the question of whether to order the test may be informed by \"Clinical Risk Category\" according to MINDACT Trial criteria. In addition, understanding the significance of the test results in light of MINDACT trial findings must take into account both Clincal Risk Category (per MINDACT Trial criteria) and Genomic Risk (the MammaPrint test result).

In this instance, \"Clinical Low Risk\" and \"Clinical High Risk\" categorizations are specifically defined per clinical trial criteria.

The paper further states: >> \"Details regarding clinical risk assessment according to the modified version of Adjuvant!

The surgery and radiation are \"loco-regional\" treatments, directed at removing cancer from the breast. I think your doctors are saying that after the lumpectomy (plus radiation) and negative nodes, they feel that they have successfully removed the local cancer. However, even with node negative invasive disease, there is a risk that before the surgery, some cancer cells already escaped the area and moved to distant sites via the blood or lymph. Your team views this risk as placing you at high risk of distant recurrence. Chemotherapy and targeted therapy (trastuzumab for HER2+ disease) are systemic treatments and are designed to address the risk that some cells moved to distant sites. If you are Stage II and purely node negative (N0), then size-wise, the tumor must be greater than 2 centimeters. Please advise if that is not correct. For hormone receptor positive, HER2-positive, node negative (N0) ductal (IDC) or lobular carcinoma (ILC) where the tumor is greater than 1 centimeter, the consensus guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) (Professional version 1.2016) provide the following treatment: \"Adjuvant endocrine therapy + adjuvant chemotherapy with trastuzumab (category 1)\" The recommendation you received is in line with consensus treatment guidelines. However, if you have doubts, or would like additional input and discussion, you may wish to seek second opinion from a medical oncologist at an independent institution. You could also discuss any issues with the pathology report with the second opinion, and get input on whether they have been adequately resolved, or if not, what steps may be needed to be certain of the pathology. This \"high risk\" thread is more for people at high risk of getting cancer, as compared to those already diagnosed with Stage II HER2+ disease (at higher risk for recurrence). For more input from other HER2+ members, please try a new thread in the HER2-positive forum: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/80 If you are triple-positive (ER+ PR+ HER2+), try this thread: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/80/topics...

By \"clear nodes\", I take it to mean that you had no clinical evidence of lymph node involvement, and the sentinel node biopsy results on final surgical pathology were designated as purely \"N0\". Then, I assume your tumor is \"T1\" in terms of size (tumor ≤ 20 mm in greatest dimension), including any one of the following: T1mi Tumor ≤ 1 mm in greatest dimension T1a Tumor > 1 mm but ≤ 5 mm in greatest dimension T1b Tumor > 5 mm but ≤ 10 mm in greatest dimension T1c Tumor > 10 mm but ≤ 20 mm in greatest dimension T1 disease that is purely node negative (N0) with no evidence of distant metastasis (M0) would be T1 N0 M0 and that is considered Stage IA. For a T1-size tumor to be Stage IB requires micromets in the lymph nodes (i.e., \"pN1mi\" = Micrometastases (greater than 0.2 mm and/or more than 200 cells, but none greater than 2.0 mm): https://cancerstaging.org/references-tools/quickreferences/Documents/BreastMedium.pdf I am a layperson with no medical training, so if unsure about the above, please ask your doctors for clarification.

In clinical practice, which is evidence-based, recommendations for tissue biopsy are based on the results of imaging assessment(s) used to determine the likelihood that a mass is malignant, and hence the need (if any) for short-interval monitoring or biopsy. Radiologists do not in practice \"assume\" that a mass is benign on the basis of patient age. Radiologists use information regarding the appearance of the mass on ultrasound (or other imaging modalities) to assess the likelihood that it is malignant according to BI-RADS criteria that are age-independent. Did you obtain a copy of the Radiologist's report and BIRADs score yet? What is the follow-up recommendation? Return to normal screening? Short-interval follow-up? (e.g., further imaging in six-months) Referral to a breast surgeon? Other? The Radiologist's written report is the most important and informative data available to you at this time. Without that information, this discussion is essentially fact-free. BarredOwl",

It is important to note that the study was performed in a subset of ER and/or PR positive, HER2-negative, node-negative patients with invasive disease: \"The study included women 18 to 75 years of age with axillary node\u2013negative invasive breast cancer that was estrogen-receptor\u2013positive or progesterone-receptor\u2013positive (or both) and that did not overexpress HER2. Patients had to meet National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for the recommendation of adjuvant chemotherapy, including a primary tumor size of 1.1 to 5.0 cm in the greatest dimension for a tumor of any grade or a size of 0.6 to 1.0 cm in the greatest dimension for a tumor of intermediate or high histologic grade or nuclear grade (or both).\" Here is the original report published on Monday: http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1510764... Here is a related commentary: http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1512092 Here is a summary in layman's terms: http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-09/ecr... The new study found that the Oncotype DX assay (for invasive cancer) was quite robust among node-negative patients who met the study criteria and had scores from 0 to 10, almost all of whom received endocrine therapy alone. (Edited above to add \"almost\": \"Although the protocol specified that no chemotherapy be given if the recurrence score was 0 to 10, a total of 6 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy . . .\") In the thread I linked to above, you'll see some consternation arising from the different cut-offs used in this new study to allocate patients to various treatment groups, versus the cut-offs currently in use. The authors explained their rationale for these particular study cut-off points in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the \"Study Protocol\" section of the paper. Those observations may be worthy of discussion with your oncologist, depending on your actual score. New Study: \"Low risk\": RS ≤ 10 (assigned to receive endocrine therapy alone) \"Intermediate risk\": RS = 11 to 25 (randomly assigned to receive either chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy or endocrine therapy alone) \"High risk\": RS ≥ 26 (assigned to receive chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy) Previously Defined: \"Low risk\": RS <18 \"Intermediate risk\": RS = 18 to 30 \"High risk\": RS ≥ 31 Basically, the way I understand it, the results in this particular paper are informative for patients who would meet the new study criteria, who have a RS ≤ 10 (0 to 10), and who receive endocrine therapy. I do not think the new results in this paper would change the situation for others, who will probably continue to be advised along the lines they have been advised to date, using the framework of the previously defined cut-offs (absent other results). As always, I am just a layperson and could be wrong, so you should discuss everything with your oncologist! Good luck! BarredOwl  ",

The Radiologist's report will include a description of what was observed, impressions or conclusions, and recommendations (e.g., further imaging needed at this time; return to routine screening; short-interval follow-up; tissue biopsy). In the USA, the Radiologist's report typically includes a BI-RADS category rating, which is a rough assessment of the likelihood of malignancy according to American College of Radiology (\"ACR\") criteria.

While unnecessary delays should be avoided, obviously, some time is required (and is reasonable) for appropriate preoperative evaluations, testing and consultations that may impact treatment decisions and advice. It is important to understand that recent observational studies that assessed the potential impact of delays in surgical treatment were conducted in patients who all had a surgery-first treatment plan. Those receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded from those studies (and the findings do not apply to them), because their situation differs materially, and because the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery has already been established in other clinical trials. Per purplestargazer's subsequent post, she has now received a recommendation for neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery. A timely subsequent surgery following neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not considered to be a surgical \"delay\". With a primary tumor that is estimated to be over 2 cm in size (estimated clinical Stage IIA disease) and that is \"triple-negative\" (ER- PR- HER2-), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (administered prior to surgery) is within current standards of care as reflected in NCCN guidelines for the treatment of breast cancer. Many members here have such a plan. In those who are suitable candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (per their treatment team, including a Medical Oncologist), as noted above, such a plan may have certain advantages, including the ability to assess response to therapy (the degree of pathologic response) by imaging and subsequent surgical pathology, and potentially adapt treatment plan based on the information provided. For example, if there is sufficient tumor shrinkage due to neoadjuvant treatment, in certain patients, this may enable breast-conserving surgery in lieu of mastectomy (if desired). The omission of subsequent surgery in exceptional responders is not currently used in clinical practice, but is an active area of research: >> http://www.ejso.com/article/S0748-7983(17)30347-5/abstract >> \"Furthermore, tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy can significantly impact local regional therapy decision-making by down-staging disease without compromising local regional control. This includes facilitation of breast conserving surgery and increased eligibility for limited axillary surgery in selected patients. Furthermore, the omission of surgery in the setting of exceptional response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the ultimate breast conserving strategy, is being actively studied. With further refinement of systemic and targeted therapies, neoadjuvant systemic therapy continues to provide a robust mechanism for innovation in local regional management paradigms with increased attention to individualized breast oncologic care.\" BarredOwl",

The fact that people here who were diagnosed with IDC at the outset received lumpectomy plus SNB would be irrelevant to this question if you have no evidence of invasion. We cannot be certain of what is in your pathology report, your clinical presentation, and your exact diagnosis. Your surgeon is familiar with your clinical presentation and all reports (e.g., whether you have enlarged nodes by imaging, whether you had a palpable lump or not, other pathology or imaging findings), and we are not. Thus, you need to (a) confirm your understanding of your diagnosis, and (b) ask the surgeon some questions to understand why he recommended SNB for supposedly pure DCIS, which is not standard: (1) Tell your surgeon that you understand that your diagnosis is \"apparently pure DCIS that is low grade\", and that you understand that with sentinel node biopsy, there is some risk of lymphedema. (2) Then, ask your surgeon to list the specific reasons that support his recommendation for the SNB in your specific case. Write the reasons down. Read it back to him and request that he confirm it is correct. (3) Ask for an estimate of the risk of finding invasive disease in your case. Write it down. (4) Ask if in his medical opinion you could reasonably elect to have lumpectomy (without SNB) as a first procedure, obtain review of the final pathology, and only if invasion is found, then undergo SNB in a second (later) procedure. If not, why not? With his responses to these questions, you may have a clearer idea about things. If you are unsure, a second opinion is an excellent idea. Your surgeon should be a breast surgeon whose practice focuses on treating patients with breast cancer or at risk of getting breast cancer. If your surgeon does not focus almost exclusively on breast cancer, I would recommend that you seek a second opinion.

Her doctor said it's contained in the duct.\" Her current diagnosis is not entirely clear from the information. I recommend that she obtain complete copies of her pathology reports from all recent biopsies, and share them with you, so you can check if her current diagnosis is all DCIS or if there is any evidence of invasion. Was the mass biopsied? Do you mean 9 centimeters or 9 millimeters? Is this estimated extent of disease biopsy-proven, for example, by taking cores from different areas 9 cm apart? IF the biopsy showed pure DCIS (which is confined to the inside of the ducts or \"noninvasive\") and no evidence of any invasion, then a four-week wait for mastectomy seems reasonable (even for an estimated 9 centimeters of DCIS). As noted by others, she may wish to seek a second opinion during this time. The pathology report on biopsy for DCIS typically provides grade, ER and PR status, and describes the appearance or architecture of the cells in the duct (e.g., solid, cribiform, etc.). DCIS is not typically tested for HER2 status, because HER2 status does not affect treatment options for pure DCIS. DCIS is \"noninvasive\" and so does not ordinarily pose a risk of distant spread. Because the chances of distant (metastatic) spread are so low, patients diagnosed with apparently pure DCIS and who have no symptoms of concern appropriately do not receive such scans under current guidelines. Sentinel node biopsy (\"SNB\") is being recommended because mastectomy disrupts the lymph channels needed to perform and identify the sentinel node(s). Patients confirmed by surgical pathology to have pure DCIS are expected to be node-negative. However, per ASCO, among patients diagnosed with apparently pure DCIS by minimally-invasive biopsy, about 10-20% overall will be found to have some invasive breast cancer (about half of which are very tiny microinvasion). The lymph node status info will be used for staging and treatment decisions if invasive disease is found. On the other hand, if the biopsy found any INVASIVE breast cancer (e.g., invasive ductal carcinoma (\"IDC\"), invasive lobular carcinoma (\"ILC\"), or other types), then you will need more information at this time, such as the size of the invasive tumor, and its ER, PR and HER2 status, to make informed decisions about work-up, treatment plan and timing. For example, with larger invasive tumors, particularly triple-negative (ER-PR-HER2-) or HER2-positive invasive tumors, patients should consult a Medical Oncologist prior to surgery to determine if they are a suitable candidate for neoadjuvant drug treatment administered PRIOR to surgery.

Lymphedema is a complication that can occur in some cases with SNB (estimates of incidence vary), the risk of it showing up is a life-long risk (it may appear years later), and once it appears, it is a life-long condition. Although the baseline risk may not be large with SNB, if it develops, the impact of lymphedema is significant. You can raise the question of sentinel node biopsy for apparently pure DCIS in your case by telling your surgeon that you understand there is some risk of lymphedema, and that you are wondering if in light of your pathology and imaging findings, you could reasonably elect to have lumpectomy (without SNB) as a first procedure, obtain review of the final pathology, and only if invasion is found, then undergo SNB in a second (later) procedure. If the surgical pathology shows no invasion, you would be able to avoid the SNB procedure and its accompanying risks, including the risk of SNB-associated lymphedema. Again, most lumpectomy patients with apparently pure DCIS can avoid SNB completely, or at least defer it until it is clearly medically indicated. Invasive cancer is found in only about 10% to 20% of cases overall. A possible exception in which SNB may be considered for apparently pure DCIS treated by lumpectomy is the case of excision in an anatomic location (e.g., tail of the breast), which could compromise the performance of a future SNB procedure. Note that with a lumpectomy for apparently pure DCIS, if clean margins are not obtained, a further surgical procedure(s) may be needed anyway (re-excision procedure to obtain clean margins). So, presumably you are willing to undergo a second procedure in general, and have no contraindication for a second procedure (which entails another round of some type of anesthesia, etc.) For a more information, see the recent discussion with JACTsMom here: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/68/topics...

Recurrence rates may vary based on the drugs received, tumor size, lymph node status, etcetera. You should not hesitate to ask your doctors to explain your estimated recurrence risk (local and distant), and by how much each treatment may reduce one or both of those risks. People here can direct you to other threads or useful information if we know more about your situation. Factors such as histology (e.g., ductal, lobular, etc), actual or estimated tumor size, lymph node involvement, ER, PR, and HER2 status, tumor grade, as well as age and menopausal status are useful information to share, if you are comfortable doing so. Planned treatments are also useful information (surgery, radiation, specific drugs). Are you receiving drug treatments prior to surgery (i.e., \"neoadjuvant chemotherapy\")? What drugs are you receiving? For HER2+ disease, \"TCH\" which is docetaxel, carboplatin and trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN), is quite common here. Or elsewhere, perhaps a FEC-based regimen plus trastuzumab and a taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel)? If you wish, you can share such information in a post or in the profile section.

However, I do not read the blog post as saying that the conclusions of the study are faulty. Instead, Dr. Nudelman takes issue with the interpretations of the results made in commentaries and editorials written by third parties, and emphasizes that the failure to observe an association between increased arm volume and blood draws, etc. in this study does not equate with proof of safety of such interventions: \"The study concluded: \"Although we cannot affirmatively state that risk-reduction practices have no effect on arm swelling, we hope to generate evidence that brings reasonable doubt to burdensome guidelines and encourage further investigation into non-precautionary behaviors and the risk of lymphedema. \" So, they didn't find that in the small numbers of their patients who recalled having medical procedures in their arms or flew without compression that they had a large increase in swelling of the part of their arms they could measure. But they couldn't definitively say it was safe.\" In the passage above, she quotes a statement from the original article, in which they admit that the results do not prove that precautions are unnecessary, but hope they raise questions that warrant further investigation. Her remarks explain the authors' statement and note what it does not mean, but are not inconsistent with the statement. And while she notes certain weaknesses in study design, I do not think she is saying the author's conclusions are faulty. She is saying that the commentators have not interpreted the findings properly. By the way, while it does not undermine her conclusions about safety, her remarks do not appear to be an accurate statement of the study design with respect to air travel. In particular, the assessment of air travel does not appear to have been based on recall, but per the original article was prospectively assessed: \"In our analysis, we prospectively collected information regarding air travel and quantified arm swelling with short intervals of follow-up. This design enabled the investigation of the immediate effects of flying on arm volume and minimized the risk of recall bias due to the shorter interval of follow up.\" Dr. Nudelman emphasizes the importance of reading the original article to understand the study design, findings, what they do and do not establish, and the caveats and limitations.

The period of time when you do not know what you may be dealing with is worse than actually knowing. Different types of disease receive different types of treatment(s), ranging from surgery** alone (in the appropriate case), to surgery plus one or more of radiation therapy; chemotherapy; targeted therapy (for HER2+ invasive disease); and/or endocrine therapy. Please understand that without any additional information about whether the results of the biopsy showed non-invasive disease and/or invasive disease, or the additional features of such disease, such as type or histology, estimated size, grade, as well as ER and PR status (for invasive or non-invasive disease), and HER2 status (for invasive disease), at this time, it remains totally unclear what (if any) further treatments will be indicated or considered beyond surgery, or the timing of such treatments (if any). Additional pathology and testing will be performed on tissues removed during surgery, which together with lymph node status (e.g., as determined by sentinel node biopsy (if applicable)), may provide additional information regarding your treatment plan. Please do not hesitate to request an appointment to review the results soon, and take a trusted person with you. Please do not hesitate to contact the doctor who called you to inquire if additional details are now available.

NO aromatse inhibitor?\" Are you suggesting that her prior treatment plan was deficient because she did not receive an Aromatase Inhibitor (\"AI\", a type of \"endocrine therapy\") after radiation, and therefore she should not trust her doctors now? She may still choose to seek a second opinion if she wishes, but I see no basis here to conclude that there was a deficiency in the prior treatment plan. Please note that a person who had pure DCIS in 2015, who received lumpectomy plus radiation, may not have received any endocrine therapy (Tamoxifen or an AI) for good reasons. Such a treatment plan would be within 2015 guidelines. For example, endocrine therapy would not be indicated if the prior DCIS was hormone receptor-negative (ER- PR-). Those with hormone receptor-negative pure DCIS would not typically receive a recommendation for endocrine therapy (Tamoxifen or an AI) to reduce recurrence risk in either 2015 or 2017. If the prior DCIS was hormone receptor-positive, a treatment plan of lumpectomy plus radiation with no endocrine therapy would have been within 2015 guidelines. This is because in 2015, NCCN guidelines (Version 3.2015) provided that patients \"consider Tamoxifen\" as an option, if ER+. The 2015 guidelines for pure DCIS did NOT include the option of an Aromatase Inhibitor, and included Tamoxifen only for all women regardless of menopausal status. (NOTE: Current 2017 NCCN guidelines (Version 2.2017) now do include the option of an Aromatase Inhibitor for post-menopausal women with pure DCIS, in light of recent clinical trial publications.) Tamoxifen might have been contraindicated due to certain co-morbidities. If Tamoxifen was a suitable option, it still might not always be warranted or elected for DCIS following lumpectomy plus radiation. Because pure DCIS is non-invasive, the main rationale for and risk addressed by endocrine therapy for pure DCIS is local. The main benefits for pure DCIS are reducing the risk of new or recurrent same in-breast or new contralateral disease. Depending on their personal risk profile, for some patients, the size of the potential risk reduction benefit might not be seen to sufficiently outweigh the risks, in light of their personal risk tolerance.

It is critical that your mother seek expert professional medical advice. Please ensure that she has an appointment very soon to discuss these pathology results and recommended next steps. If a family member could go with her to her appointments, to listen, take notes, and help ask questions, that will be very helpful to her. The final impression of the pathologist is duct or \"ductal carcinoma\", which is a type of malignant breast cancer. The fact that there are normal or benign cells present in the sample is expected. The presence of both benign and malignant cells is not a benign result. Malignant breast cancer was found in the view of the pathologist. What is not clear from the information you provided is what type of \"ductal carcinoma\" she has. For example, one type of ductal carcinoma is \"ductal carcinoma in situ\" (\"DCIS\"). Another type of ductal carcinoma is \"invasive ductal carcinoma\" (\"IDC\"). Both of these are malignant breast cancers. You will need to find out what type it is. The other words in the report (hyperchromatic, pleomorphic nuclei, prominent nucleoli and moderate amount of cytoplasm) are observations about how the malignant cells look to the pathologist. Hyperchromatic: more chromatin (DNA-protein complex in the nucleus of the cell) than is seen in normal cells; Pleomorphic nuclei: different sizes and shapes of nuclei (the nucleus is the place in the cell where the chromatin (DNA-protein complex) is located; Here is a general explanation from a paper: \"Certain criteria are used for the differentiation of malignant cells from benign cells. The most important feature of malignant cells is polymorphism, which is seen in the various changes of the cytoplasm and cell nucleus. The cells of a malignant neoplasm frequently show a size that differs from normal. In addition, the cells almost invariably possess a nuclear polymorphism. The most important nuclear changes are: different sizes and shapes, alterations in the structure of chromatin and nucleoli. There are also changes in the cytoplasm, which are less important than the changes in the nucleus.\" Information about the type of \"ductal carcinoma\" she has, plus imaging results, clinical observations, and other test results, such as tests for Estrogen Receptor (ER) and Progesterone Receptor (PR) status, and for HER2/neu status (if invasive), will be needed to better understand her cancer diagnosis and the recommended treatment options. As you learn more about her breast cancer diagnosis from her doctors, you will find this community to be very supportive. BarredOwl",

Then, ask the second opinion place how to go about getting the materials they need to provide a second opinion. With a lack of confidence in the prior assessment and continuing symptoms, it seems appropriate to seek out a more qualified review by means of a second opinion. Under the circumstances, I would not consider it wasting medical time or being a hypochondriac at all. Think of it as advocating for yourself to ensure you obtain a proper and thorough assessment, and sound and reliable advice. Good luck and keep us posted. BarredOwl",

In your case it sounds like you are being further evaluated on the basis of some mammography findings. It is good that this is being looked at further. Further imaging and/or a biopsy may be considered. The diagnostic evaluation process is very difficult, even when the result is ultimately a benign condition. The waiting and wondering is the worst. You are on the right track thinking about distracting yourself with work or maybe doing something kind of mindless (but not too mindless) that you enjoy.

Actually, \"Oncotype DX\" is conducted by a very different methodology than \"genetic testing\" (e.g., BRCA1/2, etc.) \"Genetic testing\" of a sample containing normal cells (e.g., blood) requires extensive genomic DNA sequencing and may also include an assessment of certain gene rearrangements. In contrast, with Oncotype DX, the levels of gene expression (not the DNA sequence) from a number of genes in a tumor sample are determined. The method used is quantitative \"RT-PCR\" (reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction). It assesses the level of expression from 16 cancer-related genes and five reference genes. http://breast-cancer.oncotypedx.com/en-US/Professi...

I also had SNB on both sides. It takes some work and insistence to avoid blood pressure readings, blood draws, and IVs on the arm. I know it shouldn't bother me, but it makes me feel like a butthead when I insist on a different location or decline a procedure on the arm. Like I am imposing on them or something. Despite the findings in this study, (butthead that I am), I will probably continue to try and evade arm procedures just in case. But I may feel a little better about the times I don't succeed (e.g., colonoscopy at a regional hospital with continuous bp readings throughout the procedure on arm, and IV placed in hand under hospital policy that SNB does not require another location for IV).

Although clearly less effective than a trastuzumab-containing regimen, please ask your medical oncologist whether there are some chemotherapy regimens (without trastuzumab) that could reduce the risk of distant recurrence in your case. Chemotherapy regimens were used in HER2+ disease prior to the development of trastuzumab, and your medical oncologist can advise you about their risk / benefit in the HER2+ setting. In addition, if you have hormone receptor-positive disease (e.g., ER and/or PR positive disease), please also discuss approaches to endocrine therapy with your medical oncologist. If chemotherapy is used, endocrine therapy would be used after chemo. I realize there may be barriers to chemotherapy drugs or some approaches to endocrine therapy, but they are likely to be much cheaper than a biologic like trastuzumab.

Therefore, I searched for a full-length, peer-reviewed paper (using the abstract title and first author as search queries), in case the final analysis, with additional details, caveats, limitations, and a discussion of other studies, is available. In this case, there is such a paper: Laurberg (2016): \"Age-dependent outcome in breast cancer - Long-term age-dependent failure pattern after breast-conserving therapy or mastectomy among Danish lymph-node-negative breast cancer patients\" Main Page: http://www.thegreenjournal.com/article/S0167-8140(16)31109-4/abstract PDF version: http://www.thegreenjournal.com/article/S0167-8140(16)31109-4/pdf Patients were all \"lymph-node-negative patients in Denmark . . . who received local treatment only\". More details regarding the study population and treatment are available: \"Study population and treatment The study cohort included 813 lymph-node-negative patients with tumor size <5 cm and no previous cancer. Included were all histological tumor types except invasive ductal carcinoma grade II/III. All patients had given informed consent to be enrolled in the DBCG-89a-protocol [24\u201325] administered by the Danish Breast Cancer Group (DBCG). Data were collected prospectively. All patients received partial axillary dissection and were advised to receive mastectomy (with no other treatment) or lumpectomy and whole-breast RT of the residual breast (48 Gy in 24 fractions+ boost of 10\u201316 Gy in 5\u20138 fractions) [26]. No patients received adjuvant systemic treatment. The study cohort had a balanced proportion of patients within each 5-year age group. Geographical inclusion criteria were used to secure an unbiased cohort (Sup. Fig. 1): Young patients were included nationwide; old patients from a particular region of Denmark. Patients with known BRCA mutations were excluded (N = 10).\" This is quite a specifically drawn subset of patients. The BC.org summary mentions that the patients did not receive \"chemotherapy\"; however, the full-length paper refers to patients receiving no \"adjuvant systemic treatment\", a much broader term, which by its plain language could include endocrine therapy (for hormone receptor-positive disease) and HER2-targeted therapy (for HER2-positive disease) in the appropriate cases as well. As noted in the Discussion: \"Almost all of the patients in our study would have received adjuvant anti-hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, and/or Trastuzumab [HERCEPTIN] if they had been treated according to present-day guidelines. This evidently affects the generalizability of our findings to today's clinical practice. Systemic treatment reduces LR [14,22,46\u201347] and may improve survival, especially in young patients who undergo BCT [12]. However, LR rates have decreased over the past decades, and a 10-year LR risk at 2\u20133% has been published [48\u201350]; however, long-term data from this period are lacking. The low 5\u201310-year LR rate seen today would likely reduce the observed survival difference between young patient receiving BCT and mastectomy in the present study.\" To ensure proper understanding of this research, please ask your breast surgeon about the treatments received by these patients, how they might differ from your likely treatment plan (to the extent known at this time), and the implications of that. As always, if this research influences anyone's thinking about surgical choice, be certain to discuss the findings and your thinking about them with your surgeon, to ensure accurate understanding and applicability to your specific case.

Please contact the ordering physician Monday morning to inform him of the second area of concern at 12:00, and ask for guidance about how to ensure (if possible/indicated) that the second lump will also be assessed in the upcoming ultrasound appointment. In light of the reply above, I would add: Please do not waste one second worrying about not having sought immediate medical attention back when you first noticed the lump. (You probably had a lot going on.) While not ideal, many of us can look back with hindsight and realize we could have been more assiduous in adhering to our screening program (in my case) or in reacting to breast changes. Whether timing of diagnosis had any impact on outcome or not cannot be known. All one can do, is to try to do better in the future. I am hoping for clearly benign findings for you on the 7th.
