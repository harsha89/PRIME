Then I started having some white, Thick discharge coming out of the top aureola above the nipple. Also the Pain in my Left Breast has intensified! Plus the hottness in my left breast is constant now. Plus the lymph node under my left armpit is painful! The top part of my left arm is swelling. Plus the lymph node under my neck on the left side is swollen. Plus last night I was having pain in the crease of my armpit. So I called my OB today & they moved my appointment up to Wednesday at 11:15am. The OB nurse said she would give my GYN the information I gave her & if my GYN wants to do anything sooner, her OB nurse will call me. Has anybody else gone through these same symptoms? How did things turn out for you? This not knowing is driving me batty!! ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢",
