I sure hope this isn't how it is going to be after every treatment. How do people get through this...  I am glad some of you are doing well.

From what I have been told this will continue every week until next December (1 year). I would also be concerned about doing a larger dose of this drug because it kind of makes me dizzy.The dizziness usually goes away after about 30 minutes but still a larger dose could make that worse and I drive myself to weekly Herceptin and just have family or friends go with me to my big rounds of all 4 drugs. Hair is kind of odd.I have been noticing more stubble which makes me think it is growing but looking at it I can't tell any difference other than more baby fine white whispy stuff.You are correct I expected it all to fall out but some of it never has.Body hair has thinned but again it hasn't all fallen out.I asked my MO when I can expect hair to grow back and she said 3-6 months are finishing chemo\u2026I had heard as early as 3 weeks after but I guess that isn't correct.Seems very depressing (not to mention hot) to think I could be still wearing hats this summer. UGH! GI issues are out of control and it is almost time for round 4.I didn't seem to get any reprieve this round from the D. Yes, I am meeting with a second Plastic Surgeon tomorrow to talk about BMX.I didn't care for the first one and she didn't seem very confident in her skills.Regular surgeon wants to do surgery 4 weeks after last round of chemo so that is around the end of April.So have to get PS on board and a plan of care.I am terrified of this part of the journey. Yes, I am trying to work full time through this but I am not sure I will be able to if the SEs are worse this next round...",

I noticed a few people mention mouth irritation. I developed this too. If it turns into white patches it is probably thrush. I had this last year with antibiotics for my appendicitis. MO called in Diflucan tablets. Been taking them for two days and have had some improvement. I will be on them for 10 days. Turns out my neutrophils are low and need to take an antibiotic to prevent infection. May also need shots daily as Neulasta isn't doing enough. I am also dehydrated (which explains the extreme fatigue). I honestly thought I was drinking enough but I wasn't eating sodium. Going in for three days of iv fluids. It seemed to help within a few hours yesterday. I now realize how individualized our treatments will have to be. The MO explained that some people breeze through this and others need propped up the whole way. I doesn't matter as long as you come out the other side. It will be time for round 2 (jan 5) soon enough. PS - I figure my hair will fall out just in time for Christmas :-( ",

WBC were also low so I'm avoiding everyone. Round three is scheduled for January 26th and I am dreading it. I am thankful my taste-buds are finally getting back to normal. Two rounds down with four more to go. I am thrilled for everyone that is finishing up their A/C rounds of chemo. Oh how I wish that was my regimen.

It seemed to go okay, which is good since I have to have them every week for a full year. (My cancer is HER2+) Full chemo is TCHP every three weeks. I finally had a good day yesterday and my energy is back up. Hopefully this means the Gravix shots for the low white blood cell are working along with the 3 days of iv fluids. I did have one of those \"oh no\" moments when I saw my Pulmonologist for a regular asthma follow up. I was explaining that over the last few days when I take a deep breath it hurts on the left side of my chest. He immediately became concerned that there might be a blood clot from the port installation surgery and sent me for a ct scan right then. He even called me himself after the test to tell me it was fine and there is no blood clot. Just when you think you are cruising along keeping your emotions and anxiety in check you hit a speed bump. But it all turned out okay. I think there are going to be a lot of speed bumps and I need to work on controlling my reaction to them. My mouth sores are terrible now. The inside of my bottom lip is just raw. It even woke me up in the middle of the night burning. I had been using salt water and baking soda and Biotene mouthwash but it hasn't been helping. I had to call the MO office (again sigh) and they prescribed something called magic mouthwash. Also, a friend mine recommended Biotene gel and Orajel. My vanity now looks like a pharmacy/dental office. However I am determined to get this under control. I will let you know which I find most helpful. Stay strong and fight on girls!",

I have seen my MO after each chemo and complained of the extreme fatigue. She seemed to think it is because my neutrophils are low along with rbc. Last time she checked them the RBCs are not low enough to need an blood infusion. I haven't specifically asked her about lowering my dosage but it might be a conversation I have to have. I live in constant fear that the chemo won't work. I guess that is the tricky mind games that come along with the big \"c\" word. I am so jealous of all of you that are finishing up your a/c!

Had my first chemo yesterday (TCHP) 12/15. I was there from 9:00 to 3:30. It was a very long day but it went pretty smoothly. The nurses were nice and let some of my family stay even though they usually just allow 2 people to each patient. Center was nice and warm which I appreciated. I was surprised by all the pre-drugs before they started on the actual chemo. My only SE's so far seem to be allergy related...runny nose/sneezing, swollen eye lids. I have severe allergies so this isn't to surprising. Will see what happens over the next few days. I have heard days 3 and 4 are the worst. I am working from home today and possibly Monday. I see my MO on Tuesday and get blood work done. Herceptin alone this Thursday and every Thursday for a year. My thoughts are with all of you starting next week. I know I have been very nervous and I am glad to have the first one behind me. Getting a pixie hair cut today so It won't be so traumatic when it starts falling out. I have heard it is about 2 weeks after first treatment. I have a wig that I got styled through a stylist that volunteers with the Cancer Society. I just have been having a hard time getting used to wearing it. It is long and seems uncomfortable. I also got a halo of hair to go under hats and scarves from TLC website. It seems much more comfortable. I will probably stick to it unless I am going to work. I know appearance shouldn't matter so much but it does for me. I work with a lot of professionals who dress up daily so that is probably why I feel so concerned about it at work. One down five more to go.",

I had double mastectomy with 3 lymph nodes removed and expanders placed on may18. My bs filled both about 240 at the time of surgery and I have had 2 fills of 60 since. I am surprised on much this process hurts. I am also having so slow healing at the incision junction. I am worried but so far bs says it is common. Path report came back with good news (the chemo did its job). I had to have a blood transfusion about a week after surgery. Hemoglobin was low. Down to 1 drain from 3. This last one is still putting out 50 a day and I can't understand why. I have already been through chemo so next is radiation. They want to start that in just a few weeks. I'm not sure I will be healed up by then. I'm feeling pressured to get more filled than I think I can handle so I can start radiation. TEs are painful at times.",

He seemed to say that reconstruction is a bigger risk for radiated skin. I was also surprised that radiation after mastectomy decreases the chance of reoccurance from 30% to 5%. Overall the visit was intense and I should have brought someone with me. They gave me a lot of information and I kind of went into overload. Chemo brain I guess.... I have post chemo mri and pet scan on Monday. See the surgeon on Wednesday and hope to get a surgery date. Dizzygirl",

I think she said they would make any adjustments they needed to. Not sure if radiologist oncologist is being overly concerned or not. Ugh...  @Fancynancy5 I also live an hour from my closest family so I understand what you are going through. That being said, I had family come up for each of my 6 tchp chemo session (long day from 9 to 3), and for a few major appointments. I have also had a few co-workers and friends attend appts with me. I also joined a local support group for women with all kinds of cancer and they have been wonderful. The local breast cancer support group is only focused on education and isn't worth going. I am mostly weathering this storm alone but I have proven to be stronger than I ever thought I was. You will likely figure out the same. My advice is to try to find someone to attend major appts like first time seeing oncologist and surgeon because they go over a lot and it is good to have two sets of ears. Today I have my post chemo pet scan and mri and I am going alone. I will get through it but it would be more comforting to have someone with me. I will have family with me for my appt on Wednesday when I know I will hear the results of today's scans.",

I got a 2:45 time slot which isn't ideal but works for me. I can flex my work schedule. The RO again said to use Calendula Oil and Aquaphor twice a day. They also made a mold of my chest which they will use every other day, it somehow concentrates the radiation closer to the skin level. RO explained it as giving him the ability to stop using it as needed if the skin get to red. I have faith in him as he came well recommended. Dizzygirl",

How is everyone else's skin holding up? I have been using Calendula Oil right after the treatment and Aquaphor morning and night. My RO swears by these.

I fell like I am not ready yet, just had surgery on May 18th and still recovering. My TEs are painful. I keep telling myself the sooner I get through it the sooner I can have my exchange surgery. LOL My RO also said no bras. The nurse said cami is okay if not too tight. I invested invested in three strechy camis and a bunch of cotton camis. I also dug out about 5 old t-shirts to wear home to keep from ruining my clothes with the oil. I was told to use Calendula oil twice a day along with Aquaphor. I am considering buying aloe vera as I think the Calendula oil is too itchy. I am nervous and I don't really know what to expect. Dizzygirl ",

Hopefully I am all set! For those of you going through MX, I found that a waitress apron with the pockets in front works great for drains. You can get them on Ebay for about $5.00. It is easy to wash too. I had drains for three weeks the first time so this was a life saver. Also a lanyard and with safety pins works great for showers. I don't anticipate having drains this time but I will have these ready to go just in case. I am doing a lot of physical therapy to keep my ROM after BMX and Rads. I hope this helps in recovery from EX too. Best of Luck! DizzyGirl  ",
