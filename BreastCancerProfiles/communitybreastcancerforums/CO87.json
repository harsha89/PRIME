I'm 22 years old and for a while now I've noticed this dent beneath my nipples, mostly when my arms are raised. It's present on both left and right breasts, and generally seems to be a space between two glands that are side by side. But I really don't know. I've always been very self conscious because my breasts are rather large and because of that bitterness I admit I've rarely done self-exams. To be honest I'm not even sure how to really do them. I've looked up the info but trying to put together how to do the circular motion on such a large breast is beyond me. It just seems to move skin around more than letting me feel anything. Anyway, because of my \"neglect\" so to speak, I'm very concerned now that maybe something's gone undetected. I don't feel any strange lumps, save for what I assume are normal glands and such. My left breast is a bit larger than the right, almost wider, I would say. But no lumps or anything else seem to be the cause of the extra width. Mostly it's just these dents that have me worried, especially after reading some of the stories on here. Unfortunately I can't just go to a doctor because right now I'm out of work and have no health insurance. I'm including photos just out of desperation to hear if this looks familiar to anyone. Left breast: the dent appears as the bruised looking spot just to the right and below the nipple. It is not actually discolored, I'm assuming it's shaded in the photo due to flash and shadows. Right breast: it's a bit harder to see in this photo, but the dent in this breast is actually more pronounced than the one on the left breast. Thoughts? (Edited by Mods to remove pictures.
