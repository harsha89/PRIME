I had just finished 2 biopsies with ultrasound and needed a third with mammogram as it wasn\u2019t detectable on ultrasound. The first two were kind of rough/stressful because I needed heavy compression (due to bleeding) which was no fun. The nurse asked if I was ok to stand up for last one and I said not really so they had me sit in a chair. For me the machine compression was maybe 15 min total but with repositioning in between. Thankfully this one didnt bleed so just steri strips and big plastic covering. I\u2019m not disabled but the whole three biopsy procedure was almost 3 hours total and I would no way have made it without that chair. Before the start of it all I did say to my husband that I wished I could sleep through it all. I don\u2019t know if if sitting would be helpful to you but maybe you could ask if it\u2019s an option. (Btw I was given a pamphlet about core biopsies and there was a picture of the table I think you\u2019re referring to, but my location didn\u2019t seem to use the table.). Good luck, I hope hope you can find a way to get through the biopsy.",

Apparently I was a \u201cbleeder\u201d after 2 biopsy sticks on my side/underarm area and the radiologist had to do some hard compression with an icepack. I was very bruised for about 4 days before it started fading a bit. My 3rd stick was in a different place and very little bleeding. I would have been panicked on my own too. Hoping you get your results soon.",

My instructions were to leave the big bandage on for first shower, then take it off and let water run over but no aggressive washing (not that I was about to do that). I took the big bandage off the next morning and there were steristrips under it along with a big black and blue area. The steri strips were supposed to fall off by themselves, and showers were fine. I finally took them off at about 5 days since they were just barely on. I don\u2019t think water is a problem but of course your doctor/nurse would know best",

Hubby and I had booked a 2 week European river cruise for October before we knew any of this was in store. My oncologist said, \u201cSounds lovely, go,\" when we asked her thoughts. I amworried about committing to a 2 week trip, but I'd also regret canceling if I turned out to be stable in October. We're leaning toward rebooking a 1 week river cruise instead. Tough decision for me, we have to pay or reschedule by mid February. How did you all do in your first year after diagnosis? Any advice for me?!",

I agree that a cruise can be relaxing, with a chance to take it easy if needed. Lovefromphilly, Great too, thatyour travel has gone well. It seems ages ago that we booked this trip, even though it was only July. We were blissfully unaware of what was coming. Parrynd, Your photos are beautiful! I\u2019m sure it was a fabulous time for you all. I understand your plan for scheduling after your scans. I\u2019d feel better doing that too, but the cruises we\u2019re looking into (if we shorten to one week) are usually sold out by that time. Even now, the moderate priced cabins are a bit hard to find. My husband really wanted to try a river cruise so this is partly for him. Is it common to have scans every three months? I\u2019m so thankful that all of you are here and willing to share your experiences. It\u2019s given me a sense that life can still be somewhat normal with some adjustments.",
