My cancer was very aggressive so my treatment plan was chemo first and surgery next. I am not sure if I will need radiation. I will continue Herceptin for the next year year. I recently spoke with a friend who is 6 months ahead of me in her treatment plan and she mentioned Gummi Bears as a new type of implant. Does anyone know about this product?",
