I had a double mastectomy 7 weeks ago (no recon) and the second week after it I started experiencing a strange kind of pain in the upper chest area and armpits. It feels like a bad sunburn being rubbed over with sandpaper. It only happens when clothes rub over it. I feel it is right along the part where the chest binder was. Surgeon said to give it a month as it will most likely go aware. 6 weeks after the pain started it hasn't gotten any better and desensitizing massage hasn't been that helpful. Unfortunately I had to go back to work last week and it has proven excruciating to wear clothes even for a couple of hours (not wearing a bra yet as the pain is worse where the bra straps meet the bra). Doctor has now put me on nerve block medication (Gabapentin), 300 mg at night, not much difference after 3 days of taking it (and not liking the side effects so far). Has anyone experienced this side effect after their surgery (I didn't even know it was a possible side effect, the only nerve damage related issues I was warned about were pangs of pain or zingers while nerves regenerate or die and numbness in part of chest area)? If so, how long did it last? Does it ever get better or go away? Does anyone know of any non-medication remedies for it (my doc said acupuncture might help)?

At this point, I will settle for months if it resolves for me as I don't know how one can go on about daily life with this kind of pain permanently (especially having to go to work every day and also be the caregiver of my mom who is going through breast cancer treatments). Some days I fear this more that I feared a cancer diagnosis itself. Thanks for your tips on wearing the tight clothing. I will give that a try. ",

Did you alternate between textures or you started with the softer ones and moved to more coarse one once the softer ones didn\u2019t cause pain anymore? The surgeon also mentioned acupuncture, I am not sure if anyone has had relief from this kind of problem with acupuncture Anna",

The medication helped, started to see improvement the third week after I started it, but I had to stop it at the end of the 3 week as I had to go for a colonoscopy. The side effects were really bad though (sleepiness, drowsiness, lack of concentration/coordination and worst of all, memory loss), so a week after I stopped it, I still haven't gotten back on it because of them. The sensitivity has come back a few days after I stopped, but not as bad as it was when I started the meds. Doc suggested I go on a lower dose, but I am thinking of just sticking it out for a couple more weeks. I guess patience is the name of the game with this kind of pain (a friend of mine said it took her almost a year for her sensitivity to subside).",

I understand different things will work for different women, but the only way I was able to find some relief has been Neurontin/Gabapentin medication (it is used for epilepsy, but found to help nerve pain). I tried just about everything (as I don\u2019t like to take medication if I can help it and I didn\u2019t like its side effects), but after struggling with the pain for weeks, I decided to give it a try. It has reduced my pain to about 20% of its original intensity and I am hoping to gradually get off of it in the next few months",

I really believe it is helping me (as I stoped it for about a week for a procedure and the pain came back), but if your doctor does prescribe it for you, I suggest starting with the lowest dose (as itcan really make you drowsy). I started with 300mg/day and I couldn\u2019t take the side effects, so I asked the doctor to go on the lowest dose (100 mg) and it has been working for me. It takes at least a couple of weeks for its effect to take place though. My surgeon also suggested acupuncture but I haven\u2019t tried that yet. Hope you get relief any way you can. Hang in there, it seems this does take time to resolve. Happy New Year! May the troubles and worries of 2017 be forever behind! Anna",

I understand what you mean about wearing the bras and prosthetics, I am still not able to wear either. Good thing it is winter and I can wear bulky clothes and loose here in Michigan, but eventually I will need to brave the bras :)",
