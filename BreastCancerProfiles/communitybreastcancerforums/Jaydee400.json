I\u2019ve been reading on this forum for a while and everyone is so supportive and nice so I thought I\u2019d post something about the anxiety I\u2019ve been having about my breast lump that I\u2019ve found. I would like to start out by saying I have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder so finding a lump has made it extremely hard for me to sleep or eat or do hardly anything but think about it. Also, I am pregnant with my first child so maybe hormonal changes are causing these lumps . Anyways,I found the lump and told my doctor who then sent me for an ultrasound on my breast. She called me a couple days later saying that she found two lumps and recommended I get a biopsy to make sure it isn't cancer. I am only 20 years old but I know it isn't impossible to have breast cancer at this age. Bc does run in my family as my mom was diagnosed at only 42. I'm so scared and I don't know how to ease my mind. I have my biopsy next week and am hoping for the best but it's hard because I do have anxiety and think every little thing is a symptom I do have a rash on the same breast and have had pain but am not sure of that from pregnancy or the breast mass. Anyway thank you for listening. I know it may be silly because I'm so young but I didn't have anyone to talk to about it. Bless you all. Log in to post a reply",

I didn't get an ultrasound report at all. They didn't tell me much but to come back in 3 months to keep an eye on it. The radiologist sent all the information to my obgyn who then called me to schedule a biopsy. All I was told was it was highly recommended. Terrifying.",
