Really gives easy to understand information. Answers questions in layman terms-not medical so you have to look up every other word. Make sure you ask for your 'tumor' profile. ER/PR/Her2Neu status. You can also ask for KI63 and Topo II and VEGFR. If it is cancerous that will help the Dr. know what chemotherapy drugs are best. Read up on it and you will feel better and informed. I am doing well. 2 years since my dx. Not sure what age group you are in but I was triple neg. good luck hope this helped with info. psp2pdx",

I haven't had problems with lymphedema. My friend ended up just three months later with the same dx (triple neg idc) same surgeon they removed 18 nodes. all were neg. go figure.......the good news 1 1/2 years out she doesn't have lymphedema either. u have to be careful not get cuts, cat scratches, rose thorns etc. also having your nails done w/o using your own equipment puts u at risk also think the exercises may be important after surgery i found the surgery (segmental wedge resection) fairly easy-childbirth was harder!! good luck diane",

Also it is important to keep you own medical record file. Get copies of each mammo/ct/mri. They now put them on discs. if you don't have one maybe a close friend does. It is so not fair to not give you a heads up. I would let your M.D. know you have suffered from the length of time and information. If they could on;y understand that the anxiety that builds really sets you back mentally, spiritually and emotionally.. I wish the best for you.........been there Diane",
