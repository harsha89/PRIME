After 8 years I started to have back pain and pain in my right hip. It was nothing , only trouble with my back the doctors told me. For two years I was in pain more or less. They gave me painkillers but no scan. Finally I got an x-ray and at that time  I could hardly walk. It was the bc comming back. Mets all over, bones, lungs, liver. I had chemo, radiation and tamoxifen. aredia for my bones. Two years later the mets in lungs and liver was gone. I switched to zometa för my bones and had tamoxifen until 2007.Now Aredimix.Nothing new came up in my bones but last summer I found out I had a brain met. I had radiation for that and the tumor started to shrink. After having mets for 8 years in my hip and pelvis its totaly broken. I can hardly walk and my hip joint? ( sorry not sure if it´s the right word) has moved into my pelvis because its too weak. The doctors don`t know how to do anything about it. Please let me know if you heard about something similar. Áfter all, this is a positive story and I feel healthy and in a good mood but I need surgery . I would be very pleased if someone know anything about  this kind of operation. Thanks, Anna from Sweden",
