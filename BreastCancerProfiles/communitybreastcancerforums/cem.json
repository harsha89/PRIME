My thoughts and prayers are with you.  A bit about the aches and pains.  I'm a year out from treatment (6 months chemo, surg. and radiation) I still get muscle and joint pains so I feel for you.  Especially with your busy lifestyle.  I'm a grandma and when I watch my three grandkids, (7 and 5 year old twins) I'm just wiped out.  Please keep your spirits up.  There is a light at the end of the tunnel. ",
