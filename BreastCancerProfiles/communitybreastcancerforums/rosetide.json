Has anyone had this treatment and did more than 6 rounds? How many did you do? How were your side effects? Did it give you a better result in the long run? I know lots of questions, please answer any that you can, I am beating my head over here trying to decide if I should continue or stop the taxotere, I am uncertain if I am going to be setting myself up for failure with my decision.

My onco said because my bloodwork is great and my physical appearance and overall health is really good. I know he wants to do one now after this treatment to see where we are. He had said that no matter what the results showed we would continue with the tax,hnp regimen? He tells me since I am 42 years old that I should be able to handle more of the tough stuff, he always brings up that he has patients that are in their 60's and 70's that have done this treatment it should be a breeze for me lol! He also knows the first treatment regimen I had was that for Incredible Hulk not a woman! lol! I have yet to meet another person that had my treatment from my first diagnosis. I was treated at MD Anderson in Houston, and that treatment was a doozy! 12 weeks of taxol once a week then 12 weeks of Flourcil, Adriamicin(RED DEVIL) and Chlroymidide?? AND a booster on the 3rd day of Adriamicin! You talk about feeling like your dying! lol! And I was between stage 1 to stage 2! So my onco looks at that and thinks I can handle all this I guess lol! I think what is getting the better of me is the mental game. I have to get my game face on, and it has been tough this time. Stage 4 and hearing you will be in treatment indef is big words to swallow lol! Esp since chemo is literally what I imagine hell to be, a whole bunch of chairs with people hooked up to chemo for all eternity!lol! YIKES! It is a nightmare. But it is doable. That is so reassuring to hear that you are sustained with just herceptin! WOW! That is fantastic to hear! So happy for you! I am going to ask my doc about the meds you mentioned. Have a great day!",

I hated chemo, it was complete torture for me the first time. I am taking herceptin, perjeta, and taxotere right now, I am going on to treatment 6 next week it is given every 21 days. I will say for me it takes 9 days to get where I feel comfortable getting out and about. I also live in Florida where it is extremely hott right now and we are advised not to be out unless you have to. I will tell you it is tough but it is doable! Once you get your head around what is the plan then survivor mode kicks in again. Stay away from negative people! I have had quite a journey this time with this but I take it day to day. Stage 4 is way different then Stage 2, when the doc says treatments forever you think what? there is no way! There is a way, day by day, don't think any further lol! If you want to talk or discuss things please feel free to message me. This is a scary journey and I find myself reaching out on here so that I can find someone that understands what my world is. Hoping you have nice day!  Rosetide:)",

I am going to do one more of the taxotere and that will be 8 in total. I feel that the taxotere is doing a big job with keeping this at bay right now. When I began it was bad, really bad, and after a few treatments it was like a miracle! I could breath, I could take deep breaths. Real air was moving in my lungs not wispy gurgly moist air. The major side effect I have is being tired. I am just so tired. I get spurges of energy but they don't last. I get winded quickly. I need to move more I know but it makes me feel sick. I try to stay still from getting sick then it doesn't allow me to move as much as I should. I eat alot, healthy food. My weight is steady. My bloodwork is great. Mentally though I am checking out of this a bit, I am tired. I am mentally tired. I need a break. The thought of going back in there Friday and having them hook me up again is a nightmare. I will do it. I have no pain. I feel fine except for constant fatigue nausea. I keep it under control with promethazine. I just need to toughen up do one more call it a break, and then see what happens with the HnP pretty much what you have explained and I was picturing the results of excaclty what happened to you from what I gathered from my doc. He wants me to keep pushing forward because he knows that is the heavy hitter. I am just tired. Hope I can do this lol! I have alot more to go, who thought that the very thing I disliked the most in my life would be the thing that I would have to do to keep me alive lol! God has a sense of humor! For sure! lol! I appreciate you taking the time to respond, I will let you know what I decide. God willing I make it to next Friday! lol! Wishing you good health! Positive thoughts, Rosetide:)",

That is very positive to hear that you are on HnP and it is working well for you, I am very happy to hear that and for you! It is Sunday, I am still having the bathroom woes from the last treatment and I have to go back in 5 days for another hit lol! It seems to all melt together now. It is reassuring to hear that I am doing \"well\" to what I could be experiencing lol! This is all some nasty stuff but it is keeping me alive so that is the crazy part lol! Here is to one more of the taxoterrible, that is perfectly put lol!, hoping it does it's job:)",

He is also I think going off my rigourous treatment from the first dx, which I was clueless, I trusted my doctors and they really ran with it. Granted I was clear for 8 years till this came in full swing lol! I would like to find a happy place where I didn't feel like this stuff wasnt eating up my insides, I see what it is doing to my hands on the outside so I can only imagine the inside lol! I feel confident I can complete one more, once I talk to my onc tommorow we will see what he says about my bloodwork and my increasing fatigue. We have a tropical storm coming thru our state my treatment day lol! Maybe God will make the decision for me lol! Will post after treatment with what happens, thank you for your input!

The side effects from the last one was pretty yuck! lol! My nails on my left hand are going to fall off and I was extremely fatigued. I bounced back quicker though and now am having a tough time sleeping lol! I was so tired then went from sleepy, super sleepy, to now I am wide awake lol! I guess it is because my energy is coming back. I have my PET scan on the 29th to see where I stand with everything. I am not looking forward to it at all. I am so use to bad news after scans I don't think I can fool myself anymore lol! Either way, noone is guaranteed tommorow. That is my reality. I am fortunate I am here right now. Whether I have cancer or not I can be taken out of this world at any moment. Also, that God is a good God, He will not forsake me. He has me in His sights. I will be just fine.
