I've done too much googling and research, and think I overdid it: it was good to get tips and lay in supplies but also relentless reading about chemo was probably too much! I feel nauseous and have a headache; can you have anticipatory nausea before you've even gotten the first treatment??!! I had terrible nausea with both pregnancies, so am worried, and also worried about the side effects of the drugs given to deal with side effects!! It is a comfort to hear other people going through this. Has anyone had treatment at MSKCC? Do you know if you are in one big room, or private room?",

I also will be getting Neulasta shots with every cycle: I've read that Claritin can help with bone pain; my oncologist said they neither recommend nor discourage it and that a lot of patient s seems to find that it helped: did anyone do this, and if so, howmuch Claritin and which days? Also, should I chew on ice during the Adriamcycin part? if so, whats the best way to bring it in? Crushed ice in a cup? No port for me, getting geared up for next thursday. Planning to work Friday, then take off monday, back to work Tuesday.",
