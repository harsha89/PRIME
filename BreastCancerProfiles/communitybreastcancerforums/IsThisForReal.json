      "Content": "IsThisForReal wrote: Has anyone ever had a uni-lateral mastectomy shortly after having a lumpectomy?  Is this even an option? The reason I'm wondering is - I had my MRI on the 15th of Dec - it showed no lymph node enlargemnt.  Therefore, I chose to have a lumpectomy done.  The Sx was done on the 30th of Dec and the post op report showed there were several lymph nodes enlarged and suspicious for cancer.  The surgeon called an spoke to my husband as I was at a family Dr. appt, and told my husband there were 2 nodes involved.  What??!!! In 2 weeks...from having the MRI to the Sx...2 nodes became involved?  I find this very distressing as had the MRI shown that I would've chosen a uni lateral mastectomy - not only for the node involvement, but also because the tumor was a grade 3.    So now, although I take sleeping pills, I am not sleeping well, and just feel generally upset and sad all the time. It's not that I WANT to have my breast removed, but I was fully prepared to make that decision if it had moved outside the breast at all.  I believed it was contained to the breast itself.  Now, I worry that since it was a grade 3 tumor and there is node involvement....will I catch it quickly enough if it recurrs??  Because now I have a 1 - 2% higher chance of recurrance!   You thoughts and opinions ladies would be greatly appreciatted. BTW - I see my family dr. tomorrow and am going to discuss this.  I've called the Surgeon's office and asked her to call ME.  I would really liek to discuss this.  Failing that, I've booked an appt. but that won't happen until Feb 4th....
