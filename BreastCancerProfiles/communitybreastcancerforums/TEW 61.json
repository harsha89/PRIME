Im 56, I saw the surgeon on the 16th- Wow - now I'm trying to decide - lump/chemo/radiation or mastectomy/chemo. I'm supposed to be giving my answer this week, but as of today, I still can't make up my mind. First let me give you all some results - invasive ducal carcinoma, stage 1, grade 3, ER+, PR-, HER2+, 2.1cm. I know that statistically the outcome is the same, as far as cancer reoccurrence. At first, I wanted them \"both\" gone, then lumpectomy,then just the right one. Ikeep going back and forth. Please - I need guidance- my head is spinning. I have such a wonderful support system, but none of them know what I'm really going thru",
