I wonder if anyone else finds this. All fresh fruit and veggies taste fine, but nearly everything else doesn't. I have started making clear soups, eating food \"stir fried\" in water, baked non-oily fish in the oven, eaten toast with jam and no butter, and everything tastes better.

At this time I think I probably will continue through it. My needs keep changing. Sometimes I am seeking support, answers, guidance. Other times I feel strong and want to help others feel better. When I am \"well\" I feel guilty about posting too much because so many others are struggling. I tend to just respond to others' posts.

The year after I got back on my bike and worked to get healthy, didn't lose weight but was toned and reasonably fit for a largish old bird. Then I fell off my bike, broke a shoulder, out of action for months. Stage 4 diagnosis happened while still disabled so the weight just went back on plus more. Treatment SEs took away walking and riding but I love swimming so off I went again. From January this year to May, I ate very healthy and calorie controlled food, swam a lot and lost 18kg (lb?) Got back into ALL my per-cancer clothes, felt fantastic. Then in May, another tumour, surgery, radiation, chemo SEs mean I cannot move much due to breathing difficulties. I am determined to keep as much of this weight off as possible, whilst still staying strong and fighting my main enemy and here's why... When cancer came back in May, I felt hopeless, lost and like I had no control over anything. The fact that I could wear anything in my wardrobe and look ok gave me great positive energy and a big smile. I don't want to lose that feeling. I am on steroids again and I am inactive, but I am trying to eat as much healthy food and avoid the junk as much as possible. Look, when we are battling this bugger, it really seems stupid to worry about our weight and how we look, and of course my number one priority is to be here for my family as long as possible, but I also want to live a happy life; not be depressed in my final years. For me to be able to dress reasonably and not feel unattractive makes me feel stronger and happier. I will do what I must to fight cancer and I will do what I can to stay healthy and within a weight range that suits me. Love to all Angela",

Only you can possibly know how you are travelling with treatment, and only you can decide what you will and won't subject your body to. Easier said than done. When people say \"you can do it again\", I interpret that to mean that I can deal with any treatment, put up with all the pain and accept the de-feminization of my once-lovely body, and keep smiling like the soldier I am. People want to believe it will have a happy ending. I understand that, and my guess is that this wish is at the root of many of the stupid things people say to Stage 4 girls (ok not all...some comments are just bizarre!) But that doesn't give them the right to dictate what you do to your body. Sometimes we all need to cut ourselves some slack, be kind to ourselves, make the choices we want to make for our selves, and occasionally tell well meaning people to butt out! Again...easier said than done. Cheers, Angela",

My otherwise fantastic oncologist said that I would not get bone ache, nor loose nails on Abraxane. 2 doses done and the bone ache is incredible. Reading your post, I have just applied dark nail polish as I did on taxotere. Not taking any chances. Thanks for posting. No hair, rotten nails, you're right about losing all semblance of femininity. This stuff better be knocking out the cancer. Love and cheers, Angela",

The first time around I cut my hair in a pixie cut, then when it started coming out in clumps I clippered it and got straight into hats and scarves. The act gave me a sense of control. This time I started with a pixie cut, and have just let it fall gradually. It started to thin after about 3 weeks. Then it started to some out in clumps if I pulled it and when I washed it, but there is still a fair amount hanging in there after 4 weeks. I brush it gently and avoid washing it. It's now too thin to go outside, but I have enough to poke out from under my hats and scarves. All the best Angela",

Feet were sore, but only badly after about the third course, and whenever I had my week off the symptoms went immediately. I had a month break after the 6th course each time to let myself get back to 'normal'. I used Moo Goo which you can get at health food stores and some chemists. It contains milk protein so, although my feet peeled, the skin was always elastic and never cracked. I applied it multiple times a day and wore socks. I vote Xeloda. If it gets too much you can always stop it. Or have breaks. But you have to decide for yourself. I know you haven't had a break from the major chemo like I did, but it honestly was nothing like the side effects from the intensive stuff you've just had. Never easy choices. Cheers, Angela",
