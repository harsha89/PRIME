In general the precautions regarding prevention of lymphedema have not been evidence based.  My search of the literature showed only obesity (high BMI) being a reproducible risk factor followed by age and in some studies infection and injury.  I could not find any data demonstrating that having your blood pressure taken, having an IV placed or having blood drawn from an arm that has undergone axillary surgery will cause lymphedema.  Most of these precautions were suggested by surgeons and not tested. There have been only two studies regarding flying.  One was a questionnaire asking people what triggered their lymphedema.  There were only 173 women who were postmastectomy who answered the questionnaire.  Of these some (at most 22)  felt that flying had triggered their lymphedema.  The other was specifically on 287 women post mastectomy and compared flyers to non flyers and found no difference in the rates of lymphedema.  This data is not enough to make any recommendations regarding compression garments to prevent lymphedema.  (Obviously women with lymphedema may need to use them). Other precautions commonly recommended also should be studied rather than just accepted as true without evidence.  All this being said, I am sorry if my comment appeared flip.  I do think that lymphedema is a serious problem and that we need more research regarding treatment, and prevention.  I have been impressed by some recent papers about looking at lymph drainage from the arm prior to surgery, in order to better plan surgery.  My many years of breast surgery have suggested to me that some women have more lymphatic channels than others congenitally.  If you do a big resection on someone with few channels they will get lymphedema while someone with extensive channels will not.  This hypothesis is now being tested.  I am currently in process of writing the fifth edition of the Breast Book and welcome any input you would like to suggest for the section on lymphedema.  In addition my Foundation is collaborating with the City of Hope and the NCI to launch a study within the Love/Avon Army of Women.  We hope to collect data on a large number of women and follow them over twenty years.  This includes women with breast cancer and will be a perfect opportunity to question women about what precautions they take, what surgery they had etc and see if we can see some patterns regarding lymphedema.  I would love to find the answers to both prevention and treatment.   Again thank you for responding to the blog, and I am very sorry if I did not express myself well.  Sincerely, Susan Love  So if she's going to expand her discussion of LE, shouldn't we help her do it right? ",

There is a mother of a child in my son's class who will probably die before the school year is out from bc.  She has a loving husband, two beautiful children, a charmed life and she has always been a kind and very upbeat person.  Its a crap shoot, a really, really unfair crap shoot.  And while people like that PA want us to search through our lives for that one thing that gave us bc (I thought I was happy, but since I got cancer I must not have been happy), I would much prefer everyone search around for a cure. ",

Truth is my mom was diagnosed with brain cancer last weekend and I am overwhelmed with her care.   I just can't come on in general as much as I have been.  But I suspect I will be asking for advice in the palliative care section down the road.",

I will say that I thought the fact that I am not overweight made me immune from LE and that has obviously turned out not to be the case.  Lesson learned: nothing makes you immune.  It does sound like it helps, though. ",

Breast cancer survival rates have increased dramatically, treatments have become more targeted for the different sub-types of cancer. This is not a wide net. I know lots of women who have gone through breast cancer treatment and most of us have had different protocols and different drugs. There is a theme that runs through these boards -- hit the beast at first with everything you've got so hopefully you never see it again. Its just harder to treat the cancer if it comes back. Perhaps you should go to the moving on section and ask about the long term effects of rads. Most of us would says we have none. Some women report aches and pains down the road.

First of all, if it is a 20 year old study it should be taken with a grain of salt. Radiation in the old days (not that long ago, actually) was less focused, used higher amounts of radiation and was, in general, more dangerous than what they do today. Like everything else, they've gotten better and safer with the treatment. I would guess that the vast majority of women here with mets did everything, everything they possibly could. You can't draw from that fact that radiation doesn't work. For some women, it doesn't work. For most, it does. We can only go with the current state of knowledge and that is that the benefits of radiation outweigh the risks. I know a woman who had multiple positive nodes. She did chemo but chose to forego radiation, against her doctor's recommendation. She now has mets. I'm not saying that this would necessarily happen to you, but it is a cautionary tale.",

What most of us are saying is that you should do everything in your power to be OK, and that includes rads. Something within you isn't accepting the science on this. Your \"intuition\" says rads are bad but the medical knowledge is clear that the benefits far outweigh the risks. You have a locally advanced cancer.

I had one out of three sentinel nodes positive, and therefore the full dissection, 17 nodes, although ultimately I still only had the one positive node.  Recently I went through the very wrenching process of deciding whether or not to have my ovaries removed (I finished 5 years of tamoxifen and was put into chemical menopause via zoladex).  My oncologist thought it very significant that I had a sizeable tumor that only got into one node, that this was important information about the behavior of my particular cancer and that it hadn't behaved aggressively.  As result, he wasn't pushing the oophorectomy and I chose not to have it.  What this meant to me was that the dissection wasn't just a matter of treatment but also of information gathering that was important for treatment.  We may be at the point, or fast approaching it, when this won't be necessary but i was very glad to have this information when I made this important decision. ",

I know these new studies are important and that practices change but we should be careful about definitive statements here because there are nuances and everything is in flux. ",

I'm starting to feel like a freak of nature, like my body isn't built for these things.  Plus my requirements seem to be on the more obscure side (finger stubs, heavy glove, lighter than most sleeves) so i don't seem to have as many options.  Maybe when I see the LE therapist she will reassure me. ",

Then there is a more general kind of palliative care that is solely for comfort and not for treating the cancer itself.  I think this is what Annalemma is referring to.  It can be offered to anyone with any illness and the point is to ameliorate symptoms that cause discomfort.  The confusion here is that sometimes the word palliative is used interchangeably with hospice so we get the impression that palliative care is end of life care, but it isn't necessarily.  People in hospice do receive palliative care but you do not have to be in hospice to receive this kind of palliative care, you can also be in active treatment.",

I should say that I adore my surgeon.  He has been really terrific not only through my original diagnosis and surgery but several scares and biopsies since.  He has shown kindness above and beyond the call of duty..  So I don't want to trash him but I do recognize that this may not be his strong point. ",

She said she had a bilateral mastectomy because she had atypical cells that were \"on their way to becoming DCIS\". Well, she did have the bilateral mastectomy, and we can argue about whether DCIS is cancer, but we don't need to because she didn't have DCIS, she didn't have cancer.

I have been surprisingly happy with the results, and I had a 2.9 cm tumor so i was amazed at how well it looked in the end with my small breasts. The rad onc told me that skin tone does not affect how you will react to rads because it is a different kind of ray than sunlight. Breast size seems to have more of an effect, women who have larger breasts are more uncomfortable. She explained why this is but its been three years and I;ve forgotten. One last thing, many women now are being told to have radiation even with a mastectomy, even with no nodes. You might want to meet with a radiation oncologist now, before you make your decision, to make sure you know what your recommendation will be. He or she can also speak to your concerns about skin tone an breast size and rads.",

First of all, are the flashes very quick bursts or continuous, zig-zaggy things?  If the former, coupled with the blind spots, I would get to an ophthalmologist ASAP to rule out a detached retina (plus I notice you wear glasses.  Nearsightedness can increase risk).  If you are having the continuous zi-zaggy things that come with ocular migraines, I believe it is highly unusual to have it last this long.  Whatever \"it\" is, it sounds like it is getting worse.  You really, really need to call your neurologist and have him check it out.  You've already had a clean MRI so I think the odds are very, very strong that this isn't cancer, but it is something and you need to get it fixed. ",

After LE I always wear a sleeve and glove when I do any kind of exercise, including yoga.  I find that exercise plus garments actually helps me reduce my symptoms.  The lymphatic system has no pump of its own so exercise (controlled and with the garments) helps.  I no longer have the heaviness and aching in my arm that I was having before.  I do still have the sausage finger and sometimes my middle finger -- the expressive one! - swells, but for now at least thats all.  But I should say I have found religion on the subject of LE.  I am very careful about doing everything my LE therapist tells me to do to manage it because I don't want it to get worse. ",

About a year after I finished chemo I developed a disorder called gastroparesis, or slow stomach emptying. Generally the disorder is permanent but for me it lasted about a year and seemed to be a long term side effect of the chemo. I actually threw up several times a week. Fat is more difficult to digest so fatty foods are often a no no for folks with this disorder. A premature feeling of fullness is also a big red flag. This wouldn't explain the smudge on the liver but if it turns out to be b9 (fingers and toes crossed) ask for a stomach emptying test. Gastroparesis is an underdiagnosed disorder and often people walk around with it for a long time before getting the right treatment.",
