I go to see my BS on Tuesday and I'm leaning towards having a BMX. I have 3 ILC tumors on my left breast and a benign papillary neoplasm on my right that is precancerous and they want to remove as well. When I was 15 yrs I had a lymphoblastic lymphoma in my right femur and had almost two years of chemo and two months of rads. Being that I'm 45, this is my second cancer and there is already a precancerous spot on my \"good\" breast is why I'm leaning toward a BMX.  I have a few questions for my BS and many for my PS. I'm wondering if there is anything that you ladies would have wished you'd asked your BS prior to your BMX? Is there something the BS should have done or not done that effected your reconstruction part of this journey? The reconstruction I would choose is TE and implants.  Also, what has been the down time for you ladies after the BMX. Im a hairstylist and I'm trying to get an idea of how to manage my business. I use my upper body all day long. Being self employed it is one more moving part for me in this BC thing. It would be helpful to have an idea of how long I will be out so I can arrange my clients properly.  Any insight would be appreciated!

Coloring and hair cutting isn't quite as labor intensive and I do think that will be easier for me to do. With that being said, it does still require your arms to be up above your chest a lot. I will have to ease my way back into work and work much shorter days. No more 10hr work days for me! I have looked into getting an assistant to help me when I return. Guess I should have been clear about that in my post. Great/informative input and very much appreciated! ",
