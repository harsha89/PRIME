I've gone through the typical hormonals and we talked about staying on Aromasin/Afinitor, moving on to another chemo, or trying 6mg of Estradiol daily. He thinks the timing for the third option is good because I've been on an anti-estrogen drug for a long time so if we give the cancer what it wants (estrogen) it will gorge itself and explode and die. The secondary hope is that the remaining cells may be sensitive to the anti-estrogen drugs again. Goodbye wrinkles...hello libido! I have high hopes this will work for six months or more! I'd be interested in hearing from others who have tried this treatment. Nancy",

After a mast and radiation I was pretty much clean from June until my TMs jumped in Sept. A PET showed mets to the spine in a couple of places (although I had no symptoms, felt great and as you say, had stopped think about cancer 24/7. I started Taxol, Avastin and Zometa in Sept, so I'll be done with the Taxol in March. I'm just now starting to think about \"what's next?\". I think I'll be on the Avastin and Zometa long term, but I'm expecting a chemo break. I think we'll follow things closely with TM tests every couple of months and PETs. My understanding is that my cancer may stay at bay for several years, but I may be kidding myself. My onc was quick to say that he has one similar gal who is 16 years out and one who is 18 years out...and they didn't have the advantages I have early on. He's very positive about my long term prognosis and that really helps my confidence. I have high hopes for many years of high quality of life time! I don't want to look back on this time as my lost years and if I don't have a lot of years left, I sure don't want to waste a day! Like you, I was a lurker on the bc boards during my original treatment, but once I became a stage IV gal and saw all of the support from the wonderful women on the mets board I finally joined and started posting.

It was really hard because none of the nurses and familiar faces went with the new oncology practice. I think I broke out in tears at least once every visit for about three months. Eventually the new faces started looking familiar and relationships grew. My new onc understands that we're looking at a 10 to 20 year plan - with the option of renegotiating. We have nice personal conversations that take up most of the visit and I've gone from extensive bones mets and a few liver mets last summer to NED this month! It's tough at the start, but you never know what a lovely new relationship may be formed. Good luck to you.  Nancy",

I had some tingling in my left hand and toes, but B6 kept in from getting too bad. The Taxol did a bang up job and I was NED after treatment. When my 6 month post chemo PET this Sept. showed a return of mets to the spine we jumped right back in on the Taxol again. I've finished two cycles and although pretty thin, my hair is hanging in there! I'm doing three weeks on and one week off. Feeling just dandy and back to working out four or five days a week.

It's actually about the same weight as the real one, so it helps keep me \"even\" and I avoid back problems. I'm too cheap for fancy mast. bras, so I buy what I've always liked, keep my foob in the little soft bag they supplied and tuck it in the bra. My DS assures me it looks okay (she loves me and will let me know if I look goofy!). The bags are washable and I have a few. I actually have a \"swim foob\" too. I'm in the water a lot and I was afraid I would wreck my foob. The swim version was much cheaper and I don't regret my purchase. I guess you could say, all together, I have a pair and a spare. I have to admit that I bought a size (or 2) too small (because I'm always going to lose weight) and now I sometimes wish I wouldn't have been so vain - or unrealistic. Good luck to you. Nancy",

If you get to the point that Xeloda is your best option, please note that the Coumadin issue can be managed. I'm on Coumadin for a PE too and my numbers jumped like crazy when I first started on Xeloda in late August- from 1.2. to 8.8! We've gotten it under control for the past month or more. I recently was approved for a home PT/INR monitor through my insurance company and I'm looking forward to not having to go in for frequent blood draws. My husband created a wonderful graph that shows when I'm on and off Xeloda, my PT/INR results and the amount of Coumadin I take. The doctor's office actually used it to help figure out how much Coumadin I should take at different times. (He's a retired engineer, so he likes this sort of thing.) I too think you should be able to find a local onc who can work with the distant doc. Good luck to you and your wife. Nancy",

Mine (Principal) does and with her help I just had a PET covered. Two prior during my orginal dx and treatment last year were denied, even after multiple appeals. I started at stage IIIc with a \"hot\" node near the collarbone that showed up on the 1st PET, but they said payment wasn't impacted by the details uncovered. A jump in my TM tests this Sept. led to another PET that showed bone mets to the spine. Maybe the good news of being a stage VI lady is that the insurance companies will cover more dignostic tests, so we can all stay ahead of the curb! My heart goes out to you for the loss of your brother, but please remember, we all have our own path to follow. You have the chance to live many, many productive years with or without your hair.
