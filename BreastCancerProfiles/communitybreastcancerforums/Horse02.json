The surgeon I was referred to initially said lumpectomy  followed by tamoxifen would be my treatment option. But when MRI came back, he totally changed the tone. Because the MRI lit up more area( like about 4cm) and me being small breasted(34B) he said I ought to have a mastectomy. Consulted with two other breast surgeons and all concurred. Long story short, went in surgery not totally willing and ready the day before Thanksgiving. That's when the most challenging part of my life started, more so emotionally and psychologically. The final path result came back with some interesting findings---LCIS, ADH(5cm), PUSH and \"less than 2mm minimal burden of DCIS in a background of ADH\". I am at profound loss of my left breast. When asked if I was over treated, my surgeon was very defensive and suggested i might want to consider having the right side done due to LCIS. Screw him for even suggesting that to justify his own ego. I am coming out of this very much depressed. My only regret is not having my initial path slide reread. Totally could not wrap around my head with less than 2mm minimum ADH/low grade DCIS with a ULM. Just want some support here. My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer at 68 five years ago. My diagnose is strong ER+ and PR+. VAN NUYS score 6. I did have LD flap with no implant.  Dx 7/2013, DCIS, <1cm, Stage 0, Grade 1, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",

I, on the other hand, just wish to have my breast back so badly!!! Life after all is not fair but then who said it should be? Holidays are always tough for me and my son as it's always been just two of us the past 7 years. I am hoping next year will be the shinning year for all of us. Here's to 2014!!",

Yes, hopefully the life changing part will make all of us much stronger in the years to come. Are you pondering any kind of touching up once the dust is settled? I might explore the option of fat grafting in a couple of months if only I can stop worrying and gain some weight. I had LD flap but the reconstructed side sits about one inch higher and half size smaller. I can still fit into my previous bra size but always gives me indentations afterwards:(",

I have, believe it or not read all most all of your posts in the past 2 weeks and I respect and appreciate your input and expertise in DCIS neck of the woods.  You are right, I made the decision based on the info given at the time, 1 from a chief surgical oncologist, 2 from surgeons. And their consensus were mainly from the MRI and needle biopsy reports, and of course me being \"small breasted and lumpectomy would make my breast deformed and plus possible rad\".  I guess I was trying to ask here is: what's the stand of care for extensive ADH? And could ADH easily show on MRI? I did have a very busy left breast as they say. Full of stuff for sure as you could tell from previous post.  I just think this whole DCIS is not just some breast disease, but can be mental illness especially for somebody like me who has OCD tendency to begin with. Really want to move on and concentrate on healing and taking care of my 11 year boy. But I still worry about my perfectly healthy right breast now LCIS is in the picture. It might sound vain but I really think I'd like to preserve my right one as much as I possibly could.",

Or perhaps it's just a term when the pathologist can't decide one way or the other?",
