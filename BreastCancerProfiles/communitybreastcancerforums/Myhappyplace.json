    "Content": "Myhappyplace wrote: hi my sister is 41 and was diagnosed with stage 2 invasive cancer in her right breast and also tested positive for the BRCA1 gene. She's having a double mastectomy next week and knows that she also wants to have reconstruction but is agonizing over the flap or implants. I'm trying to help weigh her options, and figure out the pros and cons of both. I'm also trying to prepare for what she's going to endure over the next few months. I'm not sure what type of treatment she'll need either. How does anyone decide this, it seems so difficult. She has a 7 & 9 yr old and will also opt to have her ovaries removed. Any input would be helpful, thank you. Log in to post a reply",
