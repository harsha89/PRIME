Marywh, Plett is the perfect little town, I can get around everywhere on my 125cc scooter - it's a kind little town where people care about each other.  So cool.   I too have a bucket list - paragliding and sky diving are on the list to do in April, when my son is down here with me, and I have some wild ones on the list, like a trip to California, New York, Toronto and Calgary (& throw Brazil in for good measure).  Can't see me ever having the money for that one, but it mut be on the list. I do wish you could get to Holland, Kristen - I had no vacation time last year - I took it with my sick leave, and I get what you feel when you say you can only get off when you're sick!  If you can get by with 1 month of unpaid leave and get to Holland, you should go.  Nothing worse than one day to say \"I wish I'd done xy or z\". Paul and Sandy, hope the Abraxane will work!  Cancer really does suck!!  When they told me that I had mets to both lungs I also lost hope for a while there.  I felt that they'd given me a death sentence and nothing was important anymore.  That went on for about 5 days, and I was in a very dark place.  Then a friend said something about hope to me and I realised that I'd given up hope.  So I've been working on fostering hope - I don't think we can do this without hope.  I hope you find yours! I'm going to have a bone scan on Friday before chemo, just to check and to have a base line.  Am not too nervous about that - yet!  All these tests and scans bring on a degree of anxiety.",

Did 4 rounds of cytoxan and adriamycin, 25 rads.  Was so sure it was all gone.  At first 3 month check up after end of tx in Jan 2013, they saw something on lung, so had CT scan and fine needle aspiration, and it's mets to both lungs.  So doing 6 months of weekly Taxol now, just did #2 yesterday.  So much easier than previous chemo. It boggles the brain to go from stage 1 to stage 4 in 8 months! I'm living alone, well, also have a crazy black lab youngster and a beautific rescue mixed breed (what we call a pavement special), Chelsea and Sanjay.  They are amazing and keep me going!  I have someone who picks them up 5 days a week and takes them to the beach for an hour, so they are getting all the exercise they need, and that takes the pressure off me.  I just play ball with the youngster in the evening. I'm 58, have a 36 year old son who lives in Israel, eldest sister is in Johannesburg (about 1000 miles away) and my middle sister is in La Jolla, Ca.  My Dad, 91, is also in Johannesburg.  All my family have been down here to see me - even dear old Dad - and we are all getting together up in Joburg at the end of March and my sisters, son and I are going to a private game reserve for 4 nights, where we will celebrate my birthday!  What bliss, game reserve with my 4 best beloved people in the world!!  Then my son will come down for another week with me here at the cape coast.  I live in Plettenberg Bay, which is just a beautiful, gentle little town right on the sea.  I have a great network of friends around me too.  Cannot imagine having to do this on my own!  Got so much hope from reading your posts, thank you all for being here.  This is still very new and unknown territory and I was so terrified at first, but hearing others experiencing the same stuff and understanding cos you've been here, helps so much. I've taken 6 months off work, to just concentrate on getting well.  I'm not symptomatic and feel well, if tired.  So get to the pool to swim 3 times a week, and to the sea also on the weekends more, with a friend.  Go to yoga classes, great for my stress levels!  And I nap every afternoon usually for an hour or so.  I work in a shop and we do embroidery and printing on clothing.  I do some of the sewing, but most of the design work on the computer, which I just love!!  I can still do some design work from home, and am looking around for software so I can do all the digitising of the logos that we send out anyway.  Working from home would be perfect.... Glad to have found you all Love, courage and hope ",

Starting the last 3 chemos on Tuesday - dreading going back after a week break, but really eager to get them done and over.  It is hard, not knowing what will be in 3 months time, impossible to plan much.  They struggle to draw blood from me too - average 3 jabs only though, and no ways I could do it - can't even watch the needle anymore.  5 tries and still no success is hard!  I do have a port and that makes the chemo so easy, but they can only use it for chemo and not for drawing bloodd, something about our small path lab here not having the right equipment, or whatever. My head is a serious swamp - if I dont write something down or put a reminder on my phone, chances are I'll forget it.  I do crossword puzzles, go to French conversation classes and try to keep my mind working, guess it's excercise for the mind! That is a sombre thought, being on some form of treatment for the rest of our lives, or until we say 'no more'.  We are lucky to have so many different chemicals to throw at this monster, but I want qol too!!

Hi Gah, and welcome.  You and I sound similar, they found my lung mets 7 months after my original dx.  Many small nodules in both lungs.  I was asymptomatic.  They have pretty much doubled in size since then, and I get SOB and have random pains, but I'm like you in that I'll do an ostrich - if I don't say anything about it, it won't be there kind of thing.  Not good.  The point is not to be a hero, but to get all the help we need to feel as well as we can.  Re the ovary removal, I thought that is only necessary as a precaution if one has the HER2 gene?  And I so totally agree with SusaninSF - BAH to stats!!! - we are all individuals and would it help to know how long we have? (stupid question, cos I'd LOVE to know how long I have!).   I have to have a femoral hernia repaired - probably early next month, not a big deal but I'm dreading being back in a hospital, even though it wont be an overnight stay.  That's another thing I do - if something is not cancer related in my body I'll not pay too much attention to it! We celebrate a long Easter weekend here - today and Monday are holidays, the sun is shining, I have some energy, have been to yoga so I think I'll have a gentle walk on the beach and then come home and nap in the afternoon.

So no NED, and no stable boy this time dammit!! I'm sorry you (& I) can't carry on with Taxol, it was pretty easy.  I was upset, thinking that the Taxol didn't work, but then I thought that in a way it did, because it kept all those nodules of mine the same size overall for 6 months. My oncologist reckons that if I hadn't of had the Taxol I would not be able to fly to Israel now.  That's scary!! So we talked about other chemos - he seems keen on Carboplatin and Gemzar.  2 weeks on, 2 weeks off, once a week.  Side effects don't look too hectic.  He also mentioned Xeloda, Ixempra and Navelbine I really wanted to just leave everything until January, but the way he talks it doesn't sound like such a bright idea.  I'm still asymptomatic and as long as we can keep these nodules small, the better my qol will be in the long run, he says. What we're going to do is leave everything for 2 months, then have another scan and then decide.  It will be interesting to see what those little critters do when they are left alone with no treatment. I will have to do my homework and find out about the different chemos he mentioned so I can be part of this decision re more chemo.  So I have another 2 months of chemo vacation, yay!! Do you know anything about Eribulin? Feeling a bit numb, was so hoping for better news, but we don't think it's spread anywhere else, but we will do another bone scan before starting chemo anyway.",

Brenda, I'm with you, having my ct scan on the 4th too. I've been thinking that if all those little nodules in my lungs grew while I was still on chemo, then what have they been doing with no treatment for the last 3 months? Good luck, Chanah for the 11th! My last scan was the end of Aug, showed slight progression, and my onc wanted to start new chemo immediately, but I wanted a break, was just so bone tired. So we agreed on another 2 months. So I'm pretty sure the new chemo is on the cards, but I feel much more ready to do it now, I'm stronger because of having the break. I just hope that they didn't grow hugely, I can live with a small progression. But I don't think I have symptoms, yes, I do have shortness of breath at times, but not hectic. No pain that is there all the time. When I breathe in deep I feel pain inside the lung area, but I don't know if that's just me worrying about nothing. Anyway, we will know more on Monday! Then I see my onc on Tuesday to discuss treatment plans. My big sister from Johannesburg is coming down to be with me for the onc appointment, it's so much easier with someone there. She writes everything down, and remembers to ask stuff I'd forget. Not to even mention the moral support!! Glenna, the shower, drying the body, creaming the body and then dressing does me in still! When I was having chemo I had to do it in stages, resting inbetween. I still have to sit down and rest after doing it all!",

There was also a question with me about whether it was a 2nd primary - lung cancer, or bc mets. They come down on the mets dx cos of how the nodules appear (?). Also heard bc mets better than lung cancer. Had last chemo on Friday & am only starting to feel human again today - been able to eat with a bit of appetite, & feel my light coming back on. Did 3 shots of Neupogen Monday, Tues & yesterday. I have discovered a whole new meaning to \"tired\" - felt totally sucked dry - love my sofa! However, this afternoon I'm on the sofa by choice and not because it's too much effort to be other than horizontal!  Plus, I'm listening and allowing my body more leeway. May even put on my gentle yoga dvd & see what I can do, but later! wrsmith, namaste, pls do let us know your bronchoscopy results, and there's nothing wrong with hoping it's benign, am hoping with you!  As GatorGal says, at least you'll know what you're dealing with!  I also had an enlarged lymph node in my lung (showed up on the last ct scan), when I asked what that meant, my onc said it has probably got malignant cells in it. So I asked if that meant it's spreading those malignant cells around my system & he said that at stage 4 it's already spread anyway, and just said we'll keep an eye on it. So I've survived 2 cycles of Gem/Cis, one more cycle & we'll scan again. I can't believe anything could survive this combo! But now I still have a whole week off chemo, big yay! Time to get back walking on the beach. Sorry you have back pain too, Blondie - thank God for good painkillers! The Neupogen does a number on my lower back & hips, which is not nice, using a mix of codeine & anti inflammatory for it. My big question is do you feel better for being off chemo (guess that's a stupid question) but has your qol improved?",

I'm full on with the anti anxiety meds, Debbie - my shrink prescribed them at the dx and I sleep at night (except when full of steroids) and I can work with any anxiety better now, lots of deep breathing helps too!  I also take anti depressants, but have done for many years.  I'll take all the help I can get -  as you say, there is so much in the way of treatment and meds that is available, we should make full use of that. When I asked my onc how much time do I have he said honestly he can't tell me, I'm 3- and it either spread really quickly - (3 months after finishing the initial treatment), or it was always there and was already in my bloodstream somehow as no nodes were affected.  So he says that they measure in days, weeks, months and years and I can look at many months or even years - YIKES, what on earth is he talking about?!  I'm not symptomatic, no pain, no mad coughing.  I do get shortness of breath, but it's just here and there, and I think it's a se from the chemo.  And you talk about months??  No way!  I'm like you, Tree, not feeling particularly bad from treatment - fatigue gets me, but nausea is only 1 day and totally controlled by meds.  I'm up and about, doing the chemo, go to yoga once or twice a week, walk on the beach, have coffee with friends.  I do have a lie down and nap every afternoon for an hour or so.  But I'm enjoying my life and I know this cancer is going to get me, but not yet!!!  And until it does I'm doing stuff that makes me feel good.  Spending more time with loved ones, being more aware of the beauty of nature and how many really kind people there are, feeling the connection.  I'm planning a trip to my son in Israel in September, and I'm am for sure going to do that!! But I also have been putting all my affairs in order, giving my big sister signing powers on my accounts and medical stuff, living will, will, etc etc, so I'm not in a state of denial.  Hey I just got great news, and I know that maybe I'll be in remission, who knows how long till it starts up somewhere else, and sometimes I also imagine these little monsters in my bloodstream, lurking in organs and bones, ready to start growing, again and again, and it's like a war and you run out of ammunition.  But I'm going to enjoy the injection of hope and just allow myself to be happy right now.  I have no power over what is going on in my body, except to do the tx and look after myself, but I do have control over my attitude, and it's not easy to get to the point where I can make that attitude shift from negative to positive, or at least to a place of acceptance.  And it's something I have to try to do over and over again.  And when the sadness, anger and the fear come I acknowledge them, and try to speak to someone or just let it all out here, where you know they'll get you, and just try not to get attached to the fear, anger, sadness and stuck there.  But it's hard.",

It sounds like you live in a little piece of paradise, Justagirl! Debbie, the mindfulness book download sounds interesting, thanks for posting the website - 69 pages is more like what I can handle with this brain!  I did read a book by Brian Weiss (you mentioned him Sarahlou) called Beginning Mindfulness, which I found very practical.  It's only when I'm mindful of what I'm doing in the present moment, that I live in the present.  And there is usually nothing to fear in this moment right now.  We learn to dig deep with this illness, which is not a bad thing. Sarahlou, I'm busy reading Bernie Siegal's book, Life, Medicine, Miracles right now - well, inbetween novels - I really like what he has to say!  Mostly I read fiction tho - it's my best way to just escape.

Teresa, congrats on selling your condo!  Sounds like the move will be a good one, so great to be closer to family.  I also have a fondness for De Nile, hear it's great at this time of the year!!  But it's not really denial, it's just not going there.  I have few illusions (I think) about the crap I'm in, but right now, like you, Debbie, I feel well and am asymptomatic, so I'm choosing to not think ahead (much)! Every hear the saying 'you never get a problem without a gift attached to it'?  I think that is true, if I look hard enough I can see positive things that have come out of the bc.  The biggest one is that I see how I'm really loved by those close to me.  I feel their love at a soul level almost now.  That feels so good, and is also very humbling.  I've become even closer to my 2 wonderful sisters and other family and friends too.  I'm learning to show my vulnerabilities more and can sometimes get to a place where I'm at peace.  That's the good stuff that I try to focus on right now.  The only men in my life, apart from friends, are my son & my Dad.  My Dad has been just great, calling me every other day.  He just wants to know that I'm doing ok.  He did ask me if I would have more chemo if the scan shows progression.  But I can't answer that one right now.  My son also, he's been out here from Israel twice in the past year, we facetime a few times a week.  With Ben, my son, I don't want to go to dark places if not necessary, but it has been necessary.  Sometimes I do tell him of my fears as much as my joys, but don't dwell there.  We've always had an open relationship, he knows my stuff and I know his, I hate to see him sad about me, but he's been so supportive and amazing, I'm so proud of him. Had the last Taxol last Tuesday, scan is scheduled for the 30th and I'll see my onc on the 2nd of Sept.  Trying very hard  NOT to think of that, again, it's not happening right now.  Have also been pretty tearful this last week - finishing chemo is so wierd.  I'm so relieved it's over for now, but also hard not to wonder if it \"worked\".  Felt such an anti-climax finishing chemo - no fanfare, dancing girls or marching band!  Not that I really wanted that either.  I just wanted to cry.  I think I've been really strong and in coping mode for the last 6 months, now it's over I've let go of that, and feel bone weary and quite emotional.  I figure it's ok though, it was time to let some tears out, and let my defences down. Debbie, we'll miss you, but it's worth a try - hope your anxiety does lessen.  I also think of you when I do the breathing! Chanah - you're dancing with the stable boy - that's good news.  It's kind of wierd though isn't it - how these days it's good news if our lung mets just dont grow!  Awww... I'm so lucky to have 2 amazing sisters who will discuss anything - they are not scared to go to worst case scenario.  They have told me that they will make sure I'm comfortable and lack for nothing.  That they respect my wishes not to make it a long, drawn out, painful thing.  And they will be there with me.  I hate having to talk about that, but it needs to be done.  I'm the baby sister and know they will look after me, as they always have.  That's a huge comfort.  Better submit this now before I wipe it out again.  Am eager to get my body moving and improving now that I'm off chemo, sure my emotional state will improve with my physical improving. Thank you all for being here, sharing this journey",

I love him so much and I ache for him - he just can't do enough for me, and has that watchful look over me. The flight went easily - I took wheelchair assistance (& felt silly) just not to have to stand in long queues, & that was a huge help. Adnerb, I also think that there has to be a way out of this, but I've also gotten to a place of more acceptance, even tho I hate the thought of going back onto chemo. My last Taxol was on Aug 6th, the nodules in my lungs shrank during the first 3 months, then grew back again in the next 3 months. But I'm still symptom free. I try not to think of the future and to stay in the present, which is a good time. Getting out of my routine is doing me good, as is being with my boy in some warmer weather! My anxiety is less too. I have what I hope is a trapped nerve (sciatica?) which is painful and of course part of me is saying it's mets to the bone, but I'm staying with the nerve story. Will be having a bone scan in Nov in any case. I'm not going to let a sore back and leg interfere with my vacation! Am really hoping this break will be better than any medicine and the mets will have shrunk again, but know that's unlikely, my onc is sure they will progress without chemo, but we have to have hope, no? In any case, unless they shrink it'll be back to chemo - probably also Carboplatin & Gemzar. But don't want to think about that now. I've been swimming every day, which I love, and tomorrow we're going to have a spa day at a hotel at the Dead Sea - wow, my ex husband organized it, so how's that!! I also stopped working for the 6 months of Taxol, I worked thru 4 months if AC and it was just too exhausting, all my energy went on work and not on healing, I felt. It's hard because no employer will accept that some days I can't be there cos of chemo or ct scans or just feeling wiped out, so I started doing some sewing work with a friend, and I think that's a good start. I do admire those who do work thru tx! Thinking of you all with love",

Brenda, we also couldn't get enough tissue from my lung biopsy to see if it was 3neg too.  My surgeon was querying the whole thing just now,  and suggested maybe this is a second primary - lung cancer.  So I spoke to my onc, who said my surgeon had called him about it.  He says the shape of the cells are very similar to the bc cells and everything points towards bc mets and not a 2nd primary.  But it would be nice to know if the mets are also 3neg.  What is a liquid biopsy?  Had developed a femoral hernia that had to be repaired, so that was done one Wed, with a spinal block, no anaesthetic.  Had to stay overnight but came home yesterday and slept like a log.  So I've got an extra week break from chemo, while this heals, that's a bonus.  It's a lot less sore today, but boy was it painful for that first day!  Anyway, it's not cancer so not a big deal and I'm going to try and listen to instructions for a change and rest up, no yoga or driving for 10 days - 2 weeks.  Ho hum",

I sometimes juice, mainly when I'm not eating fruit or enough veggies, but on the whole I just try to get a variety of food into me. My appetite is also not great, tho I do get days when I'm suddenly hungry. It's like my body wants to make up for eating less, that way I manage to stay at more or less the same weight too. I can't get crazy about feeling I have to eat this or that specifically, I follow my body's messages, & when it calls out for red meat or whatever, I eat that.  But I'm not one to talk, my eating habits have never been very good, even tho Im not a junk food fan at all, & like \"healthy\" food, I'm just an 'erratic eater'. Have heard of the Nutribullet, Brenda, it must be better as you get to keep the fibre, as opposed to juicing. I think attitude does have a lot to do with quality of life. If I feel positive, even tho what they say is not so positive, then my reality right now is good. And so the qol is good, maybe it's living a bit in denial, or never never land, but it does no harm. We are all amazing women facing probably one of the greatest challenges in life - living with a stage iv disease. It's not for sissies!!  Thanks for the reassuring words re Gemzar/Cusplatin, it always helps to hear from someone who's done the same chemo! I can't handle thin or patchy hair, I'll probably shave it then & maybe it'll grow back during the rest of the treatment. I'm also hoping this combo will kick some serious butt! Cathy, how did your appointment with your MO go? Hope you got good news! Susan, Love what you say about looking like hell on paper, but feeling fine - so true! Thanks for a very clear and positive explanation of the lymph nodes. I don't like not understanding things, & you cleared that up!  I'm in awe of you living with extensive mets and still being so positive! Are you on any chemo now, after your rads?",

Had 2nd infusion on Friday - pretty much the same, knocked for 6 the first 3 days (plus I had a migraine yesterday, to add insult to injury), hopefully will start feeling better tomorrow.  My wbc and neutrophils dropped a lot after the first chemo - not enough to put off the 2nd one, but I do have to get my blood tested on Thursday again, (even tho I have no chemo on Friday), just to check they're ok.  The weather's been cold and windy and a bit rainy so I've stayed next to my heater, under a blanket on my couch - so cosy - that's where I am now, and plan to stay here all afternoon!  And I don't feel the least bit guilty about it.  That's a change! Brenda, dammit, I'm sorry about the stuff in your lungs, but thank God the rest of you is clear.  I was also so relieved to know it has just stayed in my lungs and not spread!  Good luck with the Abraxane, I hope it'll be easy on you and hard on those sneaky mets! Carrie, how was your next chemo?n  I really hope you did get them to weigh you again?  Hope you're coping.  I know that because of my blood counts my chemo nurse did check with my onc if he wanted to do the same dose, and he did.  I have 2 weeks off now - and feel I really need it, already!!  This stuff has a kick to it!  Surfdreams, am so sorry to hear of your allergic reaction, and I totally get your reluctance to stop a chemo that's working cos as 3neg we have a smaller arsenal (that I feel like I'm burning through too!).  I'm on Cisplatin, not Carbo, which I read is a bit harder, maybe that's why my se's are harsher.  But who knows, we all react differently, as you know.   Please let us know what you and your team decide to do.  I'm sorry I'm no help on the issue, but hope someone else can be.  In the end, I generally let myself be guided by my onc, but I do like to have all the information before deciding on big things. hugsxxx  CarolSue - the stable boy rocks!!  Long may you hang out with him!!  great news! Welcome wrsmith2x, we're all in more or less the same boat here, hope you find lots of help from the threads.  It is such a shock to hear of progression, especially after a while.  Hang in there, let us know what's happening - there's many of us stage iv metsters (triple neg too) still around and kicking! Wandering, thinking of you and hope your onc can sort out what's worrying him (hate it when my onc is worried, it's scary!!)  Waiting for scans is the pits, so feel free to vent, share fears, laugh, cry, whatever. Keep breathing! Hey GatorGal, yes, the 2 week break has started, still pretty flattened today, but from tomorrow it'll get better.  I'm writing a (short) list of stuff I want to do - finish off crocheting that blanket for my niece, and plant up a bunch of pot plants for my garden, and get a bit of sewing done.  Apart from the planting, the others require little energy, but I've been too tired to even do that!  Geez....... Cathy, how are your side effects from your trial.  I seriously hope it's doing a demolition job on the mets! Blondie - I so respect the courage of your decision to go off chemo, and know it must be a hard one, but you are so right - qol is important.  I can manage 3 crappy days after chemo, but a year in bed with no qol is not living.  You are blessed with so many grandchildren - it must be a huge affair getting all your family together - and in the end, that's what counts for me - my family (& friends), but mostly family.  I have no grandkids (my 38 year old son would love kids but has a problem committing to a woman, or whatever), so I've adopted my sister's kids as my surrogate grandkids and love them so much.  Surround yourself with their love, Blondie, you are one gutsy woman!  When I'm moaning about se, I remind myself that it's my decision to have the tx, and can stop any time.  I'm definately taking a chemo break after this lot!! Time to move into a horizontal position. Hugs all round x",

It was worth trading small progression for the break. Brenda, my onc's thinking is that because the nodules are growing slowly a single agent will be enough and he wants to keep the Gemzar/Carbo for next line treatment. I hear some good results from Xeloda. In any case, we'll scan 2 months into treatment and see if it's working. Had an MRI and it showed NO bone mets (yay!!), but I have degeneration of the vertebrae in my lower and upper spine. Nothing needs to be done about that now, I guess if it gives me more trouble I'll see an orthopod. Now for the exciting news!! My friends took up a collection and have paid for a skydive for me!! So I had to wait for my onc to see the MRI and let me know if it would be ok for me to dive, and he said yes. So I'm hoping to do it next week!

Welcome to the club I also didn't want to join, but these threads have been a great source of info & comfort for me.  I only made my first 3 month checkup when they found my lung mets.  Mine range from 3mm to 12mm, and are \"numerous\", and I've been symptom free, & have enjoyed a year of more good days than bad. Been on a couple of great holidays, sky dived, do yoga & swim a bit. Spending lots of time with family & friends, feeling very loved.  When they first told me I was stage 4 I fell into the black hole for a bit, I took it as a death sentence. But I was wrong, there is hope! It's a hell of a thing to be told, very scary, but there are many different chemos (even for us triple negs) & I just hope you find one that will keep you stable, at the least, for a long time. Feel free to rant here, this is the place to let it all out cos we're in the same boat and understand. Big hugs",

My son is with me at the moment, visiting from Israel, where he lives.  I just love him so much, he's so amazing, he's so patient and loving and communicates and we can laugh together and cry together.  He's doing everything around the house, making me rest up, and we're doing fun stuff too!  Yesterday we went paragliding !!  It was really very very cool - so calm and serene and quiet up in the air.  We did tandem glides over an area on the sea and surrounded by lakes, just so beautiful.  And it was so easy, a couple of steps at lift off and a really easy, gentle landing.  No exertion needed even! Aimee,I'm also 3-,  I started chemo almost immediately after they found my mets - did 6 months of Taxol.  After 3 months I had some regression, but at the end of 6 months all my mets had grown again and there were new nodules in both lungs again too.  But then I took a 3 month break from chemo, which was a bit nerve wracking but let my body recover a bit from the first AC chemo, rads and then the Taxol.  My mets grew while I was off chemo, but not as fast as my onc thought.  What is radio static ablation?  Looked it up on Wikipedia but didn't understand it all.  I think I get the thing about quality rather than quantity.  My onc explained it to me that he wants to get me on chemo that is not going to have too many harsh side effects, but will keep me stable (at the least), so that way I stay pretty much asymptomatic, dont get knocked on my butt from chemo and can still get out and enjoy life.  I've had that with the Xeloda, and am so hoping to continue.  There are side effects and some days I feel pretty crappy, but I have many more good days than bad ones.   My son is 38 now and he's still my little boy but instead of cuddles now we have lots of big hugs.  Enjoy every day that comes along and love those you love well!!",

I absolutely agree about enjoying as much as we can.  My fix is coffee (or tea) out with a friend.  It gets me out of my house and moving.  On those mornings when I get up, sit down and wonder where the energy will come from for the day, I know that if I just get myself up to town I can grab someone for a coffee or a chat or just visit my old workplace and say hello.  I worry that if I stop doing stuff I'll not get going again!  Getting to yoga is also a challenge, but once I'm there I love it.  It's a great form of exercise and it kind of irons my whole body out.  Also that calm after the class is beautiful.  Also I just go into child's pose when tired and rest.   Glenna, it sounds like you live in a really beautiful area, so lovely to have the wildlife around!  I spend as much time outdoors as I can - love the sun (tho it doesn't love me too much anymore), but every afternoon I hit my bed and have at least 1, often 2 hours of sleep.  It doesn't make the fatigue better, but it's so nice.  Then I can go to about 9.30pm before going to bed for the night.  If I don't sleep in the afternoon I'm all done in by 6.30pm!  Also if I get over tired I get all weepy and emotional and feel like I cant cope etc etc.  And yes, it's exactly as you say - I make my bed; sit and rest, have a shower; rest, put cream on; rest, get dressed, rest - but chemo and the cancer will do that.  It sucks tho. I do so envy you having your Mom with you - my Mom passed 4 years ago, and I would just love to have her around still, she was a wonderful woman.  My Dad is still alive (94), but we don't have the same relationship - there's nothing like a Mom. I also sit in my lazy boy and watch TV - I'm a big cricket and rugby fan, but I'll watch anything that makes me laugh, so I do watch some junk, but thank God for lazy boys and TV!!  My attention span is short and I love to read, but it's taking me ages to get through a book these days. I'm lucky that I sleep so well, I sometimes take a sleeping pill, but now that I'm not getting steroids I have no trouble sleeping in the afternoon and then all night too!!  Some of the sleeping may be my escape too. so I need to watch that. The house I've been renting has been sold, so I have 2 months to find a new place and move.  I have 2 dogs and it's not always easy to find rentals where they allow dogs, but I'm sure the Universe has something out there which will be just right for us.  Luckily I have good friends who will help me pack and move.  I've been throwing out stuff and this is a good opportunity to get rid of a lot of junk. My good news is that my latest scan shows I'm still stable (love that stable boy) and there has been no visible spread, so the Xeloda is doing the trick, and I'm so grateful.  I'm pretty much asymptomatic, except for some sob, so as long as I can keep stable my qol should continue to be good. But I do feel like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop, how long can this last?  My onc thinks that we won't get any regression if we haven't had any till now on the current treatment, but I can live with stable!  So I'll continue with the X for another 4 cycles and then scan again.  I have numerous small nodules in both lungs and a couple of bigger ones - 11mm is the biggest though, and they are all contained in the lungs so far, not in the lining. Majister, I agree with Brenda and Ronda about the work.  I wish there was a way you could take time off.  It's hard cos of finances, I understand that.  I worked half days during my first chemo (AC) and felt like any energy I had went into my work and it was too much.  I am very lucky in that my sisters urged me to stop working when I got the stage 4 dx, they and my Dad are helping me financially, which is a little hard to stomach (that I need to be financially supported), but I'm really grateful that I can do this.  I miss my job (I did designing of embroidery and printing jobs on clothing), but I do feel so much less pressure.  Also it was hard when I took time off, not fair on my employer.  I do a bit of sewing from home or at a friends house, hope to make some things that I can sell.  I totally identify with feeling done in by 08h30, it's nasty! I'm up with my sister now, will be going home again on Thursday.  I love to spend time with her family, she has 3 amazing daughters and 5 beautiful grandkids.  They are so alive and smart and funny, but being away from home I find tiring, but wouldn't swop a week of not resting so much but having great times with family. My son has gone home to Israel, he left this morning and I hate saying goodbye to him, but we had a wonderful time together. I celebrated my 60th birthday on Friday - so the good news from the scan was a wonderful birthday present.  I've always said that if I make 60 it'll be a miracle (I was a pretty wild child up to my mid 20's) and that anything over 60 would be a bonus.  So it was a big one, and being the princess I am, I was so totally spoiled!! Hang in there everyone, lets try to find something each day to lift our spirits, each day is so precious.  I so admire you all, such amazing women, I get so much inspiration here, thank you all. hugs  ",

All this talk about grandkids - I'm not sure when my son will get round to finding a good woman, I know he wants to have kids.  So I've adopted my sister's grandkids as my surrogates, and I do love spending time with them.  The eldest is Emma at 7, - when I said her grandad can fix anything, she said to me, 'can he even fix you?'  They are so precious, but live about 1000 km away, so I usually only get there a couple of times a year.  My closest friend has 2 grandkids here, 5 and 3, and we took them to the next town to us today, when I went to see my surgeon.  We had time to kill so we stopped at a park where they had just cut the grass and we ended up throwing the clippings at each other - they are good medicine, as you say.  Also good exercise! CarolSue, such great news from your scan too!  I hope the Herceptin & Perjeta will continue the good work, and not be too hard on your system.  Well done for getting the chemo done.  I seem to live from scan to scan - also have them every 3 months.  Next one coming up at the end of next month.  I guess if we get scanxiety, I also get very scanxious lol!  I get the report e-mailed to me and opening that mail is so scary, I always find I've held my breath.  I've been stable now since November - please God may it continue for a long while.  I really hope your next scan will be more good news! How are you doing, SusaninSF?  I remember how tired I was from radiation - hope that will improve for you.  I also hope that the rads did a lot of damage to those brain mets, when will you know?  I get a very tight chest and/or a feeling of something heavy on my chest.  It seems to happen more often during chemo (am on Xeloda), but you are so right about using your lungs with exercise - I do yoga and walk, that's my exercise - some days just sweeping the floor is exercise enough!!  Agree with you too about the walks with friends, and we're on the sea, so beach walks, even in winter, are always good.  And my lungs feel better for the exercise, gentle as it is!   Brenda, you're back on the Carbo/Gemzar combo aren't you?  How's it going?  Hope it's treating you well and will kick butt for those mets.  It is scary knowing there are 'numerous' nodules all over my lungs (like you) - and my onc reckons that if we didn't get rid of them with Xeloda in the first 4 - 6 cycles, they are probably there to stay, dammit.  Whatever, stable is good. I feel so tired of cancer, I think of it at some stage every day, I'm tired of treatment, tired of having my life revolve around scans, doctors, chemo, side effects, blood tests; tired of side effects and tired of being tired!  I'd love to just be able to shut the door on all of this and just forget about it for a while.  My old life is gone, and I really am struggling to find my feet with this new life.  I think that maybe sometimes God does give us more than we can handle so that we have to learn to surrender and trust.",

Wow, Justagirl, you sound like the little energizer bunny!!  I so get what you mean about getting the chemo look.  Loosing my hair for the 2nd time was horrible, getting that pale, tired look - yuck!  But it is what it is - I used to always keep my head covered when I went out, I didn't want to make others uncomfortable (at least that was my reasoning)  Till I realised that was ridiculous, I am having chemo and am bald, and I'm worrying about it making someone else uncomfortable!!??  I think it was me feeling uncomfortable really, and now I just don't really care much.  You get looks, either sympathy, or just interest, but so what.  The weather has always affected me - there's something called SAD (Seasonal Attitudinal Disorder), google it - so I try and have lots of light where I live and spend lots of time outside in the sun - our winter sun is lovely and gentle.  I have \"numerous\" nodules in both lungs and also don't have any symptoms.  I do get short of breath, but am not sure if that's a SE of Taxol.  Walking and doing yoga dont make me SOB, so that's what I do.  But have been so tired, that I've not done that much walking lately!  I'm glad your hubby is helping you out around the house etc - it probably does him good, cos it's a way he CAN help you.  I started the breathing to control my anxiety - works like a charm.  Now I try to do it often during the day.  I also feel that I need to keep my lungs active and can also hunch over - kind of like a protection of my breast that's no longer there and my lungs.  My sister said to put my shoulders down and back and let the light in my heart shine up and out.  I love that!! Rozann, welcome, and sorry you need to be here, but this site has been such a help to me - family are wonderful, but only someone who has this &@@#** disease can understand what you are going through.  That in itself is a comfort to me.  I don't have to explain myself and then get blank looks.  Browse around, and it will start making sense - I've never been part of anything like this on the net, and it's really user friendly! Gail - shoot, sorry you had to go back to hospital, hope they have drained all the fluid and you are home, or will be soon!  I had a scan after the first 3 months of Taxol (3 weeks on, 1 week off).  And it showed that all my nodules had shrunk to different degrees - am really hoping it'll do the trick for you and give you a break!! I had a lower dose of Taxol last week cos my wbc dropped a lot, and felt much better for it - not so much like I've been hit by a bus!  This is my week off, and I'm sure the blood will be good again for next week's chemo - only 3 more left and I am so wanting to get it all done already!!  Then another scan 3 weeks after the last chemo.  I write that and my stomach just clenches right up, so I try not to think of the scan now. I read somewhere that anyone who has migraines, Taxol makes them come more often?  I have been having 1 or 2 a week lately!!!  Am so looking forward to summer and being able to swim again - swimming is also great for the lungs, plus it's like a moving meditation - you concentrate on the breath and kind of get into a zone, at least I do! Surfdreams & Glenna, don't feel bad for feeling like couch potatoes - I reckon there is a time for that - I've been doing a lot of that and not feeling guilty about it.  I'm having chemo, am so tired I feel like there are weights on my shoulders, so if I move between my chair outside, my chair inside and my bed, so be it, give my body time to rest and not stress.  When I finish chemo, then that will be the time to start doing more, as my body recovers.  I'm not pushing things right now. ",

Have no idea what to expect, so am just trying not to think of it right now.  I'm half brain dead anyway, between chemo and fatigue I think my brain has given up!  I feel I should be dancing with joy that this chemo is coming to an end, but all I can summon up right now is relief!  It's been a long time. Then too, I think, so this chemo comes to an end, but the disease doesn't, it's still there, maybe bigger, smaller, not evident but lurking somewhere else or waiting to grow back.  As you say, the never getting away from the thought of where next? Fatigue also makes me feel down, and am trying not to give in to the urge to climb into my bed and pull the covers over my head!  We're having a bit of a freak heat wave, which is a bonus in my eyes, don't like winter! Sorry you're back in hospital, Gail, hope they'll get your lungs drained and clear and send you home again soon! I hope all you who have colds get better soon - when I got a bug it went to my lungs and I coughed like a steam engine - but my lungs came right again, like 3 weeks later!  It took a while, and I thought also, what is this doing to the cancer, is it the cancer - eek!  But I got through it - it was just so scary how quickly and badly I got sick, with a compromised immune system it happens so fast!",

Have been struggling a bit with depression, difficulty looking after the basics like cooking and showering, or getting up enthusiasm to do anything.  I had a really good talk (and a huge cry) with my closest friend here, and she just listened, no advice, and that did me a lot of good.  So I've been feeling a bit brighter since that.

Am now waiting to hear when the skydive will be - weather has been foul, and he needs 2 bookings for the flight, so I'm waiting for the phone call!! Started Xeloda on Wednesday, so no real se yet. Am on a low dose this week, then if I tolerate it we'll double the dose next week, and go up to full strength in the 2nd cycle. Have had some nausea and tummy ache, but nothing hectic. Had a good chat with my onc on Tuesday. I wanted reassurance that we're hitting these pesky nodules, that keep growing, and new ones keep appearing. And he explained to me that he wants to balance chemo and its se and my quality of life. I'm still feeling well and am asymptomatic, so by using a single agent chemo the se's are less, therefore my qol is better. So I understand that better now. What's the point of knocking me off my feet with hectic chemo and spoiling my good qol that I have now, because that qol won't last. But he's hoping the Xeloda will at least stop the progression, or keep the growth slow, even if it doesn't get the nodules to shrink/disappear. Hope everyone has a good weekend, with easy breathing and lots to smile at!",

I realised it's not a death sentence and that there is always hope. I've had good qol on the whole, and they try and balance the treatment and qol, so I'm trying to just enjoy each day as it comes.

We meet once every couple of months, and it's nice, but I'm the only stage iv there, and it's really here that I found women who are going through the same things that I am. You guys put my feelings into words and give me so much hope! I'm so grateful for this site. Finishing my first week on Xeloda today, am on a low dose and it's been easy, the dose doubles tomorrow, and I say bring it on, lets zap all those bloody nodules that keep growing and keep appearing!",

Good luck - I hope it does the trick! Well, I finally did it - went skydiving on Thursday! What a totally awesome experience, it was a tandem jump and we jumped from 10,000ft, I did have a moment just before we jumped, but as soon as we hit the air, it was amazing. Have no words. Was having a bad day, feeling nauseous, tired, shaky and sorry for myself. I jumped that afternoon and felt like a million bucks after! Big dose of endorphins will do that! I have a juicer, Spirit Blessings, and only use it intermittently. I'm a bad eater at the best of times, so try to just keep eating whatever my body tells me. I get a craving for red meat every now & then, then I eat that, & I'm not much of a red meat eater. Otherwise I've always preferred lots of fruit and veg, fish, not much of a fried food fan. I don't eat junk, but chocolate & ice cream and the odd piece of carrot cake can't be considered as junk! Stirfrys are also good. I get lazy to cook and my appetite is not good, so I ask friends to make me the odd home cooked meal - it always tastes better when someone else cooks, somehow. I do admire you eating an organic, whole and healthy way! We don't do thanksgiving down here, but I love the concept, and am thankful for feeling as 'well' as I do, being able to still swim in the sea and do yoga, and skydive, to still have pretty decent quality of life. I'm also very thankful to family and friends and all their support, and VERY grateful to all the amazing women on these boards, who, without knowing it, have helped me so much!!",

Glad your breathing is also improved Carolsue.  My sob is sporadic, it can come out of nowhere, like I'll run out of breath in the middle of talking.  Stairs do me in.  I think part of it is the chemo, part being out of condition after a long time of treatment.  I also am more aware of my lungs, odd pains, feeling a heaviness on my chest.  Sometimes I feel pain in one particular area, or a general back ache in my lung area, not sure what that's about.  But yoga I can do, even if I come home after and don't move for a few hours!! Jean, I hope the Navebine will kick butt!! (not yours, the cancer's, lol)  Like Brenda says, all improvement is good.   Brenda, when do you start back on chemo?  I really hope it'll do the same as last time! Have been nauseous on this cycle of Xeloda, using lots of Ondansetron!  Also the fatigue gets bad sometimes.  Have been struggling with some depression too, so have changed one of my meds.  Sure the fatigue affects the depression too, been wanting to sleep a LOT, and that's often my escape. Also struggling with a very short attention span - I can't watch even an hour's program on TV without taking a break half way through!  Chemo brain still?

After being on Xeloda and keeping my hair, it feels like I'm going back to 'serious' chemo again now - that's strange, but I guess it's the sitting and getting the infusion at the oncology unit, loosing hair etc - it's so obvious to everyone, whereas with hair people don't know you're on chemo.  Oh well, it could be worse, I'm still feeling well, so am determined to enjoy each day of feeling like that!",

My tastes have changed - I used to be the chili & pickle queen, that's gone, along with avocado, banana, hard cheese, rich ice cream (love frozen yogurt & sorbet) liver (that's the worst). I do use turmeric & cumin & like a touch of coriander, but that's about all the spice I use now.

Had a bad bout of diahorrea on Saturday night, slept most of Sunday.  Went and got Neupogen shot yesterday morning, had a tea with a friend, and spent the rest of the day on the couch.  Had the 2nd Neupogen this morning, so that should set my wbc right now.  Then a lymph drainage massage, divine, now I'm on my couch, resting from my terribly energetic morning!  A bit later a friend is taking me grocery shopping, time to get some berries and good yoghurt, and some other stuff.  I eat such small amounts at a time, so I freeze in little containers, where I can.  Eating is a challenge, have no appetite, plus I have a bad metallic taste in my mouth, which makes everything taste foul.  So will get some plastic forks (god, I hate eating with plastic forks) and more lemon drops for that.  I have a lot of muscle weakness and it's an effort to do stuff, need to rest often.  So going to the shops will be a push, but I will rest up again at home after!  I figure the less I use my muscles the weaker they'll get, and it can get to be a vicious circle.  So I often have to drag out whatever will power I have to get going.. I'm feeling very hopeful that my scan will show at least stable, tho of course I'd like some serious regression.  I've found I've been so bad at predicting the results of my scans, when I've been sure there's been improvement, there's been progression; when I've thought there's been progression I've gotten stable - so I should really give up on trying to guess, but it's hard not to!  Going on my past chemo experiences this should do some good for a while, even if it's 6 months, then there's always been progression despite the chemo.  Maybe this time it'll be different? xxx",

I'm only just past halfway thru this chemo & it's really hit this poor body - I weigh in at 49 kgs, about 108 lbs, really struggling to eat, everything tastes bad or I'm nauseous or my mouth is sore.

I did 6 cycles of Taxol last year & it wasn't nice, and we also scanned after 3 cycles and it had shrank all the nodules in my lungs. So I'm hoping for the same good results for you! Get Neupogen shots the next 2 days, at least it'll get me out of the house cos the nurse at my pharmacy gives them to me.  My pharmacist called me on Sunday, just to ask how I was feeling! I love that man, he's so great. Sometimes I go in & have a cry on his shoulder, or share good news. People are so good to me: I have 3 young guys who, between them, take my dogs running on the beach nearly every day; my best friend comes over each day & makes me smoothies & juices. Other friends cook me meals, drive me around or just come & visit. I really feel so blessed. I'm in contact with my son, 2 sisters & my Dad nearly every day.

I start 6 rounds of Paclitaxel next Friday, weekly x 3, 1 week off for 6 rounds. I'm still in shock and can't believe I've gone from a stage 1 DCIS to stage IV so fast - it's only last year May I was diagnosed with the bc!! I dont know if I'm in the right place on this thread?

OBXK, I so get your feeling like you never want to see a doctor again!  These days even when they take blood for the weekly test before chemo, my body just wants to scream - please dont stick any more needles in me!!  I've never been afraid of needles, but am becoming a real sissy about it.  Of course, we grit our teeth and just do it anyway!  I also have a port, have heard they can give trouble, hope your port replacement goes well. Such amazing, strong women, you are all an inspiration to me.  I had my week off chemo this week and am visiting family, which is so good, we're all very close, but live far from each other!! Debbie, good luck for the MRI!   I had a bone scan last week, which was, thankfully, clear!  It's the first one I've had and they want it for a baseline.  Sending all love and strength",

I did have the best time with my \"boy\" - of 36!!  We didn't get to paraglide, the weather just wasn't right - but I have a friend here who wants to do it with me, so I think we should.  CSMommy, sky diving is also on my list - got to do that! Interesting to see how Ben (my son) wanted to take care of me - he did the cooking and all the washing up, insisted I rest every afternoon and sleep for an hour.  Was so watchful of my well being.  What a sweetie, I'm just mad about him.  He's very down to earth and is a calming influence on me.  The plan is for me to go over to Israel to visit him in September - all being well.  I find it so hard to not be able to plan far ahead.  My winter is mapped out for me around treatment, so far.  After the scan at the end of this month, things may change.... OBXK I'm sorry to hear there was progression shown in your scan, damn this disease, it sucks big time!  I also have a long, intimate relationship with depression, struggling a bit now, lilfe is back to normal and everyone has gone home again.  The bump down to earth after the best vacation.  But the anti depressants I take are keeping me fairly on top of things, meantime, thank God.  Fatigue does not help either - I get all tearful and sad when I get over tired.  I hope you can get the problems with your (4th!) port sorted out! Marywh, I could bend your ear for hours about the game reserve trip - we saw leopard every day but the last, saw lions eating a buffalo they'd brough down, wild dogs taking a bushbuck, elephant, rhino, cheetah, a hyena who got a zebra - huge herds of buffalo, giraffe, hippos, crocodiles, oh you name it - we were so lucky in the game viewing, had really knowledgeable and enthusiastic game rangers, first class accommodation and food, plunge pool at each room, indoor and outdoor showers.  It was just awesome - a once in a lifetime trip!  My 2 sisters and son and I get on so well and we laughed a lot, cried a bit too, which is also ok. Gabpj - know what you mean about happy to be starting chemo to hit those lung mets - I felt exactly the same - never thought I'd be keen to start chemo!  The waiting is the hardest part and there is lots of that.  But once I'm doing something to fight it I feel easier.  Hope the new chemo will continue to be fairly easy.",

Thanks, Karen, chemo becomes a way of life, but sometimes I resent having to plan my life around it.  On the other hand I'm grateful we have chemo to throw at this monster, and more grateful that it is working.  I hate to whine and winge, but it has to come out somewhere - I can't always have the happy face on!  Also true that I'm really still a beginner to chemo, this is only my 2nd lot, so many of us have had so much more.  Just brings it home that we are in this for the long haul.  It's scary but I try not to get stuck there.  The sun is shining again after tons of rain, and that always helps to make things look brighter to me.",

Karen, I drink ensure twice a day at home, my son has just been making small amounts of food for me about 10 times a day!! Stuff like soup is easiest. OMG, the bone mets stories, Stride & Deyla, my biggest fears of the moment in black & white!! Now 1 side of my neck is really painful, sure it's just cos I've been holding my body funny, trying to find comfortable positions. And of course part of my head is saying 'bone mets'... Mary, I'm so sorry you're having a tough time with Gemzar - do hope it becomes easier. Funny how we all react differently to the chemos. And you're still working!!! You're amazing!!! Have been able to enjoy being here more, now that the pain is more controlled. Leaving tomorrow morning early- have to check in at 02h30. Will take pain meds & a sleeping pill when I get on the plane. Land in Johannesburg at 2pm and my sister will fetch me. Her daughter is a physician so she will write me a script for the usual pain pills, these ones make me feel horrible. I may change my flight to go home earlier, will see, just want to be back in my home, to speak to my onc, see my physio, be in my safety zone again. This sucks, I've always been a good traveller. A friend dyed my eyebrows - yay to having them again, then lying here I remembered that I'll be back on chemo soon & will loose all my hair again, and my stomach dropped, it's been really lovely having a chemo break! Am dreading saying goodbye to my son, he has been an absolute star. He will be coming to me for Christmas, so I'll hang on to that! Love & strength all round",

The thought of going back for more chemo makes my stomach knot, (although I'm keen to do it and to hit those nodules and keep things at bay, hopefully). I realise that even though I didn't have bad se from the Taxol, it's still chemo, and the fatigue, vague sickness, steroid highs, aches, headaches, etc etc. I can totally understand someone saying \"no more chemo\". But I'm not ready to do that yet. Working is going well, it's nice to have the energy to do this work, and to come home at 5pm and still have energy to go out for a meal or something in the evening. I've gotten myself involved in co-ordinating a street collection for our local Hospice. Have never done something like this before. It's going to be on Nov 2nd. And on the 1st of Nov we have our annual walk for cancer - it's a 5km walk, and I\"m sure I can do that! Last year it was in the middle of my rads & I helped with the registration, but didn't walk. And I'll be working until the 31st, so I'm keeping myself nice and busy until the scan on the 4th Nov. How are you doing, Karen, any relief from the pain? Thinking of you xxx",

I empathize with the thrush, had it twice now. They put me on an oral antibiotic, Nystatin, which seems to help. Ditto on the lack of appetite, I'd live on mangoes if I could, and frozen yoghurt or gelato.

I'm older, have had a crazy and full life; why take those with young children, it's just not right, so there's a kind of guilt - survivors guilt? Anyone else feel this way?

I know just what you mean about being nervous to run out of chemo options (but it seems to me that we still have quite a few), hopefully the CAF will knock your mets out the park! I did AC last year, and Taxol this year, it does make the time go quickly when I get weekly chemo, but I was happy to have the 3 weeks between chemos with the AC, it was harder. Scan tomorrow morning at sparrow's fart - 07h45 in the next town, 30km away, should hopefully have results by midday...... got butterflies in my tummy. Been feeling like I need a good oiling - all my joints feel rusty and tender and fragile! Every year they have a Plett for Peace thing on the beach, so I'll be going to that this evening, with some friends, have a picnic on the beach and see what's been organised for Peace!! Should be fun tho. I haven't been out to something like that for a while now.

Also relate to the tiredness - I sleep an hour or so in the afternoon and about 9 hours a night.  Spend lots of time just sitting in a comfy chair, watching tv or playing games on my phone.  I do go to 2 yoga classes a week, and try to get walking on the beach a couple of times a week at least.  The rest of everyday life just uses up all my energy.  They say that exercise is good for the fatigue, and I'm always kind of surprised when I can get through the whole yoga class, and it makes me feel so pleased that I could do it! I lost weight last year from chemo, didn't ever put it back on, then lost more from the time I got the stage IV dx - tension, anxiety, no appetite to talk of.  I put on a little during this time I was with my family, but it's going again, I can't seem to keep it on either. Tortoise, I say you need to do whatever is going to make you feel good - don't know that I could face more surgery myself, but that's me - as you say, who knows how long we will be around and we need to do the stuff that makes us feel good NOW!",

I did have the best time with my \"boy\" - of 36!!  We didn't get to paraglide, unfortunately, the weather just wasn't obliging - but I have a friend here who wants to do it with me, so it's still on.  CSMommy, sky diving is also on my list - got to do that! Interesting to see how Ben (my son) wanted to take care of me - he did the cooking and all the washing up, insisted I rest every afternoon and sleep for an hour.  Was so watchful of my well being.  What a sweetie, I'm just mad about him.  He's very down to earth and is a calming influence on me.  The plan is for me to go over to Israel to visit him in September - all being well.  I find it so hard to not be able to plan far ahead.  My winter is mapped out for me around treatment, so far.  After the scan at the end of this month, things may change.... OBXK I'm sorry to hear there was progression shown in your scan, damn this disease, it sucks big time!  I also have a long, intimate relationship with depression, struggling a bit now, (life is back to normal and everyone has gone home again.  The bump down to earth after the best vacation).  But the anti depressants I take are keeping me fairly on top of things, meantime, thank God.  Fatigue does not help either - I get all tearful and sad when I get over tired.  I hope you can get the problems with your (4th!) port sorted out! Marywh, I could bend your ear for hours about the game reserve trip - we saw leopard every day but the last, saw lions eating a buffalo they'd brough down, wild dogs taking a bushbuck, elephant, rhino, cheetah, a hyena who got a zebra - huge herds of buffalo, giraffe, hippos, crocodiles, oh you name it - we were so lucky in the game viewing, had really knowledgeable and enthusiastic game rangers, first class accommodation and food, plunge pool at each room, indoor and outdoor showers.  It was just awesome - a once in a lifetime trip!  My 2 sisters and son and I get on so well and we laughed a lot, cried a bit too, which is also ok. Gabpj - know what you mean about happy to be starting chemo to hit those lung mets - I felt exactly the same - never thought I'd be keen to start chemo!  The waiting is the hardest part and there is lots of that.  But once I'm doing something to fight it I feel easier.  Hope the new chemo will continue to be fairly easy on you.",

Marywh, I'm so sorry to hear about your progression, hope your ekg was ok? Anko66 - the nails, yes.  I've been wearing thick, dark nail polish on hands and toes since I started the Taxol.  My nails are in terrible condition, splitting, cracking and dry, but not lifting off the bed.  I'm also far too woosy to put my hands and feet on ice while having chemo, but the woman who told me about the nail polish did that.  I had a dream last night that one of my nails lifted off, that's wierd.  Ouch, it sounds painful.... Is there anything one can do for the peripheral neuritis?  My toes are worse than my fingers, and the chemo nurses say the only thing they know to try is anti-histamine cream, which hasn't made a difference.  Went to a yoga class this morning and it's my week off chemo, so no steroids, and it was a stretch (literally and figuratively), the steroids give me a physical boost for 2 days.  I also dont like the feeling, especially cos they make my head just go around in circles!  Then I have a busy head and a tired body that thinks it has oodles of energy - just nasty. My wbc was low and they didn't want to give me chemo on Tuesday, but I was keen (what a hero) so they gave me a lower dose.  Well, next time they say my count is too low and they dont want to do chemo I will totally agree with them not to - it knocked me flat for almost a week!  Just having a shower wore me out.

Started coughing and feeling fluey day before yesterday - spent most of yesterday with doctors, x-rays, blood test and ended up at a specialist physician.  It's so cool, I can call my oncology clinic where I'm getting treatment, tell them what's going on and they tell me what to do,.  Have a big lump just come up in my groin, am hoping it's just the infection.  Seeing my onc on Tuesday if my blood count is back up for chemo, he can take a look then.  So am on antibiotics (again) and bed rest.  At one stage they wanted to put me into hospital, but eventually said I can stay in bed at home.  I just hate being in hospitals, they are such lonely places.

I have 6 more infusions of Taxol to go.  It's been easy-ish till now.  They did say it'd be cumulative; have had 12 infusions already, so I shouldn't complain as I've tolerated it really well till now.  I have to say tho, that I'm really tired of all this treatment and this whole cancer story - In July I will have had 9 months of chemo in just over a year,  I feel like this disease snuck up and stole my life from me!  I have no idea of what is \"normal\" in my body anymore - my whole \"normal\" has gone - now it's all side effects and that's the new normal, I guess. It's cold and raining here, I'm in my bed with my electric blanket on and my 2 dogs next to me - so cosy!  And friends will pop in during the day.  So it's not all bad - so happy to be home in my bed and not in hospital!!!",

I'm taking a knocking from this weekly taxol now - each time is harder.  Sometimes I just want to stop it, say \"enough chemo, I can't anymore\", but then at the last scan the nodules had shrunk, so it's doing its job, so I guess it's worth it to press on.  Only 4 more to go, then a scan to see what's happening in my lungs.  But after this lot I am so taking a chemo holiday - my body needs time to rest from chemo, for a good few months!  ",

Had my scan, all the little nodules which had shrank have grown back (only about 1mm bigger than they were before we started the Taxol) and there are a bunch of new, little ones (4mm) so there has been progression and it's goodbye to Taxol. They are all still small and my onc says they are very treatable, plus I'm in pretty good physical shape (??!!) so he wants to start a new chemo immediately and I want 4 months off!  So we settled at 2 months off, then another scan to see what the nodules do with no treatment, and then we'll decide on chemo. I'm willing to give chemo another chance - he's talking about Carboplatin and Gemzar - anyone had that combo?  He also mentioned Xeloda, Ixempra, Navelbine and Eribulin.  How does one ever make a decision about which one to go with, or which combo.  I have to trust my onc (which I do) but am also doing my homework (with help from my sisters who both have medical backgrounds).  It's a difficult one.  In the past, I've just gone with what my onc suggested was best. But meantime I'm on chemo vacation, will be off to Israel in 2 weeks time, will be able to swim there and have some warm weather after the cold winter here!  So looking forward to spending time with my boy (big boy, he's 37). Onc said definately to have a long soak in the Dead Sea!! I'm disappointed and feel still kinda numb, was so hoping for better news and a long chemo break.  And in another way I also kind of feel that this is the way the disease goes, and having progression was always a possibility.  I just get scared when I think of the future.....",

Don't think we took in a fortune, but we did okay. Because of the tummy thing I couldn't do the bc awareness walk on Friday, it was raining and cold and I decided to be a bit wise and just stay in.

You mentioned more fatigue, is there other stuff going on? Apart from having stage iv bc that is! LOL. Sorry, that's a big ghoulish. When I asked my onc his prognosis he said \"months to years\". They go days to weeks, weeks to months, months to years. Was only diagnosed stage 4 end of Jan this year, but they said the mets may have been in my lungs all the time, but so small as to not be visible on x-ray. So do I count from original diagnosis of May last year or Jan this year? Whatever, I'm not going anywhere fast, apart from fatigue and the odd nausea attack out of nowhere, I'm feeling good, so I get a bit sob, but not enough to really bother me. I've always been the one to break the rules, so stats don't really do it for me. I've spent a lifetime making sure I fit no ones' stats, I'm not going to start doing it now!! I'm really just trying to get the most out of each day - conciously find something to really smile (inside & out) about, notice something beautiful, make eye contact and smile at a stranger, etc. But I have my days when I hunker down at home and potter and rest and do very little. TexasCC I'm also on Xeloda (have you gone to the All About Xeloda thread?), just finishing up first cycle tomorrow. So far it's been easy apart from what I mentioned above. It's early days, I know, but Karen's experience is it's very do-able. And look at what we're saying!! \"I could do this chemo forever\" It's bizarre, but I so get it. To have one chemo at a dose that has few se, that will keep me with the stable boy - yes! What a new normal we have! Surfdreams, holding and crossing everything for good scan results. Scanxiety is horrible. I get the lab to e-mail me a copy of my report when they send it to my onc. Once I got the results 3 hours after the scan!, but I get them the same day. I cannot read the end of the book first though!! Tomorrow I see my onc and get the next cycle of Xeloda to take home, it's kinda nice not to be having long IV chemo for a change. How's the Navelbine, Mary - how often do you get it? Hope it's being gentle on your system, and your chest tumors will clear up to show you it's working!",

It'll be interesting to see what the scan shows. I agree with you, Nancy, it's a bit scary, but good. My onc said in the beginning that we'd do chemo with breaks. Was rather hoping for a break cos I was dancing with the stable boy, but that didn't happen. I could cope with small progression, then hit them with new chemo. I told my onc I wanted a break till January, & he was not keen, so we compromised on 2 months more, so it'll be 3 months altogether.",

Marywh, what is the Stage 4 roll call? Debbiej, my onc said that after 3 rounds of Paclitaxol they'll do another CT scan to see if it's working.  They also told me that the mets in the lungs were probably there when I found the lump, but so microscopic that they couldn't be detected.  My question is - why didn't the 1st chemo kill them?  I had a lung x-ray is September when I got a cold during chemo and it was all clear. Snickers, I feel exactly the same - every ache and pain is scary - I've been so tense these past few days that my whole chest was aching - until I eventually took a tranquiliser and it eased.  I'm not symptomatic - the nodules are still small - biggest being about 7mm.  I've been swimming and I went to the pool yesterday and just flew through the water!  It was so easy and felt so good - it reminded me that I'm still physically pretty well, no sob, no coughing.  It was so important to be reminded that I can still do everything I want to, pretty much, so now is the time to do it! Of course, chemo may change that slightly, but I'd like to keep swimming and doing yoga, they have both been so beneficial to me. It is insane just how fast a lot of us went from a low stage to 4 - I was so convinced we had gotten it all, it's so comforting to have this identification and support. Love & thanks to you all",

Karen, so sorry to hear of tour progression, I hope the trial will kick the life out of those mets!! Sherbab, I went from Stage II to IV in 9 months, so I understand how overwhelmed you must feel. Hang in, I hate it, but this does become our new normal. And hear, hear Karen/Kazzie - let's kick cancer's big fat, ugly butt!! So I'm in Israel visiting my son and landed up in the local hospital's ER yesterday - inflamed nerve in my lower back AND Shingles. The stupid part is that I did something to my back during yoga before I left but just ignored it (was so scared it was mets to the bones). Anyway they did an X-ray and said no mets visible. Whew! Am having a bone scan in November anyway. Bad, bad timing, doc told me to have bed rest till I go home. Am so disappointed, but my son says he's quite happy to just hang out with me while I'm flat on my back. It was so painful, no sleep for 3 nights & agony, just cried & cried. And, like all of you, I'm pretty tough!! So, once again, our paragliding plans must be put off, dammit! It's horrible to be so far away from my medical team, just wanted to go home, at first. Ben (my son) is so amazing, cooking for me, waiting on me hand & foot, not letting me do anything. Gosh I love him so much, am so blessed!",

Not sure if that's catching up on missed sleep or escaping in to sleep a bit? I get nervous when I want to sleep so much, it happens when I get depressed. I've been put on a stronger dose of anti depressants, maybe that's what it is. It's hard to plan, you're right Mary & OBXK, in terms of years that's the hardest. And I'm tired of people telling me that they are just as likely as I to drop dead in the next few years. That we all only have right now, but we have kinda been given a death sentence, a very real one, and they haven't. Then I think well, they do have a point though. No one knows how long they'll be here; we have just been forced to look that right in the eye! I know with Christmas coming up, and the whole family will be together in Jhb again (sister from La Jolla, and my son!!) and there will be a moment when I wonder if I'll be here for the next one. It happens on birthdays too, and it's hard to look at that, I just feel so sad at those times, as you say Mary, and we can't dwell! Then we need to plan stuff around chemo too - grab the breaks if and when we can. I've had periods during the last month where I haven't thought about chemo - I've thought about cancer - but not about the coming chemo. And it's been really, really nice. Really nice. I have been on a chemo vacation for the last 2 months, and even though this whole trapped nerve in my back thing took me down, I'm further away from the last chemo and feel better for it. It's been good to have a break. Now I'll be very interested to see what those little nodules did with no treatment. Hope this will be a good / better week for all",

Hope you get the Fentanyl patches soon, I hear they are very effective. Will you be having a ct scan or sonar to see what's happening to your liver? Sending you love, hope the pain improves to where you are comfortable and can eat a bit. How are you sleeping? Mary, sorry to hear about those chest tumors - hope your appointment with your mo goes well. I'm enjoying my time of chemo - I'm working in the afternoons until next Wednesday, which I'm enjoying. Feeling so much better. Just under 2 weeks till I have my scan! Looks like the next chem will be gemzar & carboplatin. It's been good having this break. Thinking of you all with much love",

Alilou, you're going thru so much, big hugs! Welcome Freedomchild, you'll meet some amazing women here. Great advice from Alilou! Sorry you're struggling with the Gemzar, Mary, hope you'll have a good few days. It sounds like you haven't had a chemo break for a long time? I feel unsettled cos if my lung mets were growing during chemo, what are they doing without it?? But, I'm still pleased to have had this break, feel a lot stronger.",
