I have always been extremely healthy, fairly athletic, non smoker, light social drinks...that being said I think that health enabled me to ruise through 12 x taxol, 4 x AC, a double mx, and 28 radiation to the breast. I didn't miss any time for the chemo from work other than the appointments, no time for radiation (although I did have a lot of fatigue). I only missed seven days for my operation. I also rode my bike like crazy, went camping, swimming, etc. Now I go monthly for a Zometa infusion and take a daily Aromasin. I will be scanned at the end of this month to see what might be still hot. What has your treatment been? Feel free to PM me-I try to remember to check that.",

I sent email to a number on them listed on the Breast Cancer Trials site that were for my specs. I am not HER positive so a lot are not suitable. All but one said because I currently don't have measurable disease I can't participate. I am waiting to talk to my surgeon at the end of the month about it. I could even stay on my current treatment regimen. Downside is its in Virginia and I am in NY. Fitz-would you do another trial?",
