Here's a link further discussing the cause of pain as intercostobrachial nerve damage which occurs when surgeon cuts through certain nerves during masectomy which leads to lingering pain. So, after reading this my question is..I guess if the nerves are cut, what's done is done? Once nerves are cut then can't be repaired? Or perhaps, pain is from scar tissue but my pain was pretty immediate after surgery so scars had not formed I presume. General treatment I am hearing for PMPS pain includes Myofascial Release. Spoke with PT who said that acupuncture is fine for those who already have lymphedema. But for those with PMPS and not lymphedema placing acupuncture needles near the sugical area is not a good idea. I pointed out that the two are likely inter-related as per the MD Anderson findings..She just said that she would be hestiant to put needles around the area... The nerve damage during surgery..that's the question...because I am hoping that a switch to the smaller silicone implants with alloderm vs. 530 cc saline I have now will alleviate pain but may be not if the nerves are just damaged...  See link below.

Deeds-It would be great to find out from other ladies about switching from saline to smaller silicone and if this would provide relief. I wonder how to get this info. The PS's I have seen on this issue have said there is no way to know but they never mentioned the intercostbrachial nerve possibly being traumatized. If I just do the switch out and the nerve problem is not addressed than the pain might just persist.  Anne W. who was your PS that understood how to \"untether the nerve from the tissue\"? Again, the first time I heard of it was here. I dont think I have enough skin for a DIEP so was going to do an implant exchange but it is very interesting that you found relief only when the implant was removed. I wonder if I were to have the nerve \"untethered, get scar tissue removed and then do exchange from saline to silicone if that would do it? FogandRoses- Very interested to know what your neuro has to say about nerve issue can be reversed after surgical trauma. I would have addressed this long ago if I knew that this was a possiblity. I think sharing this info on PMPS is very important and agree we have a karmic responsibilty to help thos sisters who have yet to be diagnosed. We have so benefited from all the wonderful women who have gone before us. What I have learned about all of this is that you have a life plan and then life has other ideas and takes you on a different course. No matter how much you want to go with your old plan you have to bend with the wind but also stay firm. Like a tree. It reminds me of those scenes in Forrest Gump when the feather dances around him..in the wind. I think that it was they were trying to say. Life is like a box of choclates..",

I wonder if they know who is leading PMPS in New York. I have done some googling and there doesn't sem to be any one leading the way here. There are Pain Centers but none that specifically mention PMPS. I see that Washington State has recognized this big time..not finding anything comprable in NY.",

It's the iron bra thing. Was wondering what meds you have found helpful. Read through all the posts and still a bit confused. PM me if you can please..Going for a revision but would like to make a decision based on odds of finding relief. No tingling or sensitivity...just like to canon balls on my chest and extreme soreness at pec muscles. Especially would like to know what \"nerve trauma\" feels like? Love, Jessica ",
