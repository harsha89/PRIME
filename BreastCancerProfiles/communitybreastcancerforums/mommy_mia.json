I have had similar issues recently with my onc. and I'm also wondering how to switch oncologists.  The bottom line is that he doesn't look at my chart or know the specifics about me when we meet, which results in him giving me the WRONG information until I correct him.  I recently asked him when I was to have another CT-scan and bone scan.  He told me I didn't need one, that was just a precaution at the beginning.  When I reminded him that there was a 1 cm spot on my lung and abnormal cells on my rib, then he said \"oh right\", and I now have new scans scheduled.  There have been a few other incidents too and I'm not comfortable with him. I have to change cancer centres when I begin my radiation, so I'm going to ask if I can also have my herceptin treatments at the other cancer centre...and also change my onc. at the same time.  Not sure if it will work, but that's the approach I'm going to try to take. Good luck to you and remember, you are in charge! Mia",

I'm stage 3, HER2 positive, ER/PR negative, lymph nodes \"fully involved\".  I had a lumpectomy and sentinal lymph nodes removed on Oct. 10th.   I will have more surgery but the oncologist says that the chemo is the first priority since there is a 70% chance of this spreading based on the pathology. I'm 39 years old and terrified to leave my children and my husband.  This website has been wonderful to learn more and read about other women's experiences.  It's been great for those times in between appointments while you are expected to wait for answers. Is anyone else ER/PR negative?  My chemo will be FEC followed by Taxol, then eventually Herceptin.  Does anyone have any experience with this combo?",

Grief, big or small, has 5 stages.  I learned this in a course I took at work many years ago, and it has been so true.  The acronym is SARAH (Shock, Anger, Regret, Acceptance, Hope). For me, it was important to learn as much as I could about what my pathology meant.  Although it was hard to read stats...they are down right scary, I had to read them. I guess this was part of the acceptance.  Every darn thing I read was bad news.  So many people were telling me stories about someone they knew that was \"just fine\" and I was polite, but I did't want to hear it.  In my mind, they didn't have the same dx, but I couldn't bring myself to tell all of these people how scared I was.  It kind of made me angry. Once I learned as much as I could, I finally felt like I could focus on being in that percentage of survivors, no matter how small it was. Don't get me wrong, I still have my moments.  This is overwhelming.  I think we will go through all of these stage of grief multiple times. Knowledge is power and this SARAH thing has helped me to understand some of my feelings and at least know that I will feel better, even when I'm down. Hope it helps... Mia",

Do you have a place there where they offer support?  We have a place here called \"Wellspring\" and it offers programs, support groups, yoga, tai chi, mentors, etc.  It would be good to have a person you can talk to who has walked this road.  It's hard to go to these places sometimes, but it will really help you get through the worst times. Try to rest and call that doctor in the morning.",

Sorry I haven't posted in a while...and very sorry that so many of us are having a tough time.  I just love everyone's photos.  What a gorgeous group we have here! Karyl & Ula, if it helps at all, I think the taxotere is a pretty hard one to take.  My first taxotere was rough on me too.  I was great for the first 3 days (while I was still on steroids), then I crashed and literally couldn't get out of bed for a few days.  With the taxotere, it felt like there wasn't room in my body for all my organs (stomach, gallblader, intestines, liver).  Like they were screaming in pain and I couldn't get comfortable no matter what position.  Literally like there was no room inside me for everything and it was all trying to fit into place, but didn't. Also, I wanted to tell you about something I've found that's coincidence, but strange.  It's about gallbladder and breast cancer. Before I was diagnosed with breast cancer, I was having A LOT of pain on my right side behind my ribs.  Up at night in tears kind of pain.  Every time I ate, pain came back.  Doctor told me likely gallbladder and sent me for ultrasound...which did not show gallstones, but I was still in pain.  After a couple of months of this, he sent me to a surgeon for more ultrasound and to discuss removing my gallbladder.  My appointment with the surgeon which was actually to discuss my gallbladder became a discussion about my biopsey and breast cancer and how quickly he could get me in to remove the lump. Since then, I have met SEVERAL women with a common denominator of gallbladder problems and bc.  A girl who worked for me and was diagnosed 1 year before me had her gallbladder out about 1 year before bc diagnosis.  Another girl that was sitting across from me at my last chemo was telling the nurse that she was really seeing a surgeon to have her gallbladder removed and it was during the pre-surgery physical they found the lump/bc.  And there are others with similar stories that I have heard. I don't know what it means, but it does seem too much to be a simply coincidence.  Since your gallbladder is involved in processing/removing waste from your body, I wonder if it has something to do with trying to remove the cancer cells.  Or reacting to the fact that there is something BAD in your body. I think I preferred the nauseau of the FEC to the pain that the Taxotere caused.  And I still have to more to go...I'm DREADING Monday, Jan. 28th.  I'm normally a very strong person and I honestly feel like playing hooky and not going on Monday.  Of course, I will...but the thought keeps lurking in my mind.  The smell of that place...drugs mixed with beef barley soup that they are serving for lunch...ugh!  I can't do it...oh ya, have to do it. Karyl - you are in my thoughts.  I just know that everything will be ok when you find out your results.  Just a few more days.  It does seem that taxotere is hard on the digestive system so that has to be what it is. Hugs to all, Mia",

Karen & Ulla - I'm so happy for you that chemo is done!!!  I'll join you guys after my last treatment on Feb. 19th.  It was supposed to be the 18th, but we have a new holiday here in Ontario Canada (Family Day) and the onc clinic is closed.  Oh well, just a 1 day delay.  But I've had Feb. 18th circled on the calendar for so long! Had my 5th round on Monday this week and still feeling ok...steriods seem to help (and I didn't have them with my first 3 treatments of FEC...only with the Taxotere).  Although I gained 5 lbs in the 3 weeks since my last treatment.  Nothing tastes good, so I don't think I'm eating that much.  Guess it's the steriods.  Hoping it won't mean 5 lbs with each...that will be 15 lbs. Karen - good luck on your CAT scan tomorrow.  I had one yesterday to follow up on a lump on my lung that they found before I started chemo.  Test itself is nothing compared to all of the other stuff you've been through...now lets hope that the results are just as \"uneventful\"!!! I'm also scheduled to have preparation for Rads on March 4th, and I think I will start the actual radiation treatment on March 18th (every day for 6 weeks)...seems like a lot, but should be a breeze compared to chemo, right?  I'll be starting Herceptin for a year around the same time, too. Love you guys...hope everyone is having a few good moments in there somewhere. Mia",
