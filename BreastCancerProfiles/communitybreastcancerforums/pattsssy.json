What does 4 mm nodule posteriorly and medially in the left TRAM flap reconstruction, it may be summation of parenchyma artifact, nevertheless, further evaluation with additonal mammographic views and ultrasound.  I have appt. in a week and I am very anxious.  Not sure what all this means.  I have been cancer free for 9 years.  It doesn't describe what nodule looks like.  Where is the location of the nodule.  On chest and middle?
