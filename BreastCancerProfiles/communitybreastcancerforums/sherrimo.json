I am hoping to be done at least with all the chemo by late August when we move our daughter into college.  My docs have been great about trying to schedule things around her high school graduation and party.  Hang in their girls, we'll get through this together!!  Sherri",

I told her to go ahead and talk to them because I don't want them freaking out when all of a sudden I start wearing hats and scarves to school. I have a wig but I know they will notice that too. I had one kid ask me how my hip surgery went. We got a kick out of that. Some of them aren't quite as savvy as others. I work in a Catholic school and they have been praying daily for me as a special intention. She asked if it would be ok once she talks to the kids to pray for me by name. I said that was ok too.
