And, silly me, I've been trying to avoid Dr. Google so much that I never bothered to see where other lymph nodes in the arm are until today, so I feel a bit ignorant.  It looks as though there is a chain of lymph nodes right where I'm experiencing the pain & lumps.  Can the cancer spread down the arm through lymph nodes?--stupid question! I know it can go anywhere it wants!--I honestly hadn't even thought of the arm as a possible site for recurrence before because I haven't really heard of that.  Plus, after surgery, chemo & radiation to the axilla, etc. I didn't think the rest of the arm was anything to worry about. At first I thought it might be lymphadema, though I wear my ugly sleeves and hand gauntlets all the time & I just had my physical therapist measure me because I was concerned & she said there is no change in size--and I've only experienced minor swelling in the upper arm, not in the forearm, all along.  And when I went for my Herceptin, the nurses at the hospital said they saw no signs of infection but could feel the lumps. Has anyone else experienced anything similar?  I hate to run paranoid to my onco to ask for some kind of testing if it's nothing, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried...

It is no wonder you feel uncertain.  It is a huge decision.  And no matter how prepared you think you may be to make a decision like this before you are faced with it, it is still different when you actually have such an unimaginable choice looming before you.  On the one hand, you feel like you are doing 'everything you can' when you remove the whole breast, but, on the other hand, it is not a simple surgery and I think a lot of doctors downplay it's significance.  Not an easy choice.  I think CoolBreeze's post is terrific--lots of honest information there...   I had a bilateral mx and was not given a choice, but, honestly, I was almost grateful to not have to be forced to make that decision.  I was struggling with the decision before all of the facts were in and before I met with my surgeon.  So when he actually sat down with me and told me there wasn't a choice, I felt relieved more than anything else.  So I certainly feel for you--especially because I know what it feels like to want to go with your gut on major decisions like these, but to feel like you don't know what your gut is telling you.    But I have to say that, maybe I'm wrong, but it almost sounds like your gut feeling may have come in through your last post...  It sounds like you trust your surgeon, and if she feels like there is no danger in waiting a few weeks to get all of the biopsies back, then perhaps going this route will give you the answers you need to feel more at peace with your choice.  It is such a big and difficult decision to have to make that it would probably give you a bit more confidence if you go forward with the biopsies and have a more complete picture of what is happening in your breast before you decide between lumpectomy and mastectomy. I think that whatever decision you make will be the right one for you...  One of the most important things I've learned in this process is that once I go through with a decision, I have to accept that it was the right decision for me and not spend any time or energy (easier said than done, I know!) rehashing the decision or wondering if I made the right choice.  To not rehash or second guess myself completely contradicts my nature!, but I find that it does help me feel less anxious about my choices and really helps with that 'stomache tied in a knot' feeling.  I'm sorry you are being faced with this decision...  You've come to the right place, though.  Please feel free to lean on all of us for support!  Sending warm thoughts... ",

I had a bilateral MX without reconstruction -- no choice. It was followed by radiation, chemo, herceptin, etc. anyway. The cancer was so extensive on the left side that it was initially inoperable. I had dose dense chemo to shrink it so that surgery would be possible. I had chest wall invasion, spread to my axillary and supraclavicular nodes, etc. so the left side was a pretty extensive surgery -- he took as much as he possibly could, including as much skin because they believed it had spread to the skin. I still suffer from severe pain on the left side and had many complications with swelling and seromas. I developed lymphedema on the left side. And the LE has made me prone to cellulitis and systemic infections (requiring multiple hospitalizations). I saw a physical therapist for a year to try to get some of my range of motion back, but just couldn't continue because I got so tired of it all -- my ROM is pretty limited still. That said, my right-sided mastectomy was a breeze in comparison. Though the skin is tight, I do not have the nerve pain, swelling and tightness that plague me on the left side -- or I don't notice it. I wish that the left had been so easy! I hope this is helpful and doesn't complicate your view. And I must add that I have to agree with INDENIAL. I felt completely unprepared for what happened to my left side. The right, no problem. But the left... Best wishes...",

      "Content": "Jun 29, 2013 01:07AM - edited Jun 29, 2013 01:11AM by mom2twins34 Georgie, I had by bilateral mastectomy with no reconstruction almost 3 years ago at the age of 34.  My surgeon wouldn't even entertain the idea of reconstruction at the time, so it wasn't a decision I had to make then.  More recently he gave his half-hearted approval if I want to pursue it, so I am considering it, but given my propensity toward systemic infections (I'm sorry that you are also infection-prone!) and given the work it would take on my left side (I had chest wall invasion, etc. so the plan for that side would be pretty intense), I am not sure I will ever go through with it.   That said, if the last two factors weren't an issue, I think I probably would, simply because there are times when I really do miss the idea of having breasts and do feel less womanly (mostly just with my husband -- I think his attitude is rubbing off on me!) and because seeing my chest is a reminder of what this disease has taken from me (only when I stop to think about it, which really isn't that often). But it's nothing I can't live with.  I'm sure that from what I just wrote it probably sounds like I am not very accepting of my new body and that it has been very difficult for me.  To be honest, though, no one in my life would even guess that I have these feelings on any level.  The only time I ever wear my prosthetics is with a bathing suit.  And I never talk about it, so everyone just assumes that I have completely accepted life as a breastless woman.   And I'd say that I pretty much have.  I'm sure I will always feel a sense of loss, but it doesn't keep me up at night.  I would never have chosen to be breastless.  But now that I am, I just accept it as a trade-off for life, I suppose.  And I'm not sure I am willing to accept the risks of the surgery.  Maybe one day.  Or maybe never.  For now, I'm \"okay\" with how things are.   I know it is such a personal decision.  And it's hard to know how we are going to feel.  I realize that you already have experience with this because of what you've been through.  Even still, it is such a big decision, so try to be kind to yourself as you make it.  I'm sure that whatever you choose will be the right decision.

Thanks, girls!",

How long have you been having problems?  Mine started in March.  I was still getting radiation, so I showed it to my radiation oncologist first--actually, he saw it when he walked into the room--because I figured maybe the radiation was causing it (I was getting radiation near the area for positive supraclavicular nodes).  But he told me that radiation didn't do it and sent me down the hall to my medical oncologist--who immediately sent me off for an ultrasound because he was worried about a jugular clot!  It wasn't a clot, but that was the end of the diagnostics.  I asked if it was LE and they told me what they told you, it goes down, not up.  So I still have swelling in my neck 6 months later & no one seems too concerned--except me every few weeks when I worry that it's cancer in the middle of the night!  :-)  I haven't heard the \"throat infection\" reason yet, though I've been on antibiotics for other things a number of times since the swelling started and they haven't affected my neck size, so I'm curious to see whether the antibiotics work for you.  I'm personally leaning toward LE as the reason--sounds like you're not convinced it's not that, too.  Seems like too much of a coincidence that we both have it only on the BC side!  I certainly get your frustration!!!   :-) I'll let you know how my appt. goes.  I called the onc today to ask him about the arm & they said \"you know you have an appt. tomorrow, right?\"  I had completely forgotten, so I guess I'll be able to ask him in person! Thank you--so nice to talk to people who understand...",

(I am going to ask the surgeon what he thinks while I'm there, though)...  It sounds like my swelling is pretty much in the same place you are having the pulling/burning sensations, jenny...  I really hope you do bring your neck symptoms up to your onc and that you are able to find a good LE specialist.  I certainly understand your feeling of being freaked out because there are LN there...  This can all be so scary... Sending you good thoughts...  Good night!  ",

The only thing I can think to suggest is to talk to the doctor who ordered the PET and see if there is anything he/she can do to make this happen.  Or, whenever I have an issue with insurance, I talk to the social workers at my cancer center and the hospital--the doctors and SWs always seem to be able to do more than I can as the patient. I am so sorry that you are going through this.  It's bad enough to have cancer, but to not be able to get the things you need medically because of insurance is just horribly wrong...  Thinking of you...  ",
