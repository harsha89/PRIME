I would not have changed my mind about what was best for me.  Again I think a choice is exactly what we needs and this is clearly not one option fits everyone.  It is a hard decision particularly because you do feel rushed to get the cancer out and treatment started.  My successful reconstruction was relatively easy.  Had I not been so scared and really had looked into the qualification of my original PS my first attempt may have been successful also.   My best lesson learned is that I certainly have become a more saavy and assertive medical consumer which for me has been very helpful.",

Although I am having very little problems currently and have been able to forego sleeves and things without exacerbation and only my tolerable baseline swelling, I feel very uncomfortable wearing compression garments to work. I do believe my coworkers feel intimidated by my wearing them hence one of the reasons I stopped (but to clarify, I have not had an increase in symptoms either). As Pat has said in the past, it is impossible to use a compression glove while working in a clinical setting. Without the glove and only sleeve, my hand looks like a rubber glove someone tried to blow up halfway. I have been very fortunate that I have not had any sequela from foregoing the standard compression. I do wear it for hiking, flying and more strenuous exercise.",

Provigil was not designed for cancer patients, it is used mainly to treat people with narcolepsy. It has some troublesome side effects. In a clinical trial, 74 of the 934 patients (8%) who received PROVIGIL dropped out compared to 3% of patients that received placebo. The most frequent reasons for stopping Provigil were headache, nausea, anxiety, dizziness, insomnia, chest pain and nervousness.",
