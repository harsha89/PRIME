Spots are still red. When I had 2nd set of lumpectomies, they used a moleskin thick compression type bandage on the rt side since it was more extensive but even though I told then about the waterproof tape they used it on the left and it got several large blisters..just hope it doesn't mess up chances for reconstruction when I have BMX next month? The heavy moleskin did not cause blistering. But for folks worrying about lumpectomies I only used one pain pill and had very little pain afterward. I did not have general anesthesia just the twilight kind so no horrible side effects from that. I did have some leakage two weeks out on first surgery. Gave me antibiotic and had me do hot compresses. No problems so far with 2nd round. Congrats to all that have posted that have gotten good news. Mine continues to be stage 0 even though there were too many spots. If SNBs are clear and no invasive when they do pathology from BMX then I won't need chemo, radiation or hormones. I am REALLY hoping for that!!",

I spoke with around 20 women before I decided and got great input including questions to ask MD, so if you have questions about anything, please PM me or e-mail MiamiU72@aol.com and put cancer question as subject.",

If anyone wants details of my journey you can access my posts or feel free to call 203-792-0208.  I talked to so many prior to making decisions and afterwards as well.  It helps to have support!!  Good luck all.  I am SO happy I went the way I did...feel good, \"girls\" look great and cancer is thankfully gone. PS...take those laxatives after surgery even if you think you don't need them....or you will regret it!  Prune juice as well.  Those narcotics really play havoc with your systems!!",
