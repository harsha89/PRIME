Now just did my post surgery blood work and the number is up to 52. MO ordered PET scan for next week ( even though he refused to give me one initially when I asked for one to have one to use just a baseline because he said it wasn't protocol\u2026 then as soon as he got my blood work he was like oh yes, let's get one next week..this rising number is a mystery...) I'm terrified now that I am already stage four rather than being stage 2a as they told me upon diagnosis and after my BMX. It's worthy to note that I am premenopausal and I do understand that this test is not as reliable in premenopausal women and can Also rise from benign conditions ( however seems some of the benign conditions would've shown up on my initial CAT scan?) all my other bloodwork looks totally normal... I was wondering how many of you guys were in the same situation with the rising CA 125 before you were diagnosed with mets? Thanks for sharing, I appreciate it.

The largest tumor is 2.1 CM. I am planning Mastectomy and am not sure what systemic treatment protocol they will recommend yet but, I'm assuming it will be the traditional radiation chemo and hormone therapy even with Mastectomy. I'm 47. As someone who has rarely been sick other than a minor cold and typically never takes medicines all these chemicals are scaring the hell out of me as I'm sure they did all of you as well. Did anyone out there skip one or part of the traditional treatment protocol and feel fine about doing that? Anyone regret treatments that they received? Anyone feel they would've done things differently had I had more time to research? I read a study last night that said 20 to 40% of all early-stage cancer will metastasize no matter what treatment you throw at them, no matter how aggressive which does not make me feel good about putting my body through that hell with those kind of odds I would love your thoughts;) Everything is more beautiful because we're all doomed üíÉüèª Dx 12/6/2016, ILC/IDC, Left, 2cm, Stage IIA, Grade 2, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 2/28/2017 Mastectomy: Left, Right; Reconstruction (left): Tissue expander placement; Reconstruction (right): Tissue expander placement Log in to post a reply",

He's downplaying this as to not worry me but I know it's related to cancer... I understand CA 125 is a cancer marker so now I'm worried that I have an additional cancer (ovarian as that is what is most often related to) or the breast cancer has metastasized. I understand It can be related to some benign conditions as well. anyone have any experience with this? Worried. But I do always think of the worst case scenario first...
