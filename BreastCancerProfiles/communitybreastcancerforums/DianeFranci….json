    "Content": "Oct 19, 2009 12:56AM - edited Oct 19, 2009 12:56AM by DianeFrancine Hello Nanpar: I had a minuscule cancer removed in Aug 09 (1.3 mm) and I saw oncologist on 9 Oct.  Because my cancer is very small, he said that he would consult with other oncologists, although he said that his mind was made up about my case.  He said that there was a lady with a very small cancer like mine who opted not to have radiation and several years later, she got invasive cancer in same breast.  So, right there and then, I knew that I did not want to take the chance of having it return.  Anyways, the oncologist called me on 14 Oct and after consultation with his colleagues, he thinks it would be in my best interest to have rads.  So, I will have rads very soon.  Good luck!  P.S.  I am 64 years old by the way.",
