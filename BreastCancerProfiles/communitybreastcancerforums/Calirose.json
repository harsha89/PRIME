It's so good to hear all the B9 results!!! lv2crft- I'm having a biopsy of a lump and a lymph node on thursday also. I was scared of the same terminology about the metatastic characterstic, but have also read that if it concerns the nearby lymph node, it does not mean it has spread distant places in the body. I wish you blessings and a good report on Thursday too. I'm trying to pace myself too. Somedays I like to just enjoy a whole day knowing I don't know for sure what I have. And others are not so good. To all the ladies here, thanks for your communication- it helps when you don't have a talkative team of doctors...... ",

Report says \"Highly suggestive of malignancy\" BIRADs 5.  It was just a small movable lump under my bra several months ago. Dr at radiologist said \" very bad, expecting cancer, do you have any questions?\" I was too shocked so walked away to try to digest. When I called back they said they do not talk over phone. Have biospy scheduled.  Trying not to belive this, and don't know if this means I'm terminal.  Log in to post a reply",

I suppose that will be a few days after my appt. on 27th. I'm scared still, especially since it feels to me that the tumor is growing larger and wondering if the time this all takes cuts down on successful treatment.  Sounds like everyone knows what the anguish feels like. I'm thankful for a place to go right now and for hearing your words of support, knowledge, and experience.   My daughters know, and my little sister who wants to send me Vitamin D \"to take right away!\" I know they want this not to be something so huge and scarey, so I'm sharing with them the words you are telling me too! I'm sure relishing in holding my grandkids hands right now and enjoying the life moments (when I take a break from worrying) as you all suggested. I wish all of you great blessings also.     ",

According to my Dr. my next step is being scheduled with the breast specialist next week to talk about treatment. I have invasive ductal carcinoma according to the biopsy results. I guess any other details are only known at the time of surgery. I'm afraid of the word invasive. My doctor also said that they \"couldn't tell\" whether the lymph node was affected or there was another tumor but I thought that was what the biopsy was for. They did two that day. Just wondering if I should be going a different direction with another Dr.  Any thoughts?   ",

I think it was the way I was handled at the radiologist, having just thought I was dealing with some sort of cystic thing under my underwire bra. He was so somber and then when I did not reply from being in shock, he said, \"Don't give up hope\" . I know I must sound very naïve, but I felt like even if I knew what to ask, wouldn't want to ask him! Thank you for your reassurance about waiting for the biopsy. I'm trying to stay busy and positive, so as to hear something besides his frightening words in my head. I called my referring physician who did not call me back either.... Thank you so much for responding...I will stay on this site and learn from real people.  Sincerely,  ",

My Dr. finally called me back a couple days ago after I called the center several times. They seemed as though they were informing to be sure to schedule the biopsy but not very responsive to going over results with me. I finally told the Dr. that I was scared of the limited communication more than anything. She suggested I call a BS to do my biopsy instead of have the biopsy done so that the results would be more immediate? What does that mean? Did you have someone from your medical office guide you in any way? LizzieK, thank you for your encouraging reply also, am so lifted up by the strength of all of you ladies that have been through so much and give support to others. I did some retail therapy out of the blue after work the other night and bought myself my first in lifetime expensive pair of skinny jeans (to hold in the muffin top) and a new bag and some new makeup. It felt good to be sort of Ok with just getting myself something- being single mom most all my life.....    ",
