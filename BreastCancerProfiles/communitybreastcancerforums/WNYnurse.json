The medical oncologist stated no chemo, no radiation just hormone therapy.  I was ready for the surgery because I thought that the hereditary paget's disease was going to be the course of BC so 25 years ago I was ready for the surgeon that I had.  But know I am dealing with depression when I should not be.  I am confused with my feelings.....",

You will get strength back.  Arimidex and Zoladex is what I am on because mine was so small and no nodes involved.  Please make sure they do blood work to determine whether you are in menopause or not.  I thing too many MD go with statements from women and then give them Tamoxifen causing bad side effects.  I am having no trouble with the mixture I am on and the blood work showed I was 1/2 through it; even though I had no period for one year.....Good luck you will get strength back.....",
