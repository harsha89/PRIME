I am now waiting for results. But, I am wondering if anyone can send light on the nature of my first pathology report: diagnosis: occasional features suggestive of papillary lesion, epithelloial proliferation present. comment details include \" The stromal contains a localized area of dense fibrosis and looser cellular fibrous proliferation - this looser area is suggestive of reactive change. There are occasional irregular monotonous epithelia fragments entrapped in fibrosis and elsewhere within the fragmented areas there is focal epithelial proliferation focally with a cribriform architecture, associated with stroma - withsome features suggestive of a papillary lesion.\" Any one know anything about a papillary lesions, or what this report means?
