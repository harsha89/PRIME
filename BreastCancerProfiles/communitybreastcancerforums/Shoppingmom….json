I had the PET scan yesterday and a consult with a plastic surgeon. They called me today to say the results of the scan were in and it does not appear the cancer has spread anywhere outside the breast, which was awesome to hear as each prior phone call seemed to bring bad news. So they scheduled me to have a port put in on Tuesday, and would like me to start chemo next week. I am still so in shock and wish I had more time.  My children are taking this very hard, especially the 10 and 12 year old. Any advice to make his any easier on them? ",
