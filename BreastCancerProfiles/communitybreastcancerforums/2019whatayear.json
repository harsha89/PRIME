    "Content": "2019whatayear wrote: Well I have been lurking since March 23rd when I got call to have diagnostic mammo. I was really hoping the lump would be benign once it was biopsied - alas I was wrong. Ironically I feel great. In early March I joined that online program Noom and I overhauled my eating habits and revamped my exercise --have lost almost 20 pounds from my new good habits and then - diagnosed with IDC Stage 1A. Currently, I don't feel bad, I'm not crying, I'm not depressed. I can't wait to get my genetic results back (in 2 weeks) so I can decide treatment, If I have BRCA then everything must go and I am truly fine with that- the prospect of losing my hair is what sticks in my craw the most. I really appreciate this website because it allowed me to read posts from other women and get the scoop on all things BC related --and that education is already paying off in discussions with my doctors- I know I have a long way to go, but I tell myself, you ran a couple of marathons, you can use the skills you learned from that to make it through the gauntlet of treatment. My number one goal is to be myself, be positive (that's my blood type so I have an edge on positivity LOL) , don't hide and do everything I can do to reduce my chance of a reoccurrence. So Hi all! 5/2/2019 IDC Stage 1A, Er+, Pr+ HER/pending (fish) Log in to post a reply",
