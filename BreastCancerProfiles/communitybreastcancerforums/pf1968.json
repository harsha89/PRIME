Is it common for fibroadenomas to change to lobulations?  If it were lobulated, wouldn't the radiologist have reflected that?  3). Can it be \"circumbscribed\" AND lobulated? 4). Is there a difference between \"well circumbscribed\" and \"circumbscribed\"?  I am generally not an alarmist, but I have to admit, this one has thrown me for a loop!  As an FYI - I am 43 with bilateral retromuscular breast implants.  I do have an excisional biopsy planned for 3/14, as my BS suggested it needs to come out.  One thing - in the earlier days of this (going on two weeks) - I started to take him serious and asked him if I should panic.  He suggested I not panic but be concerned.  Log in to post a reply",

My concern now is that, rather than telling me on the phone, he would rather tell me the results at my Thursday a.m. check-up for the incision.  Paranoia will destroy ya........  Also - the procedure was super easy.  I was called in a few hours early - so no time in the a.m. to stress. I got a little hit of versed - and was given a little more, as well as a sedative and local.  I woke up hurting a little bit, and had pain off and on for two days.  I did take vicodin for those two days - but quit on the third day.  The pain was NOT bad, just enough to make me grumpy.
