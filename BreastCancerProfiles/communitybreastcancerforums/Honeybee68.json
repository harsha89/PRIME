I started to get diarhhea a few days after the first infusion. I took Immodium about every other day and that worked. Now I am taking multiple doses every day and am still having watery stools. If you have any tips for how to manage diarrhea better, I would appreciate your input. Also, how far in advance were your chemo infusions scheduled? I only get them for one to two weeks at a time and they keep switching the day of the week. I guess I expected I would get the entire 5 month schedule right away.

How hard was the recovery? Did you feel the risk was worth it? I have two mets that have shrunk quite well with chemo and appear to be dead on CT scan. The complication is that the mets are located in two different lobes. I would like to hear others' experience with this kind of surgery. My Mayo oncologist thinks there is no benefit to doing surgery for stage IV. But my local oncologist and the surgeon do. So it is hard to decide whether to have the surgery.

My Mayo oncologist doesnt even want to talk about surgery unless my cancer is stable forr a year. It seems so contrary to normal protocol of doing surgery as soon as reasonably possible. And it is contrary to what my local onc says Thank you again.",
