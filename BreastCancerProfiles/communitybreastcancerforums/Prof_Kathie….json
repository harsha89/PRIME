How can anyone who hears those words, \"You have breast cancer,\" ever get to a point where recurrence isn't on our minds. How can we not fear it when there is so much to love about being among the living? I am neurotic by nature. If I have nothing to worry about that day, I'll find something to worry about. Here is what gets me through the ongoing thoughts of recurrence. I am fortunate that my Oncotype DX score is 12. The probability of distant recurrence in 10 years is 8%. It seems like the statistics/probabilities are really all we have, doesn't it? I would try to focus on any positives you have in your life right now. How do you feel today? Each day that goes by, especially after we hit that 5-year mark, decreases our likelihood of recurrence. I know these odds are not a perfect guarantee, but we've got to hold on to whatever we can to keep us sane, right? For those remarkable women on this post who have experienced a recurrence, I hold positive thoughts for you. I also would like to know how you found out you had a recurrence. I have never had a scan. When I see my breast surgeon, she feels my armpits, incision sites, and neck area. If all feels \"normal,\" she sends me on my way. My oncologist just asks how I'm doing on Arimidex. Thank all of you for your posts. This is my first post on this discussion board, and reading about you all has been inspiring.",
