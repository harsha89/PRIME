However, I did have a large ovarian cyst (been told endometriona) that has now gone, and I am pleased about that. Was told by one gynae it is harmless and will self resolve, another says ~we always get these out' - what to believe?? Interestingly, my left ovary had twisted on the tube and died anyway. When I questioned the doctor about this he told me that ovaries post-men often die and usually it is the left. I googled this and indeed it appears to be so! So all on all i had one removed plus tubes too. But I also needed other stuff done so for me it was a good decision to get them out.",

The meds they give you will control it should it happen, so don't worry too much. I have been told that the hospital won't let me out until the drains are out so it might mean a longer stay.

Tazzy, - I am in the North now ( Bronte country - wild and windy Pennines) but I did live in London for many years, Camberwell and Brixton. Do you miss the UK? Blessings20- Thank-you for your lovely comforting words it really does help and your understanding  has given me the strength to tell the story that I have kept to myself for so long .  Here it is:  I have been at the breast clinic for many years on and off, with fibroadenomas, dense breasts, lumps and bumps. Indeed last time I was there 6 years ago for a lump on the left breast the doc cleared that as b9. On the right side (my now mx) he told me 'I don't like the look of this' I had mammo and ultrasound the radiographer told me I had a lymph node up that was 'probably a result of an infection'. I went on to have biopsies in that breast and was told it was 'normal breast tissue' and discharged.  Fast forward to 2012 and here I am with an mx, with at least one node and I have done neo-adjuvant chemo. When my breast started to look weird, grow hard, and distorted, I did not go back and I am sure was like this well over a year. I should have done and I should have questioned the 'lymph node issue' more closely than I did 6 years ago.  But I was having such a bad time in my life and I......didn't do what I should have.  Today, I had a missed phone call from my breast nurse, she tells me that all my histology results might be back by Friday and if they are she will phone me. I already know that it is a mixed ca lobular/ductal and grade 2 - although I have yet to be staged but at a 5cm mass I think it will be 3, (the staging is what really scares me), but I have a clear CT      There it's all out! and I feel better!! (but I have a snotty nose now, due to the blubbing!)  Mumofthree - I was touched by your story and what a difficult time you are having especially with managing largely on your own with the children. Surely there is some help you can get from an outside agency? You have too much to deal with. I have been there too with young children on my own and unwell (I also have an auto-immune illness as well). Please do know that there has been great support on here for me and I have only just joined. There is so much comfort in knowing that so many others are here with us, to help and share in those awful dark moments. I am sending you hugs across the waves(((MO3))  I hope all who are in pain and discomfort - find tomorrow a better day.  I will get that book that you all recommend.                              ",

I worked at St George's hospital some years back.  Good to know you don't miss it too much and have settled well in the US. Hoping everyone has a lovely and pain-free weekend (unlikely!) but a great thought that we may in the not so distant future. I will check back in Mon, after seeing my consultant.   ",

Mumof3 - I am so pleased you managed to get some help - it was needed for you and your children. I'm pleased you said having fluid drained didn't hurt as I think I might need that done. I finally got my path report and here it is:  e/r+ (8/8) pr- her- 4/11 nodes IDC (6cm)  I was completely terrified going in. My surgeon is so lovely, she has such a calming way and it makes a huge difference doesn't it to get someone kind. I am so glad that is over and done with. I got a written report of the Path results but gave it to my partner to hide as I can't face looking at it! I think I am  a bit of a coward. My surgeon has put me on Letrozole as she prefers it to Arimidex apparently - wonder why that is. I have to have a bone scan in about a year as my recent DEXA scan revealed Osteopenia, AI can only worsen that. I am coming up to 2 weeks post op and I have to say I think my pain is increasing! Or maybe I am just not taking meds seriously (Paracetomal/Ibrufen only). The surgeon yesterday said I have a seroma too, but just to keep an eye on it if it becomes swollen or tight. Well, it is both of those! I wonder at which point I should get it seen to again? anyone else had this? Mu underarm is sore too, my ribs and round the back where the rains came out. My MX scar was revealed yesterday to as the dressing came off. It looks quite neat, there is a very small lump there that alarmed me a little, I am assuming it is just the stitches or something. It 's so difficult to know what to do about these bits and pieces that arise isn't it.  Perhaps I will call in at the drop in clinic next week and get all looked at by the nurse. Thank-you to all that supported me on what I think was an utterly terrifying day (Mon). I am so glad to be thru the other side.     ",

It is just me and him (cept when he goes to his Dad's, which he will be doing). In the US how long are you expected to be in hospital for? I have heard that here in the UK, you can be out after an overnight stay, which is too short for me as I live alone.   I have just bought 'pull-over' sports bras, but am worried these might not be the best post surgery.

I would just like to say to those who are anticipating drain removal that is really ok and over in a flash.  I am now 6 days post MX and boy the stiffness and pain! the nurse visited today and declared the wound site ok and will come back Thurs. Has any one else had a ANC? I think this is where most of the pain is coming from, it is a kind of burning/pins and needles thing. I am trying to do exercises as I am worried about the lymphodemia. I am still worrying about the final path report on Monday, I know it is something I have to do - but honestly I feel ill even before I have got into the consultant's room. I feel a huge sense of guilt because I knew there was something wrong with my breast for some time, and life was hectic, I was trying to separate from my ex financially, and having other investigations (bleeding) I had started a new job etc etc and I left the breast issue. I feel so bad as I have a 14yr old son and feel I have put my life in jeopardy.... My path report must be worse because of this .I could go on and on. I am sorry to unburden myself here but I need the distance to unload from people who have no chance of knowing me.  Thanks for listening WS           ",

Has your current consultation finished? Like you I had fibrocystic breasts, I asked what I should do if another lump/abnormality should show up after my consultation. The consultant's reply was that each finding (lump/bump inc stringy bits) had to be judged by itself irrespective of what had gone before. My advice is to go back to your GP and tell them of your new findings and insist on a re-referral. You could ask the GP for a copy  of the findings of your last breast clinic visit (I am sure they cannot refuse). If you go back to the breast clinic (and I advise you do, if only for peace of mind) ask if you might be copied in to all GP correspondence. I was actually asked if this was what I wanted. I am in West Yorkshire. Please don't just be worrying. go back again and again , until you are satisfied. I wish I had done.   Just ask if you want more info. WSx    ",

I am just 1 year post dx, I cannot say I have  'good/positive' days yet, rather that I don't have those awful panic/numb feelings all the time now. I too have a son at 15, he was 14 as I was dx'd. I think he is a little bit in denial about it all. He was very upset about my hairloss.  But as I am NED 1st one, I will let him stay there, unless something happens.     I am not really sure what else to say as I know it is such a tough time.

I saw my GP and he asked I provide a sample and then gave me rehydration sachets and loperamide capsules. I stopped the capsules for a day or 2 to see if I was better but unfortunately not. I am literally going to the loo at least once an hour. I have a massively diminished appetite also. I am a Coeliac and do not recall eating gluten which could be giving me the above symptoms, but I am pretty sure I have not, as I tend to have other symptoms alongside the tummy issues but I don't. Can this be a sign of seondary cancer for example in the liver? I am panicking right now, not least because I have a new job starting Weds and I just don't see how I can go like this. Also that there might be something serious going on. I would be grateful for any advice as to this being symptomatic of secondaries..",

I explained to the receptionist that I had still had intermittent arm pain still and what was i to do about that? She said she would get a GP to call me and todaY, she called and said she had he letter in front of her form the Prof of onc (he must have seen the blood test results) and she said he says something like poss mets to chest wall and that I need reviewing and an MRI might be then ordered, So she says can you come into tomorrow for a thorough physical exam and I said no. meetings at work tomorrow. So she says Thursday and i said yes. so at 6 it is. She asked me about the pain: it is intermittent and sometimes goes for weeks and then is back and goes from shoulder to hands/fingers and up/down the arm (cancer side) and is a real deep pain. then it goes again. Says she: mets pain is constant and tends to get worse over time and it doesn't sound particularly worrying. but let's have a look at you. I told her that no one had contacted me either about the Onc letter or blood tests. She apologises and says 'Yes you seem to have drifted' sorry. The NHS here in Blighty is a real mess - but really if I had not been in touch I would have been left. It's my eldest sons birthday today he's 24 and honestly I don't know how I stopped from crying when I spoke with him on the phone to wish him HB ; I didn't tell him about the latest. Any thoughts any one? Please.",

My surgeon immediately recognised something was very wrong. It was my right breast which i had had many b9 issues prior to the cancer dx. I did not have any itching, but I did subsequently develop a really painful shooting, like lightening pain. the nipple was permanently protruding too. I am not sure if this is an unusual presentation of breast cancer, but I was not really aware that breast size changing shape to either larger or smaller could be a sign of breast cancer. I was always told to look for a lump. I do hope the breast specialist is able to put your mind at rest as soon as possible to what is actually going on. Please try not to overly panic! This is my story not yours. It is virtually impossible to diagnose anything over the internet, and I repeat this is only what happened to me.  ",

However, I did know there was something wrong, but took a time to get round to it because of other ongoing problems (some health, some other stuff). Now I just feel incredibly guilty that I seemed to ignore it. Mainly, because of my sons 18 and 15yrs. But, I had been at the breast clinic for years prior to this with lumps/bumps fibroadenomas and even a biopsy 6 years or so ago in the breast that was mx'd last year. I am worrying that I/we have a worse prognosis because of the large lump. My BS has told me she doesn't expect it to recurr. I realise I am still fairly new to this have only finished RADS in Nov.

Hiya Liv from Perth   Iago - the dense tissue does seem to be a problem, this was my issue too  - If only they would MRI those of us with dense breasts.  ",
