I did buy a second identical wig so I could go somewhere after playing with a \"fresh\" start.  And just fyi, my wig brand is Raquel Welsh -- I can recommend it! Margaret ",

Kissta -- as I'm prone to medication-induced constipation, I think I'm prepared this time.  If 2 days pass w/o going, I'll take Senokot-S which is both a laxative & stool softerner.  I've got other products in the medicine cabinet, but I'm hoping staying proactive with the Senokot will be enough. Also planning to stay as physically active as possible... daily walks, circuit at gym 3x/wk, and easy tennis when I can.",

Also great to hear about the horseshow fundraiser.  Every way we turn it seems there is something going on for breast cancer awareness.  My local support group, the Bosom Buddies, is having a garage sale tomorrow and our proceeds will go towards an upcoming Relay for Life event.  I feel even better that I got rid of so much STUFF out of my house!  A win-win situation for sure. Also went to my PS this week and got the final fill in my expanders.  Now the skin and muscles will stretch for 3 months, while I'm on the Taxol. One of my sons who just got his license was in a fender bender yesterday. He says it wasn't his fault but didn't get the name, etc. of the other driver.  My dh and I have to decide what he should pay for.  Another tough life lesson....     Just got asked to sub in a tennis game on Monday --  Hope I can report back that I played decently -- wish me luck please!
