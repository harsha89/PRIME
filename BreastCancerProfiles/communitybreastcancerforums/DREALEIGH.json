I haven't been able to see my doctor lately so I was wondering if I should really get this checked out. It is round and about the size of a pea and is realy dense and cannot be squished. when i stretch the skin over it or press on it a little is is a little more painful than expected. also it appears like a white bump when i stretch the skin it is attatched to. anyone who knows what it might be would be greatly apreciated Log in to post a reply",
