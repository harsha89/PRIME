The same family as the ibuprofen I take, while oxycodone is an opioid type drug.... It is certainly the flavour of the month for very strong pain, although it has all the problems associated with narcotics.

This ensures all the medication is administered and seems to make the injection hole close over quicker. And of course dispose of the needle in an appropriate container! ( nurse talking here).

I am a nurse unit manager in a large private hospital so the facility was very quiet over the Christmas/new year break and I already had annual leave granted. I am going back in another week and just take it as it comes. I expect that I will have chemo day off, them work a few full days while the 'roids are in my system. Then another day or two off when my blood count is low. I reckon I will me able to manage 30 hours most weeks. When I go to tax I hope to have chemo in the Arvo and the next day off.

Speaking of bloods, I had my first lot taken yesterday post A/C and they are all great! Fingers crossed this continues. I still have no SE's to speak of, quietly confident I can return to work next week. I have an appointment with my onc on Friday and I'm seriously considering asking her to reduce my dose of pre and post dexamethasone..... In retrospect I can see I was pretty buzzy for 3 days, I don't know if I would be able to work if I was that high! Will let you know her recommendations.  It's a beautiful sunny day here in Australia, sending some your way LIL",

The treatment provided by the oncology clinic is a package and the insurer has no control over the prescribed medications etc, so the oncologists are able to provide the best treatment. I believe the public system has no constraints either due to the Australian Medicare system which provides free healthcare to all. It must make treatment difficult when there are financial considerations!  Just a quick poll here.....how many of this group have a port? LIL",

It's about as short as you can get with scissors at the back and a touch of Miley Cyrus at the front ( or Flock of Seagulls if anyone out there remembers the new romantic music movement of the 1980's). I quite like it, and it's interesting to see my natural colour.... Ash blind with salt an pepper grey. I expect to get a week out of it before it falls. My hairdresser also cut my wig to suit me better and I'm happy with the result. Paloverde, I plan to only wear my wig to work, I have a nice collection of headwear now, but the way the weather is hear I think the big floppy sun hat will be my mainstay. I'm still se free and very much looking forward to work tomorrow, wish my good luck! We'll in off to the organic farmers markets now to so my weekly shop, wishing you all a wonderful day/night where ever you are LIL",
