      "Content": "Strawberry8 wrote: hello, I had surgery yesterday and per doctor's instructions took the bandage off after 24 hours and showered. I noticed a little bleeding and the steristrips were not completly adhered to my skin. I noticed part of the incision through the loose steristrip, it looked a little open. The incision is on the outer part of my breast right where the weight of my breast pulls the incision downward unfortunately. I rinsed off quickly and patted the area dry and taped some guaze over the steristrips. I find it odd that the steristrips were applied parallel to the incision instead of across the incision to keep it closed. Should I just get more steristrips and apply them myself? My follow up appt is the 29th and I was planning to go back to work this thursday. Dx 1/28/2016, LCIS, Right Surgery 3/21/2016 Lumpectomy: Right Log in to post a reply",
