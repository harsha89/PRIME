First I have a chest cold, coughing, runny nose, sneezing the whole thing.. so I O.D'd myself on Dayquil so I wouldnt blow the test...I knew I was in trouble when I laid my face into the holder and I could feel the pads already hurting my cheekbones..then I had to rest.. hahah.. my arms over my head.. relax my shoulders so they could get all of my reconstructed boobs ( tram on left implant on right).. and hold still for 45 mins...this machine had to have been invented by a MAN.. I was just about to squeeze the little rubber ball and scream UNCLE..  when the noise stopped and the table started to move forward.. The tech cheerfully announced that WE (I say that word tongue in cheek) \"were done\"...she said now the bigger challenge was going to be for me to get up.. No s--T sister.. you lay here for almost an hour perfectly still and see how fast you can get this old body to move.. well alright you say, why is she complaining now .. it is done, and she made it through???? And the answer is .... just cause I CAN ! So for those ladies who are headed to the \"Magic Boob Machine\" or have not yet had the privledged to be tortured by one..  I bow down to you.. you will get through it ..as I just did.. but just remember \"You too have the right to bitch and complain\"!! Just because... \"YOU CAN\"! Nana Pam Log in to post a reply",
