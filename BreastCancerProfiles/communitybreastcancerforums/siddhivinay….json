I want to ask a question from all of you.In how much time lung mets causes symptoms.Because it is already a year since they found multiple(numerous) ground glass nodules in both lungs. They were all under 1 cm and were nodular ground glass opacities that they had found about a year ago on pet/ct.Not able to biopsy because of size.",

But the main thing that worried me is mild uptake in lung nodule on the left side.Is there is any chance that it is mets or mild uptake is common in nodule on pet scan. Biopsy cant be done becauSe of small size and location.",
