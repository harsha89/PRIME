Once you have symptoms, it can take a few days or even a few hours for symptoms to progressively get worse. Because the redness comes and go with you, I highly doubt it is inflammatory breast cancer. Of course, because no one on here can properly diagnose you, it would be wise to see a breast specialist. If you don\u2019t have insurance/insurance won\u2019t cover it, a lot of facilities may offer payment programs where you pay in increments.  Sorry you\u2019re going through this and are worried. The main symptoms for IBC is swollen breast that\u2019s keeps getting bigger, redness, hot and tender breast to the touch, orange peel appearance skin, etc. Mastitis often appears witha fever and chills. Perhaps you have a skin allergy. I wish I could offer more help and words of encouragement to but you shouldn\u2019t worry much as it doesn\u2019t sound like IBC. Good luck and I hope you get it figured out soon",
