I went through emotional hell when first diagnosed and then was really positive starting treatment, just cant believe im so wiped out. Suffering anxiety and panic attacks for which im getting help, but just wondering is it normal to feel so wiped out.I would be grateful to hear from anyone else who found the radiation tough.

I thought id feel great having got through the chemo and instead of that just felt rotten, exhausted no taste etc. I feel the radiation is ok apart from all the daily travelling up and down which is exhausting in itself. I just hope I can get back feeling to my old self shortly.",
