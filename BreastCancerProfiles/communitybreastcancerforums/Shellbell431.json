My father had kidney cancer. Is there an increased risk for breast cancer correlation with parent having kidney cancer. I've heard that some cancers put increased risk. Not to educated when it comes to cancers. Also when the radiologist determined the lump needed to be biopsy. Do they always give it a rating? Thank you. Log in to post a reply",

Went back to obgyn for so post op stuff and mention lumps in other breast. Sent me for diagnostic mammo and ultra sound. ( I have fibrositic breast also dense) they didn't see anything on imaging. Yeah!! Then I got a letter telling me to follow up with doc. They are sending me back to breast surgeon to see what he thinks. I'm trying not to really even be concerned. I got really scared last time turned out to be nothing. So that brings me to me question. Is it better to not be found on imaging or worse. Last time they found it right off the bat.

Do tumors seen on test more often than not turnout to be not cancer?  The mass in my breast was seen on both ultra-sound and mammo. They think it is benign. Athough will do excisional biopsy to make sure.  Didn't know if one was any better than the other.   Thank you. Log in to post a reply",

Also states \"partially obscured nodularity is present in the anterior third of the right breast.\" it measures 1.8x1.9x1.0 cm in longitudinal, transverse,and AP dimensions? A hypoechoic solid mass suggestive of benign mass. However tissue diagnosis is recommended. BIRADS 4 any input or clarity appreciated. Is the measurement hight then width? Just curious. Thank you.
