I was up walking around a couple of days after surgery. My right breast was the cancerous one with both IDC and DCIS and I elected to remove the left breast at the same time. I'm only 40 years old and I struggled with whether or not to take the healthy breast and whether or not to try and save my nipples. My BS said that medically there was no reason to take the healthy breast, but for cosmetic reasons she understood because it's easier to obtain symmetry. I'm currently 5 days post surgery and I'm doing well. I don't regret my decision. I'm a worrier by nature and have been prodded and poked more than enough and didn't want to be under constant scrutiny with the healthy breast. Good luck with your decision, I know it's hard.",

As you can see by my signature, my diagnoses is similar to yours (so far) but the Oncotype came back in the intermediate range. My MO recommended chemo and reluctantly, I did it. If my Onctotype had come back low, I would have skipped it. If it came back as high, I would have done chemo willingly. I was reluctant with an intermediate score because the consensus on whether or not chemo benefits patients like me isn't out yet. I finished treatment in October. It was certainly doable and I have no regrets. For me, hormonal treatment is not an option. I am doing it at least for the 10 years recommended. I think we're lucky to have a form of breast cancer that is so treatable.",

My thought was to make my eyebrows on different cycles so that I would have at least some eyebrows grow in faster if I lost them all. I'm not sure if it worked - my eyebrows did thin out a lot after treatment, but they never fully disappeared. Also, they grew back pretty quickly too and with eyebrow pencil, it was barely noticeable.",

Going wigless is emotional! I admire those of you that are rocking it without one. I'm aiming for summertime.",

Before cancer I thought I was invincible - never got sick, was fairly healthy and I just started making healthy changes for my whole family by shopping organic, etc. Then cancer hit. When I told my mom she instantly said they made a mistake. There was no way that it could happen to me. But it did. And here I am, trying to figure out how to pick up the pieces, like many of us. Some days are much better than others, but the sad thing is that when I find myself having a good day I almost have to mentally sabotage myself by thinking about \"it.\" Anyhow, I just wanted you to know you're not alone in your thoughts.

For me it felt like I had the flu for a few days after each treatment. My biggest complaint was that my leg muscles felt weak. Going up and down stairs was difficult - my legs felt like I did 100 squats. Also my eyes started to twitch a bit. It was annoying at best - it didn't impair my vision at all. I'm also nearsighted and went for a baseline visit before starting chemo. Here I am 3 months later and my legs feel fine and my eyes don't twitch. I never had any episodes of chemo brain. The only evidence I have that I went through it is my hair (cold caps failed me.) Chemo is certainly doable. It's no walk in the park, but you can do this. <3",
