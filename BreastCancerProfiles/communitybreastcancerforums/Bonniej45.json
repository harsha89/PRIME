There is a thing on my breast, it's like a zit but it's dark and hard and the size of a penny. There's only puss if i massage it out ( the puss isn't visible until popped, it just looks like a small dark lump) and it keeps coming back. I am pretty sure it's just a reoccurring zit, but i'm not a dr and i dont want to make an appointment if it's nothing. Does anyone have any input? Log in to post a reply",
