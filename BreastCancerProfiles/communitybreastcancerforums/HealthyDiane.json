    "Content": "HealthyDiane wrote: Hi, I'm new to this discussion board.  I was diagnosed at stage 3.  I had chemo (TCH x6) before unilateral mast with one more TCH post op.  The chemo worked well - no cancer was found in the breast and only 1/9 nodes had some cancer (and only 1 mm).  My tumor was ER- and Her2+ Next up is radiation.  Because I had chemo before surgery, no one knows exactly how much cancer was in the axilla (or breast) at diagnosis.  Different docs are giving me different opinions about what to radiate:  the full axilla or not.  I don't know who to believe.  I don't want rads to the entire axilla, but I don't want a recurrence either.  It's a risk/benefit question. Anyone experience a similar dilemma?  Anyone have rads to the entire axilla (armpit)?  How did it go?  Anyone in the 1% where cancer recurred in the axilla? Thank you for any input. Wishing you all peace and blessings,  Diane  Log in to post a reply",
