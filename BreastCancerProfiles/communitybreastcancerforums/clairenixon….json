Were they written/photos taken by your physical therapist or some other medical institution? I've seen different methods and wrapping materials depending on the therapist, so I was just confused. (I haven't used the materials shown iny your photos) Is any supervision required the first time a person tries this, etc.? Or is it okay to just try it on your own and take your best guess? Thanks for any info!  Chloe",

      "Content": "Jun 23, 2008 11:44AM - edited Apr 22, 2015 11:01AM by jdc Thank you for your responses. I had never heard of a stockinette and especially foam. My PT had me wrap my arm a few years ago when I was having some trouble but I don't need to now unless I have a flare. She taught me using short stretch plus the white gauze/bandage on the inside. She also lent me a video for a few weeks on how to do it. Since how I was taught wasn't anything like the photos here, I felt a little bewildered! Also I have friends who are treated at other institutions who were trained slightly differently than I was, but they still never used foam, so the context of the photos was a little confusing. Thanks for clearing that up.",
