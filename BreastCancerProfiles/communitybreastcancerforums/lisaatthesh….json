We are seeing the minority who have had recurrances, who have had mets, etc. AND continue to post. It is scarey, but if you think it through, just as people with more side efects have more to post about, the more complications--the more posts.  I was convinced (based on the posts) that I would be deathly sick and etc during chemo.  While some women are, I am not.  How many posts are there of people saying, \"well, I went for chemo, and I am kind of tired, but I am feeling fine.\"  The BCO boards would be closed in a minute--there would be no point! Another thing to keep in mind is that we really don't know the backgrounds. I notice plenty of posts that say things that don't match the signatures, so--is the poster unsure of what she has?  Or does not understand what she has?  I have seen several posts where the poster talks about not being able to get diagnosed or treated.   Certainly this could happen, and does, but surely it is not that common.    It is similar I think to the skewing (yikes! math!) of the ages. If you see the thread about 'how old when dx', and as we have said about this thread before, the ages are significantly younger than the \"average\".  Why?  Because it is online? Probably.  I know I read (in posts-not an article) that having BC once makes us more likely to have it again.  I asked my onc, and he said not unless you had a genetic component.  Like you I think about it anyway, and the increased chance of getting lukemia in 10 years, and the colonoscopy that I get to go for earlier and more often than I would have if I had not had BC, and so on........ But then I think, if I had not been diagnosed, no one would be checking me for any of this stuff.  And I might have it, or get it.  And so might anyone else who never had BC.  So the choice I made for myself is that I will be aware of the things that I am at risk for, or at greater risk for, and I will do what I can to minimize my risk, and I will do all the screenings and check ups that I should, and that is all I can do.  I emphasize that I say this is a choice.  I could choose to just believe blindly in my doctors.  I could choose to say it is in (G)(g)od's hands, nothing I can do.  I could just succumb to the fear and never be able to function again (I do lean this way at times).  So, I will do the best I can, and that is all I can do.  That is all any of us can do. Regarding the treatment-Even the Stage IV ladies get treatment, and some of them have been on these boards for a VERY long time.  So I guess there is a point to getting treatment. I saw in one of the articles that BC can be cured, the only problem is that they can't tell if a particular woman was cured until she dies of something else.   It is really hard when these thoughts stay with you and the actual people around you don't quite get it.  Probably some  one more eloquent will come along, but until then I hope I gave you something to hang on to.  If you think it will bring oher people down and you don't want to post it, feel free to pm me.  I promise not to sink under the weight of the possibilities!   (Statistic say I should not even have BC, so there!)",

Have you all seen the thread about dumb things people say to you?  Amazing.   (My father told we are all gonna die someday, some of us sooner than others.  Then started sending me those inspirational death emails where people found god or angels or what have you.  So I was forced to tell him that I was not expecting to die in the near future from a stage 1 cancer which has been completely removed from me.  So perhaps he needed to see a counselor of some sort, but not a grief couselor on my account.  And do not send me any of those emails, because they are not inspiring, and I don't need to find God, because am not lost.  So far so good on the emails anyway.)",

I think Texasrose is right about the blood donation, although I had not thought about it as I don't donate blood.  A few months ago there was a story in the paper about a guy who got a donated (I think) kidney or liver, and the person who died had died in a car accident.  The problem was she had cancer and no one realized that she did, and the guy ended up getting it.  So of course he sued everyone.  Not sure what the outcome was.  Of the lawsuit, I mean.  He died of cancer.  So I am guessing we can not donate organs.  Good question though, something else to look up.  They can always use our bodies for that \"body\" exhibit that moves aroundthe world. And I think 'changing blood' would be something like the theory behind the stem cell transplant...hopefully none of us need to go there!  Good job on releasing your inner scientist tho'!   If we work on this we may be able to come up with something!    Have you seen this?   lifemath.net   pick the 'cancer'button.  Could not put in the link.  There is a good explanation of the statistics portion on another thread, I can put it here if some one wants it.  (I didn't write it).

I felt like trying to get treatment was a pretty disorganized process.  My sister works at a hospital in a different state and checked with the mammo area staff and was told that it just is like that. Great, extra trouble right when you need help! About the third week of May-- I saw a lump in the mirror while brushing my teeth....?????  No discoloration or pain.  Waited a day to see if a rash/tick ring etc developed.  No, so called gyn and made regular appointment, was due anyway, appt for 1st week of June.  He said, prob nothing, but go for  mammo/sonno if something shows.  First avail apt a week later.  Negative mammo. Radiologist tells me go home.   I showed radiologist the lump and freaked him out (not a people doc).  So he has them do the sonno.  They see 'something' and say the only way to know what it is i get a biopsy, so I should consider that.  I was 43 then.  At no point did anyone act like there was any urgency, so I really didn't think it was any big deal.  So I scheduled the biop for the end of June after my vaca, And was stunned to get a cancer diagnosis at 3pm July 2, before the holiday weekend.  So by Tues I did have a list of Drs I wanted to call.  By Thurs I was meeting Drs and having tests.  Had right mx with immed te on July 20 and started chemo Aug 19.  Second treatment tomorrow.  RE INSURANCE/ out of network: I have posted this before, but I was able to get my out of net work plastics paid for by getting a 'case manager' at the insurance company.  My question was \"I already have a BS and and operation date, why are you telling me to go to somewhere out of state.  Why do you not have a doctor on the plan.  Why can I go to Philly, New York, Baltimore, or Pittsburgh, but I can't have this done here?\"  And I just STAYED ON THE PHONE ASKING WHY. And they paid it. I am with everyone who wondered about the hair.  They said tomorrow was the day it will come out.  Nothing is happening.  No real side effects, was just a little tired last time.  For the good drugs--I went back to my primary, he gave me what I asked for and just said call.  I think the part where I cried helped.  Also I have him gathering ALL the records so he can review.  I found each of my specialists missed something that I thought was pretty big and they should not be counting on me to bring up. DH would not have known to tell them.  Also my primary had a handheld (phone)(computer) that he was able to enter all the drugs plus the chemo drugs plus the over the counter drugs and it popped out the list of potential drug interactions. (none, but that is NOT the point)   Pharmacist said they could not help me with things they did not rx (like adding in the chemo meds).  Not only am I normally a terrible patient because I know everyone makes mistakes and I don't want it to be on me, I hate everything they do in every medical procedure.  And I read the charts, and I make them give me copies.  And then I take them to other doctors.  I bet the office staff hates me.  But I don't care if they do. ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK:  the imaging center, the pharmacy, and maybe my gyn.  The gyn gets one more shot.  After I am done w chemo I am going looking for another pharmacy.",

(not likely!)  I even asked, and the response was 'just make sure you eat and drink', and 'have what you can tolerate'.  There is one nurse who phrases her question \"Did you eat every day\".  This might make sense for peope who were losing a lot of weight, or were sick, etc.  I have not lost or gained anything.  Why on earth would it not be ok to have tomato sauce?  Could it be upsetting to the stomach? Like heartburn or something?  I don't eat tomatoes, so have not had sauce, but also havent ad the bad SEs that so many have had either.  Please share if you find out!  I am fascinated by this!",

The doctor and insurance issues are completely ridiculous.  This is a very common disease.  There are laws in place regarding the treatment of ths disease (reconstruction).  Yet, it appears that there are sufficient road blocks for many people to actually threaten their health.  Even the part where you pick a surgeon....until the last 10 years or so there was no breast specialty training.  ALL breast surgeons are general surgeons.  Even the younger ones with the extra training.  So......breast surgery ranks lower than say --plastics, orthopedics, cardiac, prob others too, where there is a special school for it.  If your surgeon was out of school more than 10 or so years, he/she just decided to do breasts and that's hw he/she became a 'breast surgeon' . This is also on my list of things to find out about (WHY).  But not just now, I have to finish what I am doing first.  I feel very lucky to not be 'sick' so I am able to make the calls and follow up on everything, and do the research.  I don' think there would be anyone who would do it for me.  But I can not imagine if I had to do it all and actually felt really bad, or had multiple health issues or small children, as it sounds that many of you do. Just FYI, I know its common to pan medical services down here in hicktown South Jersey, but I did a consult with Johns Hopkins and Magee Womens (emailed my pics and did by telephone) and they picked the same treatment the onc picked here, so I saw no need to travel. Had my second chemo today.  Still have hair, but a couple fingernails are not looking too good....not that bad either tho'.  Ok, lets start planning the trip! ",

On that Neulasta, I suspect that 'everyone is different' is the new normal.  The  nurse at the onc who gave me the shot made it sound like the pain was going to last the whole 8 weeks of the treatment which was what mae me so sceptical about taking tylenol+aleve at the max dose for 8 weeks, but my primary said it should 'normally' be a 24-48 hr thing.  I did not think to ask on which day it would start.I go today for the second one.  Last chemo (the first one) I had on a Thurs, shot on Fri, and they told me any side effects I got would sart on Sunday, so I set off FRiday night with my daughter to visit a college that she had been invited to. (another display of brilliance)  Fri in hotel, Sat on a walking tour of campus.   I did take a couple tylenols, just thinking I would stay ahead of anything creeping up.  I was seriously exhausted by the time we were coming home, but had also been up most of 3 nights, wether se from steriod, nerves about 1st treatment, idk. I think I felt worse on Monday and Tues, which is 3 or 4 days later.  But not that horrible.  Kind of like maybe I am getting a sickness/flu.  One of my coworkers did tell me I was good for nothing on Monday afternoon, but since I had finished my Monday work while up all night and on Sunday when I thought I wasn't going to be able to do anything at all and so had nothing else to do.......it didn't matter.  Going to try for same this week end, minus the trip.  We still have to work Monday because payrolls have to go out regardless of holidays, but we are trying for a 10am finish time.....

Each time they do my bloodwork they say \"it's great\", and then my dh leads me to the next chair...my job is to stay in the chair.  I know they do the chemo mix by weight of the person, but I wonder if there are 'high' dose and 'low' dose.  I kind of thought I was on a 'lower' dose, f/i I am getting taxetore and cytoxin together, total of 4 doses, I will have 5 years of tamoxi after, and possibly something to put me in/keep me in menopause, if it hasn't happened (not clear exactly on that part yet).  But I had a masectomey for a 1.8cm idc with negative lymph nodes.  I will not have rads.  Each onc I spoke with indicated that if I was older, they would most likely just ave skipped to the tamoxi, and that they did not recommend that now, but it was a legit option I had. So I wonder--is this where the differences are?  I have a friend who was diagnosed about 2 months before I was with a 3cm mass in situ not in a lobule or duct, we have completely different drs, even though being treated in the same hospital system.  She did a lumpectomy, and has already had a&c 4x and now is in taxol 4x, then will have rads.  She is suffering pretty bad wth se, and has had the blood count issues many of you mention. So many decscions!  So many medical people to second guess and try to explain our entire histories to. Happy labor day all (does that means the oncs are closed on Monday!)",

Agree with you lizzy, re 'crazy!'. All of the unknowns and unknowables really contribute to that I think.  I think by the time we really get everything down it will be over.  Then, we can come back and tell the 2011 groups that we made it and they can make it too!   That hair..... maybe it won't.  I still have aout half, and it didn't start until after the third treatment.  Of course maybe it's all gonna fall out in a few minutes (contributing to craziness!) And TEXAS!!!!!!! Glad to see you back!  Hope everyone has a great week end!",

Once there was another guy in the closet with me  too (lol), he had tonsil cancer.  And they only removed the tonsil that had cancer, and left the other one in.  Doesn't that seem just wrong?",

Regarding the scans, one criteria I used to pick my onc was that he has his own machine.  I think if you own a machine like that, you are going to need to keep it working, therefore you are going to send people for every scan you possibly can get paid for.  And though I normally avoid doctors like the plauge and I hate every single thing associated with the medical profession......I want to be scanned from now on ... and on a regular basis.  The whole thing is such a disorganized mess....I heard three different sizes under which the scan won't show anything anyway.  The terrorist hotel, OMG ROTFL  Although I did keep one, it was mostly cause my BS will not do a double in one surgery.  So I got the lift/reduction, they are supposed to test what they take out, so-another back up to the mammo/sono/mri/pet that all said all clear for that one.  Those resliant kids.....the girls went out and got breast cancer related tattoos, as did the whole group of their friends.......some of them are not exactly of age, but I don't think I am going to inquire.  Some other time, sigh.  At least no other Moms called me about their girls.. The boys and their friend have all ordered t-shirts that say 'breast' on them, f/i  'I am a breast man' etc and are making plans about wearing them to school, I don't know where they got money/credit cards, but again, I will think about this later.  So they are coping, right? You ladies who are sparing with the pills, that is pretty brave.  I figure they gave them for some reason.  It says 'as needed' on the label, it does not say for breast or for place breast used to be......... I am takin' the pills!  (and I am not a pill taker either, well---WASN'T, but hey, change is inevitable, right!) I also have a friend who was diagnosed about 6 weeks before I was and so is about half way through her chemo now, so I swear  we are all going to make it.  Anyone want to plan a virtual party for New Years Eve? Will everyone be done with treatment by then?  (place picture of confetti and party hats here)",
