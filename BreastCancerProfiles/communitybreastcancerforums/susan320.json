I am not whining, only being honest when I say I with the mets  the thought of stopping tx there has crossed my mind.  However, each treatment has given me more time. I am so thankful for that time! While I have become very sick many times, there have been far more good days, thus far, and this is what allows me to keep push forward. What makes me want to push forward is being with my family and friends!   I think my oncologist felt it was important to talk with me about all options, including stopping treatment. Well, I am not there yet. So cancer cells be forewarned, here comes navelbine to blast you away!

Maybe that is easier than dealing with their feelings. Maybe they are overcome with fear or sadness. Other times I think they are afraid they will say the wrong thing, so they remain silent. And of course there are some who are, unfortunately, just plain insensitive to our situations. Then there are those who care, but are dealing with their own sh** and cannot deal with our sh**. Still, it is disappointing, when you do not get the support you want and need. There have been times where I have expected others to support me, without me letting them know I need their support and that has not worked out so well. I have found that asking for their support, spelling it out for them, usually results in my need for support being met better. But dang it, it is hard for me to sometimes ask, especially with all the other stuff going on like doctor's and treatment appointments, feeling so tired, etc.. What has really helped me is posting in groups like this and meeting with a counselor about every three weeks. My counselor has a great deal of experience (over 25 years) in working with cancer patients and I can tell her anything and everything! I can be real with her and she will accept me for where I am at and she really understands me. Because she has been doing this work for so long, she is able to give me loads of hope, because she knows what things were like for cancer patients 25 or more years ago. Twenty-five years ago I would have been dead within months of my Stage 4 diagnosis and now it is likely I will live 2-3 years, possibly many more. I am hoping for the many more! I believe many people do care for you, they are just at a loss or struggling in their own lives... Keep coming here.

If I wait to take the medication when I am really hurting, then I have gone too long and it is hard to get relief from the pain. Also doing something to distract myself, like reading or writing seems to help some. For the butterfly feeling, lorazepam has helped me. For those times when the pain breaks through, I take the small morphine tabs that dissolve and provide almost instant relief. Sometimes I limit the medications because I worry I will become too dependent or I want a break from the drowsiness they cause. However, for those of us with stage 4 cancer that involves mets to bones or tumors pressing on nerves, etc.. the pain is very real and we need to use the pain meds. According to my doctor for patients like us, the chance of becoming addicted to the meds is low. I have also used a TENS unit for pain from tumor in my thoracic spine that causes severe referred pain to my left shoulder blade, shoulder, and neck. Also, massage and heat treatments have helped me, but check with doctor first, especially if using pain patch, as heat treatments and pain patches can be dangerous when used together (heat can cause one to get too much pain med released from patch. I hope your mom can find some relief from her pain! susan320",

I manage the pain with Fentanyl patches 25 micrograms and use hydrocodone for break through pain. I receive monthly infusions of Areida to keep bones strong and prevent fractures. It is my understanding bone mets is often slower growing than other types of mets. I identify with how scared you are. I want you to know spinal mets are treatable and you will find much hope from others on this board who are in the same situation as you. Oh, how I wish you did not have to be here. Blankety, blank cancer! I found about about my cancer recurrence just six weeks after my 25 year old son got married and two weeks after moving to a new house (yes many boxes remained unpacked!). It has been upsetting to him, his 23 year old brother, my husband, and the rest of the family. We all rely on the \"3 F's\": Faith, Family, and Friends. I also talk to a counselor who specializes in working with cancer patients. She is my person who I can tell anything to-my greatest fears, what I want my obituary to say, to how others are driving me crazy : )... She has been very helpful in getting me thru this most recent round of breast cancer and in dealing with work issues. In regards to work, I would suggest you consider applying for Social Security Disability now, just because it takes so long to get approved. You may find that you want and are able to continue working, however if you are not, having the wheels in motion for disability may provide you with peace of mind and down the road, some financial security.

While I did not want to leave my job, the pain got to be too much in my spine. I can now look back and say it was the right decision. Yes, I miss the challenges, the good feelings of helping others, and the money- but gaining the time to rest when I need to and not having the work stress has been very good for me. I first went on medical leave, then applied for long term disability benefits thru my employer. I applied for social security disability about three months after going on medical leave. I did all of this prior to my stage 4 diagnosis in July 2007. The stage 4 diagnosis automatically qualified me for Soc. Sec., Please note, I had applied for Soc. Sec. almost a 15 months prior to being diagnosed at stage 4. I suggest going on medical leave, applying for long term disability thru your employer (if that benefit is available to you) and applying for Soc. Sec ASAP. I did not go through my supervisor for help, because she could not remain objective about my situation. She was more worried about who was going to pick up my workload, than helping me figure out what was best for me. She had tried to convince me to just quit and live life to the fullest. Had I done that, I would have been without my long term disability benefits, which pay me 2/3 of my salary until age of retirement. I am 46 years old, so this is a pretty important source of income, for whatever amount of time of I have left on this earth! Bouncing things off of non work friends, my counselor, and working with human resource staff person is what helped me get thru it all. Good luck and feel free to e-mail me directly. And yes people did get kind of weird towards me. Actually, since it was my second go around with cancer, I think they were just tired of me being gone and having to pick up my work... I don't know... when it comes to cancer and other life threatening illnesses, there are so many different reactions from people. Guess it brings their own mortality into question and that can be an uncomfortable issue to face! -susan320",

Then I started taking the drug Arimidex. I was hopeful the breast cancer was gone for good. However, this was not to be. I started having bad headaches in May 2007 and in July of 2007 was diagnosed with spread of breast cancer to soft tissue in my chest and neck, spine, collarbone, and liver. When I heard all of this, I was so sad and wondered if treatment would help me. I also had a spinal tap because the doctor was concerned the cancer may have spread to my brain. It had not. Thank you, God. I started treatments of chemotherapy drugs Xeloda and Taxotere. Those drugs are helping me, by making the cancer smaller and keeping it from growing. It has not been easy, because I have had many side effects from the drugs. Like you, it is my family that has kept me going! I have two sons. Also, my husband has been supportive. I am sorry and sad that your husband was overwhelmed by your cancer. This often happens to many caregivers... I take Effexor for depression and talk to a counselor who has special training in helping cancer patients. Will you be getting scans soon to see if your chemo is helping? I am also 46 years old. My heart goes out to you! I will pray for you. In Peace-susan320",

I also have two adult sons, but no grandchildren (yet). My husband and I share a love story somewhat like yours and Diane's, in that my family had to move when I was a senior in High School and I thought I would surely die, due to being 200 miles away from my beau. Still we kept our love alive and married a couple of years later. He is the love of my life and I know I am his too. I am going to have him read your posts as he feels able to. I hate that breast cancer cuts lives short, that it cut Diane's life short. That it will eventually cut my life short. I guess this is where Diane and I differ. I believe the BC will eventually kill me. It is not that I have given up hope. I think I am buying time with the treatment that is out there and I know treatment is not advanced enough to hold off stage 4 bc forever. I know some get many years, some very few... Oh, I am rambling... Bimmer- please know I am praying for you and your family in your time of great sorrow. I will light a candle for all of you. Last two of my favorite sayings: I am strong enough to rise above most any troubled time... Today may be a mountain, but I was born to climb. Stop telling God how big your storm is. Instead tell your storm how big your God is! Diane no longer has to rise above troubled times or face storms, yet she has provided, in fact both of you have provided a very fine example of how to rise above troubles and face the storms. Thank you for your priceless gift of allowing us into your life. I believe you have helped prepare me for the road ahead. Thank you. Peace be with you-susan",

I am using a drug similar to zometa and it has worked really well on the spots in my spine! I hope your mom has a positive response to treatment. Take good care of yourself during this hard time. I am 46 years old, so my mom is in a caretaker role with me. She is great and relies on her faith in God and love/support from family/friends! Peace -susan320",
