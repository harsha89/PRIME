They scheduled me with a breast surgeon who suggested I have it removed so the surgery is scheduled for August 30 but I'm still a bit nervous because the doctor said they like to go in to make sure there aren't any underlying abnormalities like noninvasive breast cancer. All of that scares me. I just had my biopsy last Friday and now I'm feeling something like a small lump right by nipple and where they did the biopsy. I wasn't feeling it before and now after everything I feel it. The Papilloma that was initially found was found in a duct and is small half granule of rice. What could this be all of a sudden?",

They had me watch this video first on what was going to happen within the biopsy and I just started to cry. The tech came in for me to sign some consent forms and reassured me everything was going to be ok. Then be doctor came in and said the same so it did give me a sigh of relief. In the procedure room was the doctor who did the biopsy, tech and another doctor who assisted at the ultrasound machine. I asked how big or small was it that they were seeing and she stated it was very tiny like half of a granule of rice and it was located in a duct in my nipple. They took five samples and they did that for precautionary reasons. I'm at home a little sore and bruised but will be receiving my results in 1 to 2 business days. So I guess by Tuesday or Wednesday next week I should be hearing something. Has anyone experienced something like this before? Still nervous and scared and I feel all alone.",

It seems to look a little brown once it stains my shirt I sleep in but never anything huge; very very tiny. I just got out of the bathtub and when I put my clothes on I felt something cold and looked and it was a real tiny bit of leakage. I haven't noticed any since the first time I posted on July 25. Is this something serious? Because if so I need to prepare myself for the breast specialist appointment I have Wednesday. I'm having anxiety because every where I research it states if its clear and coming from only one breast it's serious? I'm really scared and concerned. I try to stay off the Internet but its hard.",

The nurse practitioner did a thorough breast exam on me and was able to see the leakage once she pressed on certain areas of the breast. So you ordered a mammogram and ultrasound which I took immediately after seeing her. The mammogram was fine and the doctor herself completed the ultrasound and stated that she seen a small something she assumed is a papillioma in duct in my nipple. She also stated that it could be thick secretion. I have a biopsy scheduled for tomorrow and I'm really nervous. Could this be cancerous? Has anyone ever had one of these removed? If so how was the surgery and how long did it take? I'm SCARED!! Please HELP!",
