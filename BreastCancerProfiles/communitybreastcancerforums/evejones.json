The R breast had shown 2 cysts, two months ago at another centre. This radiologist found them as well but did not agree with the previous diagnosis, because she said they were not entirely black but had some white specs within.She thought they may be complex cysts. She then found that the cyst was connected to a duct which appeared enlarged and also appeared black. She was not sure what it was - perhaps a papilloma. This cyst and enlarged duct was not found on mammogram, apparently because the dense tissue was masking them. Has anyone else had anything similar. How did it appear on ultrasound and what further tests were done. Eve Log in to post a reply",
