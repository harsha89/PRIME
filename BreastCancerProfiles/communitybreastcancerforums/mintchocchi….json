Part of me just wants to clam up and not share the feelings with hubby as he does not always get both sides of things before he blames.  I do see your point though and feel this is great advice - thanks again",

So far he has been to the oncologist with me, I have upcoming surgeon and PS appointments next week along with MRI. My kids are 15 and 13 both boys.  My older son poo pood me when I told him there were lots of people he could go to if he needed to talk - he is the one who told me I wasnt special and this isnt anything new and it would be fine.  I am very close to my boys and they can talk to me about anything (which has the other mommy's asking me how I accomplished this,as their kids wont tell them anything)  This broke my heart in two even tho I understand everyone has different ways of dealing  with things.  My DH has informed me that I need to be more discreet in discussing with kids - am I wrong? Maybe I am the one who needs to be beat with a clue stick (Madalyn love that statement  lol)",

CELTICSGIRL - thanks so much for the encouraging words at a time when I really needed to hear positive re-inforcement. Loving hugs to you all and best wishes for speedy recovery and most excellent futures,  Denise",

Well its been a week and a half since my BMX and TE's.  The surgery not bad at all, mostly just numb afterwards.  Cant do much with arms, but steadily getting better.  Today I go to have 2 drains removed and get my first pump up in the TE's (yikes) and (Hurray) at same time.  I wish you all the very best in your journeys - gentle hugs - Denise",
