My mum is the most important person in my life. Next week treatments and further tests start to make sure it hasn't spread anywhere else. I can't stop crying even thinking about this tough journey ahead is panicking me. How do I become the strong person that my mother needs. Any advice on how to cope? Thanks for giving me a place to talk about my worries Log in to post a reply",

My mother has appointments next week to check if its spread and find out her treatment opinions. I'm sure there is more facts to discuss but last night when we all found out I haven't stopped crying since so maybe today I can sit down with mum and get all the scary stuff that needs to be discussed in the open. I just don't know if the shock is ever going to wear off. How do I even mention it to close friends and other family members.",

I wish I could tell you get its easiler but the reality is that it just gets manageable. There was no words for how I felt when my mother told me. I just went with how my emotions were, cried when I needed to spoke about it when I needed to. It's the shock for me that was the hardest part. I found that talking to amazing women on here and in person who have survived and been the main support for survivers really helped. After a week or so I began to become very strong and ready to be there for my mum. I was her main support and went to every appointment with her and I just became able to deal with things more when I knew what was going to happen. My mum had her scans last week and had the lump removed today so in a few days we should know the next step. Hopefully what I have said is able to support you and I am always here if you ever need to just chat or help by leading an ear I know your mum is going to be fine as she sounds like a very strong amazing lady and I will send you both my prayers xxx",
