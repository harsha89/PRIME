The fellow who did the examination before the med onc came in thought it looked slightly swollen and needed a tape measure to confirm. Then ultrasound w/doppler to rule out blood clot. Still waiting for the referral to LE specialist and will but calling first thing tomorrow!",

Mild fatigue kicked in after week 2 and I really had to take things slowly and conserve energy around the time the boosts started. The fog lifted about 10 days/2 weeks after boosts finished.

The actual path we are on is different for everyone, but the emotional roller coaster is the same, as well as dealing with the medical system, side effects, uncertainty, research information that isn't always clear and so much more. Our fears are real and all our feelings are valid and don't let anyone, even yourself, tell you otherwise. And then there's the pressure to stay positive because we're lucky. Well, if I was that lucky then I wouldn't have gotten cancer at all! I'm so glad we have this place to be together whether we need to vent or laugh or celebrate. Sister power!",

I went to a presentation on doctor/patient communication and the breast surgeon on the panel considered himself \"the quarterback\" of the medical team. In the ovca world, my relationship is closest with my med onc b/c that is who I see more frequently. I know a few women who have very long and close relationships with their primary care doctors who stay involved during cancer treatment and facilitate communication between the cancer doctors. Ultimately, it looks like you might have to take on the role of making sure that everyone has up-to-date information. All my doctors are at the same institution (for ovca and breast) and even with computerized records that everyone has access at the push of a button, they aren't always on the same page! It can be annoying to have to be on top of all the information all the time, but with so many bits and pieces of information, it is easy for something to get overlooked and fall through the cracks.  I wish there was an easy answer! ",

(NOTE: without a history of ovca, some type of chemo would have been included.) Will have heart scan next week and a PET/CT to make sure ovca is still in remission--we're not expecting to see anything since last ca-125 was 5, but it doesn't hurt to check. Cancer life is full of uncertainty and there are no guarantees, but I am very comfortable with this approach. Will I be able to go to work after herceptin only? It looks like they'll be scheduling the infusion in the morning. One more thing: I have a little lymphedema going on and will be getting a referral to a specialist. Who would have thought with only 4 nodes? Actually, it was only 2 nodes but 1 of the nodes was like a triplet, so my surgeon says the grand total is 4. Weird huh?",

I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but when I had a nasty exposed area during rads the nurses at my cancer center used RadiaDres gel sheets that had been in the refrigerator. Sooooo cool and immediately comforting. First, the area was slathered with aquaphor and then the refrigerated gel sheets were applied. Everything was held in place with a loose surgical bra, using folded up guaze for extra support  underneath the \"sag\" zone. Hang in there!",
