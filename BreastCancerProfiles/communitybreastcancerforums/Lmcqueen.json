They say the risk of infection is too high. I also have RA and am taking a low dose of steroids so maybe that is a factor in my case. Still on antibiotics bc of the lovely bags. I c the PS again on Monday and I am praying they come out then. Sigh.....",

However, they will fall out on their own if you rub your eyes. I would definitely try the Systane. I still have to use it mostly just at night but if your ducts are closed that might be the best course for you if insurance will cover it. I hope it gets better soon.",

Guess he will start me on my hormonal therapy tomorrow as well? I still have 2 of my 4 drains in and they are making me crazy. Can't sleep at night now because of anxiety in reference to whether or not I have to have chemo. They did the OncoDX/Type test to decide. Has anyone on here gone back to work with the drains? Are you wearing any type of bra?  Thanks, Lisa",

Is it that bad to have the fluid manually drained? Thanks for any help you can provide.",
