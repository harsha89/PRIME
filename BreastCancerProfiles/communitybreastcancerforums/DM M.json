I work in a hospital - so coming back to work breastfree was noticed - everyone was super supportive and happy to have me back and healthy! I had to replace some of my wardrobe - some V necks simply dipped too low but other than that I wear \"normal\" clothes and stand tall. My surgeon had a bilateral 5 years ago and no reconstruction -  her motto was - if someone has a problem with it, thats their problem -  Other than being Healthy - The Best part of being Breastfree - not struggling out of a sportbra after a sweaty workout!!  Heres to the newly flat chested !",
