I am still in a waiting game - IDC on left breast Dx 4/9 through routine mammo then biopsy - no palpable lump, had MRI 4/17 and revealed another small area in another quadrant of left breast, US on 4/25 did not confirm so MRI guided biopsy is recommended but can't be scheduled until 5/10. I still have to wait for genetic testing on 5/9 and plastic surgeon consult on 5/4 but am ready to just go right to bilateral mx. Maybe I need to be talked down or just hear from some that have experienced this. What are the odds the MRI biopsy shows another area of cancer? Thanks again! Prayers and thoughts for all of you! Dx 4/9/2018, IDC, Left, <1cm, Stage IA, Grade 1, 0/2 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- (IHC) Log in to post a reply",
