I was diagnosed on 3/6/09 and had a lumpectomy on 3/12/09. I am 52 with 3 grown children and 3 precious grandbabies. I don't have a family history, this was really a shock.  I have gotten mammos. since I was 40.  This was the first time they found anything abnormal. 7 lymph nodes were removed and were negative, praise God!  I was hoping that because they caught it early, I wouldn't have to deal with chemo, however, as I am learning, they are much more agressive with treatments to prevent recurrence than in the past. It has been scarey at times, but my faith has really been my anchor.  I hope things go well for you.  I wonder if it is 100% that we all loose our hair? God bless you - Gina",

I have cut my hair short, but wonder if it is 'for sure' that I will loose my hair?  Any thoughts?   Ready or not, here we come! God bless you - Gina",
