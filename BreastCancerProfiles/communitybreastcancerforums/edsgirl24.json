Well now it is hurting (not constant) but sometimes it throbs and I accidentally brushed against it one day and about screamed.  It hurts mostly when it is touched.  Ever since the mammogram that found this mass when they were looking at the other breast for a lump, I have just been overly concerned I guess, and I have been feeling other places.  I feel like the dr's think I am stupid.  So, NOW, I am having a pain on my left breast, it has been hurting all day and it feels like somebody poking me off and on.  I did ask them about removing the mass and they didn't seem concerned or made me feel like a dummy for asking.  I was wondering if I should push the issue to have it removed.
