We are in a similar situation so I understand how distressing and difficult this is. It would be helpful if you filled in your background (ie cancer type ((ER/PR/HER). You may alsowant to jump on the threads that are most relevant to your diagnosis (ie. bone thread, type of treatment, family situation etc). Bestbird also provides a free copy of her very extensive Guide to MBC which is an invaluable resource. Just search her name and you can find how to request one (a simple email).

I agree that there is no settled view about whether surgery is good or bad or indifferent to long term outcomes. My sense is that it seems to be swinging towards surgery being good (reducing tumour burden etc) but that's just a perception. I've also looked back through these boards and know many others have wrestled with this issue. I have no insights to add other than my experience. I'm really, really glad I had the surgery and got the thing out. I believe it's good for your body's immune system and overall capacity to fight this long journey with the primary gone. I know some people have completely the opposite view and choose a different path and I absolute respect that. There is no clear answer either way. BTW, I also had lung surgery for the biopsy and an ooph within a couple of weeks of the mx. It was not a ton of fun but honestly it was ok and I recovered quickly from them all. I'm sure that your fitness and stamina will see you get through really well if you do decide to have surgery. Wish I could give you some more definitive advice dear Z. On the big upside, it's great that your very good scans mean this is an issue you are confronted with! Good luck",

Normally I would have been scolding myself but now am much more forgiving. Something else I've been doing which lifts me a littlebit is do my exercise in the morning, eat a healthy breakfast and then take my meds. Makes me feel good about the day and positive about the meds rather than resentful. I know everyone had set times for meds and exercise etc and it might not suit anybody else but it's helping me and with this diagnosis every little bit that helps along the way is worth sharing!

      "Content": "MSL wrote: Dear all I am very newly diagnosed Stage 1V, de novo, lung nodules. Just 4 weeks ago I was blissfully ignorant that I had a lump in my breast, let alone an incurable illness. I've had absolutely no symptoms and feel completely well (aside from the scars I bear now from 2 surgeries!). As many of you have noted, no one can possibly understand the breadth and depth of the emotions that follow such a diagnosis unless you've walked in these shoes. The fear, the disbelief, the shock, the smell of hospitals, the bedside manner of strangers, the loss of control, the loss of the future, the interminable tests, appointments and scary scanning machines. To name but a few. So I firstly wanted to say thanks to you all. I know, from your posts, that many of you read and read this site when you were first diagnosed. Looking for hope. And information. That's certainly been me. And I thank you for your honesty, your compassion and your desire, driven from your own personal experiences, to assist people like me make sense of this most unexpected and most unwelcome turn of events in our lives. In that spirit, I thought I would share with others some of what I have gleaned from the thoughts and ideas on this site, and my own reflections, that are helping me begin to develop strategies for dealing with this day to day. At the outset, I make the point that it is clear everyone confronting this beast is fighting it as hard as they can. Some people obviously have better physiological responses to treatments than others. It's also clear that strategies and expectations inevitably change as the time with this illness marches on. And it has been a privilege to witness the strength, courage and honesty with which people in this community are approaching the latter part of this journey whenever it may hit. These are just the thoughts of a person at the beginning. So. I have done lists of my own characteristics and traits that I believe will help me in this fight (I've got a beautiful family, I'm tough, I work hard, I've got a good sense of humour, I'm fit) and those that I believe will be unhelpful (I get very anxious, I'm prone to jealously, I'm frightened of tests and hospitals etc). I'm trying to nourish the good traits and identify and isolate the bad ones (easier said than done with this crap sandwich of a diagnosis!) I've done lists of my fears (leaving my children, experiencing pain and hideous procedures, never working again, watching everyone else getting on with and enjoying their lives etc) and my hopes (I'll live well for many years, I'll stay active and productive, I will have many moments and stretches of happiness etc). When the fear grips I try to offset it with things I've identified on the hope list. I've done the list of what I'm grateful for, and try to write the 5 things I'm most grateful for each day at the end of the day. This helps keep my heart open and loving rather than closed and bitter. (Easier said than done of course!) I've set the list of what I want to do - be here for my family; be productive and fit; be living in the moment; have fun, travel with my kids; write, read, think, pray, reflect; letting anger and resentment go; letting jealously go (very hard on given this diagnosis); being grateful. This all added up to a list - ever evolving - of how to approach the darkness when it hits. And as we know it hits often and with ferocity. Here's my first cut: Get up and about (if you are able) Don't think about what ifs and what could have been. Ever. Don't let yourself go down the path of jealously and resentment, this poisons your soul. Do exercise (if able) and eat well Understand that you are spending such quality time with the kids not because you are going to die tomorrow but because that is what makes you the most happy. Embrace the insight and understanding that this awful diagnosis gives you about what is important in life. See your medical appointments/procedures as just part of your daily/weekly routine. You will be spending much more time at home and with your family over the life of this road than you will in hospital; You will have many moments of happiness in any given day. Cherish those. And remember you had plenty of unhappy moments before this diagnosis; Be hopeful, many women live for many, many years and new treatments are coming on line all the time; The stats are old, old, old!!; Mission statement - I don't want to spend my days feeling distressed, frightened, resentful and bereft.

Be terrific to hear your words of wisdom. Thanks again all. You've been my raft in these hideous rapids.

As you say, we are now unable to cloak ourselves in the comfort that most others enjoy - namely that death is a distant, unknown quantity that does not need to be contemplated on a regular basis. Having said that, and as you point out, we have also been given an extraordinary (albeit unwelcome) understanding of the genuine human condition. It changes us - as Divine said some of the best moments of our lives are happening post this diagnosis because we are able to appreciate in the very depth of our souls the exquisite beauty of life and the immense power and joy of the love we feel for those closest to us. Given I can't turn the wheel of history and alter my diagnosis, I would like to choose to be grateful for this insight and to explore more of it, which is why I find conversations like this so important. I hope we can continue to tease these issues out and share our reflections. Anyway, lovely last para SP - there's 4 out of 5 things to be extremely grateful for today right there! Perfect. Here's mine - I drove my eldest to school and we listened (and sang along) to her favourite tunes; I had a 2 hour walk; I had a glass of champagne with my husband; I snuggled with my little boy; I continued my teen wolf marathon with my middle kid (good ol' Tyler Posey!!). 😘 to you all xx",

Don't try to run 10k straight up and then get frustrated and disappointed. My tip would be set your 5k goal but spend the first month or so breaking it up into jogging/walking - in one km lots. Or start similarly with a 3km circuit until you're ready to go to 4km etc. This approach has always worked for me getting back into running after kids etc. mara - love your work and your attitude and your goals!

Throughout all I've been exercising my little butt off, running most days and doing 10km regularly. My onc reiterated to me the absolute importance of exercise - said 45mins a day. So inspired by all of you - lulubee your humour and strength shine through in equal measure. Z you motivate us all every day. Welcome to those who've joined us recently.

I read another one in these boards (I think it was you too) along the lines of feeling like you're performing in a play to the outside world with your real life hidden and scary. Like most people, I enjoyed planning, thinking about things ahead, imagining where I'd be in this timeframe or that. I think pajim is right, we need to build a new concept of the future, not one we ever contemplated but one that will assist us live the best we can with where we find ourselves. The \"new normal\" that everyone keeps referring to! It's fascinating what you said about wellbeing DivineMrsM. You have great honesty and insight and that helps many people on these boards. I always love reading your words, despite the darkness of our situations you seem to shine often, and I take great inspiration from that. In spite of being prone to stress and anxiety, my basic disposition during my life has been pretty upbeat and happy. Most days I woke up feeling good about the world (even if certain things were bothering me etc). Interestingly, I've found the mornings the hardest time of the day with this diagnosis. Waking up to the new reality and feeling depressed/distressed which then can cripple the whole day. I'm really determined to crack that (long way to go!!) This is where exercise or activities will be important, I think. Get up and about, remind yourself of what you're grateful for, and embrace the day. (So easier said than done......!!!!) I've also found it helpful when trying to get that awful monkey off your back telling you you can't enjoy this or that because you've been given a death sentence etc etc to absolutely not put timeframes on my life (I know many of you do that as well). Hopefully I live for \"many\" years which would mean I'll have many experiences again and again etc. And who knows where that might take me? Anyway, writing these things down does assist me create some order in my internal chaos. I appreciate so much you sharing your reflections, ideas and experiences, it is immeasurably helpful. ",

Almost like you're a little kid who finds the flowers and ladybugs fascinating and for whom summer holidays last forever. I guess it's your mind coming to grips with the massive change to previous assumptions about your longevity. Ultimately I believe it's helpful and means you're able to live in the moment, find joy in many things, take great comfort in all the living/loving one can do in a day, let alone a year. (Some of the best times I've ever had with my kids have happened these last few weeks because I'm completely present in the moment and so grateful for being with them) But I'm also finding it a bitter jolt when you interact with the \"outside\" world and everyone else is operating (quite rightly and good luck to them) on the normal timeframes, the normal years unfolding ahead, the normal planning for the future etc. etc. Its a tough reminder (and often one that hits you without warning) of all that's been ripped away from you. I really want to get better at dragging myself out of that rabbit hole and back into the sense of wellbeing and hope that comes when you are able to live in the present and look forward to all the beauty of tomorrow, or next week, next month or next year, rather than the luxury we used to have (without fully appreciating it) of planning for the next decades. I don't have any answers, but I guess part of finding them (if there are any) is articulating the question/issue. Any thoughts/advice is most welcome!!!   ",
