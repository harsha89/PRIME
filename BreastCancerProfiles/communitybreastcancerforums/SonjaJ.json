I freaked out a little, then I calmed down. I did not call doctor Friday, becasue it was a holiday. When I called Monday, I got an appointment for Tuesday. I saw my primary care physician and he examined me and measured the mass. It was 3 x 4 cm and was very hard. He asked if I had had a mamogram and I said no. Well, I am 42 with no family history of breast cancer at all. I thought I would be fine. He sends me over to radiology right away, just to be on the safe side. I go over to have the mamogram and after the radiologist sees the pictures he asks if I have time for an ultrasound. I did, so I went over and had that done. The tech takes the pictures and then goes and gets the radiologist. He comes in and asks when I found the mass and how. I explain it was in the shower during a monthyl self exam. He says that was a good thing and says he wants the mass biopsied right away. Wednesday, I go to the hospital and have an ultrasound assisted core needle biopsy. The radiologist that performed it was very sweet and apologozed for the pain I experienced during the procedure. He says the results can take as long as 5 says, but they are usually back in about 2 days. So, here I am waiting, and waiting, and waiting. This sucks majorly! How am I suppose to occupy my time. Myhusband is the only one that knows. I told my 9yr old that I had to have tests to figure out what was going on with me. After he giggled about my breast being in pain he said not to worry, he would take care of me if I am sick. Log in to post a reply",

Anyway, I called the docs office this morning because I was confused about who I would hear from (the radiologist or my pcp). Well, the nurse calls back and says the doc has results, but he wants me to come in so we can discuss them??????????? I immediately freaked out here at work, I means tears and sobbing like never before. I called dh at work and he agrees that it is not fair for him to do that. He works an hour away and rode the commuter van to work today, so he won't even be able to go with me at 3:30. I think it is a bad sign that they won't give me the results over the phone. What do you guys think?",

Was referred to surgeons, have appointment on Tuesday afternoon. PCP says with the size of the mass being so large more than likely they will perform a mastectomy right away. DH made it to appointment, so I wasn't alone. I was very calm. I think the freakout I had at work was good enough for right now. Picked my son up from school right after. He put a smile on my face immediately. We just came back from dinner at Outback.",

Saturday, I got up as usual and cleaned and did laundry. We went to see a movie and then I visited a friend. Sunday I got up and made breakfast and got ready to prepare dinner for my family and friends. I had them over to tell everybody at once instead of having to tell the same story over and over. Things went well, my mother (who is a colon cancer survivor) was strong and said it wasn't a death sentence. My sister and brother took it really hard. Although I am the youngest, they kind of rely on me to keep things in check. I think it scared them to realize I am not superwoman. My friends were crushed, but we all cried and hugged and then we ate and had a ball. Marie5890- Thanks for your words of wisdom. Cuetang - I picked up the reports and films today during lunch. I am prepared to see the surgeon tomorrow. Pattithenurse - Thanks! This forum IS a great source of comfort. Alynne61 - Great advice. I will do just that. Adelaidegirl - You will surprise yourself.Â  As a woman, it is instinctual to fight when backed in to a corner. Debmc1958 - Hope things went well today with the surgeon. I am anxiously awaiting my appointment tomorrow. Kel44 - Thank you. I am taking this fight to the streets and I fight dirty when I have to! Sharon1953 - My mass is 2.8cm and I feel like it is huge! How did the meeting with the surgeon go; what happened at first appointment? Kayezzy66 - Hope you got your results today. It definitely helps to stay busy.",
