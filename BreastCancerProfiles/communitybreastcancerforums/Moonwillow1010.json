My lump is less than 2cm and the adjacent node was negative according to the biopsy. My two surgery choices are Lumpectory w/Radiation or Mastectomy without. He said that both cure rates with either surgery are the same. I am TERRIFIED of doctors and needles etc. but will of course put the big girl panties on. However, I am leaning towards the Lumpectomy w/Rad. He tells me that he believes my nodes are ok BUT won't know until after surgery. Can I please get some advice on weighing out the options? I see surgeon again next week.
