I've been drinking about 90ish oz of water and Gatorade a day, and taking Zyrtec helps with the bone pain from the nuelasta shot tremendously! The 2nd round was much better than the first, I think because I learned what to do better from the first round. I'm about to have my third round this Thurs April 5th, and I'll be half way through. The lump is flatter and smaller, so it is shrinking. My chest MRI showed only the one mass, lymphnodes look clear, but when I have my lumpectomy, they will take some lymphnodes to test, of course. I've had some fatigue, but I've been ok. I've just rested extra when I need it, and taken advantage of the days when I feel good. My appetite has been good, some change in taste buds - things taste bland at times, but I still eat pretty well. I take Miralax that day before chemo and for a couple of days during and after. That seems to prevent getting stopped up, so to speak. So, I have some ups and downs, but the suggestions and instructions have helped me stay on top of things. I hope my journey encourages some one else. I know it's scary, but it is do-able.",
