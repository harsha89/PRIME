What I'm wondering is--I look at a ton of the signatures/profiles of people on the boards here and I will see someone who is \"0/24 nodes\" or \"0/1 node\" or \"0/17\" nodes.  My question is--why take 24 if they are all negative? My second question is, when they take out my 3, the go in order, so if the first shows cancer cells, and Nodes 2 and 3 are clear...would the doc then proceed to take out \"the rest\" of them?

Proud Mom_wife:  I am due to get my port in and my first chemo on the same day (Jan 18th)   Tammy:  I was hoping for Friday infusions and back to work on Tues...but my doc isn't in the clinic on Friday...so my first infusion will be on Tues...not sure what to expect. I'm full time now, but will be starting part time (T-W-R) work on Feb 1st....Where did you go to look at wigs? I'm so unfamiliar with the whole process...do salons carry them?   Julie H: thanks for starting this thread, and I wanted to comment on your \"how to tell kids\" post-there are a bunch of books of course, but I have 3.5 and 19 mo old sons. The 19 mo old doesn't have full command of the language yet, but my 3.5 yo is very sharp. I borrowed a book from the pre-school library called, 'My Mommy has Breast Cancer, but she's OK'  My son really likes reading it...the book keeps things very light (intended for 5-6 age range I think) and gives just enough info to explain, without burdening a small child with too much.   Warrior princess24 -I think you might win the prize for being the youngest on our board! So sorry you are going through this, but glad to have you here with us (from a support standpoint!)   Annie_momof3: I'm excited that you are doing the cold caps...please let us know how it works out for you. Where did you get them?  Though-I see you are from MN, my sister lives there...and man, it's COLD...you could just do your chemo outside (LOL, just kidding of course)   Moe0279 and Proud Mom-Wife: What's up with the glutamine?  Does it help with the chemo?  My onc never mentioned it at all...    Can you tell me what it's for? Vis0121 I also have small kids (3.5 and 19 mos) it's tough, b/c they are just tiny humans-so it's hard to figure out what to explain and how much to disclose. My 3.5 yo came downstairs last night (after I tucked him into bed) and was very upset, crying and saying he was sad that I had to go back to the doctor -again-and that I would lose my hair.  Sweet thing he is :)  To all: What's this oncotype score everyone is talking about? I wonder if I didn't get that b/c I'm triple negative? Thanks ladies!",

QueenJazz--wow, pink urine that quickly?! that's soooo weird! I know that will freak me out a bit. I guess the countdown begins to hair loss now, huh? Keep us posted...because I'll be two weeks behind you! JulieH: Yes--chemo twins :)  So, the Avastin trial is unaffected by the ruling, anyone enrolled will continue to carry out the Clinical Trial Protocol.  They are also allowed to continue to enroll until early Spring. Then they will be done. I'm still unsure about the Avastin; not sure I want to add yet another drug to a regimen that is already going to be very taxing on my body. That said, I'm triple negative...what if this Avastin is really the magic bullet, you know? On wigs and hair--I went to a wig place near my home (they do male and female hair loss), and the guy was really nice (kind of outgoing in a NewYork / Bronx kind of way) and helped me try on a few wigs (they had them right there in the store)...but they are like $600. Am I crazy for thinking this is WAY too much for a wig?  He mentioned that my insurance might pay for it...so I will call them today. I've also visited the TLC website and they have some cute stuff too. there's a thread on this board about hair loss options (I think it's pinned to the top of the Chemo board) and it has a lot of links / websites. I ordered a free scarf from FranceLuxe and I also emailed the other website (can't remember, starts with a G) for a free wrap. Hopefully those will come quickly. My biggest complaint with the wigs I tried on is that they don't look like me....but I have this really thin fine hair that's very straight.  The wigs all have this \"pouf\" up style at the crown of the head and it makes it seem like I'm 4 inches taller than I really am...and with way more hair. So i'm nervous. On the work front. I've been at the same company for 11years. I'd been looking for part time work for about a year (b/c my children are very small) I finally found a part time job that I was interested in (same company), so I applied (before I knew about the cancer, of course). They hired me, and want me to start Feb 1st. So I had to have the whole, \"thanks for hiring me, and by the way, I've got cancer\" conversation :P  That was fun. But the hiring mgr seems really really nice and understanding. The point of the story is, I need a good wig, but for only 3 days a week. My work sched is set to be T-W-R starting Feb 1st.  The other point of my story is; I'm taking a 40% pay cut, so I just can't see spending $600 on a wig I'm hoping to be able to manage working my new part time job through chemo, but we'll see. We're leaving the kids in daycare full time for now (since I don't know how I'll be with chemo, and the continuity is nice for them).  I originally wanted to do infusions on Fridays...but I can't now (my onc isn't there on Fridays, go figure) So they've started me on chemo on a Tues...and I'm hoping I can at least work my way up to going on Thursdays...like, Tues 18th, maybe Wed Feb 2, and then Thurs the 17th or something... Good luck to chemo sisters starting this week! Keep us posted with your experiences and SEs!",

I almost can't bring myself to go on Thurs for round 3. I'm scared witless. Just knowing that I'm signing on for that Hell makes me want to just take my chances with the cancer, you know? I keep telling myself I'm \"1/2 done with the A/C\" and that's why I posted a question a while back about how bad the Taxol is...B/c if it's worse than the A/C, theres *no* way I can get through 4 rounds of that too. Take care ladies!",

Nothing tasted good. I existed on snack pak pudding and homemade chicken soup from the neighbor. LOTS OF WATER (even though I hated it) and ginger tea. I would start to skimp on the water (due to nausea) and then get severe constipation. Very painful. Meg: Glad to read your posts as always. What's up with the earthquake news in Christchurch? I kind of feel like I'm out of the loop...Japan's issues (or Charlie Sheen nonsense) are the lead on the news in the States. Christine: I'm right with you...April 14 and April 28th are my last two chemos! For me: Taxol has been a bit rough. Certainly easier on the nausea but WAY more difficult with bone pain and fatigue. Also, the SE seem to last longer (a full 7-8 days) which is a bummer for sure. But seriously, I'd take anything over the nausea I had with A/C. My radiation oncologist is leaving my cancer center on April 15th (I'm supposed to have made an appt with him by then) and moving to a new competing center. I was tempted to just follow him to the new place, but now I'm considering getting rads done at a regional hospital. Do you girls think I'm nuts?  I mean, a regional hospital isn't some big fancy cancer center....but rads is rads, right? I don't know. The cancer center is 49 miles from my house (about 65 minutes to drive, each way).  The regional hospital is 19 miles from my house (about 45 mins to drive). I just can't see spending 2+ hrs on the road every day for 6 weeks. I have 4 and (not quite) 2 year old boys, and I'm still working 3 days week. So i don't know if I should just suck it up and stay at the center, or tone it down and go to the regional hospital...? Thoughts?",

My all time favourite beverage of choice!  But there's really nothing of value in a diet coke, it's just chemical sludge So we quit. Otherwise, I've been doing fruit smoothies with leafy greens (I have great recipes if anyone is interested!) But on the A/C days, I really couldn't drink those. We definitely do a lot of vegetables, but these days I find myself buying more organic stuff. I've lost a bit of weight on chemo--I'm 5'5\" and about 115 now, but got down to about 110 on the A/C. Normally I'm around 120lbs. On exercise...we bought a recubment bike at the suggestion of a friend who is struggling with ovarian cancer. Her onc told her to bike 30 mins a day and gave her 2 years to live. That was 6 years ago, so I figured a bike was a pretty good idea. I bike 30 mins a day (usually 35 or 40), but on the very worst of chemo days, I might only go like 3 miles (i can barely move my feet to pedal!) On a \"feeling better\" day, i can go about 7 miles. When I'm out of chemo, I will get my lazy ass back on the treadmill too, just to mix things up a bit.",

My port sticks out and is rather unsightly. I've not been able to get in front of the nausea, despite taking Emend, Compazine, Zofran and Ativan.  I joked with the nurse and said I'd start taking Heroin if she thought it would help. Anyway, the Neulasta shot threw me for a loop. So much hip, and lower back pain I wasn't sure I would be able to walk. Did someone mention Clariton for this? If so, I will try that. I just hope there is a reprieve, b/c I cannot live like this for 16 straight weeks. And just to reiterate to everyone, once your hair starts falling out, do NOT pull it out in chunks, it damages the follicles and it will grow back in patchy.  That was advice from a BC survivor i know IRL. Also, just to reiterate, (more for myself) I am making this decicison to do chemo, even though chemo is an evil bitch, I think it is the best option for me, so it helps (me) to think that I have some small control over my therapy. My darling (almost 4 year old) son sobbed his head off when he saw me Tues after treatment, and told me I \"looked just awful\", and he offered to have a special stay at home day to take care of me. What a sweet kid. This is why I'm doing the chemo, even though I hate every second of it. More later, my sisters!",

It's simply gorgeous!!! Vis0121: I'm so sorry; you sound about on a par with me. I felt so bad last week I thought, \"there's no way I'm going to live like this, so chemo can take a hike; I'm not going back\"... Melissa (Moe): I'm so happy to hear of the tumor shrinking! I also got really emotional at my first treatment. It's a lot to manage. Aimster1123: What's the pump thing for the nausea? I'm so scared of treatment 2 that I want to make sure I explore every possible thing for nausea.  I know what you mean about bone pain, though mine isn't from taxotere; it's from the neulasta shot. Annie (in MN): I like your plan of fluids on day 4 of chemo. I definitely felt like a bit of a science project on chemo #1, which I think will NOT do for chemo #2. Webu: What you said about wearing the pink ribbon and fighting hard really resonated with me. Mostly after my first treatment I just wanted to curl up and die in a corner. I didn't feel strong, or warrior like at all. I felt miserable, scared and lonely. Proud Mom: My insurance is similar to yours; I don't want to have to drive (1 hr each way) to get Neulasta shot; and I'm not squeamish about giving it to myself; but I hope that they can \"prequalify\" or \"precertify\" or whatever they have to do to get insurance to cover me giving it to myself. I check with Target Pharmacy (where I get my Rx filled) and it's $3000 per pre-filled syringe.  But, given what a 3 day stay in the ICU would be...I guess it's cheap by comparison. Thanks for the lemon tips. I'm so going to go get those supplies ASAP. BDavis: What's the benadryl for? I'm desperately trying to figure out a way around the nausea for next time... Tundra I think it's definitely getting to be a younger disease...who knows why? I originally chalked my dx up to all the Cheeto's and Diet Coke I used to have for lunch...but I think it's not really fair to blame the cancer patient for the cancer (at least in the case of breast cancer). Science Girl: I really struggled with the Neulasta shot, which I got on Day 2 (next day after infusion), but by Day 5 the crushing bone pain was gone.  I like the idea of the oxycontin; I told the charge nurse I would shoot heroin if it would get rid of the pain and the nausea. (I was only half kidding...) Sorry you ended up missing the party. I envy you that you are back to work. I haven't been able to go back yet. I am going to try for Feb 8th (6 days after 2nd chemo). I was supposed to start a part time job (I've been at the same company for 11 years and finally found a part time job that is a good fit...I'd been wanting to go P/T for a year now, since my kids are so little).  Anyway, I was supposed to start Feb 1st, but I just don't think I can go in quite yet....we'll see how Chemo #2 goes. HSGray: I am right there with you on the meds and the SEs, we sound like twins. UTMom: I'm sorry about your white count too. It seems like several of us on this board are suffering from that, but I'm glad it's back to good now! AliT: Welcome to the boards! CBlue: I'm scared of treatment #2 as well, did not go well with #1...I hope it is smooth for both of us. Amara: Welcome to the boards, I'm sorry about your recent dx. I was dx at 37, it's such a shock isn't it? (I just turned 38 in Dec). I agree with Science girl's recommendation though, be comfortable with your onc. Don't leave anything to chance, and study up; you are your best advocate. We made a lasting impression on our oncologist b/c we had a copy of a 2 day old article from NewEngland Journal of Medicine on Triple Negative breast cancers and came prepared with questions. Luckily for my 2 oncologists; they had already read the article J AmyK: Thanks for the info on the nausea. I'm really struggling with that.  On self injection of Neulasta: Any favorite spots? The nurse gave me the first one in the back of my arm. Just wondering if there's a preferred place for those self-injecting...? Thanks ladies, for being there!!",

Thanks for all the nice comments about my bracelet idea (it was a gift from DH!)  Wanted to answer a few questions, and ask a few questions as well! Annie: I would def push the onc for nausea meds. Emend is quite expensive, but is the best anti-nausea on the market. I think the \u2018wait and see' approach for anything pain or nausea related is unethical (in my opinion). And thanks for the cyber cookie/milk sending!  Love it SusanLynn: Welcome to our board, lots of knowledgeable women here for certain! Melissa (Moe0279) Neulasta is to help your white count. You may not need it, but in our office it seems standard. Vis: Happy birthday, and I'm glad you don't have chemo that week! It's nice to get a break from it all! BDavis: I'm having the same trouble with wigs as you are it seems! I am very picky. As much as I would just like to rock out the scarf look, I think it's an open invitation for people to come up and discuss your cancer. (Kind of like being 8 mos pregnant...everyone-including perfect strangers- had to rush up and tell me their labor and delivery horror stories!) But, I think a with a wig, even if someone suspects, it's not like they will say, \"is that a wig? What-you got cancer or something?\"  Or-maybe because *I* wouldn't do that, I assume nobody else would? LOL On the whole working toward the perfect job, and then cancer coming along-pretty much the same thing happened to me. The timing couldn't have been worse, but I start the new role on Feb 1st and so far, my new boss is totally supportive...Hope he stays that way! MaryMeg: I'm definitely struggling with this whole crap-tastic mess. I hate cancer, I hate the diagnosis, I hate worrying about whether I'm going to die or not. It's *a lot* to handle.  I have an appt to talk with a psychologist in a few weeks (not saying it's the right answer for everyone). For me, I am really just hoping to get some pointers on how to \"live in the now\" and not be paralyzed with fear of this disease all the time.  I'll share if I learn anything useful! LOL  I'm also a scientist, and although I'm working full time, I will start a part time position at the same company I work for now on Feb 1st (incidentally, lines up with #2 of the A/C, so I might miss my first day!)  Jane: We have a donation program in the States similar to what you described, called Locks of Love. I think it's a beautiful thing you are doing. CK_Moma: Welcome to the group! I'm also in a pretty rigid corporate environment. I'd love the details on your wig buying experience and any other tips you can give! Sylvia: Welcome! You will start chemo the day after me! It sounds like you are triple negative. If so, please join us on the \"TN board\".   It also sounds like you and I are on the same regimen.  4 cycles of DD A/C and then the Taxol. That can come in either 4 cycles of Dose Dense (every other week) or once a week for 12 weeks.  We'll be chemo twins  On the Hair Falling Out: My friend IRL who went through this said *Do NOT pull out your hair in clumps*  Let it fall out completely on its own. If you start yanking, you can damage the follicle and when it comes back in, it will be patchy/spotty.  Just wanted to pass that tip along. On the supplements: For ladies on supplements, how did you figure out what to take? I feel like my onc isn't likely to recommend anything like B6 , glutamine, or any of the others mentioned here. Also, on the glutamine, how are you girls measuring 15 mg?  Is it just a capsule that you are emptying into warm water to rinse your mouths? It would be awesome if we could get a big list somewhere of all the OTC meds that can help (and what they help with!)",

I didn't even think about that. As for me: Still in sort of a 'chemopause' (weird, since I'm only 38) but the hot flashes have been quite an experience. I still have no hair, and next Thurs is my last Chemo (DD A/C and DD Taxol). I have a mtg with the rad onc tomorrow (regional center) to see what they say and what the plan is. I plan to start taking Biotin soon (vitamin to encourage hair/nail growth). Still wearing scarves, but tried on a wig that a friend gave me (not my normal color, and way shorter than what i used to wear when I had hair) but still it looked suprisingly good! Not quite comfortable enough to wear it to work though :) I've also been lurking on the \"hair hair hair\" thread on the chemo board. Some great photos of women PFC (post final chemo)--it's a nice way to gauge how long it's going to take to get some hair back. Some women go \"topless\" as early as 12-13 weeks PFC.  I hope I have that much hair by then!!! Take care ladies!",

My mom used to buy them and hide them from me and my sisters while we were growing up. I still love them today! (forbidden candy always tastes better, no?) Amy: Please  don't give up. I hate A/C so much and I am making myself sick over the thought that I have to get my 3rd dose on Thurs, so I know how you feel. For me the nausea has been completely overwhelming. But PROUD MOM-Wife made a great point about the anti-nausea meds and how they weren't available 20 years ago (although, during the throes of nausea, I question if they really work or not...) I know that there are many more SE that you are dealing with besides nausea, but for me that is the worst. I can sympathize with you on wondering if it's doing any good. I'm triple negative so I have a high risk for recurrence in the first 5 years. I will be some kind of pissed if I get tagged again after going through this crap. Anyway-we are all here for you to vent if you need to. Jcoutee: I noticed from your post that you have some young kids. Me too. My oldest will be 4 in March and my youngest will be 2 in May. We don't have a lot of close by family, so it's really hard on DH taking on the parenting when I'm super -sick. On the periods: I had one Jan 2, and again Feb 2 (my 2nd round of A/C), so far they've been pretty normal. Anxious to see if I get another one in March. For me: I'm feeling a bit like Amy on the A/C. I almost can't bring myself to go on Thurs for round 3. I'm scared witless. Just knowing that I'm signing on for that Hell makes me want to just take my chances with the cancer, you know? I keep telling myself I'm \"1/2 done with the A/C\" and that's why I posted a question a while back about how bad the Taxol is...B/c if it's worse than the A/C, theres *no* way I can get through 4 rounds of that too.

Amelia: Thx for your comments about us mom's with young kids, gave me a huge boost to keep fighting! Aimee Mac: Lorazepam is Ativan, if you haven't already made that connection, I know there are others of us on it. They prescribed it for me as well, so I can share my experience here. It's supposed to relax you and ease the anxiety and the anxiety-induced nausea. I'm supposed to take it day of chemo, and a few days after. It does help with the racing brain / nausea, etc, but it makes me tired (this is OK with me, since during sleep is the only time i don't feel like I'm going to vomit). The only significant SE that I have had with it (and I'm not sure if it was the lorazepam or the zofran/compazine) was during treatment 2 I had really horrible constipation. Such that I thought I might have to go to the hospital. So...get your stool softener / miralax, or whatever and make sure you are religious with the dosing.  Hope this helps! On the hair: So--DH buzzed my head shortly after treatment #2, and most of the stubble fell out the last week or so...but I still have some up on the crown of my head...does anyone else have this? good luck to all our ladies getting treatment this week; I go in tomorrow!",

To answer your question about how fast treatment started, I was dx on Nov 19th, had surgery Dec 20th (earliest they could get me in) and will have port installed and 1st chemo on Jan 18th. So--two months after dx I start chemo. JulieH: I think my insurance will pay up to $400 for one wig, but I have no idea how to start that process. It seems like I have to pay up front, then submit some kind of claim or something. I have a feeling this will be a full time job...dealing with the insurance!

I'm glad you are doing well so far from your 1st round. My DH wants to do something after each chemo...sort of a countdown. He suggested getting a pinata filled with candy so I could come home from chemo--whack the pinata, and then let my kids eat the candy.

I've been up and down a lot in the past few days. I met with a friend yesterday for tea (she has ovarian cancer) and she told me, \"sometimes when you feel like your back is against a wall...just remember that you are CHOOSING to have this chemo b/c it's giving you the best shot.\"  And then she said, \"when you think you're just being shuffled through a system, remember that your other choice was to NOT do chemo, and some people make that decision too, and it's OK, but remember that YOU are in control, and YOU get to decide\"  She said that remembering that has been helpful for her.  I thought I would pass along.",

JulieH: My fingertips are so sore, I can't even use them...I've started to turn on my electric toothbrush button with the middle of my thumb, you know? It's crazy! But, like you, way less nausea. Thank goodness. I am still taking emend (preventative measure) since I struggled so much with nausea on A/C. But I haven't had to take nearly the zofran or compazine that I needed on A/C.  On the neulasta...my doc said I don't need it, but I *am* dose dense on Taxol. Weird. I did ask her to pull a vitamin D level and she agreed, so I should get the results soon. Although, she went on to say that most of us would have a low Vit D level since it's wintertime (not enough going outside). She also said that she wouldn't know what to do with the results anyway. I think the US Recommended Daily Allowance of vitamin D was set to prevent Rickets. I don't think that RDA value takes breast cancer into account! Melissa hi!!! I 've been wondering about you!  Like Julie, I won't sugar coat the A/C. For me it was brutal. Treatment one was especially hard b/c i had the port put in and the chemo all in the same day. But Tx 2-3-4 were also extremely difficult for me. Nausea, constipation and fatigue (in that order) were my most difficult side effects. It took me a while to get the meds sorted out (most of the anti nausea meds create worse constipation than just chemo alone) but I did finally figure out to just STAY on the stool softener the whole time. I thought I could just take it starting the day before chemo. NOPE. Also...get some Miralax that stuff rocks. For me: My doc recommneded the L-glutamine (which I have) to prevent neuropathy. I don't know how much to take, but she said it's on the bottle. My bottle is just loose powder though, so hopefully they'll give me a teaspoon amount or something :) Good luck to all our girls getting chemo this week!",

I coloured at 8.5 wks, 10.5 wks and again around 13.5 wks. It's just literally *all* gray otherwise. And I'm 38, so I'm just not ready for that much gray. DH laughed and said, \"why waste time colouring if you're just wearing a scarf to work anyhow?\" Ha ha. I used the same box and just mixed up 1/3 of the soln's each time. So it wasn't really a waste of $ at all. I'm almost ready to go topless...just wish I had a bit more hair. Though, I am convinced that as soon as I get a bit more, it will start to stick up in odd places. As for the eyelashes and brows---me too, lots of thinning. I finally have some mascara on today, but i still use the eyebrow stuff to help powder them in a bit. BDavis: Feel better soon-sometimes it's the small victories that are the sweetest!!! ",

I had kind of been protecting him from that visual (he buzzed me with the clippers 15 days after my 1st chemo, but hasn't seen anything since.) Here's what he said, \"Well, you've certainly been holding out on me...were you waiting until you grew pigtails??\" Cracked me up :)",

I'm curious to see how they will react to me not having any hair. My nails survived chemo thankfully so I don't feel that the $ is wasted on getting them done. I'm more nervous about the facial and how that will be handled with me being bald. Then Sunday my baby boy turns 2. Lots going on!",

Ducky: I hope you are feeling better soon!! Question for group: Does your center do an x-ray every week \"just to make sure the setup is accurate\"? I don't like this; I don't want more xRays every week, that's like 6 additional xrays. Grrr... Have a great weekend ladies!",

I start on Monday the 23rd so I will brace myself for what's to come! On Radiation Brain: My DH just laughs. Said, \"first it was 'pregnancy' brain, then it was 'chemo brain' and now you think you'll develop 'radiation brain'...have you ever considered the fact that you're just forgetful?\" I just cracked up. He's so right :) I'm off to the spa tonight (massage, facial, mani-pedi) and although I'm anxious to see how they will deal with my lack of hair, i'm excited to be able to go (figured i wouldn't want to go after rads started for me...) Wish I had some hair though!",

Also. I got told I'd \"lose my hair\" not, \"my eyelashes, and my nose hair too\" They sort of left that part out.  Thanks to all for posting your experiences with rads. I start next Mon the 23rd. I already have my tattoos (they are very small, like a pin-point) and i'm ready to roll. Thx also Julie H for posting about Tom's Of Maine. I ordered some, but haven't tried it yet. I worry now that it will be a slimy mess. I'm *so* not going until July 8th with no deodorant. That's just the way it is. Another question for everyone: My RO told me no shaving that area for the duration of treatment. Really? Like, is this what all of your all's docs told you too? B/c seriously, I so should have been diagnosed so that I could have had rads in the winter... LOL Take it easy everyone!",

For me: I had my first treatment today. It was OK. Long drive to get there though (~45 mins) and I have the 7:15 time slot, so I left my house at 6:25 this morning. So far so good. I forgot, and wore my underwire bra. I'm ok for now. The only real discomfort I have is b/c they removed my port on Friday. The doc was in there scraping all over the place until I was finally like, \"Dude..what are you doing?\" He said, \"I'm disrupting some of this scar tissue\" So, OK--that disruption left some pretty serious bruising on my chest and boob. My port was in my cancer side, so they wanted it out before radiation could begin. Anyway, I'm kinda tired today, but seriously, not from radiation at all, from having my 4 yr old and 2 yr old boys with me today :) Take care everyone!",

I'm really so close to the end...but it's very difficult for me right now. I have 2 whole breast sessions left, and then 5 boost. Looking forward to being done on July 8th (and also looking forward to 3 day weekend!) My scratch off ticket was a \"free ticket today\" and I won $2 yesterday. Overall I've won $13 I think. (Spent $33) I have 7 tickets left. . . ",
