I had a double mastectomy, with sentinel nodes removed from both sides. No radiation, no chemo (oncotype 9), and I am on Arimidex for 5 years. I have just now been \"promoted\" to seeing the breast surgeon only annually, and the oncologist semi-annually. I had a scare a few months ago, with some frightening symptoms (pain, constant headaches) and the onc ordered a Pet Scan (my first one) and a brain MRI. Thankfully, they were both clear. Aside from that, the screening consists of a manual exam by the surgeon and the onc. I consider myself very fortunate to have caught the cancer at such an early stage.",

Routine mammogram showed calcifications in the right breast, which led to a diagnosis of DCIS. Only the pre-surgical bilateral MRI picked up a small lump in my left breast. This one was IDC, which led me to have a double mastectomy after already having a lumpectomy(right) and wide excisional biopsy (left). Six years out and doing great.",
