I've been reading a few other posts and am also wondering if she's a good candidate for experimental treatments?  I see some people saying that if it has spread to too many places they're no longer a good candidate... Thanks again.",

I really am so glad I found this board.  My mother in law is too overwhelmed to get on here herself.  Thank you all so much for your responses!",
