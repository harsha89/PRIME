Hello, I'm recovering from radiation burns. I'm no longer asking for more than 1-day while my skin is sore. In fact, he's letting me work at home tomorrow. I'm so grateful. As far as the other people, he's doing what's best, but I know one woman mentioned something to me, and her job is different and she's not able to work at home. She has to deliver paperwork to team members. I told her our jobs were different and why didn't she mind her own business when this first started. But, I feel that I have no \"friends\" in my dept. and it's not a great feeling, but today I'm oversensitive. I wouldn't want anyone else with breast cancer to go through what I'm going through. Or without it either ... you know what I mean. So, I'm just going to do the best job I can with G-d's help and your prayers. KateB - I wasn't for rads either, but the numbers decreasing reoccurence spoke to me. Reduces risk from 30% to 5% and that meant something to me. I'm glad to be done, but the fatigue is huge!

Luckily it was OK and I had treatment 6 of 16 and some will be to lumpectomy area only. I'm working from home today, thank goodness. Are you guys having any fatigue issues? I'm already tired after work and I seem to be more tired everyday. I may ask RO if I can work from home for the last few days and send that in to my HR for my FMLA leave. My boss has been great to work with on this. I'm very grateful. My Dream: I would love a vacation someplace warm after treatment. Reality: I hope to get at least a weekend out of town in the Spring. sos - I had CT scan before rads too. jerseygirl - welcome to the group. There's lots of support here. Thr-Yet - Welcome, I'm also fair skinned and am having some pinkness. I'd like to wake up from that dream too. Thinking of it as healing energy working on my body. Suz-Q - I had redness from Aquaphor that I used before rads. I'm now using an anti-inflammatory cream and RO says I don't need another. My breast is pink and a little tender. I position a pillow under it for sleeping. ctgal48 - I find a lot of comfort and support here. StefLove - hope that cream helps you. I had to take 1 week off rads with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory cream. Sadly, my RO and nurse were not very clear on skin care instructions before and during treatment. It was like a big mystery and nurse would only talk to me after 1st day of rads. I'm like a girl scout and want to be prepared, not rush out to get something. Now, I'm scared to use anything else since I had a reaction to the Aquaphor. I do agree that it's a case by case basis, depending on skin sensitivity. Mary - thanks so much for being the moderator and for your warm welcomes and kind words. I do wish everyone a happier and healthier 2016. Linda",

Shopgal: I agree, do not use any cream or lotion or deoderant before seeing RO. The nurse gave me some samples of Aquaphor and Miaderm. RO then said I can use Tom's deoderant (available at WalMart).

Patty - great quilt and get well cards. Thanks for sharing. Octogirl - thanks for the cooling cloth info. I have more questions ... Why is a cooling cloth better than a damp wash cloth?

Of course, I bought a $14 container of Aquaphor, thinking it would last me throughout radiation, and now can't use it because of reaction. I really don't want to use anything except natural items like Aloe or Calendula cream, but for today I was told not to use anything. Someone helped me immensely here by posting a link to a video of radiation treatment. I was very nervous for the SIM, which is longer than anything. Today they took some new films and did some new marks; I managed to keep most of the others by facing away in the shower and not letting water run over that side at all.

I had an issue with redness and swelling after my surgery, so my radiation was delayed too, but I'm thinking it works out in the end. Praying for you to heal. I'm having an anxiety attack. I'm pretty nervous during radiation and seem to tear up after on the way home; want to cry. Today, I did a visualization exercise after that helped earlier- soothing blue gentle raindrops healing my skin and body, to take away the heat I feel (on the inside). Glad to say I'm not red, just a little pink. Rad nurse asked Dr. and I can continue to use anti-inflammatory cream that surgeon gave me. I asked about aloe and calendula and she said RO said I can use aloe calendula, so now I'm thinking someone got signals crossed and am scared to try something else because of irritation I had that delayed rads for 1 week. Meet w/RO tomorrow, so find out how many sessions and more about lotion. Thurs. my appointment is at 7:30 am so I have to work from home and take a very early lunch. 3 of our cats are lining up in the bed meaning that I have to sleep in a different spot. Plus, being anxious doesn't do much for sleeping. Hope I can relax and sleep so I can work tomorrow. Octogirl, good for you ... going strong and just a little pink. Linda ",

I'm in so much pain under my boob; skin is broken, went to see Dr. on Wed. and he gave me something to mix in water and soak every 3-4 hours. Got a script for Tylenol 3 but I don't want to get it, so taking 3 Advil at a time per his instructions. Using aloe and ice and keeping part of a t-shirt under my boob and wearing t-shirt. Called off sick today and may again tomorrow. Can't ask to work from home for a while because someone in my dept. complained (and I know who it too - bitch!) Hubby brought home huge advil bottle and ice cream. Hope you all are doing well. Advil is making me sleepy now. Hugs, Linda",

I met with a counselor yesterday who suggested I think of rads more positively as \"positive healing rays flowing through my body\" (the image and words I came up with) and that's helping a bit to reduce the anxiety. I'm also working FT and I need to leave early to get the treatments at 3:15. The center says, \"we'll work with your schedule\" .... last appointment is 3:30pm (What??!!! I don't get why there aren't evening appointments) I get off at 3pm, so it's not too bad. Here's the snippy Chicago Jew coming out. Looking forward to meet RO nurse today to find out about lotions and if they'll be open on Christmas and New Years and other questions. She specifically told me that I'll find out everything today and only answered 1 question last week about Tom's deoderant. I find that a little irritating, since I like to be prepared and don't want to spend more time shopping or running around to pick up lotions or other things I'll need. I love the aloe plant gift idea. Years ago we had one, but with 4 cats now there's no way it would survive even 5 minutes in our house. Wish everyone well and thanks for the support, Linda",

She said not to put anything on 2 hours before treatment. I purchased Aquaphor right after and put it on that night and around 11am before 1st treatment. NOTE: I would pester them about lotions and sensitive skin (if you have it, like me) before using anything. I don't know why it's a secret until the day before. I love that someone got to watch a video and get information beforehand. That's how it SHOULD be. I didn't try them before purchasing Aquaphor, and I bought a huge jar. I put it on before the first treatment and wore a cotton T-shirt - they had to wipe it off and told me to apply it after the treatment and later at night. Before 1st treatment, yesterday they noticed my breast was a little pink/red and marked it up to see if it spread. I've done 2 things different: new laundry detergent and the Aquaphor. Today, I put it on again after treatment, then realized I should have tried the other type which is only available at the hospital Walgreens. Today, my right breast is still a little red, warm to the touch and they called my surgeon to see if she can get me in. It might be cellitis (a skin infection). Might be having a reaction to the Aquaphor - I'll tell them tomorrow. I made a sign from a coloring book and my first day, thinking about the Healing Rays coming down over my body. And I brought a lovely prayer for healing adapted from the one from Rebbe Nachman of Bratslav from a book my rabbi gave me when I was diagnosed. One of the techs said it with me, which was nice. Oh, then my rabbi didn't call me after the surgery ... nor did any of my friends from the synagogue, so I quit. I am in touch with another rabbi who is praying for me and can follow my progress on Facebook.   I may have some scotch tonight; I'm a little nervous about this redness. I asked RO if I could ice it or put warm heat and he said to wait for the surgeon to call me in the morning. All my techs are women and they are terrific. I'm grateful for them - they help me to make it as smooth and quick as possible. Haven't had music yet. Good luck everybody :) Linda ",
