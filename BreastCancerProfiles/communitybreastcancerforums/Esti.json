Even though she can't tell the difference between the toaster, a loaf of bread and my purse (she put my credit cards in the toaster one time and believe me, it was the very last place I thought of looking!!) Despite all that, her spirit is the same. She is still sweet, bossy and collects things. No matter how damaged her brain is, her heart is the same. I wish the same for you. (And now might be the time to get rid of any embarassing items in your home before you forget that you have them: George Clooney posters, love letters that you wrote in your teens, Britney Spears CDs...) I don't think that anything can break your strong, lovely spirit and you have a lot of people wishing the best for you. Jenny",

You might be a bit overwhelmed and when emotions get involved it's hard to think clearly. (I heard 'cancer has spread to your lymph nodes..' and then all I heard was 'wha-whaa-wha wha wha' like the teacher in the Peanuts cartoon.) Keep everything in a binder or something similar, and occasionally review it.  You'll be inundated with a lot of imformation and terms that will be new to you. I believe knowledge is power and wanted to know everything.  I went through chemo and rads with two women, one of which chose not to know very much about her disease or treatment. For her that worked. You have good sounding boards right here. And I'll be with you in spirit - I'm seeing my oncologist on the 21st as well to go over my recent mammogram on my 'good' side. Jenny",
