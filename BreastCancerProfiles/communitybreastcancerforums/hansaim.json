I do not do well with hormonals though the pathology showed ER+, PR+. I did not know each cycle of Halavenis two treatments. I am feeling fine today. No nausea, yet. Will see how it goes in the next couple of days. The hospital scheduled me for 6 cycles. I just hope that it works well and my body can take it as planned. A beautiful sunny day here in BC!

My white counts always take a beating so I get neupogen after every treatment. HAIR-- I did lose my hair, unfortunately. The last two times, I shaved as soon as hair started coming out. This time, as I was hoping that hair would just thin out, I did not shave. I still have some hair left on the sides and back that a hat does the trick. In the first couple of weeks, it was messy as I was shedding everywhere. I vacuumed my head and shoulders and used the lint roller. Hate losing hair! It's the touque season, so it's not as bad as in the summer. I have not worked since my dx 3 years ago. I am amazed at the gals who continue to work while coping with stage 4. All the best.

She is one of the breast specialists at a large research hospital. I chose to be referred there thinking that I would have the benefit of being cared by a doctor who is on top of the latest research and clinical trials, etc. However, my treatment so far has been pretty standard; tamoxifen failure right away to mets, A/A (with Afinitor only for a month) failed, then Xeloda for 16 months, onto to 6 cycles of Abraxane. She gave me 2 months of chemo break in Aug. When I asked that I wanted to try another hormonal like Faslodex, she did not think that I would benefit. and said no. After the break, the CT showed some progression in lungs and lymph nodes. She said to continue the break for another 2 months until the end of December. YIKES!! I am 45 and relatively in good health to handle treatments right now. I sought a second opinion and started Faslodex with Afinitor this week. Praying hard that the combo can keep me going for a while. But if it does not, I can cross off the combo off the chart and move on.",

Before the three months scan, I knew that it was not working as the pain worsened and my mobility declined significantly while on A/A. Now I am on the 2nd cycle of Xeloda. I will be getting a scan after 4 cycles. In the mean time, I notice that the pain has improved and I am able to walk better. I can walk with a cane instead of a walker and can even take a few steps inside without a cane! Now here comes the question. When the pain and symptom improve, does it normally indicate stability or regression? Has anyone experienced a case where you felt better but had progression while on treatment? Thank you.

But this time, though the markers are going down, I am not feeling better. Back pain is worse and I am not as stable on my feet as I used to be so back on the cane I go. I had a spine MRI today. I am waiting for a PET scan to be scheduled. With the holidays, it may be in the new year. Thanks gals for waiting here with me.",

I have not bought new clothes, things for my home or garden for a long time. I trashed the dream house renovation plan. The ladies here are so right in that you do what you enjoy. But sometimes, especially after progression and change of treatment, nothing gives me joy. When I feel that way, I remind myself that I keep going because of my husband and two kids (12 and 9 yrs). Another week, another month, another year that I am around is more time that my kids have their mom. Yes, they will be fine after I die. My parents are close to my kids and my husband will do well for them, but they won't have mom. I want them to remember me and all that we did together. Hugs.",
