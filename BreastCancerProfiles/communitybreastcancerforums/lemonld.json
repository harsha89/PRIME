Good luck I know how it feels, also as an FYI in the winter time my feet would get very sore when they got cold and I purchased a pair of Happy Feet house shoes and they were wonderful, didn't leave home with them.  They can be purchased on line at www.buyhappyfeet.com if you are interested. Hope this is of some help! Hugs, Linda",

I wish you good luck on your tx and also wish you a Happy Anniversary.  Even though you will be receiving tx that day you can still celebrate that 1st anniversary, make each day count. Hugs, Linda",

I had the first one removed and when I needed IV chemo I had another on put back in. It some much easier than using a vein. I will mention that when I have had any scan they will not use my port. They say that the contrast can clog the port??? not sure why? Hugs, Linda",

I was taken off of the Xeloda in June due to the toxicity of the drug and remain on the Taxotere with good results.  Good luck with your tx and remember we are here to help...just ask....as I tell my college students \"There are no dumb questions, only the ones you don't ask\"!
