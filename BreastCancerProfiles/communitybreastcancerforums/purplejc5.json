Just taking Extra Strength Tylenol 3 days after surgery. From what my husband says my surgeon took 3 tumors instead of the 3 that they saw and removed 4 lymph nodes. I\u2019m hoping he was being cautious and not because there was more than he thought. I guess my fear is now, did I make the right decision? It seemed right at the time. Here I am waiting again-Lymph Node results. I will get those on Tuesday.

I\u2019m putting on Aquaphore, sometimes Aloe Vera gel (if I can\u2019t stand the stickiness). I\u2019m doing whole breast, 16 treatments with 4 boosts. Let\u2019s all hang in there together.

I chose the 16 treatments and was confident in my decision. I am trying to think positively that my SE\u2019s would be minimal. I went for my CT Scan and tattoo markings today and told the radio tech what my decision was. He proceeded to tell me how much I was going to burn (I\u2019m larger breasted) and told me I didn\u2019t need to put on my cream of choice (Aquaphore) until after I got home and I wouldn\u2019t like Aquaphore because it is \u201cgummy\u201d. I\u2019m trying so hard to make choices according to the great info I\u2019ve gotten from this site and staying positive. Now I\u2019m questioning everything I thought I would do. Please help with your experiences and any tips would be greatly appreciated.
