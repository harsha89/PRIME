I had the liver biopsy and while I was afraid to have it -- it was not bad at all.  If it is a secondary cancer, the chemotherapy drugs used for breast cancer may not treat the liver cancer.  My oncologist specializes only in breast cancer (he's #3 in this country) and he won't treat a patient until he has all the facts -- and you can't get those facts without scans, biopsies, etc.  I wish you the best...keep fighting, it's worth the fight.",
