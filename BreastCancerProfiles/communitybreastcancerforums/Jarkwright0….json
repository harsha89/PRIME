I had a double mastectomy and reconstruction last year with no radiation or chemo, ONCO score (11). They wanted me on tamoxifen but I couldn\u2019t tolerate the side effects. I had a local reoccurrence of the exact same cancer come back this year and had a lumpectomy. Drs want to do radiation and hormone therapy (putting me into menopause). I don\u2019t know now if I want that beast either so they gave me choice of chemo. Also concerned about neuropathy with chemo as I can tolerate short term stuff but not sure about long term side effects. I am 38yrs old and have a 5.5yr old and don\u2019t want this a third time.",
