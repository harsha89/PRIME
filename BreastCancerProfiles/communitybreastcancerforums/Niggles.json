Without thinking quickly enough I agreed to biopsy before they checked the bookings for consultation with surgeon. So biopsy has 'woken' the monster as it were, but Thursday appointment requested stretched to Tuesday (tomorrow) to meet surgeon. Why don't they think before they open their mouths? Radiologist said he would call but then \"if I don't call you call me...\" Seriously?? When I am over this I will give them some handy hints, but having said that, they are very kind and I feel in good hands. Big day tomorrow I think. Spending most of the morning on a 'make over' treat so I will rock up to appointment looking the best ever. I feel like I need a 'before' image, and it will give me something to aim for 'after'. Adult sons proof that no-one listens after the \"I've got cancer\" words. One rang at 2:00am to wish me well for surgery not yet even scheduled. I said I would take the love he sent and please send more next week. Partner - kind of downplaying this. Difference of approach - I want information and to mull over the 'what if's' he thinks it is just a lump will be removed and on we go. I hope he is right. May find out tomorrow. Thanks for the website. When I tell the clinic how to improve their client interaction I will suggest a sheet of helpful websites. Breastcancer.org might be at the top!",
