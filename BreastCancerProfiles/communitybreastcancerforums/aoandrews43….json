The hair buzzing was also very traumatic for me--the way it just would pull out in large clumps just felt horrible but I couldn't quite bring myself to accept that it was coming out. However, I did feel MUCH better once I decided \"okay, its coming out no matter what\" and went ahead an just buzzed it off--I think it is one of those things that is so bad in the anticipation that it is better to just do it. I like my wig although I don't like wearing it all day (and have an 11 year old who isn't quite comfortable seeing me in just a cap) so we'll see how  that goes. I also find that my glasses aren't comfortable with the wig and wondering about finding some softer pieces to put on the end of my glasses.  I would like to know more about the risk of permanent hair loss with taxotere. The stories I\"ve read seem to be mostly by the same people across the Internet, so it is hard to know if this is  just a horrible thing that happened to a few people, or something more common.

But I walked and exercised and feel a lot better than  I expected. I'm even able to eat vegetables, which was the first thing to go  when I had nausea from pregnancy (11+ years ago). I have had some tingling feeling in my hands, but not too bad. So the anxiety was worse than the reality. I feel like I'm still waiting for the other shoe to drop or for it to get much worse next time--but maybe that won't be the case. I'm going to a 'look good, feel better' seminar tomorrow--supposedly they give you lots of free makeup and stuff. I'm not much of a make up wearer, but hopefully I'll learn a lot since I have a feeling I'll need it soon. Oh, I've found small ginger candies can be good to chew on with the low level nausea, if you like ginger (these are called 'gin-gins' from the Ginger People--they aren't too sweet so they don't make your mouth hurt).  Thanks to everyone for keeping the updates - it really is helpful to see how everyone is doing.

But now I'm waiting for the hair to come out and dreading it a bit. Nadine54 --thanks for your story, it is great to hear you felt okay bald once you went ahead and just did it. I didn't have great hair to begin with, but I did cut it from mid-length to short a few weeks ago. That really has helped me deal with the loss. I wanted a short wig for summer and actually am liking my shorter cut--but it took me about 2 weeks to get used to it. I go Monday to have the wig I picked out styled (and thinned--much poofier than I'm used to). I went to a \"Look good, feel better\" session last week and it was really fun.I'm going to try acupuncture next week for the first time as well. I figure I should try to do anything that might help me manage my feelings about this process. Wishing everyone a healthy, feel-good rest of the weekend.",

They have TVs, and I have a computer and could watch movies or bring books. I know it will be really hard to concentrate, so any advice you have about good distractions would be great.  Nadine54--I like your bracelet idea as a distraction. I've had a difficult time functioning this week with the anticipation of the unknown coming up. I had a counselor show me around the infusion suite and have bugged my doc with lots of questions. However, I'm not sure having all that information helps the anxiety. I had bilat mastectomy and read all the lists and bought all the stuff and then found I didn't use most of it and needed different things, so it is hard to know how to prepare.I work outside the home, so that helps as a distraction, but I find I don't get much work done during the day because it is hard to focus. An oncology nurse said that biotin can help the problems with fingernails on Taxotere. Has anyone tried that?  Also, has anyone ordered a wig from wigsalon.com? We have a good boutique where I live, but I didn't like the selection there and found a cute one I like on that web site. I live in New Hampshire and while close to Boston, there aren't a ton of places nearby to look at wigs and try them on.   Thanks,",
