    "Content": "partyof5 wrote: I had an excisional biopsy one week ago to remove a 2.5cm mass but I didn't get to speak with the Dr. post op to find out exactly how much tissue was removed in all. I am waiting for results still but I imagine if it was cancerous I would have heard by now, but he did tell my husband that it looked benign (not sure if they can tell by looking, but he seemed confident). My question is that prior to having the lump removed my breast was soft with no real mass to it outside of the lump when I would lie on my back (both of my breast were the same). Now however the one that had the lump is hard if I sit, stand, or lie down (in other words it no longer flattens out in a lying position if that makes sense). Since my breasts are not very big it is a substantial part of my breast now that is hard tissue. The cut is almost entirely healed, the bruising is only faint now, but I find the hardening of tissue under the surface odd. Is this normal? Does it soften back up after awhile? I am seeing my Dr. for follow up in another 5 days but this is kinda weird to me since he never mentioned that the area would change. I am not in any pain, but to the touch it feels knotted up under the skin. I can't think of a better way to describe it. Thanks for any feedback. * (I posted this same question on another forum so I apologize for the repeat) Log in to post a reply",
