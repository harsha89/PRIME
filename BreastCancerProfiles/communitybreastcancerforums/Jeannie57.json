The only thing I didn't like much was the spin class. We were on more upright, stationary bikes but it is still hard not to put too much pressure on the arms by leaning on the handlebars. One gal had a swollen hand the next day. The seats were too hard, too! We did a water exercise class which was fun. Now I go on my own and run laps in the pool, throwing in some lunges and jumping jacks. I also sit on a couple \"noodles\" and bicycle my way across the pool, which I'm sure engages the core a lot for balance. It's fun. I'll be sad when the class ends early May. ",

Our schedule reserves practically the whole pool for water ex or walk from noon- 1 everyday, as well as other times. Maybe if enough people expressed an interest they would respond. The important thing is to move somehow, somewhere! I was so lucky that my LS trainer was all over the LE, especially after reading the material I gave her.

Her mom was so depressed after breast cancer surgery that they came up with an exercise routine involving a little dance that stretched the affected arm and opened the lymph system. Sherry has taught the method in many countries and there have been something like twelve studies published in journals on the benefits of the Lebed method. Of course, even though Sherry, the LS instructor and a couple other gals have LE, I was the only one wearing a sleeve or, in my case, sleeves. I don't get that. ",

I don't want to mess with these arms. Who knows what they'll do to me during DIEP surgery.",

Toward the end of my visit, 2 nurses came and asked me about the sleeves, like how long will I have to wear them? And they never see patients with them. They were surprised when I told them it's usually a lifelong condition. It's true, I never see anyone wearing them, neither in everyday life or at the cancer center. The OT gal also asked me about them. She said to me, \"That's not true! You don't have to wear them for the rest of your life!\" I'm so tired of explaining and educating those who should know.
