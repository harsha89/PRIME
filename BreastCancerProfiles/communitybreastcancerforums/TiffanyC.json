I am fortunate that my insurance company is covering the cost of Afinitor. I had absolutely no problems. My insurance company list Afinitor as a non-preferred drug, but does not require prior authorization. No questions asked.I didn't have to go throught any appeals process. For the first month on Afinitor, my doctor was checking me weekly. There are not many studies on Tamoxifen and Afinitor. He was worried about drug interactions, specifically liver and kidney functions. Other than the typical side effects of Afinitor, I have not had any issues.  I had some success with only tamoxifen. Scans showed significant improvement, but my tumor markers were irregular. It has only been two months, but the tumor markers have seemed to stablize. I have yet to be scanned since starting Afinitor.  Best of Luck! ",
