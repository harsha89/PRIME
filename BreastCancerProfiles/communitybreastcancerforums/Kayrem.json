Bad allergies before - hay fever, asthma (did whole chemo treatment on ventolin and Alvesco), horrible sinus headaches, finished treatment and use Ventolin less than times a week only. No sinus headaches nothing. However I will say that since diagnosis I got one of those adjustable beds and always sleep with my head adjusted up 6 to 7 inches. I notice when I sleep flat after a few days I wake up with congestion and a headache (which is how it was when I had allergies).",

Has anyone suggested genetic counselling for you? If not, I really think you should consider getting genetic counselling and testing for a BRCA mutation. I am the youngest of 4 kids and the only one in my family who had a BRCA 1 mutation. My grandma died of ovarian but that was over 50 years ago and none of my doctors believed me because there were no medical records. You really have to push for things in order to get your piece of mind. Take care and hope you have a speedy recovery from your PBMX. I noticed you had it on March 25. That was my 50th birthday! I am almost 4 years ( June 28) out from stage 3 triple negative and feeling pretty good. Take care - you will get there too! Karen",

Came home today with 2 drains (2 were removed earlier today. Yah!!!). I have slept and ate really well and I am not in too much pain. Not too bad for me but glad that I NEVER have to repeat this again! I hope everyone else is feeling better or starts to real soon! For all of you waiting...I think the anticipation of it was the worst. I did not get reconstruction and it does not look as bad as I thought it would. Definitely worse frame of mind pre surgery versus post. My thoughts are with all of you waiting and those of you recovering. This is my second surgery (first was June 2011). It totally gets better and you will get back to your new \"normal\" in no time. Take care all. Karen",

My white blood cells are consistently under 3.0 (2.7) and my neutrophils are very low at 1.2 (last blood work June 19, 2014). I used to be very worried about it but now I am pretty sure it is because of my tumeric and green tea consumption. I am BRCA1 pos. and had my prophy procedures done in March 2013. Before the procedures I needed to go off tumeric 2 weeks prior (I also quit the green tea) and on the day of the procedure all my counts were in normal range (3.5 for WBC, etc.). I figured the combo of green tea and tumeric daily was giving me a gentle type chemo. I rarely get sick and if I do it is just 5-7 days and gone. I read somewhere (science daily I think) that neutrophil nets could possibly be a mechanism of metastasis seeding. So I went back on the tumeric and green tea. I have no clue what my numbers are now. I will book an appointment soon and get tested. Just thought I would mention my experience.",

I have read that the laparoscopic procedure ( which I will be having) is not so bad - 2 days in hosp, etc. I actually believe people this time.

Then last week wednesday, after going to my son's last hockey game (yeah - they lost but I was SOOO glad they were done) I bent and stretched awkwardly to get something out of the oven. I did feel something strange and I thought uh oh. Then Thursday I couldn't get out of bed. It hurt to breathe. My BS said to put a hot water bottle on it (covered with a towel of course) and just sit around all day. I forgot and put the water bottle on over my pajamas for about 2 mins but it was hot so I asked my husband to get me a towel. Sat in bed all day Thursday, woke up Friday feeling much better, looked in he mirror and realized I burnt my back! So now I have 3 or 4 nasty water blisters on my back ( the size of a quarter or less). I can not believe I did that! I suppose the silver lining is just like I could not tell that I burnt myself ( no nerves) I also have no pain from the burn! Anyways I am better and I do not have alot of pain but everyone out there should be very careful if they use a hot water! Foreverchanged - i actually felt sympathy pain reading your hug story.

They had just watched my dad die 10 months earlier from metatastic lung cancer. They did not understand that not all cancers are the same. I did the same as earlier poster, I kept it simple. I told them that I would do everything the doctors told me to do in order to get better but I never told them that I would not die. They never asked. I only kept it simple and positive. Now almost 4 years later my daughter does not remember all the things that happened to me. I have used almost all the time since then to fill their heads with good memories ( not enough room for the bad). The worst time after finding my lumps was the time between then and starting chemo. I was so scared and sad. I really felt all alone for the first 1.5 months, then a close friend was diagnosed with the same cancer (triple negative) and then I really felt bad. But here I am almost 4 years later planning my summer. If you do not have family close by, tell friends. Do not be afraid to ask for help. Sometimes it comes from the strangest places. My husbands family did nothing to help until his second cousin (whom he had not spoken to in years) showed up at our door with his wife kids and a weeks worth of meals. Then they asked if we needed anything and we did need help!! When something like this happens we think we have no time, but we do. You will be where I am soon enough, unfortunately you just have to get through some really crappy months ahead. Take care Kate and take heart, things will get better.",
