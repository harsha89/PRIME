I was reading your information and I was just wondering how you are doing on the tc and what round you are currently on. I have had some problems with stomach pain and breathing for just a few days afterwards then it gets better. I also seem to have some nerve twitching in my eyes but I have not read where any one else has had issues with twitching. All and all it is going pretty good. Have you had round 3? Thanks I am new to this group but have had a great time reading all of the stories. My next chemo is 5/13",

      "Content": "Apr 29, 2009 04:02PM - edited Apr 29, 2009 04:04PM by GMK Mom of Boys-  Thank you so much for the info. I will be seeing a neuologist on Monday because I also have numbness on the left side of my chin and inside my mouth I have had it for about 4 weeks now. Just like I had a shot from the dentist. My chemo doc says it is not chemo related, so he is sending me to the neurologist, this 2nd time hit me a little harder after one week later I am still having rapid heart beat and lots of stange taste...I hope number 3 will be a little better. Have you had round 3 yet? I love this site, you mentioned that there is tc chemo info available on a separate thread within this chemotherapy section.  How do I find it? Thanks for all of you help GMK",
