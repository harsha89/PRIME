In December of 2014 I found a lump in my areola and a indentation in the lower outer quadrant, and went to a doctor and she said \"oh it's nothing just mastitis I think\" but it didn't change no matter what I did. So I moved and forgot about it until one day in February, and I made another appointment. He said that it looked fine as well but we could get a ultrasound for my piece of mind. The radiologist had her supervisor come in and he said that it was glandular tissue that rested over a vein in my areola (the bump) and said that it would shrink once I was done nursing. I'm nursing my babies for 15mos so far and its still there. My indentation is what concerns me most because it's in line with the lump in my areola but there's nothing under it and I have no idea why it looks so big and scary and no one seems to mind it. I made another appointment in a week but I just am worried because of all the stuff I have been reading. Could this just be from lactation? If this helps my chest grew from 34c to40dd could that be why I have a indentation? Like ligaments being stretched out? Any answers would help me with my anxiety, thank you so much! I don't have any family history either. I'm just really nervous because no one seems to know what is going on... Log in to post a reply",
