My pathology report is the best one you can get I guess, Low-Grade DCIS stage 0. I had a Lumpectomy last Thursday and I must say that wire deal they did on me hurt like hell!! I am now waiting to hear how my margins are. The Microcalcifications were at the 6 o'clock position.  The waiting is the hardest but I'm glad It was caught so early! No family history either.                                             Thanks For Being Here   Dx 7/9/2009, DCIS, Stage 0, Grade 1, 0/0 nodes Log in to post a reply",

I hate to sleep on my back. I think I will be having one more surgery on that. See that octor next Thursday. It hurts my heart to see so many woman going through so much so fast and here I am with the best one and some with such shocking news. Cancer puts things in perspective as to what is REALLY important. I for one am such a selfish person but I'm learning to let go.                                    Hugs Back .......Renee                                    ",

Yea I know what ya mean bout the welcome :-) but once one gets over the I have cancer it really does fit....maybe that's what the lepers said of old when they greeted the new arrivals. So many strong women on here that just step out and say hello, like you Athena. I don't think I'l give you a hug just yet, maybe wait a few months? Sounds like you might be sore. I think I'll just reach out and give your hand a squeeze.                                         Renee   ",

My lumpectomy was done last Thursday and I am struggling with the waiting game but it's getting better because of all those that have gone before. For me I try to stay in today and deal with what's on my plate today....then I'll find myself out there with the what if's and have to reel myself back in. One day your on one path and the next your looking through the brush for the road. Dissect this site and know your not alone.                      Renee ",
