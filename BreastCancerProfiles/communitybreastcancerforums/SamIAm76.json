Then I noticed that I have an area of thickening in that breast as well. I do not feel a lump. The area of thickening feel different or \"thicker\" than the rest of my breast tissue and is very obvious even when I look at it. I also have a few lymph nodes near my right breast that seem enlarged to me. At first I was not alarmed, I thought I'd just keep an eye on it. I'm getting older and thought maybe it could be cyclic and maybe it would go away in a month or so. Since I found the indentations, I started having a stinging pain in 2 spots in that breast, 1 spot is right where the 2 side by side indentations are and the other spot is felt under the thickened area. This pain comes and goes, sort of, but I feel it everyday and do not feel anything in my left breast at all. I have decided that these breast changes can not be cyclic, there are never any changes in the indentations or the thickened area or the lymph node enlargement. To document this, instead of relying on my own memory, and so I can have something to show a doctor when I finally get to have this looked at...I have taken photos about monthly or so at about the same time per month, I started the day I noticed the indents/thickening. The last time I took a photo and looked at it, I notice that the thickening is increasingly obvious and that the 2 indents seem to be slightly deeper. I can now see both indents without lifting my hands above my head, with my arms at my sides. My left breast has a very normal shape, my right breast is wonky. The nipple on my right breast points in a very different direction than my left nipple and is slightly pulled inward. I do not have medical insurance. I've made loads of phone calls here in the Dallas, Tx area and I'm not having any luck finding a free/low cost exam and mammo. I don't know what to do. I'm scared to keep watching this get worse and not have it looked at. I'm a mother of 3 wonderful boys and the thought of this whole thing is terrifying. My husband and my sister are also concerned and want me to see a doctor but we're having trouble making ends meet, it will be months before I could even hope to have the funds for this expensive testing. The longer I \"wait and see\" the more concerned I become because I KNOW this cannot be cyclic. If anyone know of resources that might be available to me, please respond with that info so I can have this looked at. Thank you. I just don't know what else to do. Log in to post a reply",

I have this itch in the same spot as the indents, I have a burn/stinging sensation there also. My breast looks nothing like the other one anymore, nothing. It is puffy and very wonky, a different shape. The lymph nodes that I thought were swollen seem to be slightly bigger and the \"lump\" seems slightly bigger. Not that I measured it, and it could very well be in my head, but I feel/see a difference. This all only started in March or so and I have monthly photos that show a progression of the indents and puffiness and my breast getting more and more wonky. This waiting thing is killing me. :( To make matters worse, my husband and I were rearended last month and my neck/shoulder/back are in constant pain, so now I'm also dealing with the stress of takiung care of that injury. Then there's also a rash of bad health going through my family right now. My mother has been in the hospital twice and my brother has been in the hospital twice and he is now living with me and under my care for end stage liver failure. I'm so overly stressed right now that I had to start taking an antidepressant. I'm just here to vent, in need of a shoulder to cry on. I feel very alone. My husband is very loving and supportive normally but I think he is more scared than he lets on about what's going on with my breast also, so he's been a bit distant. You know.....Not knowing what's going on with your body is hard enough but having to wait until November is incredibly difficult.",

I did call Parkland and make an appointment for August 8th. They work on a sliding scale based on income, so I hope they won't demand money that day to see me, if they do I'll have to walk out. We've been so broke that I don't know how I'm going to buy my kids' school supplies, much less pay for a dr appointment! I try to reassure myself that it's likely some benign condition but it feels pretty impossible to not be stressed over it, especially considering the fact that the look and feel of my breast is worse now that it was when it started. Thank you for suggesting Parkland, by the way, fingers crossed that it works out.",

She saw my indentation (plus an indentation below the nipple that I hadn't noticed) and nipple retraction and asymetry, she even felt a grape sized \"lump\" that I hadn't noticed. She referred me for a mammogram and sonogram. I called to set up the appointment for my scans and they can't get me in until November. I'm really really bummed and freaking out. She marked my scans \"time critical\" on my paperwork and in the computer system but that is the best they can do. I was told at the main hospital, when scheduling the scan appointment, that time critical is why I'm getting an appointment (everyone else gets put on a waiting list!) I'm really freaking out now. I've had symptoms for over 3 months now and I've seen it progress just in that time, so now I just think it's going to get worse yet before my appointment which is just over ANOTHER 3 months away. I'm very sad and scared. :( MelissaDallas....I want to thank you again, hon, for suggesting that I call Parkland. While I might be waiting another 3 months, at least I'm able to have it looked at now. Much appreciation to you, and to the other ladies that have posted resources for me. I'm glad I found this website.",

About a month ago I was getting out of a shower and was naked in front of the mirror. I just happened to notice 2 very noticeable indentations on my right breast, close to each other, in the upper outer area above the nipple. On further examination I noticed the the inner part of my right breast looks pretty puffy, not swollen, but thicker I guess. It's quite obvious (to me and to my husband) to the point that my breast seems a bit deformed and enlarged. The puffy area also feels thicker or more firm, I'm not sure how to describe it. I examined even more and I think I have 2 swollen and tender lymph nodes, 1 above the breast and 1 at the corner of my breast towards my armpit. My breasts have always felt slightly lumpy to me, and now I'm not sure but I \"think\" I feel a small lump in my breast just below where the indentation is. My breasts are DD cup size but these past few weeks it seems my right breast is now a DDD and does not fit in any of my bras. Over the past few weeks I've become somewhat obsessed and have even noticed my nipple has inverted and is thicker than the other nipple, as well as pointing in a slightly different direction. I've also had occasional (but daily) burning pain and itching in/on my right breast. The itching is all over the upper area of the breast and the burning is in 2 spots, 1 spot near the indentations and the other spot is where the \"puffy\" feel and appearance is. I don't know what to think but I'm worried out of my mind. I have 3 sons, 1 of which would be orphaned if anything happened to me. I'm going later this week to a clinic that offers free exams, because I do not have medical insurance. I worry about going to a free clinic, I don't believe you get the best treatment or diagnosis that way (and worry that they aren't specialists.) I don't know what else to do though. Anyone with similar experience? I could use some shoulders to cry on! I'm terrified. Log in to post a reply",
