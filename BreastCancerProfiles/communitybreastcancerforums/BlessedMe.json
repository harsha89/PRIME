I really thought I could continue to just lerk but have found myself wanting to share and ask questions.... so here goes. I found my lump trying to position my large breast in my large bra and holy crap...what is that. Was  DX early Feb with 2cm IDC in the left and oh... they also found DCIS in my right breast. From the start I decided on the BMX without question. Had surgery on 4/7 and found out that 1/15 lymph nodes was positive on the left side. (ER+ PR- and HR+) Grade 3. I do not have ANY family history and actually have not know anyone with breast cancer over my 55 years , Surprise! I love my BS, MO and my PS and would not trade them for anything as they have been honest, up front and have answered all of my detailed oriented personality questions. I am on the TCH cocktail and am doing OK... I say OK because of each of you. Your post have allowed me to confirm that all is ok with the SE's that I am having. I have everything ready for anything that can happen thanks to all of you! I have number 5 of 6 on Monday and am very worried about the fatigue as it is the worst for me. Standing and pealing two potatoes is good but add the third and I am screaming that I can do three then try to run to the chair to rest. LOL I have a Fitbit and try so hard to get at least 5000 steps per day but sometime it is just too much. I feel like I am 90 some days but reading here helps me more than you will ever know. . Thank you all and everything each of you have done for ME and I hope that I will be able to add to the team as we continue our journey. I truly love each and everyone of you. You will never know the impact you have had on my life and my BC journey. One just hopes they can pay it forward.        ",

Congrats to you MomMom and Longisland for finishing chemo!! It is a day we all look forward to and I keep telling myself just 3 more weeks and I will be DONE . Guess then I will then start counting down the days till the last Herceptin. SharonDe -  Tired ladies club gives new meaning to TLC. Made me LOL!! Mascaruso - I had a love hate relationship with my port for over a month. I did not like it one bit but I am now so glad I have it. Now I don't even know that little jewel is in there. I get so stressed after so many have missed finding a vein over and over. Why is it that they can call the IV team and they get it the first time? What's with that? Are they not all trained to do it the same way?  Some say you can keep the port up to 10 years and that just might me be because I had nodes taken on both sides. Brigadoonbenson- I would have been out to the car in a flash to get my port card! Pun intended... MakeLemonade - How are the antibiotics working? I hope you are feeling better and congrats on your last Taxol next week. ColdInCanada - Yes, you totally kicked it!! Hope you are getting stronger everyday and ready to celebrate! Let us know when your energy starts to come back. I am on the same treatment plan and am very interested in when you start seeing the fatigue subside. I am scheduled to fly from Atlanta to Seattle the 4th week after my last treatment and hope I have the energy to get there...Congrats!! Applepop - Congrats on your last treatment today!! Hope all is well and I wish you few SE's in the days ahead. I so get the exhausted feeling. Cheers!! Clarrn - Hope you are resting well at home. Sorry you are going through so much! Praying your veins hold up. Ddkath70 - I remember seeing your balloon wall and it is looking mighty fine. I had a wonderful day today! My DD came over with my 6 year old grandson. We had fun at the park then went to a ceramic place and painted our hearts out. I don't see him much between treatments so it was great to talk to him as he has such a honest outlook on life and delights my world.   I hope you all have a most wonderful weekend!    ",

Today I still feel very blessed but am so confused. Just when I was ready to get my pom poms out for finishing my final chemo on 8/18 I got knocked back. I feel as though I got through rounds 1-5 pretty good with all of the tough but expected SE's then round 6 kicked my butt big time. My SE's went through their normal cycle but were more intense for some reason. I thought my arm and legs were just going to fall off on day 5. This past Friday I went to my PT appointment and was excited about going to get my nails done finally and then off to get my hair trimmed up. (I did not shave my head so I had thin strands) I was feeling great about starting to get reset but started having heavy chills. Well..... got home took my temp and WOW..... it was 101.5 so I called and was told to go to the ER. Temp jumped to 103 in ER and I was having the worse chills of my life. They did blood work, two types of antibotics through my port, chest Xray, CT scan, pee check and everything came back normal except I had a very mild UTI. I was finally released today and they never did find out why I was running a temp. While there my hemoglobin went from 8.1 to 8.7 then down to 7.3 yesterday so, last night they gave me two pints of blood and now I have this huge headache. Yesterday I would have been out of breath just typing this. I do feel a bit better but I am still soooo very tired. Those of you that have received blood, when does feel better stage start? Has anyone heard of or had such and experience? I don't mean to be a winny baby but I just can figure out what has just happened and the idea of getting blood is still a bit freaky.I have not had time to do my normal research so any insight will be greatly appreciated.  ",

I have made so many along with other treats and typing has to be less calories. I said no to rads!  Not so sure of the decision yet. Three days prior to my surgery a report came out showing that 1-3 nodes involved would benefit from rads. I had only one with a BMX so am taking a chance -Vs- the 2% gain. If I had 2 or 3 nodes positive I would have done rads. I still have time to change my mind but still leaning to no rads. I am fearful of heart and lung hits due to the BMX.",

Go to get the dreaded shot today and have the recliner all set and ready for the roaming bone pain that will start tomorrow night or Thursday. Steroids are allowing me to only get about 4 to 5 hours of sleep. Ugh! Up this morning at 4 with the sweats. Using Poise wipes to help and they cool me right down but no luck going back to sleep. I did not shave my head and still have about 10% of my hair that is pretty evenly spread with some new growth coming in. Eyelashes and eyebrows are hanging in there so far, so are my nails. I hope this last. The fatigue is by far the worst for me and my eyes are draining sticky goop with the right one even spiting goop on my glasses. Have tingling in my feet and the bottom of my feet sweat. hummmmm...... The other major SE I am having is swelling. I am on 40mg of Lasix and taking potassium daily and still having major swelling... I am drinking a ton of water and nothing seems to help. I was prone to swelling prior to all this mess but nothing like this. But, I only have one more to go and now that is less than 3 weeks away! I can do this!  I hope you all have a blessed day!  ",
