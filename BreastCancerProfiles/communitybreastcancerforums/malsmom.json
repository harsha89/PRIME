      "Content": "malsmom wrote: I am 4 weeks post chemo and have significant pain especially in my lower back, pelvis and front of thighs that started about a week ago. I also have general soreness and inflexibility through out the rest of my body. I received 3 rounds every three weeks of TCHP (Taxotere), then went to 8 rounds of weekly TCH (taxol). I had bad reactions to the chemo and got just about every side effect in the book. As soon as I completed chemo I felt great, but now I have these aches and pains. Could this be a result of the chemo? Has anyone else experienced post chemo side effects?
