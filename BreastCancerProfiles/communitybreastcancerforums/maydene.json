There really isn't one, the doctor felt it and told me its just the nerves are imflamed around where the drain in my arm pit was. I guess I am just frustrated cause usually you have a pain and you can take aleve or advil but I am learning that after surgery those are a no no. Well if anyone else has any insight please let me know what I can do.",

I decided on a bilateral because of family history. Everything went very well. The worst part so far about this whole thing is the drains! I had 3 drains in and the one under my right armpit is so painful! The question I have is, i have had all 3 drains removed but the pain under my right armpit is still really bad. When will this subside, and when will it stop feeling like I have a golfball imbedded in my armpitt? In the mean time is there anything I can do? Ice it? They don't give you anything and they won't give me any more painkillers. Is it true I can only use tylenol? Help!",
