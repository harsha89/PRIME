I started AC for 12 weeks in June of 04 and Taxol for another 12 in August of that year. I remember I first started being wrapped about the time I started rads in December. I had my first visit to the lymphedema clinic while I was still on Taxol. I can pinpoint it to sometime around the last of October or beginning of November. If you fly, I would suggest wearing a sleeve or bandage even if you do not have it. Nobody told me that and I flew home to see my parents in Kingsport that October. Lymphedema showed up shortly afterwards. Have no idea if it had anything to do with it, but those of us who have it are told to be particularly careful to wrap up or wear the sleeve when flying. Of course, we have to wear it all the time now anyway. Everyone have a wonderful Tennessee Thanksgiving! janie",

Dolly Parton and I were born the same year (not too far apart on the map), the year of the boobs, so I had a lot of extra tissue. They did a new procedure where they did a double breast reduction and a lumpectomy and got clear margins. The tumor was 3cm and I had 7/20 positive nodes. They just went back in 10/18/06 and shaped everything up better and repaired damage done by rads. I am pleased with the results as is the plastic surgeon. I am much farther along in my tx than most of you. I have lymphedema and that is a nuisance but tolerable. I also was left with a tremor. Leave it to me to get something weird. Don't know another soul who ended up with a tremor so don't let that worry you. You will not get one. I have a group of friends on this forum that started chemo when I did. We have been through many ups and downs over the last couple of years. Things are looking up for all of us, with a setback here and there, but the worse is definitely over. My hair, brows, lashes etc. are back. My prognosis is much better than it was when I started due to the results in the Herceptin clinical trial. I am 60 years old and have three grown kids (all TN fans although young when we moved). Glad you started the hillbilly thread. Miss my mountains. janie",

      "Content": "Jun 7, 2008 01:04AM janie44 wrote: From the symptoms / diagnosis section on this site: Inflammatory Breast Cancer Inflammatory breast cancer is a relatively rare but very serious, aggressive type of breast cancer. According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), 1% to 5% of breast cancer cases in the United States are inflammatory breast cancer. The symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer can include: About 50% of women with inflammatory breast cancer have a lump or a mass in their breast, but it may be difficult to feel since the breast is often bigger and harder than normal. Inflammatory breast cancer is usually categorized as stage IIIB breast cancer because of the possible involvement of the skin, chest wall, or lymph nodes along the breast bone inside the chest wall. If the cancer has spread to other organs, such as the bones, lungs, liver, brain, or to the lymph nodes in the neck, it is categorized as stage IV. Inflammatory breast cancer is hard to diagnose Sometimes inflammatory breast cancer is misdiagnosed as an infection. Because the disease is rare, many doctors have never seen it. Also, it has not been studied as much as other types of breast cancer. An infection is a more common cause of swelling and redness of the breast-that's why doctors think of that diagnosis first. But infection is more likely to happen for a reason, such as breast feeding. Infections go away with proper antibiotic treatment, but inflammatory breast cancer does not respond to antibiotics. A diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer is made primarily by physical examination, although mammogram, breast MRI, or ultrasound is sometimes used. A diagnosis must be confirmed by a biopsy. However, sometimes a biopsy of inflammatory breast cancer may come back \"clear,\" even as the redness and swelling worsen. So making a diagnosis is very tricky. Treating inflammatory breast cancer involves chemotherapy up front, followed by surgery and radiation. Anti-estrogen and Herceptin (chemical name: trastuzumab) therapy may also have a role. Other forms of targeted therapy, such as Avastin (chemical name: bevacizumab), may be used. The kind and sequence of treatment depends on your individual situation. Best wishes for you and your friend, Janie",

This year marks 23 years since I was first diagnosed with breast cancer, and it is 4 years this month since my last and third diagnosis of mets, this time her2 +. After 6 months on navelbine and 15 months on herceptin, I was and still am NED, and of course my family and I are elated. You may remember that I had had BC in 1985, then spine mets in 1990. I was on tamoxifen for 5 years and in remission for 10 more. After that 15 years I stopped thinking about further mets, until a heart attack in June of 2004 saved my life. Because of it the her2 mets were discovered. The herceptin did cause more heart damage and I had a triple bypass in 2006. I still have cardiomyopathy and congestive heart problem, but no cancer, for which I am most grateful. ANd for those who don't know or don't remember, I will be 79 in December. So hang in there, fellow warriors! I love you all and pray for you! Hugs, Tricia\"",

At 63, I guess I am already an old lady, but not so much shriveled or wrinkled yet .... but probably just around the corner.  LOL Hugs,,,   Janie ",
