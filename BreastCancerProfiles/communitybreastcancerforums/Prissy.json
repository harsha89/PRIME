That is awesome to hear as so many people have a harder time right after rads, or that's my impression anyway. Welcome Determinedat54, pamelav77, MissCommunication, and Misha13 - Sorry for the reason you are here but this group is awesome. So much info and support. LPLlibrarygirl - A frozen shoulder is NO fun! I've gone through that and received PT as well. Hope a cancellation comes through so you can get in quickly. Joytxs - thinking of you today and praying for relief for you. Jen2Mom - so glad your first session went well yesterday! I have heard the first one is the hardest. I will find out next Monday when I start. :0) egregious - Wow! A month out and feeling really good! I for one am looking forward to saying that! Faceforward and Elizabeth9 - It's kind of cool you guys are on the exact same schedule. Cheering you on! Dani444 - You are so close to the finish line! What are you going to do to celebrate?? Salamandra - Congrats on making it through your first week back at work! And having enough energy to do what you wanted on Saturday must have been really encouraging. Yay for progress! I go for my simulation on Thursday and then I start next Monday. So ready to get this show on the road!",

Clean margins and all three sentinel nodes clear. My lump was just below my left nipple and I am still experiencing soreness from the surgery. I graduated to sleeping without a bra 4 days ago. Met with the RO on 1/3 and go back Thursday to get marked up. I will probably start radiation the last week of January. I hope I will find out all of the details on Thursday. I really appreciate this forum. I have trolled it for quite some time. It has been very helpful!",

One of my friends told me this appointment was emotional for her. My husband is going with me for support, just in case. I really appreciate all of the advice given. I've already started slathering my boob with moisturizer several times daily. Never would have thought to get a head start on that! Also, there is a report from Mayo Clinic that states Wisconsin ginseng is good for cancer related fatigue. So I just started taking that in hopes that will help with fatigue issues. I love the support here. Happy Thursday everyone!",

To me, that is what this group is for - to support each other on the bad days and celebrate the good ones. I hope today is a better day for you. Carebearzzz - hope your pain gets better as the day goes on. Hpfull - My breast is still very sensitive from the lumpectomy as well. I'm 5 weeks post surgery and a bit surprised at that. It's improving, but very slowly. I'm already slathering myself with cream to begin hydrating my skin and my breast is so tender!! I'm grateful I don't start radiation until the 28th to give me more time to heal. I just started back at the Y and I'm avoiding doing any classes that involve any kind of bouncing. And I am so glad to have the permanent marker/stickers vs. tatoos! I am heading out this afternoon to buy a couple of cheap bras and camis. Such a good idea to do that.",

I haven't started radiation yet so it is good to know that a rough start on Day 1 doesn't mean that Day 2 will be that way. TC73 - I am fortunate that my team takes mental health seriously. At every appointment I go to I am asked a series of questions that is related to depression/anxiety/etc. I am surprised that is not standard protocol everywhere. HPFULL - I have had a nurse navigator from the beginning through my surgeon who has been my main coordinator for all of my care. Any questions I have had about appointments or care I contact her. I'm sorry your concerns about your pain have not been able to be addressed. When is your appointment with your GP? Joytxs - You have been so strong during your treatment! The fact that you have been working through out is amazing. I hope the silvadene is helping with the pain and that today you have seen a difference. Gentle hugs to you...... After reading some of your posts, I am buying a variety of creams to help with moisturizing. Figured I might as well go ahead and stock up before I get started with rads. I have Aquafor and I ordered Aloe Vera Gel and Miaderm on Amazon yesterday. My RO also prescribed Radiaplex Gel that he wants me to use. I haven't seen that mentioned before on the forum. Has anyone used that? It's Friday - no rads for anyone this weekend! Hope it's a restful one! ",

And welcome to the newbies who have joined since the last time I posted. I am glad you are here, but certainly wish you weren't. That doesn't sound very welcoming, but hopefully you know what I mean. Egregious - I know you finished a while back. I'm glad that your skin is slowly but surely returning to normal. I hope you will hang around this group. Your advice has been invaluable! My journey has probably been a bit different than normal - but really there isn't a normal when it comes to breast cancer treatment. I was diagnosed Sept 2017, three days before my 60th birthday. Because my cancer was invasive but NOT aggressive (my surgeon said I'd probably had it for 5 years and yes, I'd been having regular mammograms) I chose to go a more holistic route first. My oncologist wanted me to do Chemo first, but I really wanted to avoid that if at all possible. In May 2018 I added Anastrozole to my treatment to help reduce the size of the lump. September 2108 I stopped holistic therapies because it was no longer covered financially. Though I know it really helped my body to fight the cancer, it was also very time consuming. By Thanksgiving I was ready for my lumpectomy which happened on December 12. Most of this time I haven't really felt like a cancer patient. The first 2 months I certainly did - going through all of the tests, meeting with doctors, surgeon, and the emotional toll of talking to family and friends. It was absolutely exhausting! Certainly having the lumpectomy and getting ready to start radiation has brought it back front and center. Can't avoid it with scars on my breast and permanent marker and stickers all over my chest! I go back next Thursday for my simulation, and then start treatment on 1/28 for 4 weeks. I am SO ready to get this behind me! Grateful for all of you warriors! I think of this group often as we travel this road none of us wanted.  ",
