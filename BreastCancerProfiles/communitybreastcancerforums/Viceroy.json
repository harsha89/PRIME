I have been on gem/carbo since the beginning of October, but I have had progression so now I'm working with my MO on what is next. I'm hoping to get Lynparza/Olaparib off trial but if that doesn't pan out or if it takes too long then we'll probably go with another chemo.",

AC was just awful and I never really felt myself but I could sort of muddle through things. With dose dense Taxol I get completely wiped out for 2-3 days, but then life goes back to normal until my next dose, which is every other week. I can't wait to be done with it. Unfortunately, my next Taxol dose is 12/31. ",

I liked having time to think about what treatment that I wanted surgically after having the biopsy, so for me I am very glad to have gone that route. I think I would have a hard time not knowing how extensive my surgery would be before I went under. Also, if you aren't comfortable with your surgeon I would recommend getting another opinion. I don't think that I would be comfortable with someone who pressured me. The surgeon that I had explained things to me about every option available and answered all of my questions but one of my favorite things that she did was to stress that it was my body and my decision.",
