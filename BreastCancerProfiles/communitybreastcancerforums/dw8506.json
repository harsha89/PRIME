    "Content": "dw8506 wrote: I had a core biopsy in 2009 which came back as a benign fibroadenoma.  It has grown in size since then, from 3 cm to about 7 cm.  My mammograms have come back with 'no change' since then but because I asked about having it removed, they did a diagnostic xray and ultrasound. Now they said that there have been cystic changes.  When I asked what that meant, the nurse told me that now there was fluid in the tumor.  They have scheduled me for another core biopsy. They are recommending biopsying it before removal so in case it is cancer, they'll know what they're dealing with.  I agree with that completely. I can't find any information online about someone having to have two biopsies because of changes.  I'm hoping someone here has maybe been through this? Log in to post a reply",
