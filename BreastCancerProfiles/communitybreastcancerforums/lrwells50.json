It's finally starting to slow down, so after another fill, and maybe aspiration, week after next, I'll start the chemo. The local MO sent off for an OncotypeDx, and it came back a 24, smack dab in the middle of the intermediate range. He wanted to do AC + Taxol, 8 treatments, but my second opinion MO at Baylor Dallas said he thought that was overkill, and said they do 4 treatments of Cytoxin and Taxatore over 9 weeks, so the local MO agreed to that. I'm glad it was amicable, because I really didn't want to have a two hour drive to get home from Dallas after a treatment. Have to call today to set up the port placement. If I'd gone to the Dallas guy first, he wouldn't have done the Oncotype, and we wouldn't be having this discussion. It's hard not to resent that, but the cancer is clearly nastier than they first thought, and I think if I'd chosen no chemo, I'd just be worrying about it all of the time. I really dread it, but I only live 5 minutes from the cancer center, and I'm 66, so I don't have kids at home to worry about, and I don't have to worry about my job, because I work for my husband, a CPA. We got past tax season, and this is the slowest time at work, so I'm good there. I'll have to shop for a wig, because I won't be comfortable with just scarves.

I've not been wearing anything on it when home, because it's been shedding and itching more when I do, but the wig hasn't been too bad today, I'm guessing because there's not much left to itch!

My tumor was 1.2 cm, no node involvement, and I was also told not to worry, because I wouldn't need chemo. Unfortunately, it was also ILC, and I had an Oncotype score of 24, right in the middle of the intermediate range. Because ILC tends to hide and recur later, I am doing the chemo, and will be starting some time next week. Can say I'm looking forward to it, but I'm on Medicare and have a good supplement, so am not worried about the bills, and work from home, which I may do a lot once I've lost my hair. I know I'm too self-conscious to go bald in public. I'll need to buy my wig next week, so they can match it to my hair. At least I've worn my hair short the last 40 years, so it won't take long to grow back. I just have to hope I'm one of the lucky ones that doesn't have any permanent hair loss from the Taxotere. I'm more worried about neuropathy, but am hoping for the best there as well.",

I guess time will tell. I wore a wig to the grocery store then to work this morning, but it did itch off and on. Sometimes I'd not even notice it, then I'd just want to take it off and scratch everywhere. Made it to about 3:00 and called it quits. Maybe once everything that's going to come out has come out, I won't have the mild pain/itching thing and the wig will be bearable. Definitely the worst side effect so far by a long shot",

I didn't see any reason to make do with ibuprofen if I had hydrocodone available which worked better. I do, however, think I COULD have made it with very little prescription pain meds if I'd had to, and I think the Exparel was one reason.

I'm trying to be more proactive about the pain mess before and after the Neulasta injection, but he told me no NSAIDS, so I'm stuck with Tylenol this time around. No taste changes yet, which is great, and no nausea, although I took a compazine before I went to bed, just in case. I tend to go back and forth from loose stools to constipation anyway, but I took a stool softener last night and so fa so good this morning. Maybe TC is less likely to be diarrhea producing than AC? I'm still swishing with the soda and salt solution and no mouth sores yet. Honestly, the hair thing has been the worst SE so far.

I'm doing my chemo at the Sammons Cancer Center at Baylor, Dallas, so it was very crowded in the waiting room, and we were about 1 1/2 hours later than our appointment. We were taken to one of many infusion rooms, and the nurse explained exactly what she was doing. It was VERY cold in the room, but the recliners were heated, and they had heated blankets ready. They gave me steroids and an anti-nausea med. Then they started the Taxotere, which they ran slowly, because it's the one you are most likely to have an allergic response to. Then she ran the Cytoxin over an hour, because she said it can cause a sinus-type headache. She said next time they would run it faster. I don't think I mentioned that I don't have a port, which is nice. The MO thought my veins were okay since I'd only have 4 treatments and no AC. They had eight treatment chairs in each chemo area, with chairs down the middle for family. Also a room with snacks like crackers and granola bars, and a fridge with ice, juices and pudding. After it was finished I went to their store and bought a wig and caps that I'll need before I go back, and we headed home, which is almost two hours away. Had a bland dinner, drank a lot of water, and took a compazine at bedtime. I hadn't given much thought to the fact that they ran saline alongside the meds, but those, plus the water I drank, caused about 6 trips to the bathroom during the night. Today I ate my normal breakfast, and more bland stuff at lunch, but I've had absolutely no nausea. I rarely do, so maybe that's why. I'm now T-2 hours until the Neulasta injection, so keeping my fingers crossed for no bone pain. Lynn ",

Chemo reduces that to 6 to 10%, so I felt I needed to do it. I was actually more worried about permanent neuropathy with Taxotere than I was about permanent hair loss, but I'm 66. By the 13th day after my first treatment, I started losing hair by the handful. I'd say I've lost 90 - 95%, but there also seems to be peach fuzz everywhere else. I'm 12 days post my second chemo, so shortly I'll see if the rest of it goes. If you'll put your diagnosis and other details in your profile, it might help us give a more informed opinion",

I'm 9 weeks PFC, and lost my hair about 13 days after the first chemo. Once I started losing it, I had my hairdresser buzz it to about 1/2\". Don't shave it, in case you have ingrown hairs when it comes back. I had a very small percentage of hair that I never lost. Mine started coming back in a couple of weeks ago, but is fine down like a newborn. It's VERY white on the top and sides, but dark in the back. It's very likely it was that gray before, but because I colored mine every 4 weeks it was hard to tell. I always hated sitting with color on my hair for thirty minutes, so will try to just leave it natural. My hair has always grown very fast, and I wear it short, so I'm guessing it will be long enough in 4 - 6 weeks to cover my scalp and ditch the wig. It's hard to tell at this point whether I have any thin or bald spots, but it doesn't look like it. I've worn a wig since I buzzed my hair, and am still wearing it. I bought scarves and hats, but am not comfortable wearing them. I'm going to a tailgate and football game in the wig Saturday, and the forecast is 93 and sunny. If it's bad enough I'll resort to the scarf. FWIW, my MO said he's only had 1 person have permanent hair loss on Taxotere, although there are several posters here that have had it. I was a lot more worried about neuropathy on Taxol, which the first MO I went to wanted to prescribe ",
