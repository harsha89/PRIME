Although it sounds like your MO had additional issues going on with her personal life and is taking a break from medicine, per standard doctor non-compete agreements for doctors in groups or who work for a hospital, they are prohibited from contacting their patients and giving them advance notice, as it could be perceived as trying to steal/take the patients with them. (I am a lawyer and my DH is a doctor, so I am familiar with this from both sides!) It is always the hospital/group that contacts you afterward (if you get contacted at all). This is probably of no solace but please know she didn't decide not to contact you to give you a heads up based on her own prerogative. I would imagine if it were up to her, she would have let you know in advance, given your strong relationship. Although i was very bonded/attached to my first MO (maybe to an unhealthy extent), I ended up being assigned to someone better after he left. The hospital staff all assumed I would follow my MO but I am in better hands now with my second MO. Not as charismatic and we don't have the same chemistry as the first one - he doesn't say much . . . but spends a lot of time thinking about my case/bouncing ideas off his colleagues at my hospital and at other leading hospitals around the country behind the scenes and he is miles ahead as far as breast cancer-specific expertise, thinks out of the box (as do I) and is very open-minded to my feedback/questions/suggestions (which are ample!).",

One factor to consider is that I have heard that immunotherapy is more effective when the immune system is strong (before it is beaten down by more mets and extensive treatments). Another factor is that I have heard that's many of the immuno studies will rule out people who have previously been treated with immunotherapy, meaning one should choose wisely which immunity study to try. I haven't looked into this to confirm if it is true though. I read it in article about advances in immunotherapy over the last few years. Good luck determining whether to proceed. The good news is you are stable with a minimal tumor load! I hope that lasts for a very, very long time, regardless of whether you do the trial.",

I was diagnosed last December and spent my Christmas at home, not celebrating, no decorations whatsoever, hooked up to a 24-hour saline drip to try to get my hypercalcemia under control, in so much pain from bone mets I could barely walk or sit down/stand up from seated position, pregnant, recovering from a round of Taxotere. I was \"lucky\" because most people would have been hospitalized but I was able to go home because my DH is a doctor and could administer the IV drip at home. I had my son the day after Christmas, who spent the next 4 weeks in the NICU. This season brought back a lot of the traumatic memories of that whole time. Like many of you, I now feel a pressure to really get into the holiday spirit and create memories while I am here. I actually put up decorations the day after Thanksgiving. I have never been so on the ball. Today, I took my son to get pictures with Santa. I spent so much time preparing for it and the whole thing ended in frustration. I ironed his little button up shirt the night before, struggled to get him dressed in his outfit, braved the mall traffic and parking, waited in line for an hour, timed his feedings accordingly, etc., etc. Well, me being a first time Mom and all, I didn't realize that I would need to be in the picture holding my one-year old son. I was assuming he would be with Santa alone. Anyway, I was not at all prepared for a photo - no makeup, hair not done, hadn't showered, nothing. My son looks adorable in the photo and has a big smile but I am so disappointed I didn't get ready for a photo. It is not about how I look but I feel this pressure to have as many nice pictures with my son as possible. When I was diagnosed, the therapist at my cancer center told me to take a lot of pictures with my son. Her words are always replaying in my head. I am bad about stopping from enjoying my experiences to take photos so I don't have many good pictures with him. I take a lot of pictures of him and of him with my husband. This fact made me feel all the worse about the situation. If he is too young to remember me, I want him to at least have nice pictures with me, especially now while I still look and feel \"healthy\".",

One note about bupropion - I was never a big sweets person but that has changed since I started bupropion. Bupropion increases pleasure and reward responses. Now when I eat a cookie, for example, the taste brings me an unusually high sense of pleasure, like it is suddenly the best thing I have ever had. You might have some success with sweets - cookies, donuts, baked goods, ice cream, candy and the like. Buproprion has been known to be linked to sugar cravings.",

Put yourself in the other person's shoes . . . . If you met a man who had cancer, would that change your feelings about him? Probably not. It might even make you like him more because you realize how precious life and connections are when you feel they might be threatened down the road. I don't have experience dating since I became Stage 4 but did go through this when I was early stage. I was a bit extreme - I had different dates taking me to chemo. In hindsight, I have to chuckle at how crazy that was. However, I did find that men generally took their lead from me. If I was confident, upbeat (at least in the beginning) and spoke with enough facts to allow them to break down the idea of cancer into various components requiring action rather than this big, scary unknown, they would follow suit. That being said, your current guy has experience with this disease which makes things harder to \"spin\" with him. My hubby is a doctor and I couldn't spin things with him when I met him. He knew too much! I was at a young survivor's conference in the Spring and the session leader in a mets session met her fiancÃ© while Stage 4. It is exhausting to dance around how/when to tell your story for one date and the next.

I had tumor flare pain within the first few months into hormone therapy that lasted a month or so and had flare from Xeloda within a few weeks of starting and it literally lasted over a year, while everything was shrinking and metabolically inactive in the case of both drugs. I am currently having liver pain and am praying it is flare again. I started Abraxane just under 3 months ago. On hormone therapy, my liver enzymes (ALT and AST) spiked a bit a month or so into treatment which lasted a month. On Xeloda, my tumor markers went up for the first 3 months. I haven't had anything else go up during a flare when meds were working. When my meds are working, alkaline phosphatase goes down in addition to bilirubin, AST, ALT and sometimes tumor markers. All of those are rarely out of range to begin with but do go down further within normal range which is a good indicator for me. One thought about back pain - it could be from your liver. I had have continuing pain on my right side of my back up and down the right side of my spine, sometimes pain in my ribs in the back (as well as the front) on the right side and a slight numbness in the mid-upper back on right side. Also, I can feel a sensation in my back when I take a really deep breathe, especially when laying on my back. It all feels like bone pain. It took me several years to realize all of that is from my liver mets and not my bone mets. There is a nerve behind the liver that is often pressed upon by liver mets which can cause back pain - either where the liver is located or referred pain in the shoulder or other parts of the back.",

What drug are you having trouble getting approved? Is it Ibrance? I don't know about Canada as I know you have universal healthcare but in the US, approval issues are usually with the more expensive drugs (insurance companies then find any reason to deny). The indurance companies never question things such as first line v second line on inexpensive drugs. I had a lot of trouble getting Ibrance approved because it hadn't been specifically approved with one of the drugs I was taking it with when it was prescribed. However, in the US, there are laws about what insurance companies need to cover based on how many credible journal write-ups with clinical trial results, even before express FDA approval. After fighting, I and many others gots it covered on this basis. The whole first line, second line, third line, etc is simply recommendations (or, in some cases, based on what the clinical trial resulting in approval happened to be was testing for). My doctor put me on Aromasin and Faslodex together upon Stage 4 dx (and added Ibrance to that cocktail once it showed a benefit with Faslodex in clinical trials), even though I have never had Arimidex or Femara. He had reasons as I was a unique case diagnosed while pregnant, with soaring estrogen levels and growth heir mines swirling my body. My point is that these categories are not fixed and drugs can be given a in different order. Keep pushing to get it aporoved! It is a hassle but you should be covered for your treatments! I know everyone had trouble getting Ibrance approved when it first came out in the US. ",

To my surprise, however, a week or so after starting tamoxifen a month + ago, no more dryness and the atrophy reversed itself, pretty much overnight. I feel like I was 5 years ago, before mets mets diagnosis/ovary removal/chemo, etc. I did know tamoxifen acts as a positive estrogen in endometrial lining in the uterus, opposite of how it acts in breast tissue, but did not know it had any positive impact on other parts. I hope this treatment works for a while because it is nice to feel somewhat normal again. I found I had a similar response when I was prescribed prednisone. Reversed the atrophy and normalized everything for the short period I took it after Y90 procedures. I would like to try estrogen cream but have been too scared to do that so far, although I have heard the studies that say it is safe. Illi, thanks for posting the product recommendation.

I would say that during the 3-month time I hung out on the Afinitor/Aromasin thread, it didn't seem like many had luck with the combination. However, again, if you are limited to bone mets, then you are probably a better candidate than most. In hindsight, for myself, Afinitor/Aromasin would have been better to try as a maintenance medication when I mets were already stabilized and under control by chemo. However, there is no guarantee that would have worked. I went onto Abraxane after Afinitor/Aromasin and will see next month whether it is working. There is no wrong answer and I hope that whatever you choose, it works to get your hip/pelvis bones shored up. I assume your are on XGeva or a bisphosphonate for your bones as well?",

Scanning depends on the level of cancer aggressiveness, history of the disease and history of what happens when the particular patient's cancer becomes resistant to a medication, overall level of tumor burden, patient preference, patient's overall health and mobility, etc. Medicine is part science and part art. For me, I insist on regular scans, although when medicines were working well for a long time, my MO would bump my scans from 3 months to 6 months. I don't feel comfortable relying on tumor markers or symptoms alone based on my own history. When I was diagnosed, I was in such bad shape and literally a few weeks away from dying of bone mets (which I didn't think was possible before I was in that position myself with uncontrollable hypercalcemia). My liver was full of tumors at the time but that wasn't causing me any problems. I did have what in hindsight I would say are severe symptoms but they were masked by other things going on in my life - my pregnancy. I thought all of the excruciating pain I was experiencing was caused by that. My OB-GYN told me I was \"old\" and needed to get a personal trainer to help with all the pain I was feeling. My MO wasn't worried through all this time until the very end. I had some minor changes in tumor markers but they were still in normal range until the very end when they were a point or a few points above normal. Also, pregnancy can cause tumor markers to rise. I am probably only alive today because my DH, who was the only one who was worried, ordered a basic blood panel that showed the hypercalcemia. I spent the next few weeks hooked up to a 24-hour saline drip. I had to go through 6 saline bags a day to try to water down the calcium in my blood and prevent me from going into a coma or having a heart attack. The chemo, bisphosphonates and steroids were not working to lower the calcium levels. Finally, when nothing else was working, I had to have my baby nearly 2 months early. Then a year and a half later, after Ibrance failed, my liver exploded to about 70% mets/30% liver tissue. Nearly the entire left lobe was cancer. However, I had no symptoms and my bloodwork, liver enzymes and tumor markers were normal. My appetite was strong and I was running 4 miles three times a week. I can live way too close to the edge with no symptoms and wouldn't personally feel comfortable without scans. One can only go so far before even an effective treatment can't catch up. I no longer trust my own sense of \"danger\" as my threshold for pain, discomfort and physical challenge has grown so high. What feels \"normal\" to me is probably heavily skewed at this point. Also, although the doctors in the article write about how patients don't necessarily need scans, I suspect if it were their spouse with cancer, they would be insisting on regular scanning unless the spouse was NED for years.",

I was diagnosed with both a liver and bones filled with mets Dec 2014, very advanced at the time, and I am still going strong. My liver was at one point 70% mets in 2016 but has since regenerated a lot of healthy liver tissue and currently all mets are much smaller, currently shrinking and metabolically inactive due to my current treatment. When my liver was 70% mets, I had no symptoms and was continuing my life as usual. We only need 10% of our liver to function and it is a strong organ that regenerates itself. My point for mentioning that is that you can have a great quality of life with liver mets. Don't give up hope. I try to go by the \"conditional survival\" theory - my goal is to make it on each treatment long enough to catch the next one that comes out of the pipeline.

I have my second round of Halaven tomorrow. Supposedly, this will be my last and then I will go into the FGFR treatment clinical trial. However, given the debacle with the trial application process to date, and the likelihood that the delays will continue, I am not holding my breath. I also was doing some research and seemed to read in the clinical trial fine print I found online that there is a 4 week washout period before the medicine can be administered. I had to reread the paragraph about the washout numerous times as it is so poorly written and confusing. (And I am a lawyer and spend my days reviewing and interpreting legal fine print.) It seems hard to botch a paragraph on a washout period but the drafters of this text managed to do so. There are various exceptions to the washout, various phases to the trial application process with different washout requirements in each phase (prebiopsy, post biopsy, post initial application, post second application, etc.), and the phases themselves are poorly defined and ambiguous. There are also limited circumstances where a doctor has discretion to waive the washout period for some applicants during some of the phases and the washout period is not applicable if the NCI receives the biopsy in one manner but not another. Clearly, the doctor or researcher wrote this who was more interested in the actual trial than the description of the trial and was probably in a rush. My MO never mentioned the washout. If I would in fact be required to do a washout, I will be annoyed. I came from Doxil which is only given every 4 weeks and a 4 week washout would mean no treatment delay. I would have preferred to simply have another round of Doxil while waiting. i had started to progress but it was keeping most of the cancer in check. After waiting 3 weeks after my last Doxil was due (7 weeks total) to get into the FGFR study, I finally insisted on starting some treatment in the meantime and was put on Halaven. I am not going off Halaven for 4 weeks after that. I am mentally preparing to remain on Halaven indefinitely for now and if the trial actually comes to fruition, then that will be a nice bonus. My bloodwork on my first infusion last week had my liver enzymes (AST and ALT) and alkaline phosphatase elevated - a bit of a jump in all three since being off treatment - but both tumor markers were at a record low, significantly lower than either have ever been in the 12 years since my early stage diagnosis. Secretly, I am hoping that means I am having some sort of spontaneous remission although I know that is not likely. It probably means my liver tumors are too busy building up in the liver that they haven't started shedding into the bloodstream yet.",

I learned my cancer center is renovating its pharmacy and is driving all chemo for all patients from its satellite cancer center facility about 15 miles away two times per day only. WTF?! It seems there must be a better way. There were also lots of delays and I ended up wearing the cold cap for 45 minutes longer than the required 4 hours needed due to delays with the nurses. The poor woman next to me put her cold cap on nearly 3 hours before the medicine arrived while I waited until it came to put on the cap. She never complained either. I can't imagine wearing the cap that long. No one told her that the drugs weren't coming any time soon, which seems weird. I would have told her myself but thought she was receiving chemo already when I arrived in the cold cap room. Parry, I am feeling good so far on Halaven. No side effects yet although it has only been 8 days with my second injection today. When my tumor markers were tested, it was a few hours before I started Halaven so the low markers weren't the result of taking the first dose. However, I did receive some good news today before my second treatment. My liver enzymes (AST and ALT) and alkaline phosphatase all decreased from last week, which is likely due to Halaven! It is nice to know it can work quickly. Not all chemos kick in right away. Have you had any side effects from Halaven yet? Pajim, the trial is one of many baskets in the NCI MATCH trial which is matching up persons with solid tumors of any type of cancer with drugs that align with a mutation that the person has. No CAR-T cell treatments involved in this basket. It is a basket for FGFR amplifications of any type (there are numbered FGFR alterations) where the patients receive an FGFR inhibitor called erdafitinib, a drug already FDA approved in urothelial cancer with FGFR mutations/amplifications. My MO liked that the drug in this basket is more advanced in that it has already been proven to work in some type of cancer with this mutation. I have FGFR1 and FGF3 amplifications, although I am not sure if this arm covers FGFR (the fibroblast growth factor receptor) alterations only or FGF (the fibroblast growth factor itself) alterations as well. There is also a chance that the FGFR amplifications don't show up in this current biopsy. All in all, I wouldn't be surprised if the genetic test results are significantly different than my previous genetic test. I had the first test on a supraclavical lymph node from the time of diagnosis over 4 years ago, before any treatment and while I was 7 months pregnant with all sorts of female hormones and growth hormones pumping through my body. Also, a mini chunk of my oncology surgeon's finger flesh was cut off and made it into the biopsy sample. (Freak accident, although very, very minor.) Now, I am postmenopausal with no ovaries, heavily pretreated with hormone therapy, targeted therapy and chemo, on my 6th line of treatment and the sample came from one of two liver lesions that stopped responding to Doxil although the rest of my numerous liver tumors were still responding. It is all kind of a crap shoot!",

I was in the process of waiting to get into a clinical trial but have been off treatment 2 weeks (6 weeks since last Doxil which is given every 4 weeks) and due to everyone dragging their feet it would likely be at least another 3-4 weeks or longer before everything is in place. For those of you who do Halaven with cold caps, how long do you wear the cold cap after injection? I just spoke to the nurse and she tried to tell me I need to wear the caps for 5 hours afterward. That sounds very questionable. She also told me it takes 3 hours to mix the medicine after I see the doctor. I think she is exaggerating because she wants me to schedule an appointment earlier in the day so she can leave early. I did cold caps with Abraxane and only wore the cap 1 hour before and 2 hours afterward. I believe the power dose Abraxane I took every 3 weeks is stronger than Halaven on hair loss. Any experiences with cold caps? Sierra, congrats on your upcoming wedding! Enjoy every moment of it and forget about this awful disease for those few hours!!! I hope the others can answer your questions re extensions. You may want to consider halo extensions which will not pull the hair if it will be too delicate from the Halaven.",

Unfortunate to hear about the spreading neuropathy. I had a lot of motor neuropathy on Abraxane, worse in my feet, which had spread up through ankles and lower part of calves. My neuropathy improved but never fully went away. I do experience ankle buckling occasionally and will hit a wall after a short amount of time in wearing high heels that are on the higher side - my ankles feel too weak and too tight to continue stabilizing my feet after a while. I also have to take more care in keeping my body weight directly over my feet due to ongoing balance issues. I don't want to appear drunk at work :) If I ever give up on trying to cold cap with Halaven, I will start icing feet and hands. I am interested in hearing how the TENS unit and roller ball work. I may look into those as well.",

I did every 3 week treatments which are a much higher dose and pack a much bigger punch to the hair. I made it 6 months with cold caps on Abraxane by putting my hair in a bun and using Toppik to disguise some of thin areas in front or on top and then had to move over to a wig after that but am still glad I did it. My hair did continue to grow on Abraxane, including new growth areas, and then started growing back immediately when I stopped it. I think my 4 year old son would be scared and worried if I were bald. He does see that I have other hair that looks like mine (my wigs) but doesn't ask too many questions. I had to take him with me the other day to have my wig cleaned and told him we were going to a place with lots of hair for people who want more than they have, like longer hair.",

I had no idea what was going to happen when I was diagnosed with mets at 38 (like you, dx'd with stage 2 at 30). I was out for 3 months upon mets dx for maternity leave. I was in terrible shape due to very advanced bone mets and could barely walk, couldn't go from a standing to sitting position or vice versa without major assistance/upper body support, felt like my arms were going to break holding my tiny preemie. However, I slowly but surely improved significantly over those three months and went back to my full time job and have not missed a full day of work due to mets for the 2.5 years since then. I didn't know if I would ever be able to run again but within a year, I was running 4 miles 3 days a week. I always thought I would quit my job if something like this devastating dx happened. However, I have found my desire to work (and move up the ranks) is stronger than ever (I think some sort of mental need to feel like I haven't given up on myself since I have a baby to raise for as many years as I can squeak out. . . and I get to feel and live a \"normal\" life at work and keep my mind busy on other things). I am not sure how long this ambitious stage will last. It could change over night. One just never knows how things will end up. So hang in there. The right decision for you will materialize at some point. No need to rush to a decision now.",

She mentioned you are also in Florida. I am in Miami Beach. I haven't failed a chemo yet which is the only requirement I do not meet based on initial requirements. I did see on Inspire that another woman passed away on the trial, although it sounded like she may have been in bad shape from mets/treatments before she began the trial. I have heard that it is best to do immunotherapy when the immune system is stronger (if feasible). Do you know how others with BC mets have fared on this trial? Please keep us posted. Your story gives us all hope!",

I had a severe allergy to Taxol and had to quit that treatment 2 minutes into my first infusion. A very tiny percentage of people go into anaphylaxis due to allergy to the binding agent, cremaphor. With Taxol, you would have a better quality of life as far as toxicity goes if you do it weekly (and I believe it is ever so slightly more effective that way), but weekly is tough with work. I did Abraxane recently on an every 3 week schedule for work convenience whereas most people do that on a weekly schedule. In the long-term, the biggest challenge with the taxanes is neuropathy in legs/feet and possibly hands (depending on your job). I worked full time through a very potent dose dense course of Taxotere (which is higher than the recommended FDA safe dose and extremely toxic) for 2 months and high-dose Abraxane for 7 months but it did get challenging near the end with each. I could walk but had some trouble with moving all around the building as frequently as I usually would and cut back on discretionary walking. I also had some challenges wearing heals but that may not be an issue for you. However, no one else noticed and I didn't have to modify my work schedule although I did find myself planning out tactical issues like how to reduce the amount of walking I needed to do throughout the day. I found that sublingual Vitamin B complex helped a lot with the neuropathy, particularly in the hands. I haven't tried Halaven or Navelbine but either of those could be next for me. I am switching from Doxil to my next med and am trying to get into a trial but could take either one of those if the trial red tape takes too long. My MO has been recommending Halaven and I am interested in Navelbine myself. I have heard that Halaven is pretty tolerable, overall. I have heard the same thing about Navelbine. Navelbine has an oral pill formulation which is available in Europe and has been for a long time but the manufacturer never pursued it in the US (beyond clinical trials, some of which are still ongoing). Very annoying to me as I was researching this last night and it appears the only reason it hasn't been marketed in oral pill form in the US is money. Navelbine has been generic for a long time and there isn't much money in generic drugs. So sad and very frustrating. If it were available in oral formulation, I would jump on that as an option. If I were faced with Taxol, Halaven, Navelbine or a trial of oral taxane (tesetaxel, I presume), with your treatment history and work situation, I would take the oral taxane. I have read a lot about it and it sounds promising. Much more convenient and it has been reporting less side effects, particularly less neuropathy and hair loss than IV taxanes. Good luck making your decision.",

I have taken it twice, once early stage and once Stage 4, although I am severely allergic to Taxol. My onc has Taxotere in the plans for a third round once I exhaust all oral chemo and hormone therapy options. I didn't develop resistance to it, but took it in the interim while pregnant with Stage 4, as hormone therapy isn't safe when preggos. Not only was it safe enough for me, it was safe enough for the baby. I take it with minimal premeds and no steroids without incident. The other benefit is the infusion is hours shorter than Taxol because Taxotere is highly potent and only requires a small amount. ",

Hoping this happens by the time he is three . . . Cath3rine, I know what you mean about worrying of feeling disappointment if you can't reach your goals.

The original plan was to have him out at 34 weeks but they were having trouble getting my hypercalcemia stabilized and I was in so much pain, I literally felt like I was dying. It appears my cancer was likely triggered due to IVF/pregnancy hormones and progressed very quickly. I started having bone pain symptoms in the first trimester but attributed everything to the pregnancy. By the end, the pain in my ribs and hips/groin was very severe. I could barely walk and the slightest cough or laugh felt like my back was going to break and my chest was going to crack open. I mentioned my symptoms to my OB on multiple occasions (who knew of my cancer history). He shrugged off my symptoms and told me I was probably having a tougher pregnancy because I was \"old\" at 38 and should hire a personal trainer and work through the pain. Despite extensive liver and bone mets, all is going well right now. I had two palpable 2cm supraclavical lymph nodes which disappeared in about month of treatment. I had a PET done a few weeks ago which showed no uptake in the liver and only mild uptake in the bones. All of the lesions are still there but are not really active. I feel very fortunate that I am doing well and baby is doing great. He spent a month in the NICU and is a little champ!",

Tar Heel and KJones, regarding fatigue, although I am doing fine on my current combo of Aromasin/Faslodex/Ibrance, I had a very tough time with debilitating fatigue on Tamoxifen for several years and had success with Provigil and Nuvigil (newer generation drug by same company). They are expensive but Provigil went generic (modafinil) and seemed to work a bit better than Nuvigil. They improve \"wakefulness\" without the stimulant side effects or addiction potential of Ritalin, Adderal and similar drugs. It was approved for night workers with work-shift sleep disorder and is prescribed off label for BC treatment-related fatigue. I also had success with Wellbutrin, which is an atypical anti-depressant known to improve energy due to its effect on dopamine and norepinephrine. (I had to go off it because it uses the same enzyme as tamoxifen for metabolization but I don't believe it is contraindicated with other BC treatments.) To a lesser extent, Effexor may help due to its partial norepinephrine effect or high dose SAM-e over the counter. Effexor is VERY difficult to go off of, though, due to withdrawal side effects. I have used all these drugs and had the most success with Wellbutrin and Provigil. I saw immediate improvement the first day on both medications. My current oncologist is supportive with treating side effects but my last one was very difficult like yours, KJones. I think I had t get the medications through the psychiatrist at the cancer center or through the recommendation from the psychologist to my onc. My onc would balk at all of it and tell me I am just depressed, but would usually begrudgingly fill the prescription upon major pushing. Good luck! None of us should be suffering if there are treatments out there.",

I do what I can - eat a healthy, plant based diet, exercise, maintain a healthy weight, take various supplements, try to sleep enough and not stress out, but don't beat myself up about it or take anything to extremes. I do eat meat because I feel better with it in my diet (good energy levels, stable blood sugar and ability to feel satisfied from food) and have trouble maintaining my weight when I remove meat completely. I was raised strict macrobiotic/vegan and believe that a healthy lifestyle improves our quality of life and may prevent many illnesses, but it is not always enough. Life is humbling. Some things are just beyond our control and more powerful than the food (and the drugs) we put in our bodies. I recently read a correlational study indicating that people with a plant-based diet had better outcomes with metastatic breast cancer but that being strict vegetarian didn't necessarily make a difference. It was more important to eat a variety of fruits and vegetables versus fully eliminate meat. ",

Combining or cycling the two seems to turbo charge BC growth. My take is to tread lightly and keep in mind that just because a theory about how something works or should work in the body sounds logical doesn't mean it is true. There are too many complicated variables in our bodies that hormones cannot be boiled down to \u201cthis one fuels cancer\" and \u201cthis one haults cancer\".

One of those may be worth a try. Although they do not work for everyone, some people do have success with those after prior hormonal failure. Each cancer is different and some mutate to work around your drug's mechanism for blocking estrogen but still use estrogen to grow through other cell mechanisms while others mutate to use growth factors and other fueling mechanisms completely. You can request more frequent monitoring in the beginning if you opt to try one of those and feel worried.

If you have the issue again and it is not manageable, Taxotere generally doesn't cause that response. Not sure if that is an option for you. When I tried dose dense Taxol in 2006, I went into anaphylaxis within minutes and had to switch to Taxotere. The chemo nurse told me that some people are allergic to the binding agent in Taxol called Cremaphor.

My MO has had me on a plan to space out my XGeva doses farther and farther apart but I have had trouble at times scaling back. My bones were so damaged and far gone when I was diagnosed due to delays in diagnosis that I still rely on the XGeva to keep my bones strong even though my mets have been stable all this time since I first began treatment. The issue is that XGeva prevents the bones from going through the breakdown process (resorption) which keeps them relatively stronger but, at the end of the day, the bone tissue is lower quality and more brittle than typical healthy bone tissue, as it never has a chance to go through the normal, regenerative breakdown/build up process that healthy bones would go through.

I was bounced around from dentist to endodontist #1 to endodontist #2 to oral surgeon as no one could figure out what is going on. I thought I had a small abscess on my gum from an infected tooth but my tooth is fine. It is now believed I have Stage 0 ONJ, an issue brewing underneath gums, not exposed and remaining relatively stable at this point, although none of the professionals can say for certain. One of the professionals said something about a small chip of bone starting to sequester itself (sever off). I haven't had invasive dental work since I started XGeva and I take impeccable care of my teeth. However, I now believe I 100% created this situation myself due to a recent, strange craving to chew ice, which is also treatment related. All of the various side effects are closing on on me from all angles! In the fall, I developed moderate - severe anemia on chemo. Out of nowhere, it caused me to have extreme cravings to chew ce. Weird because I have never been one to like ice or drink cold drinks. I prefer water at room temperature. Anyway, come to find out anemia causes ice cravings. Weird but true. The urge was irresistible and I am still fighting it as the cravings are still here although my anemia is only mild-moderate right now. Over a series of months, I came to a point where I was chewing cups and cups and cups of ice all day and thinking about ice constantly like a bizarre addiction. In hindsight, I am so mad at myself for causing this for something so seemingly trivial. I knew I was putting my teeth at risk for cracking (and did try to chew the ice gently if that is even possible :) ) but never thought this could cause ONJ. I did end up also having to have a few very old fillings replaced that chipped off a bit, likely from the ice, but I had no damage to my teeth themselves. Anyway, the oral surgeon explained to me that our jaws have a ton of bone turnover - they are the most active bones in our bodies that are constantly remodeling. Small tears in the bone are a regular occurrence from jaw use (like we get small tears in our muscles when we work out really hard). In normal bone, the bone is remodeled and comes out stronger on the other side. Due to XGeva, our bones don't go through that remodeling process and we are left with bone that has a hard time healing itself, is not great quality and has poor blood supply. When bone remains unhealed and has poor blood supply, it becomes at risk to infection and then ONJ develops. Here is what I learned from my own saga: - Take care of being too harsh on your teeth or gums in any respect, not just invasive dental work. Be careful and try to minimize chewing very hard things on a frequent basis and repeated trauma/unusual pressure on the teeth and jaws. - Take impeccable care of your teeth and mouth. Most if not all of the bacteria that infects the jawbone creeps in from the dental area via the mouth/teeth/gums/pockets in gums. Beyond that, taking care of one's mouth will reduce or prevent the need for invasive dental work which is the highest risk factor for exposing the bone to bacteria/developing ONJ. Whereas, in healthy bone, the bacteria is quickly swept away by our lymphatic and vascular system, with XGeva, there is not enough blood supply to eliminate all the bacteria. - Premedicate with antibiotics if you do need to have dental work, which can significantly reduce the risk of ONJ.

In all of my research over my latest pre-ONJ issue, I did learn that Zometa has an extremely long half life - like over 10 years, while XGeva has a comparatively short half life of 20-something days. That article seemed to be speculating that taking a break from XGeva to get needed invasive dental work may have a more meaningful impact than taking a break from Zometa. No hard data on that at this point though. NicoleRod, you should definitely ask your MO about options when it comes to taking a lower dose or receiving the injection less frequently. Bone mets should be the primary concern although they are not the only concern and this is all a balancing act. With respect to frequency, there was a trial a while back that showed that reducing the dose of Zometa to every 12 weeks after 2 years at a 3-4 week dose did not make a difference as far as progression of bone mets was concerned in Zometa but did lower ONJ risk. Many MOs follow that plan now, even for XGeva, although there hasn't been published data about whether the same result occurs with XGeva. There are questions about whether the shorter half-life of XGeva could mean it needs to be continued at the 3-4 or so week dosing frequency. My MO lowered my XGeva after 2 years to every 12 weeks, sometimes longer. In the first two years, I would get XGeva every 3, 4 or 6 weeks based on my treatment schedule for my other mets treatments and when I happened to be coming in for an appointment. My MO didn't seem to be too concerned with going 6 weeks rather than 3-4 even though I had extensive bone mets practically everywhere in my body when diagnosed. Another long-term risk of XGeva and Zometa is femur fracture but it is less common and usually presents itself after many years on XGeva. Again, seems to be due to the bone being poor quality and somewhat brittle and having a difficult time healing from small tears/cracks.",

At the 3-month mark, my liver enzymes and tumor markers were still in the elevated \"flair\" stage that started after I began Xeloda. I hope you are experiencing the same thing. Letmywifelive, I think a PET is a great idea. If that PET shows that your wife's lesions are inactive (or have less uptake than previously), then it doesn't matter that they look bigger. I have had instances where the PET showed my cancer as inactive where, if I had seen a CT, I would have been freaked out over the size of the lesions. Lesions tend to die before they shrink. And sometimes the dead lesions are never cleared from the tissue. Good luck!",

I haven't gone back and read all the posts. The volume on this thread makes it hard to keep up sometimes. Robin, my tumor markers went up for 3 months before they went down on Xeloda. However, it was working all that time because my mets were inactive by my 3-mo PET scan and had shrunk significantly. Increased tumor markers is a hallmark response to Xeloda. It may be worth trying it again. In my experience, comparing a CT to PET doesn't work well. My MO did that once and it was a complete failure, which led to delay in catching progression. I have had to strong-arm my MO into doing PETs only. For me, I need to see whether the mets are active or not, which a CT will not show. Metabolic activity seems to show when a drug starts working or stops working before shrinkage or growth.",

Kayboorg, I also agree it is wise to try to get the pre certification for the medication approval now, since that process is just one more delay before one can start treatment. Might as well have it ready to go. My insurance company approves the expensive medications for a year at a time. Even if you don't use it in the next year, a renewal authorization is much quicker in my experience than the initial approval. I understand your concern about the washout period before a trial. There has to be a better way! My week has kicked off with a bang. My cancer center has lost my liver biopsy. The only reason I found out is that my DH is a doctor and has access to my medical file. The MO or center didn't even call me to tell me. Per the notes in my file, the specimen was supposed to be sent to Caris for genomic test. It wasn't sent to Caris because it was automatically sent out to another company for a FISH test. Caris inquired about whether they should wait until the sample is returned from the other company or receive another sample. No response given to Caris. Other company indicated that they received my sample but that the sample sent was EMPTY. Seriously? All the time, money and risk of a surgery and they lost it. And didn't tell me about it? I can't believe I might have to do that all over again. This is just beyond belief.",

I drive myself to and from chemo all the time, as I currently don't take any of those premeds. If my memory serves me correctly, Taxol is usually given with Decradron (steroid/anti-allergic), Zofran (anti-nausea), Benedryl (anti-allergic) and Ativan (anti-anxiety, mild secondary anti-nasea effect). Of those, the two culprits that would prohibit driving are Benedryl and Ativan. I agree with Grannax, you may be able to negotiate out of getting Ativan. I doubt they would let you skip the Benedryl your first dose but possibly for a later dose if you don't show any signs of allergy to the drug. I have been able to convince them to forego the Ativan, Benedryl and/or Decadron at times. I feel for you - I had to scramble to find someone to take me to every chemo appointment when I was early stage and it was hard as I was single, new to the city and my family lived on the other side of the country at the time.",

I see you have an FGFR1 amplification. There is an FGFR1 basket trial recruiting out of NIH. That was the one I was planned to enter in four few weeks . . . had my biopsy not been partially lost. Although I don't have enough slides for the Caris test required for the FGFR1 trial, I do have a bit of remaining sample and am having my HER2 equivocal status from IHC retested for FISH, given that HER2 equivocal is now treated if confirmed by FISH. My first FISH results were negative but very borderline. I requested my biopsy be re-tested with pathologist Michael Press at USC. Honestly, I might call his office back and ask if they can test for anything else while they are at it! I would really like to get myself on HER2 treatments. Given my super aggressive cancer, my gut tells me they will help tame this beast. Sandibeach, was your FNA liver biopsy something they did while you were awake? Is it less invasive? Bluebird, what is a liver clinic? And how do I get to one?! Kaayborg, two pieces of good news. Eribulin is working and Merck will cover Keytruda.

It is one of my potential options when Abraxane stops working or when I need a break from it. I also asked if I could take it with Abemaciclib and he said yes. He noted he would be more inclined to put me on Abemaciclib with hormone therapy than without. Being that I am always one to push things to the limit, I also asked if he would give me Abemaciclib with hormone therapy at the higher dose approved for monotherapy and he said it depends - if it was never tested at that dose then maybe but if it was tested and then lowered due to side effects in trials, then probably not. Based on what Nkb mentioned about the MONARCH trial, it sounds like it was tested at the higher dose and then lowered. Has anyone else had conversations about Abemaciclib optionsstrategy/plans with their MOs? Would be interesting to hear what else is being said.",

I don't do that but since my DH reviews all the CT portions of my PET/CTs with me, I know well what those gray \"hypo dense\" regions look like and have a very good sense at any given time how much of my liver consists of mets, which goes up and down like a yo-yo on a long string. He also explained by showing me that the measurements of tumors in the reports only account for two angles (length and width - ___cm x ___ cm) but there are really three (length, width and depth - ___cm x ___ cm x ___ cm). My last scan didn't reflect the extent of my tumor shrinkage because it didn't include the depth measurement which decreased significantly. What does a bone biopsy involve? What made you decide to have one given the recent liver biopsies?",

Based on my observation only, it seems nearly all the stage 4 folks living 10 or 15 or more years seem to be HER2 and on herceptin or one of the later line HER2 treatments. Did the report give any drug recommendations for ERBB2 or note whether you have an \u201camplification\u201d versus \u201calteration\u201d? For ESR1, it is certainly good to know you may be resistant to AIs so that your MO and you can keep a close watch on it. However, my view is why throw out a treatment before it stops working. I had several mutations on my F1 that were linked to a high likelihood of hormone therapy resistance but I managed to squeak out 15 months on aromasin/faslodex (with Ibrance added the second half of that time period, after it was approved). Also, although I only I only lasted 3 months on aromasin/affinitor because I progressed, it did slow the rate of progression from about 80mph when I started to 20mph or so. My bc is a speed demon and typically travels at 100mph or above so I view those 3 months when it was slowed down significantly as buying me 3 more months of time.",

When I started, nearly my entire left lobe of my liver consisted of cancer per the description in my PET scan and the right side was filled with large tumors and innumerable small tumors. By my 3 month PET, my mets had shrunken significantly and had zero increased metabolic uptake and were inactive. Not only did nearly all of the mets in my left lobe disappear, but the liver tissue regenerated itself. It worked faster and was more effective and worked for a longer time for me than Abraxane. Like Lulubee, I also had more side effects (including liver pain) on my off week. That was when my liver pain (from dying mets) and hand issues were the worst. It is a timing thing with the cycle of meds. My tumor markers and liver enzymes flared during the first 3-4 months on Xeloda, which I understand is somewhat common. I hope it works for you. It is a really great medicine. Robin, so wonderful to hear from you and so happy Abraxane is doing the trick! Scary stuff. You are a trooper. I am looking into getting Y90 on an expedited basis. Hoping the diffuse nature of some of my mets will not be an obstacle to that. Woody, nice to see your posts! Kaayborg, the whole \"congrats\" thing is just awful.

Here is what I know, as I have tried all three and know way too much about these three drugs. At the end of the day, you can't go wrong with any of them. You are making a good decision. - Taxol is from the Pacific Yew tree and sometimes faces shortages based on scarcity. The infusion is long. In trials, Taxol fared slightly better on a weekly regime versus every 3 weeks. Some people have allergic reactions to the binding agent, Cremaphor. For a small 1-2% (including me), this leads to severe, immediate anaphylaxis. I made it a few minutes, maybe less, into my first infusion and had to abort ship permanently. - Taxotere is a synthetic version of Taxol, much more potent, much more toxic. The infusion is shorter and less medicine is required given its potency. In trials, Taxotere fared slightly better on an every 3-week regime versus weekly; and was found to be slightly more effective than Taxol. The binding agent for Taxotere is Polysorbate-80 which doesn't typically give people allergic reactions. I took Taxotere when I was early stage on a dose dense regime (every 3-week dose administered every 2 weeks) which is not approved for Taxotere due to unacceptable toxicity levels and I would not recommend it to anyone. In hindsight, it was a bad idea although I was very enthusiastic about the aggressive approach at the time. I lost all of my hair completely and it took some time for it to fully grow in in various areas on my head. Some areas were thinner for years (crown of head, especially on one side). When I was pregnant and diagnosed with mets, I did one dose of weekly Taxotere until I could have the baby and start on hormone therapy. I had zero symptoms and did not lose a strand of hair. - Abraxane is Taxol bound in Albumin rather than Cremaphor in a nano particle formulation. Given that Albumin is a naturally occurring protein the body, the side effects from the binding agent are drastically deduced. The infusion is super short (30 minutes) and no premeds are required although some people receive premeds. In trials, there were some mixed results about whether Abraxane fared better on an every 3-week dose versus weekly (with a week off every 2 or 3 weeks). One large study showed a slight benefit to weekly administration while another smaller study showed the opposite. In trials I saw, Abraxane was slightly more effective than Taxol. (I don't know about Abraxane v. Taxotere.) I took this on an every three week dose with cold caps and kept some of my hair, enough to go without a wig for 6 months. After the 6-month mark, I started wearing a wig but believe it was more a function of the fact that (1) Dignicap changed its cap tightening system for the worse in my case, which made my hair suddenly fall out and (2) my Dignicap never fit right as I had to use one WAY, WAY too big in circumference to fully cover my hairline.",

In overly simplistic terms, it purportedly shuts down the cancer growth cycle when one fasts. Also, it is supposed to prevent chemo side effects and collateral damage to healthy tissues if one fasts before/after chemo. Sounds counterintuitive, but it has something to do with your healthy cells temporarily slowing down their growth mode so that they are no longer targets of chemo, which typically kills fast growing cells. Since reading about the nightly fasting a month or so ago, I have been practicing that. I would have a harder if not impossible time fasting for a whole day or more but trying to eat dinner a bit earlier and cutting off all eating after dinner has been pretty effortless.",

Also, I just had Y90 liver radioembolization yesterday which is suited for higher volume tumor loads and diffuse mets. My liver is currently around 25 - 35% comprised of mets (possibly more, as IR said he found additional mets during the Y90 mapping procedure which uses more sensitive scans).",

My first IR said no, it was too dangerous, as I am too heavily pretreated and my liver would fail. The second IR, who is much more of an expert in Y90 and has extensive experience with Y90 specifically in breast cancer, told me I was an \"ideal candidate\". There is an element of science in this and an element of art and everyone interprets the art differently, for better or for worse. I hope you make some progress with the trial route. Z, I have also heard of others who have had some sort of flare that resulted in abdominal swelling/bloating upon starting a new chemo. You really went through extreme measures to ensure those cancer beasts were targeted with laser precision so it would not be surprising if everything is going haywire within those cells right now or if some massive die-off is underway. I used to \"hate\" the idea of chemos but have grown to appreciate them for how powerful they can be. ",

Even categorizing BC by molecular type into luminal A, luminal B, triple negative/basal-like and HER2 has been an improvement in understanding how each type works and why there can be a vast difference in response rates/prognosis within, for example, ER+ BC between luminal A and luminal B. When I was originally diagnosed in 2006, these categories didn't exist. It always bothers me that so many cancer treatments are arbitrarily approved for certain indications when they would likely work for so many other indications, cancers or subtypes. It is all about $ at the end of the day. All research is siloed and competitive and no one is looking for a universal cure - only to prove their particular clinical trial is a success.",

It is metabolized almost instantly in the liver whereas glucose (in table sugar) is not metabolized as quickly and is mostly not metabolized in the liver. Cancer cells have a special infinity for fructose, moreso than glucose. It does apply to fruits although one has to balance that against health benefits of fruits. Also, some fruits have a higher fructose ratio than others. Of course, the worst culprit is high fructose corn syrup and added fructose used to sweeten food products. I freaked out and didn't eat any fruit or sugar for 3 days after learning all this. I went through an uncomfortable withdrawal and then felt awesome after the first day and a half. I could not keep it up though. Not realistic for me. Now, I do try to avoid all added fructose and, if I am going to eat sugar, select products sweetened with sugar rather than fructose. I even noticed my \u201clight, no sugar added yogurt\" was sweetened, in part, by added fructose. False advertising. I would like to avoid all added sugars (both glucose and fructose) but have found that difficult. I settled on trying to minimize added glucose sugars, avoid added fructose and eat fruit in moderation. I also take 1T of apple cider vinegar before bed. The friendly bacteria in it feast on sugar and lower the blood sugar levels in one's body.",

Shetland, for what it is worth, I was on the fence about lowering my Xeloda dose around the 1 year mark. Neither I nor my MO felt strongly about it but we both had thought about it. I went from 3000mg 14 on/7 off to 3000mg 7 on/7 off. I showed progression at my next scan two months later after being NEAD for over a year on X. It may have been my time to progress regardless but I have always regretted going to 7 on/7 off. I think my cancer needs more time on the med and less time to recover. If I had to do it over again, I would have lowered the mg but stayed on 14 on/7 off (or stayed at full dose which was still tolerable just getting a bit tough). Everyone is different and everyone's cancer is different. Just wanted to share my story since you are at a decision point. Good luck deciding what is best for you. Curious, thanks for posting the info about VEGF, EMT and stem cells. I will read it. If we can figure out to kill those damn stem cells, I think we would be in a case closed situation.

Nouzay, I totally understand your hesitation to drop a drug too quickly. Could you request to be monitored more closely and get a scan sooner than your typical cycle? Shetland raises a good point about asking how fast the cancer is moving. When it comes to chemos, my progression seems to come on more slowly (on hormone therapy it came on like an exploding volcano). It sounds like you have mixed results and very minor progression.

I alternated once - and it burned me badly. I get PET-CT scans every 3 months but my MO has always tried to push me to do CT + bone scan because they are easier to get through insurance. I have fought him on this all along (and have never had an issue with insurance questioning or denying a PET). After several positive PET-CT scans where my liver mets had shrunken significantly and went 100% inactive, he had me do a CT instead of a PET-CT at the 3-month mark. It looked about the same as the prior CT portion of the PET-CT but by the next 3 month scan, there was a complete explosion and the worst my liver has ever been - 70% of my liver was mets with nearly the entire left lobe being mets. I suspect a PET-CT would have told me that the fire was starting to burn out of control. Before my liver mets grow (or shrink), the metabolic activity increases (or decreases). The PET-CT tells me when to start watching something closely and start thinking about the next treatment and when a medicine has shut down the activity in the mets before the lesions have had a chance to shrink. The PET-CT is always two steps ahead of the CT for me and gives me more meaningful data than the CT alone, especially for liver mets which live in a very nutrient-rich microenvironment and can grow very quickly. If I went off of CTs alone, I would have thought medications were failing when they were working and thought they were working when they were failing. However, everyone is different. Once you decide what is right for you, stick with one test.",

With bone mets, I believe the radiologist needs to examine the CT portion of the PET-CT in conjunction with the PET portion to determine whether the lesions that light up appear lytic (weaker and less dense than bone tissue) or blastic (more dense and more brittle than bone tissue). It is possible a radiologist would be able to identify rheumatoid arthritis in the same way as it would likely look different than lytic or blastic lesions. I hope you can find some answers from your doctors. I agree that sometimes I wonder if the MOs even know!",

One would need to use PET scans to show metabolic activity. All but one of my treatments worked well. I had large shrinkage from Aromasin/Faslodex combo with Ibrance added after the first 7 or so months (worked for 15 months), Xeloda (worked for 14 months) and Abraxane (took for 7 months and moved on due to side effects and possible but not confirmed resistance slowly creeping in) and now good results on Doxil (5 months and going strong) + recent Y90 radioembolization. After I became resistant to my initial hormone treatment, I tried Afinitor/Aromasin for 3 months which did not do enough to overcome the hormone resistance. The most effective of all treatments on my liver mets was Xeloda (pill form of chemo, no hair loss). It is known to work well on liver mets. I also found Xeloda the most tolerable for quality of life and preferred it to even hormone therapy. When I started Xeloda, my liver was at its worst and was 70% mets. Xeloda shrunk the tumor load down to 10% that remained metabolically inactive for over a year. Xeloda is a second generation, targeted (much less harm to healthy cells), pill form of 5-FU that is inactive when taken and is then activated in the liver itself by the body's liver enzymes. My liver has never gone above 25-35% or so tumor load and my progressions have never been as aggressive or explosive since then. My treatments have worked really well - until they don't, if that makes sense. Also note that I was working full time at a demanding job, raising my infant, eating normally and running 3 times per week when my liver was 70% mets. I had no idea I was progressing. The liver is a very tough and resilient organ and one only needs 10% or so of the liver to function. The liver also regenerates itself.",

Taxanes hit a specific step in the cell cycle and that step is not instantaneous. Is your MO a breast MO used to dealing with young metastatic patients? Your overall health as a young woman puts you in a position to be able to handle the treatments better, bounce back more quickly, and have a more significant response to treatment (our immune systems are higher when we are younger and aggressive cancers can respond more quickly - easy come, easy go, as they say). It saddens me that your MO is essentially writing you off, somewhat lazily, before you are ready to go. It is your decision in the end but it is hard to contemplate you are out of options. Getting a second opinion sounds exhausting but you always have the option of telling your MO that you would prefer to continue on Taxol for a while and see how it goes. If he disputes this, you can tell him to \"humor you\". If he disputes this, you may even request to be moved to another MO at the place where you are at. While you have to live with the result of his decision, he is going home at the end of the day to have dinner with his family and sleep well at night.

It is your life and your body and I hope in my heart of hearts that things turn around for you.

The question is whether he would give that same advice if it were his spouse . . . . Not likely. That is not his towel to throw but is yours. The A in AC is pretty harsh - could you try Doxil? It is the same drug as A but formulated in a liposomal delivery format to better target the cancer and cause less collateral damage on the healthy cells. No hair loss, no extreme fatigue and nausea like A. It only needs to be administered every 4 weeks because it continues to circulate in your body longer than other drugs. There is also Halaven and Navelbine which are more tolerable. There's is also Verzenio which works on people who have failed Ibrance and can be given with or without hormone therapy. The others have also given some good recommendations. Keep us posted. Thinking of you.",

Typically, a Y90 candidate would have stable mets in other organs but some here have had Y90 while not stable elsewhere. I learned through my own experience that nearly all oncologists do not know about Y90/are not up to date on its use in breast cancer, even interventional radiologists who do Y90 are not up to date on its use in breast cancer and you should try to find an interventional radiologist that does a lot of oncology. You are at Moffitt, right? You may have some good doctors there given that it is a top ranked facility. I am in South Florida and had an excellent interventional radiologist at Baptist/MSKCCC.

I try to annoy them into taking action :) While they go to lunch and they go home at the end of the day with their families, we still have cancer. Our cancer day doesn't end when we are off work. It sounds crazy that no one other than a nurse who is out on leave can schedule an appointment for you. If need be, you can start Abraxane without a port and have one put in later to avoid further delay. It is a short infusion - mine was 45 minutes, plus 15 minutes of premeds. I believe I stopped taking premeds after a few sessions and then it was only 45 minutes. I did it every 3 weeks. If you do it weekly, the infusion may be even shorter. I did Abraxane for 7 months and didn't get a port. I still haven't had a port put in and have been on Doxil the last 7 months after I stopped Abraxane. Ascites would usually be treated with chemo, especially if you have already progressed on hormone therapy. Not something to wait around to treat. I sometimes feel that the medical staff see us as a number and believe we are going to die anyway so don't see each individual decision and the urgency of those decisions as that important at the end of the day. Sadly, some medical staff write us off. It is not their place to do that.",

I hope that the barrier can finally be broken through with immunotherapy and BC. Muddling, I agree with your post and have a similar perspective. My gut tells me the answer to cancer is much more simple than the researchers believe and there may be a cure out there that is a tweak on an existing medication, such as in the delivery system, or in an over-the-counter product, whether for cancer or some other ailment, or possibly something that targets a mechanical reaction rather than a purely chemical one (such as a medication that breaks through or reverses the stiffness of the cancer cells) or something very boring that is already in existence. Simple, boring and generic do not equate to large profits for big pharma and it is big pharma research dollars that are necessary to conduct the trials. It is like Cinderella being overlooked when she is in her normal, ratty clothes. No one recognizes her as the princess of the ball that she is or even contemplates her being anywhere in the same league as those at the ball. I suspect our cure, or at least the road to our cure, is hiding in plain sight in drab clothes!",

There was some language about MO discretion which I am hoping applies at this step but I think it might be language left over/inadvertently included from a different trial where the biopsy is actually performed at NCI (like I said, poorly written and doesn\u2019t make sense). The trial acceptance is good for 60 days and I am going to have my 4th Halaven treatment this Friday, get a PET scan to determine if Halaven is working and then decide what to do.

I have stable bone mets throughout my entire skeletal system and numerous, diffuse lesions in my liver and was told I was an \u201cideal\u201d candidate. The key is to find an IR with heavy oncology experience and some experience with breast cancer. The analysis for colon and liver mets patients for Y90 is totally different so an IR with only that experience might tell you that it is too risky (which is BS). They have limited chemo options and most use Itinotecan which permanently decreases liver function over time with long-term use. I was told that by the first IR. He saw I was heavily pretreated and assumed my liver function was sunsetting from that fact alone, based on his experience in colon and liver cancer. I then went to an oncology expert with BC experiencewho said I was an ideal candidate.",

It\u2019s use in breast cancer is cutting edge and many doctors are not familiar with the recent research done in breast cancer patients. You can have it done even with innumerable, poorly defined liver mets, as mine are. I had Y90 last year. The first IR I spoke to said I wasn\u2019t a candidate and it was risky. Then I went to a specialist in oncology IR with experience with Y90 in breast cancer patients and was told I was an ideal candidate and the procedure was low risk. My tumor load has ranged from 10% of liver to 70% liver involvement, mostly blobs and areas of infiltrating cancer among liver cells that eventually converge into bigger blobs as the cancer grows. Y90 is the first local therapy used in patients with a high tumor load. It is actually not used in people who have only a few liver tumors. Radioactive beads are wired up through the artery in one\u2019s leg to the hepatic artery in the liver. The radioactive beads are then released into the artery and are selectively drawn in to the tumor cells with very little impact on healthy liver cells. Liver tumors high-jack the hepatic artery blood supply and account for 85% or more of its use while healthy cells primarily use the hepatic vein for blood supply. The tumor cells suck up the radioactive beads and then the beads release the radiation once inside the tumor. Y90 may not be an option with your healthcare system but you may want to try investigating further",

Beyond efficacy, our bodies are not meant to convert fat to sugar for ordinary course consumption on a regular basis and the process is very hard on the body. With our bodies (or at least my body!) stretched too thin as it is, being on treatment for so many years, I don't want to tax my body further. Something has got to give and our livers have less healthy functioning cells. When the breast cancer cells bump up against liver cells in the liver, normal cell instructions tell the liver cell to die to make room for the abutting cell. Breast cancer cells do not get that same message and eventually take over shop. If the body is constantly busy converting fat to sugar, will it have reserves left over to fight the cancer?",

Stats mean nothing to me because stats-wise, I was not \"supposed\" to get breast cancer given my young age at original diagnosis and my lack of risk factors.

The only time I turned down a trip was two months after diagnosis when my DH and his parents and my Dad went to Rome, the Vatican, Sicily and at least one other city to pray for me at various Saint locations relevant to my diagnosis. I am never one to turn down a trip to Europe (or anywhere else) but at that point, my bone mets were not healed enough - my hips/pelvis/tops of femurs were swiss cheese and, as I learned more recently, I had a few vertebrae fractures in my lumbar spine at that time. I was worried I wouldn't be able to do the walking required for the trips. However, since then, I travel as much as possible. I always plan in breaks throughout the day (which my DH actually appreciates too - traveling is tiring for everyone). I also buy trip insurance and sometimes medical insurance when traveling abroad. I have also had to work around various side effects such as hand foot syndrome on Xeloda and Doxil. I had to travel for work on Doxil when I was at a low point with huge blisters covering my feet. I had no choice but to wear business shoes. I actually mapped out my entire path in the airport to minimize the steps I had to take from the car to the gate and tried on tons of shoes to find something that was tolerable and comfortable yet looked appropriate. With Halaven, you can leave right after your day 8 (week 2) infusion, which would give you two weeks between treatments. You can also have a treatment a day early or a few days late if needed to work around the travel schedule. As for locations, Italy is my favorite - Rome, specifically. However, my favorite overall trip was to Japan - flew into Tokyo and then took the bullet train to Kobe, Kyoto and Osaka. Exceeded my expectations beyond belief. I also love Paris, Madrid, Barcelona, Lisbon (and even moreso, Sintra which is a small town outside of Lisbon in the mountains where a castle is located - I could escape there forever, breathing in the mountain air surrounded by all of the green trees and eating the delicious food at the small, local restaurants on the hill in town). Cruises are also a good option because you can go sight see and when you need a break, head back to the boat. Or, you can rest in the room or by the pool while your DH is doing something else on the boat, etc. So many options. No shlepping one's suitcases around to different cities. For my honeymoon, we flew to Rome and stayed a few days on each side and then took a cruise that went through various cities/islands in Italy, Greece and also went to Turkey (no longer do cruises go to Turkey though) - Sicily, Napoli/Capri, Mykonos, Athens, Santorini and Ephesus. I also recently took a cruise that departed out of Venice, Italy and traveled to various cities/islands in Greece, Croatia and Montenegro - Dubrovnik, Split, Kotor, Athens and Olympia. I flew into Milan and then took a train to Venice and spent a few days in each city and took the cruise. Amazing. I would HIGHLY recommend either of those routes. A Carribbean cruise is also a good option and can be more relaxing - you can spend time under a sun umbrella and not even walk much if you don't want to do so. I live in a similar tropical area with the beach a block away, but never feel I can just lounge around on the beach all day at home. When it is planned as part of the trip, no guilt associated with doing little to nothing. Also, cruises do have a doctor on board who can assist with various mild to moderate issues you may have. Someone I know recently saw the cruise doctor to get a prescription for a UTI. Good luck deciding where to go and what to do!!!",

I am also on a power dose which is more aggressive on the hair - I get a max dose infusion every 3 weeks, rather than weekly infusions at a lower dose. Does your center have access to a scalp cooling system or cold caps that you could inquire about? It sucks to be in our position. However, I recommend you give it a shot and decide as you go whether it is something you can handle. There is also an oral chemo Xeloda which is very tolerable and doesn't involve hair loss. Or Doxil, which is given 1 time every 4 weeks and also doesn't make you lose your hair. I hope all goes well tomorrow. Know that there are many here thinking of you.",

The liver itself bleeds a lot which may explain why they wouldn't simply remove a suspicious spot in the liver.

Each MO is a mix of skill, experience, passion, open-mindedness, respect for the patient, bedside manner and personality, etc. No one is going to be a 10 out of 10 on all of those. I need to keep that in mind and remember how frustrating my prior MO was who had a major ego and zero open-mindedness. I have it pretty good now, when I put it all into perspective. Z, I hope you hospital gets the biopsy order right this time. I, too, have been questioning which would be better Y90 or a specific type of TACE called DEBDOX. Another consideration I have been floating is metronomic therapy. I found some old posts where you had discussed it. I am looking for people who have actually done it so I can learn more and am having a hard time finding any. Shetland, I am in the same boat as you, I just don't know how MRIs fit into the mix. I don't have enough information to have an opinion at this point. I need to learn more. I do recall I had a breast MRI years ago because it could better display changes in dense breasts. It definitely is more sensitive than some other scans. With ILC, you are certainly in a unique boat since your buggers can be sneaky. ",

I don't have my MO's cell but DH does (they are colleagues at same hospital) and sent my MO a photo and MO faxed in a prescription right away. I had pain and itching and very bad flu-like symptoms all last week, keeping me up all night every night, but the shingles themselves didn't appear until Thursday night or Friday morning. I thought I had the flu and my blood counts would be tanked and my Fri chemo would be canceled but all labs were normal. I also thought I had a bug bite without a bite mark before the shingles popped up. Would not have done chemo if I knew I had shingles. Flu-like symptoms disappeared within 24 hours of starting anti-virals. Just dealing with localized pain and itching now although it still kept me up all night last night. Lindalou, I hope cycle 2 of Xeloda treats you well. Definitely my \u201cfavorite\" of all meds I have had to date, due to strong efficacy and reasonably manageable side effects.

My labs were all normal on the CBC and liver panel, which was great! Usually when I am sick, my liver enzymes temporarily go out of normal range, particularly if I have a stomach bug. They were slightly above normal last infusion, when I was also sick. However, they are now back to normal.

On the Doxil thread, I just saw that for someone on Doxil, this has been her longest treatment at over a year - and she is 6 years into stage 4 and heavily pretreated, meaning past performance doesn't always tell you what future results will be.

I have at times had loved ones with very strange, disappointing, troubling responses to my BC that have caused me anxiety, confusion, rejection, frustration and anger. I ended up trying to keep my distance from them and creating my own \"family\" of caretakers from people around me who were positive and supportive. Some were close friends but others were only acquaintances who turned out to be very supportive. Some of my medical staff fell into this group, as did fellow BC women I met on boards or through my cancer center. Three of the people who took me to chemo were mere acquainces who offered and genuinely wanted to be there for me. I will never forget what they did for me, even though we were never that close. My point is that one never knows who will surprise you by showing up to the game and who will surprise you by bailing out. I hope you can cobble together the \"family\" you need from the people who show up to help you through the treatments when you need assistance!!! It may not be the people you would expect but it can be more therapeutic to have genuine support from an eclectic bunch that becomes your \"family\".",

Mama, it is scary to progress in liver but things can also turn around quite quickly for the better on the right meds. My liver is almost mets free after 9 months of Xeloda whereas when I started over half my liver was comprised of mets (nearly the entire left lobe). I hope Xeloda can help you if that is what your doctor and you finally settle on.",

It wasn't the doctor's first choice of scans (I was pregnant and couldn't have any scans emitting radiation) and doesn't provide as much detail as a CT, MRI or PET-CT but there was no reasonable question about it being mets. I am curious, why does your doctor think it is unclear what it is? Would a PET-CT scan be an option since it would show increased metabolic activity if it were active mets? One thing to keep in mind, I read an article that said the liver is not a \"complainer\" until the very end. I had over half my liver consisting of mets with no side effects a year ago and no tumor markers, alkaline phosphotase or liver enzymes out of normal range. I would not hang my hat on no symptoms, although no lesion growth is a great sign. Good luck in finding the answers you need.",

My Mom recently asked if it was good that the cancer was in my liver because the liver rids the body of toxins (and in her reasoning, cancer). She was thinking my body was sweeping all the cancer to my liver for removal. She just doesn't get how cancer works. It makes me sad sometimes. She is a wonderful, loving Mom but just doesn't have that interest in understanding the situation in detail. It is hard for me to understand because if I were a parent with a child with cancer, I try to be more like you - trying to understand everything and do everything I can to help. ",

Sandilee, glad to hear Tamoxifen is working! Do you think you will ever take Xeloda again down the road? (I recall it was working for you but you just had terrible side effects with HFS. I haven't gone back to look at previous pages so if you already posted about this, I missed it.) Although I took Tamoxifen for 4.5 years, I plan to request it again at some point after I have exhausted other hormone therapies. I think there is a test to determine how well one metabolizes Tamoxifen related to the CYP2D6 enzyme.",

It is not like Faslodex, which is an estrogen receptor downregulator. AIs prevent the conversion of the hormone precursor aromatase into estrogen, to lower circulating estrogen levels. In contrast, Faslodex destroys estrogen receptors permanently so they cannot receive circulating estrogen. Faslodex resistance does not necessarily mean you will not respond to another class of hormone therapy. Additionally, there are even studies that show that people are not necessarily cross-resistant to drugs of the same class, such as Femara and Arimidex. Most oncologists will cycle you through all the hormone therapies because of these reasons You may respond to one but not the other. In your case, Femara worked for you and you are not resistant to it now so you have a likelihood It would work again. I have taken my hormone therapies out of the traditional order. I have had Aromasin and Faslodex but not yet Femara and Arimidex. My MO says it doesn't matter the order. The order is more based on how the studies resulting in FDA approval happened to characterize the use. There is also Tamoxifen, a hormone receptor modulator, which works by blocking estrogen receptors in some but not all types of body tissue, such as breast tissue. Not sure if you have taken that in the past. I would request a second opinion or a reconsideration by your doctor!",

Lita, did you take medical cannabis for side effects or to actually treat the cancer? There seems to be so much promise in CDB oil for the treatment of breast cancer. My state recently approved medical marijuana and many are jumping to get into the business now.

Grannax, so awesome how well the Y90 is working. I have begun floating the procedure with my MO and bring up your success story. He is thinking it would be something for further down the road for me though. Maria, I have taken ibuprofen for liver pain, and on occasion, tramadol. Tramadol may be worth looking into to add to the ibuprofen. I didn't know about it until I asked in the hospital after surgery if they had anything that wasn't narcotic. It works well if you need something more than over-the-counter but are not looking to take opiates. No loopy, drugged up feeling.",

      "Content": "May 11, 2017 11:15PM - edited May 11, 2017 11:21PM by JFL Shetland, the reason for Taxotere is because I am not resistant to it yet even though I have already taken it. For all practical purposes, I haven't really taken it for Stage 4 yet. (When I had it for Stage 4, it was just one single \"bridge\" dose (at a mild, weekly strength) that I took while pregnant because hormone therapy isn't safe while pregnant. Once the baby was delivered a week later, I was moved to hormone therapy.) Also, I think my MO suggests it simply because it is typically one of the first or second line chemos and is known to be one of the most effective for mets, with minimal side effects if administered weekly (at least in my experience). I am severely allergic to Taxol so that is out of the question - I tried it early stage and went into anaphylaxis in minutes. I don't mind taking Taxotere again - it may not \"cure\" me but if it gives me some time with progression-free survival, that is fine with me. I want to get as many yards out of each treatment as possible and avoid dismissing treatments that still might work. (In my head, I even plan to try Tamoxifen again at some point.) Like you mentioned, I thought my MO would put me on Afinitor and Femara. He mentioned that previously. However, I think he figures since Afinitor reverses or overcomes hormone therapy resistance, there wouldn't be an issue with me taking Aromasin again. Being that I blew through 2 hormone therapies in my first year (Aromasin and Falsodex), I don't mind being able to save Femara and Arimidex for later, possibly with other targeted therapy combos in the pipeline. At the end of the day, this is all a crap shoot and no one really knows what is the best course! I hate that aspect of it!!! As for what I heard about Afinitor, I believe BestBird posted an article about this at least a year ago, maybe more. I never forgot after reading it. The crux of the article was that the mutations that the cancer makes to get around the M-TOR inhibitor supposedly results in a cancer with very aggressive characteristics. This was argued by the authors of the article for being the reason why Afinitor did extend progression-free survival but not overall survival. I don't know what to believe. I hope these authors are wrong!!! Linda, sorry to hear about your liver. One thing about liver mets - they can grow quickly but they can also shrink quickly. I hope Taxol does that for you. Keetmom, I am looking forward to hearing about your experience on Doxil. I heard that it is very effective but without the cardio toxicity and severe side effects of Adriamycin. I was browsing the Doxil thread and can't believe it is only administered once a month. It must really pack a punch on mets if it can be given that infrequently! It is definitely on my short list of future treatments.",

It had been keeping him alive for 6 or 7 years (which used to be unheard of for melanoma) but he did have to manage a lot of side effects from it on a regular basis - issues with the overly reactive immune system attacking healthy tissues. Everyone's immune system reacts differently though and I think a lot of it has been a function of his super long-term use.

I totally understand being on the fence with caps. I am on the every 3 week Abraxane cycle (much stronger dose/highest dose they give, less often). Most people do weekly - two or three weeks on/one week off at a low dose. My MO said that for people who do weekly, only 50% lose their hair. However, it seems like everyone on weekly on the Abraxane thread lost their hair without question. With every 3 weeks, the hair will be gone after the first cycle without question. There is no way I could do weekly cold caps weekly. LALady is a champ for doing that for 5 months!!! Even though I plan to continue with cold caps and attempt to preserve the hair I can, I had to bite the bullet and buy a wig two nights ago. The hair loss was manageable but has recently tipped over the line. I am waiting for the wig to be ready following customization - hopefully at beginning of next week.

That must be a challenge given your fasting days to non-fasting days ratio and perhaps why, in part, you are transitioning to the fast mimicking diet? As far the HER2+ herceptin PET retesting trial - I spoke to the doctor running the trial at MSKCC. I met all of the criteria except for one requirement - my original, early stage breast biopsy sample with enough tissue for retesting. They retest both the original breast tumor biopsy and the Stage 4 biopsy. I had original breast biopsy done over 11.5 years ago and my cancer center confirmed a few days ago that they destroy all samples after 10 years. They drop the ball on a lot of things so I was hoping they dropped the ball on this and didn't get around to destroying it. However, no such luck. Very frustrating. Lesson for those of you with \"aging\" biopsies. Try to get them before your center destroys them as one never knows when one will need them. I have no doubt there would be a lot of tissue available from my original biopsy had it not been destroyed. I had a needle core biopsy on 2 tumors to diagnose me and then had lots of additional biopsy samples from my mastectomy two weeks later. My right breast was home to at least 6 cancerous tumors and over half of the breast consisted of DCIS when I was diagnosed.

On Abraxane, they have slowed to a simmer, but the stove is still on :( I called IR today and was told I need to provide my medical records for him to review before I can schedule an appointment. Trying to get him those by tomorrow so this process can move along quickly. I have to go in person to get the PET records which is a major hassle given that I work 50 mins from my home/cancer center. I suspect MO will want me to move to Doxil.",

A counter point weighing in favor of taking Afinitor now is that there is a window for taking it. It does get a bad rap and although it works well for some, it doesn't work for all people. However, it will not be prescribed once liver enzymes and other metabolic panel items are high. Thus, if one waits to take it, one may lose the chance to use it. For me, I only took it for 3 months. It slowed my cancer significantly but did not stop it. I am glad that it bought me 3 months, as a few short-term treatments quickly add up to a year or more. I was leery of Afinitor but decided to take the plunge based on the window of opportunity issue. Also, I hope you can find someone to go with you to appointments. I go to nearly all mine alone, including most chemos. With my and my DH\u2019s work schedules, it is hard to coordinate. And, when he is available, he usually has to stay home to take care of our toddler. I don\u2019t mind going alone although there are certain appointments I want my DH to be there. He can\u2019t go to all of those but we do our best to make it all work. Lilly, I hope you can get some more answers on what the doctors saw in your scans. ",

I had some odd, painful rashes after the first round and an extreme issue of my feet burning and blistering around round 2 or 3 but now that my dose has been lowered twice, I have no symptoms this round. My burning feet issue was probably caused by a combo of the dose, dealing with a temporarily compromised liver for a few weeks after Y90 and the fact that I did a lot of harsh things on my feet during the window 1 day before through 5 - 6 days after infusion. Had one of those factors not been present, I may have been okay. I later learned that that is the window to lay low and avoid all friction on feet, hands and body and to ice my feet and hands often. I have made adjustments and feel really great now. Rashes are common 2-3 cycles in and are considered somewhat self-limiting and they usually stop on their own, although I don't fully understand how that works. I think the skin figures out a way to protect itself against being burned by Doxil from the inside out in a similar way as skin builds up a tan on the outside to protect against the sun.

I contacted MSKCC today regarding an HER2 status testing trial that someone on these boards told me about - the trial doctor believes HER2+ is way under diagnosed and is evaluating diagnosing HER2+ via herceptin uptake as shown on a PET scan. The requirement to enter the trial is that the patient be previously diagnosed as HER2 negative. I called several days ago and was bounced around from the receptionist in his office, to the clinical trials department and disconnected along the way. Today, I found another number for him and I reached someone in the interventional radiology department. She took down my info and within a few hours, the trial doctor himself called me back. I missed the call but am very excited to call back tomorrow. Keeping fingers crossed I qualify for this one. Still fervently believe HER2 drugs will help me. I just had my second dose of Doxil and am 2 weeks out from Y90. My liver has started to hurt, which it usually does when I start a new medicine that is working. I hope that is the case here! My liver enzymes and tumor markers are all within normal range as of Friday although up ever so slightly. My liver also hurts when I progress but usually feels a bit larger in that case. Right now, my liver feels on the smaller side for me - no pressure when I slouch over and I feel like I can suck in my rib cage more than usual. It seems the back of my rib cage is over expanded due to liver mets but not the front. Please be my magic bullet!",

For the 3 months I took it, no one in the Afinitor thread in this forum seemed to be having any luck with the drug except one person. I would recommend looking into chemo - Xeloda is a pill that doesn't cause hair loss and I found it much more tolerable than Afinitor/Aromasin (exemestane). Chemo is a bit more aggressive to knock back liver mets and ascites (fluid buildup in the abdomen). Abraxane, Halaven and Doxil are also potential options for IV chemo. And there are others. I have taken Abraxane and am on Doxil now and haven't changed my lifestyle in the 4 years since liver and bone mets diagnosis - still work full time and no one knows I am stage 4 and undergoing treatment. I was not aware that Afinitor caused low platelets. Certain chemos can do that, such as Gemzar, but I wasn't aware it was a big problem on Afinitor. Does your mom have bone mets? Often, low platelets not caused by treatment are caused by mets in the bone marrow. If you treat those mets, the levels improve. Good luck. This is all scary and awful but we have a wonderful group of supportive people here and all hope is not lost. I have been living with very extensive liver/bone mets for 4 years. Liver mets tend to be aggressive following an Ibrance failure (in my anecdotal experience with my own Ibrance progression and the experience of others on this website). The cancer finds a workaround that is a more aggressive pathway. Additional hormone/targeted therapy combinations work for some but once you are dealing with aggressive progression or ascites, chemo may be the best way to go to get the cancer under control.",

During that time, I experienced the most effective response to to date. My liver was 70% mets when I started Xeloda - including nearly the entire left lobe being mets. By my 3 month PET scan after starting Xeloda, all of my liver tumors were inactive and had started to shrink. Don't jump ship before having a scan. Grannax, the biopsy did not hurt. I was awake the whole time, talking to the doctor. I was knocked out for my first liver biopsy in 2017 before even being wheeled into the biopsy room (the procedure table reminded me of Y90!). This time, they didn't give me any sedation until the very last minute, a few minutes before the biopsy needle went in. I asked for local only but ultimately agreed to a mini dose of sedation - I think 25% of the regular dose. The IR had me hold my breath a whole bunch of times in the scanner so I don't know how they handled that the first time when I was asleep. The only reason I agreed to sedation at all was that I didn't want to disrupt the procedure in case I could feel something and was tightening my stomach, moving or asking the doctor to stop midway through procedure. I didn't want to botch my own biopsy. Given that there are no nerve endings in the liver, they only need to numb the skin/muscle/capsule around the liver with the local lidocaine. Given my mini dose of sedation, I was able to leave after 1 rather than 2-3 hours. Grannax, I know you are not too jazzed about Afinitor. As far as both side effects and efficacy, I found Xeloda much more tolerable than Aphonytor (as LA Lady would call it) and it was much more effective as well. People think chemo and freak out but Xeloda is an oral pill and is my \"favorite\" treatment I have had to date. My only major side effect was manageable hand-foot syndrome. On Afinitor I had awful mouth sores and developed a mild - moderate chronic lung issue that had me on my toes, given Afinitor's risk of causing pneumonitis and serious lung issues. I only took Afinitor for 3 months as it did slow down the cancer growth but did not stop it. I also prefer Xeloda to Ibrance/AI/Faslodex from a side effect profile. Could that be an option for you? It is particularly effective in liver mets. It is in an inactive form when swallowed and activates in the liver due to a certain liver enzyme.",

I went in thinking it would be a breeze and was taken a little off guard when the side effects crashed the party without warning. If my scan results are good, then it will be worth it. KC, I am so sorry to hear about the scan results. The only caveat would be to make sure that the appropriate person, trained in reviewing immunotherapy-treated patients, is reviewing the scan in case some of the effects of immunotherapy cause tissue to light up similar to metabolically active tumors. The spleen is an uncommon location for mets. Do you have ILC? The liver can bounce back quickly and regenerate itself. As far as mets are concerned, easy come, easy go. Those that progress rapidly also tend to die rapidly with the right treatment. I hope that you ultimately receive the Y90 once the liver is under control. I know that typically, Y90 is given when mets in other organs are stable. However, I recall several people on these boards that had Y90 when mets in other organs were not necessarily under control (I recall someone had active/non-stable lung mets and another had active/non-stable mets in multiple organs). The argument in those cases was that the liver was the most pressing issue. You should be able to continue with treatment while on Y90, so long as it is not a chemo known to compromise the liver (like Irinotecan). I have continued on Doxil without breaks, as has Babs, and Grannax continued on targeted therapy. My mets are so aggressive, there is no way I could be off of treatment for 12 or so weeks. My IR did space out my right and left lobe to 8 weeks apart, given the tumor burden involved in my right lobe. He wanted extra time to ensure that no liver failure occurs and would safely know by the 8 week point as liver failure would present by the 5-6 week point.",

Also, I have had an area on my back near my spine on the liver side that is a bit numb under the skin - from the mets pressing on a nerve that runs behind the liver. When I was first diagnosed, the area just right of my spine running up and down along the upper 2/3 of my back was very painful and tender to the touch from the liver mets pressing on a nerve. I also feel a tightness on the right upper middle back when I take a big breath, particularly when lying down, which feels like a tight muscle stretching when I breathe. It is always there but sometimes will become more apparent when my liver mets are larger.

Below are a few of the articles I have come across regarding ketones potentially fueling breast cancer growth, or, the cancer cells adapting to alternative metabolic pathways when metabolism of sugar via glycolisis is unavailable. The general theory is that the relationship is not as simple as cancer cells feed off of sugar via glycolysis but do not feed off of non-glycolytic fuels, such as ketones and fatty acids. Certain cancer cells may be unable to metabolize ketones where others are not, in the universe of the diverse, heterogenetic tumor. Additionally, when deprived of sugar, cancer cells may effect changes in nearby cells in the tumor microenvironment that then essentially undergo reprogramming to develop alternate metabolic pathways that fuel the tumor cells via full oxidative processes as required with ketones and fatty acids rather than glycolysis (reverse Warburg effect). Certainly the jury is still out but the initial, early stage findings at the cellular and metabolic level in these studies are enough to spook me. To each his/her own and I do acknowledge that the mainstream medical opinion is that a ketogenic diet may improve breast cancer outcomes. I am not opposed to ketogenic diets and in fact, spent many years in my 20s eating a strict ketogenic diet. In law school, I found that nothing worked to lose weight except a keto diet. However, I also spent the balance of the 5 years before I was diagnosed eating a keto diet and it didn't seem to work out for me too well! Ketone body utilization drives tumor growth and metastasis Ketones and lactate \"fuel\" tumor growth and metastasis Understanding the \"lethal\" drivers of tumor-stroma co-evolution The reverse Warburg effect is likely to be an Achilles' heel of cancer that can be exploited for cancer therapy",

This is one treatment that seems to be having a substantial survival benefit impact on us, based on observation. We may have actual stats some day. It can really beat back liver mets in a way that chemo cannot. Unfortunately, it doesn't prevent new mets and doesn't treat mets that are in hibernation but does work well on existing active mets to really get you in front of the liver mets rather than always feeling like you are chasing from far behind.",

The last few months I did the same dose 7 on 7 off. Like others have said, urea cream 20% helps, as does Vitamin B6. I took a Vitamin B complex sublingual under my tongue daily which helped. I bought two pair of thin, fabric gloves - one with grip, the other without. I wore gloves when I applied the lotion to hands. I also wore gloves when I had to do anything that required friction on my hands or hurt. I also kept a pair in the car to wear when I was driving when necessary and kept little wash cloths around to use to grip things when needed. For me, the hand foot syndrome on X was cyclical. It would be worst my week off and would improve when I started my next cycle. I started to figure out the few days it would be the worst and would try to plan around them. Also, I would recommend taking yogurt and probiotics every day to prevent digestion issues. There were a few of us that didn't have digestion issues on X and the common factor seemed to be that we all took probiotics. Hang in there. I hope your side effects improve.",

Mom, thanks for letting us know about Babs. My whole body sunk hearing the news. Babs was on various treatments at the same time as me and always just ahead of me. I learned a lot from her experiences and would tell my doctor that I heard about this or that from a woman I know who is treated at MSCKK. He used to work there so it did hold some weight. We were on Xeloda together and she always had an outside of the box solution for HFS. We had Y90 around the same time, while we were each on Doxil and didn't take any time off from chemo for the Y90 (which is not common). I remember she snuck food to eat after her Y90 or Y90 mapping procedure when one is not supposed to eat for many hours after. I did as well. In each case, if Babs was able to do that, I figured I could do it too. Her experience with Y90 while not taking a break from Doxil helped me sell the idea to my MO. Babs was so elegant, beautiful, tough and real. Just a good person at her core. She had a way of drawing in everyone - we all love her - although she seemed to make us all love her effortlessly, and perhaps unknowingly. She inspired me because she kept working full time and took very little time off due to treatments. I did the same and she made me feel like I wasn't off the deep end for wanting to do that. Sklitz, I think your instincts are right that it is time to be a bit pushy. No one on your medical team will be as interested in your well being and survival as you. This is true even with good doctors who go above and beyond for us, like my doctor. I still push him and have been very involved in the last year about my treatment decisions. He thought I was crazy when I first started asking about Y90 but came around over time and now realizes what a good decision it was for me. Be weary about ever going off a treatment before you have a scan. My AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase (ALK) jumped the first 4 months of Xeloda. At that time my liver took the biggest turnaround for the better to date. I started at 70% mets and all was inactive and shrinking by my first 3-month PET scan. Had he taken me off prior to the PET for fear of not working, I would not likely be alive today. Raven, my liver has been doing well now. I have been on Doxil for 6 months and had Y90 to liver during that time as well. My liver enzymes and alkaline phosphatase have been slightly elevated since Doxil and Y90 but both treatments can cause that. Other than when I start new treatments or have the occasional flu, my liver enzymes haven't historically stayed above normal range. My two tumor marker tests are low and the one that is more indicative of my status - CA 27-29 is the lowest it has ever been. I should be getting a PET soon and pray these treatments have been working and that the elevated levels are due to the meds and not cancer.",

The only challenge for you may be trying to determine progress/status due to alternating different types of scans. For example, if you see more mets on an MRI is it progression or simply a matter of the MRI being so much more sensitive (and vice versa when you receive CTs - have the lesions shrunk or is the test just less sensitive). I get PET/CTs. When I had my Y90, the IR did a SPECT which is apparently very sensitive and showed a lot more tumor volume than the PET-CT. It had been 3 months since my PET and we didn't know whether my cancer had grown or whether the SPECT just picked up tumors the PET-CT did not. Also, early on, my MO tried to alter PET/CTs with CTs after a few good PET scans, moving my PETs to every 6 months and doing a CT at the 3 month point, but it failed miserably, led to missing a major explosion of liver mets brewing when I had a plain CT and was scrapped after trying it once. For me, the CT plugged in at the 3 month point ended up being of no value because it was not comparable to the PET/CT and I didn't have any previous CTs against which to compare it.",

Sadly, I remain in denial even after 4 years. I agree, we all need get out of jail free cards! I will have to ask for that from Santa this year! Miao, I am sorry to hear about your potential femur issues with XGeva. The only thing that I read over the years that can help is regular weight-bearing exercise, although that is of no use if you are to the point of a fracture. I recall Janis on these boards had a femur fracture in the last few years - I can't recall her screen name but her signature says \"Enjoy every sandwich\". She is a long-term mets survivor (8 or more years) but rarely posts anymore. I worry about XGeva femur fracture as well. Cure-ious, thanks for sending the trial links!! I am looking into all of those. At least one is for triple negative and another for brain mets, which would exclude me, but a few of them are possibilities. Verzenio + Alpesilib sounds interesting. I will also watch the video link you posted. My DH talked to my MO this morning - my MO threw out Halaven as a next treatment right off the bat which I expected. He noted that w/r/t Verzenio, there is still the outstanding question of how well Verzenio will work on people who already failed Ibrance but that some doctors are starting to use Verzenio in combo with chemo. He also mentioned that my facility has worked with metronomic therapy in the past but that it hasn't had good results in what he has seen. My MO said that he would bounce some ideas off of colleagues and some other doctors at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Conference. I do appreciate that he thinks outside the box and takes into account my input and quality of life concerns. He wants me to take a few weeks off to recover from Doxil. On the one hand, that sounds great, on the other, it makes me nervous. I try to avoid downtime between treatments as my cancer can grow very rapidly in a short amount of time.

I would even eat so called junk food at times if that is all I could stomach (ice cream, chips, cookies, etc.). At the time, I felt the weight issue was more urgent than my overall plan to eat healthy and avoid added sugars, unhealthy fats, etc. I was able to keep the situation from getting worse and remain at a stable point by constantly working at it. I was struggling with cachexia for over a year and a half (starting with AA in 2017 and continuing on Abraxane and Doxil until December 2018). I started Halaven a month ago and all of the sudden, I have a ravenous, uncontrollable appetite that is catching me off guard. It seemed to happen over night and I am still adjusting to the new normal.

I saw similar language in my reports except my liver involvement has always been very large so there is never a question on the PET-CT scan. An MRI is more detailed and better at distinguishing smaller lesions. \"Decreased attenuation\", which is usually described as \"hypoattenuation\" and meaning that this area is less dense than standard liver tissue, is how liver mets are described. Liver mets show up as black spots on the CT portion of the PET-CT, slightly darker than the rest of the liver which displays as a grayish shadowy color, although there may be other causes of a less dense area. \"Activity\" means that there is metabolic uptake that lights up on the portion of the scan - think of a volcano and seeing red lava versus inactive, dormant black lava stone. However, there are other reasons why something might light up on a PET scan - injury or illness, etc. My tonsils light up when I am sick. There are local liver therapies that can be effectively used on one or several mets (and other local therapies that can be used on a person with a lot of mets). Liver mets are scary but there are many great, effective options out there.",

Typically, one month is much too early to scan for Y90 results. IRs will say it takes up to 5-6 months to see results. Y90 often causes the lesions to swell at first when it is working and appear larger on the scan. Also, there is often a ring from the radioactive material around the lesions that will light up on a PET at first. It looks like progression but it is not. On my first scan a few months after Y90, the radiologist interpreted it as progression and wrote up a bad report. My MO then spoke to him to remind him I had Y90 and my report was edited to state it appeared to be changes were associated with response to Y90 treatment. That would not explain the lymph node(s) but you may be in a better position than originally thought. Please make sure to push your doctors and confirm this is in fact progression and not post Y90 swelling",

I hope Ibrance continues to keep the mets at bay for a long, long time. Elderberry, although NED would be ideal (mets undetected), and NEAD is very nice (no active mets - may still there but in hibernation), all you need is stable or stablish. The liver is such a resilient organ. It only needs about 10% to function. People with other diseases can have their entire left lobe removed and function fine. When the treatments zap the cancer in the liver, the liver regenerates itself. I read an article that stated that the liver is not a complainer. So very true. It can withstand so much. I just read on another thread someone posting that Xeloda had worked for 6 years on his sister's liver mets and she was now just moving on to another treatment (Halaven, I believe). I have my port put in tomorrow morning. It has been so long since I had a port - 2007. I am so happy to hear that the technology has improved and ports can be much smaller now. My port back then was enormous and very high profile, bulging out of my skin. I am hoping they will give me a small port. I officially start Navelbine on Friday now. I have been researching Navelbine and Tamoxifen and found some articles that Tamoxifen has a synergistic effect on Navelbine. Very interesting. That may have played a part in why my MO suggested it.",

Why does Dr. Nagourney need a laparoscopic biopsy - is he looking to remove an entire tumor? I had understood that an entire tumor biopsy would be done either via open surgery or laparoscopic and that an ultrasound or CT-guided biopsy would be done to take a chunk of tumor. Removing the entire tumor is much more dangerous - my DH, a surgeon, was not on board when my MO recommended to fully remove two active tumors and give me a ton of tissue to biopsy now and later. As between open and laparoscopic, my DH said absolutely not re: laparoscopic if I did have a full tumor removed. Much more risk of the liver bleeding and not being able to see it. I was surprised as DH performs many laparoscopic surgeries of various organs in the abdomen and has advanced training in the method. Anyway, would your MO let you do an ultrasound or CT-guided biopsy, which is what most of us get, is much less invasive and is much less risky? An IR inserts a needle with a hole into the tumor, sucks out a chunk of tumor and that is it.",

Shortly after Judy had success, another breast cancer patient died of sepsis during the trial when they wiped out her immune system before reinserting the TILs. I recall reading her daughters posts on another site, keeping us informed and being devastated to hear that news. However, I also recall her daughter saying that her mom was in pretty bad shape when she started the trial. Then there was a third breast cancer woman afterward that did fine in the trial but it just didn't work for her and she died about a year or so later. If they can pinpoint what worked so well for Judy and are able to replicate it, that would be amazing. It seems like it is still part science, part art.",

There are a few other options for those with one or only a few lesions. Glad you found this site. It is a wealth of information and support. As Sandibeach said, the liver can function uncompromised with only a small amount of healthy tissue - I was told at mets diagnosis that the liver only needs 10% to function. I at one point three years ago had a liver that was 70% mets and I had no idea - I had energy, was eating and running as usual and completely clueless. My liver markers, tumor markers and alkaline phosphatase were still within normal range although they may have climbed by a few points. Since then, my tumor load has been reduced and my liver has regenerated a great deal of healthy tissue. I am amazed at the capabilities of our bodies to bounce back from adversity! I have had extensive liver and bone mets from day one and have cycled through numerous treatments but have pretty much maintained my quality of life for the last 4.5 years. I still work full time at a demanding yet rewarding job. Few even know that I have mets at this point.

Seems odd the IR would push to do the originally planned Y90 and not take a week to reassess the additional lesions found, unless they are in such a different location or a different lobe that he couldn\u2019t truly reach them in one Y90. The chemo thing is a big issue in liver and colon cancer because those patients have few chemo options and one of the only options they do have - irinotecan - causes cumulative liver damage over time. The breast cancer chemos are not like that. However, maybe he is concerned about how the last Y90 went. I think your gut is right to not rush into something that you are uncertain about without more information. If there is any possible way those additional lesions can be \u201cbombed\u201d with Y90 you would want to know that. As for Halaven, I had a brief stint on it for 7 weeks while waiting for a trial to start and it was very tolerable. Minimal side effects. I did cold caps and had no hair loss at all. I recently started Navelbine and tamoxifen and it seems to be working - Navelbine on liver and tamoxifen or both on bones. Have you had Navelbine yet? I like it. No hair loss. Minimal side effects.

Most of the other standard options for someone with your profile are much more tolerable. For whatever it is worth, I would just say to keep in mind that liver mets can be tricky little buggers. The environment in the liver (with all the blood and nutrients pumping through) can help the cancer flourish, regenerate easily and sometimes quickly. If you remain NED on a tolerable systemic therapy for a long time, you could always try to drop the meds at that point. However, it is much easier if you stay ahead of the liver mets then try to play catch up. I have maintained my quality of life for the last two and a half years (raising newborn/now toddler, working full time and running) on three different systemic treatments: Aromasin/Faslodex/Ibrance, Xeloda and Aromasin/Afinitor. Good luck figuring out what is best for you.",

If you live 10 years or more, then I suspect you would look back and regret not doing this. I started a new job a week into chemo when I was early stage 10 years ago. I got the job offer a few days after diagnosis and assumed I needed to turn it down. Fortunately, I had a colleague who was a godsend and told me to go for it and take the job that was mine. It ended up working much better than I expected and gave me confidence that nothing can stop me and that I can do it. I am still at the company and cannot imagine how things would have played out if I didn't accept the job. I have been stage 4 for 2.5 years and am starting a new position at work right now - where I will be working at the same company but in a different division with an entirely different set of people and subject matter expertise that I need to learn. I didn't hesitate to accept this position and would have taken an outside job if a great offer would have come along. I do feel a bit nervous about having to take time off when I have to do IV chemo at some point in the future or for whatever other reason mets bring along. In my current position, I have worked so hard and proven myself for so many years, I wouldn't feel the slightest bit uneasy taking time off. One of my life mottos has been to never let fear guide my decisions. I definitely experience fear but just acknowledge it and trudge forward. My new position is a good opportunity for me and something I have wanted for many years. It all just kind of fell into place suddenly at the least expected time. I figure I will face the tough decisions down the road *if* and when they present themselves.",

My doctor doesn't seem to be concerned at all (although I can't help but worry and feel sad about the potential of burning through my 3-med combo of aromasin, faslodex and ibrance so quickly). He doesn't rely heavily on PETs/SUVs for breast cancer but focuses more on tumor growth. I have pushed him for PETs although he prefers CAT scan + bone scan. He is keeping me on current meds and will give me a CAT scan at 3 months with normal PET at 6 months. He said the increased SUV might be tumor flare from meds. My tumor markers, liver enzymes, alkaline phosphotase and calcium remain normal and stable since Feb or so. Good luck sorting this all out.",

I can't think of anyone offhand who went all the way to NED with widespread liver involvement but I suspect there are women on these boards who have done that. Sometimes there is residual scar tissue with extensive liver mets that will never fully disappear on the CT scans. I have found PET scans valuable because extensive mets typically go inactive more quickly than they shrink. Also, in my case, they have shown increased metabolic activity despite my tumors shrinking, which eventually led to a progression episode about six months later. It was nice to have a heads up to monitor more closely - I temporarily moved from 6-month scans to 3-month scans at that time. Mom and MJH, yes, some of us are just caretakers by nature and can never really fully escape that predisposition! However, we must try to put ourselves first here and there for sanity's sake! I am guilty of forgetting to do that (or just plain ignoring my own advice) . . . . Artist, your new home sounds fabulous!! Enjoy.",

Stef, it must feel demoralizing to get a biopsy that turns out to be unusable. So sorry to hear that! My MO is hesitant to do a liver biopsy until I try a treatment that doesn't work at the outset, despite my urging over the last few years. He did mention as part of his reasoning that it is hard to get a good sample. I don't know all the details but have heard promising information about the newer blood biopsies. ",

You do have some good chemo options as well as the newer immunotherapy options. Was Keytruda discussed, in addition to Opdivo? I had heard that Keytruda has been shown to be somewhat more effective in trials but am not sure if that applies to breast cancer. Zarovka, very interesting about your complementary therapy self-testing and the possibility of going to Japan for natural killer cell therapy. That is something I would definitely consider (the need to travel back to Japan, which I LOVE, would be enough to convince me). I have heard very positive things about NKC therapy. Like you, I keep a close watch on that tumor infiltrating lymphocytes trial. It gives me hope for a \"cure\" and I want to do it at some point. It is hard to know when to take the plunge on that one - it works better in someone with a strong immune system and not too beaten up by cancer and its treatments but, on the flip side, is very risky. I know of two women with breast cancer who have done it - one hasn't been on treatment for over a year an a half and appears \"cured\" for the time being or at least in a long-term, durable response state, while the other died (of sepsis) although she was in rough shape going into the trial. Have you heard of more breast cancer participants? Lita, sending you positive thoughts. I believe you had your MRI today. Bluebird, it is hard to know what is going on with liver pain and Xeloda but is worth investigating further. It could definitely be caused by liver overload, but could also be caused by dying mets . . .. or of course progression. My liver hurt from dying mets the entire time I was on Xeloda (and my mets were metabolically inactive on Xeloda for over a year during this time). Mom, I am keeping Dani in my thoughts as well! I had a liver biopsy a few days ago and the first results are trickling in -- ER+, PR+ and HER2 equivocal (2+). This has always been the case for me, except that when I was first diagnosed with mets, the supraclavian lymph node biopsy came back as PR-. Although it doesn't change my treatment plan, I felt \"relieved\" I am PR+, since it is supposed to be a favorable prognostic indicator. I have so many unfavorable prognostic indicators, this is throwing me a nice bone. My MO always said it was possible the sample size of the lymph node biopsy was just not great and that I probably was still PR+. On the HER2 equivocal issue, I am going to push hard on HER2 treatments. It seems that more research and work has been done in the area of treating HER2 equivocal with the HER2 meds, which has resulted in positive outcomes. Still waiting for the genetic test to come back (from Caris). My MO is using the genetic test to qualify me for an FGFR1 basket trial that he wants me to do after 3 or so months of Abraxane.",

I would like to hear about any research of those two options head to head. In the MONARCH trial, the patient make-up of the two test arns were very different - with the Abemaciclib only arm being more heavily pretreated - which makes comparison difficult. Z, the hyoodense lesion finding is very disturbing. How does this happen?! I hope this is a case of an overzealous IR who is seeing things that aren't there. I had some seemingly latent findings in my recent PETS. My bone mets started off in dire shape at diagnosis - to the point where I was diagnosed with Stage 4 initially due to the discovery of uncontrollable hypercalcemia and I could barely walk. For over 2.5 years, ever since I began treatment, my bone mets have been NEAD. My PET 6 months ago mentioned the continued presence of a stable wedge fracture in my L4 vertebrae. Odd, I was never aware of any fractures in my back. I run with no back pain, carry around a very heavy shoulder bag all day and carry my heavy toddler around and believe I would have noticed a spinal fracture. To add another layer, my PET 3 months ago mentioned the continued presence of two stable wedge fractures in my L1 and L4. I would not be surprised if I had fractures when I was diagnosed but why are they first being mentioned years later? Shetland, I am glad your MO is now on board with Neratinib. I have been reading a lot about its potential success with HER- patients who have HER mutations. It sounds very promising, particularly when combined with certain PIK inhibitors, like temsirolimus. I follow this area with a close eye as I have been trying (so far unsuccessfully) to get myself qualified for various HER treatments due to my HER equivocal status on IHC. LA, keeping fingers crossed for very, very good PET results!! I ended up postponing mine for a few weeks. I now get it Sat 11/18. Mom, glad Dani's Y90 went smoothly. She is a trooper with all she is dealing g with now. I read an article about 1 documented case of the \u201cabscopal effect\" with Y90. A man with some type of liver lesions had Y90 in one lobe and the other lobe subsequently cleared up of cancer in its own.",

I still have one very large liver met in the right, a somewhat large met in the left lobe and many other smaller ones but the small ones appear to be inactive. After my scan, I inquired with the interventional radiologist about doing Y90. He did my biopsy and came recommended from my MO for Y90. The IR told my DH that he wouldn't recommend Y90 for me because there was a high risk of liver failure because I have had multiple chemos over the years. He said he would only use it as a salvage therapy. I was a bit shocked as that doesn't line up with what I have been reading and hearing about Y90. My liver enzymes, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and everything else are in normal range and have consistently been that way. I have never had a problem with liver function or my liver panel levels since mets diagnosis. I am sure there is some risk of liver failure but I didn't think it was a likely outcome. I am going to get a second opinion. Grannax, Mom and others who have done or investigated Y90, were you told anything about liver failure being a large risk? Mom, I know Dani has had various chemos - was this identified as a problem/risk factor? I am feeling pretty upset about this. I would like to do Y90 while my bones are still stable. Robin, I recall having to take copper with iron as iron doesn't absorb well without it. It was required by my doctor when I took iron. Do you take copper? Z, I am glad the biopsy seemed to go through this time. I will make sure to follow some of your tips if/when I have my biopsy re-do following the prior botched one. The plan was for me to get the Caris test but like you, they didn't leave enough sample to do that, so it is good to know the specific number of cores Caris needs. Your recommendation about bringing your own food to eat after the biopsy is a good one! I completely forgot about that until you mentioned it. I was forced to eat a stale hospital turkey sandwich before they would let me leave the hospital. Thanks for the info/link on metronomic therapy. Dr. Chue sounds like he is very innovative and thinks outside box. Artist, it seems like so many of us have trouble getting meds from the specialty pharmacies. I recall spending a lot of time on the phone with the specialty pharmacy, doctor's office and insurance company to push them to get their acts in gear. I would be the persistent, firm yet friendly and likely annoying person who would call at least once a day to all three of them. We shouldn't need to resort to that. It takes too much time and energy. I hope you get the Xeloda soon. Babs, thinking about you.

My MO wanted me to take an aromatase inhibitor + something to block the estrogen cells (Faslodex) because the aromatase inhibitor wouldn't do anything to reduce the currently very high circulating estrogen in my body, but would only prevent future estrogen production. He chose Aromasin instead of Femara because I believe there was a study using Aromasin/Faslodex, combined although he would have been fine with me taking Femara instead. For first line hormone therapy, I don't think it makes much difference which AI one takes.",

I am going to stay with it for now, particularly since I may be getting a power punch of Y90 to my liver soon. He did say that we should start thinking about next treatment and he mentioned the NCI FGFR1 trial, which now has a study location a few hours from me. I asked about the trial's performance and he said that results have not been produced yet but that the trial was increasing participants by a sizable number and that the drug company wouldn't pay for that unless they thought it would lead to FDA approval. I also talked to my MO about potentially having another liver biopsy in order to do a Caris genomic panel. I am not sure when I will do it but in the meantime, I had a Guardant 360 liquid biopsy done today. I recall Shetland mentioning that she did a liquid biopsy a while back. Has anyone else had one and did it produce any actionable results? Woody, I mentioned the CISH test for HER2 and your experience to my MO. He told me that if we do a Caris test, he can specifically order the CISH so that it would not be in Caris' discretion whether to include it. Babs, glad to hear Y90 went well!! I hope the recovery is mild and it gives those liver mets a nice beatdown. Z, you have been through a storm with all going on. You are a trooper. I hope the difference in your body's response this time in Japan means your immune system is revving up to do its job. I hope you can continue with Herceptin/Perjeta when you return. I am a firm believer it helps a wider set of patients and its use should be expanded. Did you have some sort of HER family mutation in your F1 report a while back (not HER2 but HER3 or 4 or something else)? I, too, crave grapefruit. My poor liver could use the help and I love the taste. Alas, all my mets treatment lines have involved at least one med for which grapefruit is contraindicated (Ibrance, Xeloda, Afinitor and Abraxane). For many, many years, I would eat a grapefruit a day for breakfast. I actually find myself looking at the grapefruit in the grocery store longingly . . . Mzr, yours is an encouraging story about abemaciclib! Great news about your liver mets disappearing. What type of drug was the third drug you couldn't handle?",

Princess, I am incensed you have been waiting 4 weeks for Afinitor. I am a stalker from day 1 when I get a new drug pending insurance approval - call MO's nurse, insurance company and the specialty pharmacy every day until I get the drug. Friendly yet persistent and just annoying enough to give them a kick in the pants. It is not right that we should have to do that at all, we have enough on our plates with diagnosis and treatments, but it is the reality of our situation. I recommend starting calls to all involved parties (and yes, each one will put the blame on another for the hold up). I hope you get your Afinitor soon! Z, very interesting about Doxil and immunogenic response. I had not heard specifically about that aspect but have been on a mind-body connection kick after my mother keeps sending me materials on it and have been visualizing that it is doing nearly just what you described - and that the combo of Doxil and Y90 will create the perfect storm of an immune response. I can dream, can't I!? I had previously read that Doxil modifies the DNA so that the cancer cells cannot repair themselves and that there has been some success getting it to access some cancer stem cells. I also read something essentially saying that if the researchers could figure out a way to successfully get it to everywhere in the tumors they need it to be (to all cancer stem cells), they believe it would \"cure\" breast cancer and the cancer cells would not become resistant to the drug. It is just the delivery system which is still not foolproof. Improving with the liposomal/nanomedicine formulation over first generation doxorubicin but still has a ways to go. Doxil seems to be not that widely known about yet in the patient population, still getting its name out there. I think when most people see \"Doxil\", they assume it is the name brand drug of standard doxorubicin/adriamycin/red devil. That is what I thought at first. And anyone who has had the red devil wouldn't readily sign up for the same drug or any sister drug without the background knowledge of the science beyond Doxil - and how the drug maker managed to eliminate nearly all the terrible side effects and get this drug only in the cancer cells. From the doctor's standpoint, there is still the cardotoxicity unknown. Studies have shown it does not have the same cardiotoxicity of red devil but since Doxil is still relatively new, the MO's don't have super long-term data on that and remain cautious.",

I am heavily pretreated, with a liver full of mets - more than 30 small mets on my end - and everyone's outlook seems positive. My MO suggested Doxil, Halaven, an FGFR1 trial or possibly Abemaciclib. I am doing Y90 in 2 weeks. My MO first said no to Y90 but then did more research and came around to support it 3-6 months later after educating himself and speaking to some others who have done it. Don't expect any MO, even a top MO, to know the latest on Y90 use in BC. They don't. It is too cutting edge. The interventional radiologist at my hospital also said no as well because he said I have done too many chemos and my liver is compromised (despite having normal liver enzymes and bilirubin). He does Y90 but is also not up to speed on its cutting edge use in BC. IRs know Y90 from colon or liver cancer. Those diseases have many less chemo options and the few they have beat up the liver. Thus, the analysis for those cancers is different and IRs try to analyze breast cancer through the colon/liver cancer lens which is inaccurate. I then found one of the best experts in the country and he said I am an ideal candidate. I have large tumors plus diffuse mets throughout my liver and he said treating my diffuse mets is not a problem at all. If I were you, I would get a new MO immediately. You don't need someone who has given up on you - when you (and your liver) are functioning very well and are no where near ready to give up on yourself. One wonders if your MO would have advised his/her own spouse to throw in the towel. Ridiculous. Our bodies only need 10% of our liver to function and the liver regenerates itself. In 2016, nearly my entire left lobe was BC mets - barely any liver tissue - and the right lobe was over 50% BC. Despite that, my liver enzymes, bilirubin and everything else were in normal range, I was working full time, raising a 1 year old and running 4 miles 3 times per week and felt fine. Since then, my left lobe has completely regenerated and only has a 1.3cm lesion and some small lesions and is predominantly liver tissue again.",

I am in the same boat (self-insured company who handles certain appeals directly) and have been through several of those mortifying experiences with the head of Benefits making the decision and discussing it with me. It is wrong on so many levels - I have complained and tried to get it cut off at the pass by requesting that the third party administrator (Caremark in my case) handle the appeal but was unsuccessful both times. I have also gone to the Chief Legal Officer first to try to get it cut off there with no success. At the end of the day, it depends on what the agreement between your company and BCBS says about who handles appeals. Companies often want the final say and will handle third and fourth level appeals, for example. I actually negotiated that contract with the third party administrator for my company and was one of two primary attorneys who supported for the head of Benefits, which made it all the more mortifying and riddled with conflict. In one of the instances, my boss ended up giving me a bonus to cover the medication. In the other, I ended up getting the med approved (which would have been way too expensive to cover via a bonus). However, it should not need to go down like that and I was mortified I had to discuss it with him as well. Mind you, I am still \"in the closet\" at work with Stage 4 dx so having to discuss this with anyone was sheer torture.",

When I have liver symptoms from progression, I feel a bit more pressure in when I lean forward or slouch, like things are a little bit more cramped in the liver area in front. Also, when I take a deep breathe, I can feel a slight tightness on the right side of my back behind or above the liver, like the muscles need a good stretch and the deep breathe is helping with that. Sometimes I have some pain but I typically have more pain when the treatment is working. My liver will get very, very loaded with tumors with little symptoms. Since diagnosis, I have had some minor numbness in the skin on my back, near my spine on the liver side. It took me a few years to realize all of my ongoing symptoms were not from bone mets in my vertebrae and ribs in the front and back of my liver but were from liver mets. When I have initially diagnosed, I had tenderness, sensitive to the touch and pain up and down the top 2/3rds of my spine on the right side, about an inch over from my spine. I assumed it was from bone mets but never understood why I had such a distinct pain on the right side and none on the left when the rib and vertebrae mets were pretty evenly spread between the two sides. In hindsight, I realize it was my liver pressing on a nerve, likely the same nerve that is causing the numbness. There is a nerve back there which is commonly pressed upon by a liver enlarged by tumors.",

I had excruciating cramps like you describe in my sleep when I had hypercalcemia from advanced bone mets. In the process, I learned that calcium is an electrolyte which becomes dangerous when it is low or high and that there are many other elements in our bodies that are considered to be electrolytes beyond the few with which I was familiar. Something could be off from your medications. You may also want to try sublingual Vitamin B complex drops. Celebrate, I also have a strong stomach and find that in the rare instance I have nausea, ginger candies work better than prescription anti-nausea meds. I ask for ginger candies when I get my infusions at my cancer center and take a handful home. I also sometimes buy candied ginger squares from Whole Foods which are very strong but effective. I don't like the taste of ginger but now that I find it so helpful, the taste no longer bothers me. Lillymillie, congrats that X is working for you. Did your liver change shape due to the tumors shrinking or is it caused by something else? Your X dose is high! It is rare to hear doses above 3000mg per day. I had my second Y90 on Tuesday and am praying that it will work. Feeling on edge lately unable to make sense of what is going on with my labs and everything else.",

Make sure you see an IR who focuses on oncology and has done breast cancer Y90. I was told no by an uniformed IR generalist who does some Y90 on colon cancer and liver but not breast. He told me I was too heavily pretreated and would go into liver failure - a risk for colon and liver cancer but not breast due to differences in chemos available for each. I subsequently found a top oncology IR with extensive breast Y90 experience who told me I was a perfect candidate and met all three of the important criteria. Also, I remained on Doxil when I had Y90. No need for a long treatment break. Nouzay, as someone who is repeatedly dealing with liver progression only, like you, I do think getting your liver in check could permit you to stay on a good combo that is helping your bone mets and gives good QOL. I am hoping I can stay on Doxil long-term following my Y90 for the same reason. Doxil is very tolerable. I would recommend moving quickly on the Y90 for that reason. Also, because you only have 4 liver mets, you may be a candidate for SBRT, which is limited to those with only a few mets. Have you looked into it previously? SBRT has been linked to an abscopal effect - where mets in other parts of the body spontaneously healed after the local therapy.",

I have a painful liver and can feel the location of my main tumors every time I start a new med. I do feel pressure when it is growing as well. However, it feels a bit different. More of a non-specific general pressure in liver. Also, I recently read that the liver can expand up to 40% in size and shrink again during the day. That may play a part as well. You definitely have an unusually large tumor, although I am not convinced that is a bad thing. My tumors never get that big because they spread before they have a chance to grow that large. Very diffuse and then my innumerable tumors eventually conglomerate into one large blob. The fact that your tumor is staying put and is not breaking off and spreading too much into a million different mutated versions of itself could be a good thing and easier to treat. I have a 3-year old son, about to turn 4. I was diagnosed with stage 4 while pregnant with him at 38. It makes me sick to think he will in all likelihood grow up without a mother. I haven't told him yet - although he has noticed some things over the few years. Your son must have been little when you were stage 3 (5 years old?). Do you think he remembers a lot about it or just bits and pieces? Pboi, welcome as well. Liver tumors take a while to shrink. They typically become inactive first and the shrinking follows. 2cm since the beginning of September is a great amount of shrinkage - it is just challenging for you because you are starting with such a large tumor so the progress will seem slower. Shrinking mets is a great thing, regardless of whether it is happening at a snail's pace or rapidly. Stable with no shrinkage is great too. Statistically, it is not thought to matter in overall survival whether someone is stable or actually \"NED\".",

I was told the Lupron or Zoladex would take some time to kick in, like 3-4 weeks, and I was in a very grave position at the time and couldn't afford any delay in treatment. I would have had to do chemo for that time until the Lupron or Zoladex kicked in. It isn't a problem to start it at the same time as Arimidex, it just may mean the Arimidex may take some time to ramp up to full effectiveness. In addition, my MO was trying to lower my estrogen levels quickly and was worried about high circulating estrogen levels as aromatase inhibitors stop the body from producing more estrogen but don't do anything to reduce the currently circulating estrogen. Based on that, I was prescribed both an aromatase inhibitor (Aromasin) and Faslodex, which modulates the estrogen receptors and would help with the circulating estrogen. However, I was in a unique situation being pregnant with off the charts estrogen levels at the time. You may have already posted on this - why did your doctors decide to move you off chemo? Was it always the plan that you would do a limited course of chemo to control the liver mets and then move over to hormone therapy?",

Tumor this time was 1cm (which is on the small side for me). Left lobe may be easier because there is a lot less ribs covering it versus the right. Easier access. The IR didn't seem to have a problem. He took 4 samples, I believe, based on my counting - I heard 5 clicks - I think 4 were biopsy sample pulls and the 5th was an injection of the foam to block post biopsy bleeding. The body eventually absorbs the foam. I did develop is slight temperature for 1.5 days after biopsy (which IR believes is a reaction to the foam). Now, if my immune system attacking that foam could just notice the cancer cells right next to it! I didn't receive contrast with the CT either biopsy. Shetland, 1.5 years on Xeloda - amazing.

Candy, it is usually the radiology residents who write up the radiology results and then they are reviewed and signed by the attending radiologist. I see major variances in the level of description in my results and variances on what they mention. It took me a few years to find out I have had 2 stable wedge spinal fractures likely since diagnosis. No one else bothered to mention them until one PET scan did - and talked about them as continuing to be stable, as if this was not a new finding and nothing of concern. I always have notes about follow-up in my PET scans and I don't think the radiologist is always specifically considering what type of follow-up.

I do like the idea that trials are approaching cancer in different ways, given that the ways it has been addressed to date haven't cut it at the end of the day. I hope you do really well in this one and will look forward to hearing more details. My current MO does think outside the box. I do appreciate it as my last MO was straight line, no veering off course. If don't do testosterone now, I will do it later . . . and maybe try to coordinate some exercise goals/personal bests at the same time if I am going to be \"juiced\" up anyway :) Abeautifulsunset, I am sorry to hear about your current struggles. I recommend you pursuing the Y90 route first (not wait for something else to fail) and pushing the IR's office to move as quickly as possible. IRs prefer candidates who are generally in good health with decent liver markers (I recall hearing below 5 x upper limit of normal or something like that) and stable disease elsewhere. These are not hard-fast rules though. The liver needs some remaining strength to clean up all the dying mets and heal from the Y90, particularly if you have a heavy tumor burden in the right lobe, given that lobe's large size. The left lobe is so small, relatively, it doesn't require the same recovery, in my experience, even if you have a heavy tumor burden in that lobe. It takes a bit of time to get everything set up with registration, IR appointment, mapping procedure, etc. You may need a washout period of a few weeks as well. I think it took me 4 weeks to get to my 1st Y90 with me pushing everything to move quickly. Most people wait 4 weeks between Y90s for each lobe. My IR made me wait 8 weeks given the large tumor burden in my right lobe, which was done first. I believe you will have a lot of success with Y90 to really get out in front of those beastly liver mets that are always so many steps ahead of us.",

Doxil's 28-day schedule made me nervous at first because it is so long between treatments but after learning about the fact that it goes undetected in the body and circulates much longer than other chemos (for a week or two rather than a day or two), my fears were eased. No hair loss. After the first infusion, I ditched the premeds and the Doxil itself is a 1 hour infusion. I did it for 9 months without a port. For the first infusion, the nurse will slow it down to 1.5 hours to make sure you are not allergic. It is a pale reddish-pink color liquid. Food or no food - either way with Doxil. The only consistent challenge most seem to experience is painful rashes and hand-foot issues, often involving blisters, around cycles 2 and 3, which then subside for the most part. I wish someone would have told me the following, which I read in the Doxil patient instructions from the drug manufacturer online months after I started the drug: Starting the day before infusion and for the 5-6 days after, avoid all friction and heat on your body to the extent possible. I suffered majorly from not knowing this. This is the timeframe when the skin issues will happen, although the symptoms will not show up until day 12 -17 or so. The only other place besides the tumors where Doxil is harder for the cells to clear out is in the skin - through skin damage, expanded blood vessels, and/or perspiration. Healthy cells in other parts of the body typically do not have problems clearing out the Doxil. The exact mechanism of action is not fully understood. During this time period, avoid opening sealed canned jars, hot water when washing dishes, hands, when taking showers or soaking feet during a pedicure, heating pads, super hot coffee, tea or soup, tight and even not tight but fitting clothing, leaving bandages on the skin for long periods of time, exercise that involves friction or sweat, being in hot places that make your core or feet sweat, and the like. I even had to buy different shoes to wear to work when I was on Doxil - wide shoes that had very large toe boxes. I also found that icing hands and feet at home and during infusion, even for very short periods of time, helped prevent the hand-foot issues and was the only thing that would bring relief the hand and foot discomfort. The hand-foot issues are different than Xeloda hand-foot - as if the problem comes from deep layers of the skin being burned from the inside out. I would describe it as fire feet and hands.",

I have difficult veins and nurses that have trouble with them tend to get nervous the next time they go to find a vein. Have you considered a port or PIC line? Infusions via the vein can be so traumatic. And the issue just gets worse over time. Doesn't sound like fun to have a port or PIC line but it is so much easier for infusions and could lessen your trauma. I had a PIC line or port for all Zometa and chemo infusions. Would put one back in in a flash if I had to go back to infusions. Another option would be switching to XGeva which is an injection rather than an infusion. Sending you peace for your chemo room visits in one way or another.",

Also, if the sample is too small, it may not show everything that is really going on. As for the issue of keeping hormone receptors after hormone treatment, I don't believe that hormone therapy necessarily eliminates those receptors. They tend to remain in the mix in the majority of cases, but the cancer has found another pathway or pathways and no longer needs to use the hormone receptor pathway. Sometimes people can become resensitized to hormone therapy after spending some time on chemo or, very occasionally, through use of estrogen therapy to treat the cancer. I went from highly PR+ to negative and ultra highly ER+ to moderate-high ER+ upon mets dx. I was HER2- from beginning (but with a borderline 2 score) and am still HER2- upon mets dx. My MO said that I could have lost my PR+ status or the sample may have been too small and didn't include PRs although they may still be in the cancer cells. I read that losing PR+ status signifies an aggressive shift in the cancer cells (which sometimes involves rerouting things through the HER2 pathway). Based on learning that, I chose to believe I was still PR+ for a long time but have resolved over time (and several progressions) that I probably am PR- because my BC is pretty damn aggressive. I don't have answers but wanted to say you are not alone in the confusion. I have heard that there are various trials testing whether HER2 treatments work for HER2- people, particularly those who are borderline/in the 2 score range, which are showing that there can be a benefit from HER2 drugs. I have been interested that theory for a long time now. I think there may be something published on this at the June ASCO conference. I hope you can find some answers.",

My MO hasn't mentioned the scan findings re the fractures and I forgot to ask him as I have had bigger fish to fry with him the last few appointments (lost liver biopsy sample and resulting lost opportunity to participate in a trial). I suspect the fractures were there from the beginning. I had the most pronounced pain at those two levels back then, although I had involvement up and down my spine. I don't know if a \u201cstable\" wedge fracture looks the same immediately after it happens (collapses) or if it changes as it heals and whether a wedge fracture could be \u201cstable\" right after it happens. It will never return to a normal rectangle shape on the collapsed side but Idon't know anymore than that. Kandy, I too want a dumb, lazy cancer!! Why did we have to get the superstars?!",

That is a ridiculous statement comparing you to people who have super high markers. It is definitely all relative. My tumor markers are accurate but rarely go out of normal range (CA15-3 and CA27-29). However, when they rise, it is an indicator of progression. And the small increases in no way match up with the exponential growth in my liver they represent, but they are directionally the same. Artist, so happy about your scan results! And that your MO gave you the attention and time you deserve. It is definitely good that everyone is learning which scans work for them and which don't. It is truly a personalized issue and can be a matter of trial and error. What works for one doesn't work for another and vice versa. My MO prefers CTS but it is only because of the insurance hassles with PET scans which are often denied. I have experimented with both PET/CT and CT and got burned when I did a CT in lieu of a PET. It hid the fact that my Ibrance combo was starting to fail and I ended up with a scary explosion in my liver 3 months later. For me, PETs show that the metabolic activity is ceasing before my lesions shrink and that the metabolic activity is increasing before my lesions grow. One step ahead of the actual size of what is going on. But we all have different cancer beasts we are trying to tame and some of the beasts are better at hiding on some scans as opposed to others. Z, when you went through your scans yourself, did you go back and check scans before those you reviewed from April or so to look for those hypoattenuating lesions? Very impressed your spent the time reviewing them yourself at the library!",

May be worth trying to get an appointment with him or one of his team members. It is his research that has permitted us to have the Y90 procedure. My two cents is that even if you wait for progression, or wait a few lines of treatment down, it is a good idea to consult with an IR now and get everything prepositioned - so you are initially \"cleared\" and under the care of an IR and know the process so you can move quickly when you decide to take the plunge and can avoid treatment delays and making decisions in a pressure cooker at the time of progression. Y90 takes some time to be appealed/approved by insurance and some time to schedule. I hope you are experiencing Xeloda flare and nothing more with your tumor markers. My tumor markers and liver enzymes flared during the first 3 - 4 months on X when it was working really well. Grannax, my Y90 is scheduled for Tuesday, April 10! Left lobe first.

I went from mini metastasis throughout my liver that were inactive, to my left lobe described as \"nearly entirely comprised of metastatic tissue\" and very large, innumerable tumors on my right lobe, in a 3-month time span between scans. I had 7cm tumors where there was no evidence of disease previously. Since then, I had my first 3-month scan after switching to Xeloda and my liver mets have substantially shrunk and are inactive again (no increased metabolic uptake on a PET scan). The good news about aggressive cancer is that it generally responds very well and very quickly to treatment, particularly chemo which targets fast growing cells. Quick tumor growth, quick tumor death. That has been my story since diagnosis. Hoping the new chemo regimen will get everything under control very soon. As for scans, I have had PET/CTs and CTs. I have found the PET/CTs to be more reliable for me on liver mets because they show where the tumors are inactive or active. I haven't had an MRI on my liver. With regard to biopsy, it is probably not necessary given that she has already been diagnosed with metastatic BC unless they are concerned that her cancer mutated into a different form (such as from ER/PR or HER2 positive to negative or vice versa). In that case, it is important to know to tailor the treatment accordingly. There are other reasons to get a biopsy but it is not always indicated. I haven't had my liver mets or bone mets biopsied and have had mets in both areas since mets diagnosis. There are targeted treatments for liver mets (radio frequency ablation, liver resection, radiation, etc.), which are usually only indicated if someone has a few lesions but not for more wide-spread liver involvement. I don't hear of radiation being commonly used on the liver, though.",

Stable bone mets on hormone therapy (a combo of Faslodex, Aromasin and Ibrance) with no progression or metabolic activity, but with severe liver progression. I was moved to Xeloda and was nervous it would not work on my bone mets and was afraid to leave the hormone therapy. However, it has worked very well shrinking my liver mets and keeping my bone mets perfectly stable/inactive and slightly improved. I actually found that Xeloda reduced some residual bone pain my inactive bone mets were still causing that hormone therapy could not do. Xeloda is a common, often recommended next step, particularly with liver progression. It is known to particularly be effective on liver mets. (In my humble opinion, I wouldn't view this as something to leave your doctor over unless you have other issues with the doctor.) I also asked for a liver biopsy but my oncologist (and husband who is a surgeon and has performed many liver biopsies) told me that given the risks of liver biopsies (internal bleeding) and difficulty getting a good sample, he would recommend only proceeding with a biopsy if the Xeloda didn't work. It is possible for mets to all be ER+, with some resistant to hormone therapy and some not. Think of it as having several routes to work. One may usually take the preferred route (ER receptors) but if that is shut down, one will take an alternative route. When the preferred route reopens, one moves back to the preferred route. Each cancer cell is its own beast. They find work-arounds. For some reason, liver mets tend to warp and change more often than bone mets. People will often alternate various cycles or years of hormone therapy with chemo and find themselves re-sensitized to hormone therapy after spending some time on chemo. Without proven data, doctors are hesitant to combine certain drugs because there is a lingering risk they may counteract each other and render both ineffective. There is one person on this board I know of taking Xeloda with hormone therapy but she is in Turkey. There was a small study I read that showed improved outcomes with both meds. However, it was a single study and was VERY small. I always keep it in the back of my mind that if my bones progress on Xeloda but my liver doesn't, I will request to try to add hormone therapy before moving on to the next treatment. Not sure if my doctor will go for it but he is pretty open minded and an expert in breast cancer - I find BC experts are more willing to try outside the box treatments because they are more comfortable than general oncologists with where they can test the limits and where they can't. My prior oncologist was not a breast specialist although he did a lot of breast cancer cases and he would never veer from \"standard of care\". My current oncologist is always doing things outside the box and I have been on the same page with his strategy.",

Although not likely, we are going to check if going back to the higher dose generates any response.l I thought I would feel better/more at ease as time went on with this dx but it is the opposite. In the beginning, there was hope I would be one of those exceptional, ultra long-term survivors. With my first progression, that was shattered but I was able to put back the pieces and regain some hope of a long, long run. Now, I feel like I am just another number and that as I approach the median overall survival, I question how much time I will really have. I feel so sick thinking about it. I think how attached my 2-yr old is to me and wonder if I can make it long enough so he remembers me. Anyway, just having a dark day. I am usually very positive about this situation. Despite knowing intellectually the stats and realities, I am unable to accept that I will die from this. Not an acceptable outcome. Shetland, much of you post rings true to me as well. Stefanie, I agree with the others, such a beautiful pic. Louis, your wife continues to be in my prayers. Thinking of the rest of the dynamic women and men on this thread as well. ",

I don't want to list everyone for fear that I will leave someone out! Thank you for being supportive and informative to my recent post about progression and fears. After bouncing around every potential treatment option under the sun, I finally met with my MO today and settled on Afinitor and Aromasin. He recommended the combo (as did 3 or 4 other MOs he consulted with) but left it up to me whether I wanted to do a chemo first. I was heavily leaning toward chemo for the last week until he mentioned there is a window to take A/A - it is not a good idea to take it when one's liver enzymes are soaring. My enzymes are normal now so I figured I don't want to lose out on a treatment because I tried to postpone taking it. The other thing that comforted me is that my cancer center is participating in the trial with the new M-TOR inhibitor that is thought to be more effective than Afinitor. A requirement of the trial is to take and fail Afinitor first. My MO said I could join that trial when Afinitor stops working. I start Afinitor on Monday, before I depart to Europe. Hoping this drug lasts more than a few months. Based on my observations, it seems to work for many people but not for that long in most cases. Wishing you all positive thoughts. ",

He said the insurance companies nearly always approve ultimately. I think he is actively involved in writing the appeals and providing the required two publications of the benefit in a peer reviewed journal data. If they deny, please request to see the appeal submission letter. It is almost completely based on what the letter says. I was denied Ibrance in early 2015 in a similar scenario - not FDA approved yet for my indication but there was good trial data in peer reviewed journals. I asked to see the letter and almost fell out of my chair. It said I was a Stage 2 BC patient and didn't include any necessary information. The social worker who wrote it was incompetent and didn't realize she needed to state I was Stage 4 (because hospital records still refer to most patients as their originally presenting stage) and didn't bother checking the specific indications for the drug to make sure to mention those. I have heard of others having a similar experience. I ended up writing the appeal myself after reading the law on when insurance co's are required to cover and it was approved. There are special protections for cancer treatments.",

It is a crap shoot of non-ideal choices - starve the cancer with no sugar/carbs or eat balanced diet and benefit from antioxidants and fruits and veggies, which may help slow or kill the cancer and boost immune system. I have taken the latter approach but have been so riddled with guilt about consuming sugar (mostly from fruits) lately that I am pretty freaked out about all of it. It is awful.",

The liver changes you describe could be caused by cancer in liver or somewhere in abdomen, treatments for cancer such as chemo or an unrelated issue such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, etc. It may be nothing to worry about but is worthy of further investigation. Some of the side effects - ascites, high blood pressure and/or kidney atrophy, could be caused by something being blocked - hepatic portal vein, gallbladder duct, bile duct, kidney blockage, etc. Can you get a second opinion or speak to the radiologist who actually performed the scan?

I met with my MO today and his plan is for me to move into an NCI MATCH trial for FGFR mutuations with a drug called Erdafinitib. I am happy about the plan, except feel very nervous about the whole waiting to be accepted into the trial. The NCI requires a new biopsy which I am trying to schedule for next week. They require the biopsy be sent to them to do the gene sequencing. With the holidays, the time to make it through the red tape could end up being even longer than usual. I wish they would permit patients to be treatment while waiting for registration to be approved. Some good news - I received a promotion at work and am taking on a meaningful leadership position! I learned today that it will be announced on Monday in the office. Nice to focus on something positive. Much more fun than focusing on the recent PET scan with the two new lesions.",

My MOs office initially said it would be in last Tuesday and then changed it to this Tuesday. They haven't mentioned anything yet and the report is dated as of last Friday. Not too different than my Foundation One report on my supraclavical lymph node from mets diagnosis biopsy in 2014 on the key items in the report. No new \"smoking guns\" that will make me eligible for a super promising treatment although there are many trials on various alterations noted in the report. Also, my FGFR1 amplification was confirmed which makes me eligible for the NCI MATCH trial my MO was considering for me. The biggest change is the addition of the ESRI mutation representing resistance to hormone therapy. Not surprising at all as it usually comes on during the development of AI resistance while on an AI. One alteration dropped off since last time but it wasn't an actionable alteration anyway (no treatments or clinical trials targeting it) - MYST3. Last time, my MO only gave me select pages of the report with the alterations - 7 of them. I had 4 variants of unknown significance but they were not listed in the pages I was given. I now have 13 alterations and 5 variants of unknown significance. Some of these new alterations noted may not have been tested when my last Foundation One test was performed so it is hard to know exactly what changed, if anything, with all of these. F1 is constantly adding new tests to its gene sequencing panel. Here is the summary:  Biomarker Findings: (testing for likelihood that immunotherapies Keytruda and Nivolumab will work - in my case, the results say no)  Alterations:  Variants of Unknown Significance:",

However, most IRs want the other areas stable. I have extensive yet stable bone mets. I do know women who have had Y90 when other areas were not stable but that is more the exception. I would like to warn everyone based on my own experience - I had to fight for nearly a year to get Y90 - don't rely on what your MO says about Y90; don't even rely on what an IR says if that person is not an expert in oncology-focused interventional radiation and has performed Y90 on breast cancer patients. My MO first said no (quite sternly). He learned more about it and over 6 months or so he came around and by the end was a big supporter. My IR who does my biopsies and also performs Y90 in liver and colon mets told me I would go into liver failure and was not a candidate given that I was heavily pretreated. That did not align with the research I had read. Then I went to a highly recommended IR who trains others on performing Y90, who specializes in oncology and has done a lot of breast cancer. He told me I was an \"ideal candidate\" (his words) based on the criteria he looks at - presence of multiple liver mets not eligible for resection or treatment for oligometastatic local liver therapy (such as SBRT, radioablation or other treatments for those with only a few tumors), able to perform at least 50% of normal daily functions, liver enzymes/function not way out of whack (liver function tests can be elevated (maybe up to 3 or 4 or 5 times or so above normal?) but probably not super, super high) and stable mets in other areas of the body. This technology is so new in breast cancer that most doctors are not in the know. Y90 is different in colon mets and liver mets because those cancers have more limited chemo options and the primary chemo(s) cause permanent liver damage, which is why the first IR thought my pretreated history would be a problem. He was wrong. Breast cancer is different and fortunately, we have many more chemo options which do not cause permanent decreased liver function. Get yourself to an expert to get an accurate opinion about whether you are a candidate for Y90.",

Even in the US, the spheres need to come from Australia. Surgery in the US is coordinated around the shipment of those spheres. I believe there are two types but the SIR Spheres are from Australia only - patent issue, I believe. Michelle, glad you have a plan that you are happy with. I have done all the taxanes and find they are tolerable for a good while until the neuropathy creeps in. Kayla, about whether you are no longer ER/PR positive - it is possible that you are not ER/PR positive anymore or that some of your cells are not ER/PR positive while others are, due to the heterogenous nature of cancer cells. However, the majority of us do not actually turn triple negative. We remain ER/PR positive but resistant to hormone treatment. I think of it as if I am driving to work and I have a few route options, one being the ER/PR positive road. When I started my job, that was the go to route as it was the fastest and easiest. However, over time, the road became congested and took so long that I would not make it to work on time and I therefore started seeking out alternative roads and eventually taking a faster, more effective route or, better yet, a new super highway, much faster than all the previous routes, was built that was not previously in existence and I started taking that. The first route is still there, it just doesn't make sense for the cancer to take it as it has learned from experience that it is not a great or reliable way to try to travel to its end destination anymore and it now has better options. However, over time, the cancer could end up going back to that original route if the current route or its other options are no longer as effective for one reason or another or if it notices that the traffic on the original route has eased up over the years.",

Typically, the skin side effects may crop up around cycle 2 and then usually go away around cycle 3. Go easy on ANY friction on your hands and feet 1 day before - 5 to 6 days after infusion. Also watch for any friction on any areas of your skin during this time, especially in your trunk area - from fitting clothes or seams on clothes, etc. The littlest thing may cause rash or blisters in the first few cycles. I had some rashes a few weeks out of the first month or two and extreme feet blisters for a few weeks in month two but was fine after that. I loved no hair loss and a relatively short infusion every 4 weeks. I cut out the premeds after two or three infusions. Super convenient. I think part of the reason I had such bad feet blisters was that I did Y90 at the same time with little to no chemo break - I took no chemo break after my right lobe Y90 and a one week break after my left lobe. My liver was recovering from the right lobe Y90 and couldn't properly get the Doxil out of my body in month two. I had no issues after the left lobe Y90 though. I also didn't know about reducing friction during the window before and after treatment (until I read the Doxil patient instructions on the manufacturer's website) and did some heavy running/walking and had a pedicure right after my infusion. Best if I had waited a week for those items but I didn't know at the time. Also, toward the end, I had some issues with low hemoglobin/anemia and required a blood transfusion but that didn't start until 6 or 7 months into treatment. Besides those items, I pretty much felt \"normal\" which was a nice change in metsland.",

It seems like all of the stats (most of which cut off at 5 years) make it appear that once someone hits the 5-year mark, it is all happily ever after. They grossly misportray the reality that the struggle continues for the lucky ones who make it that far. Have you had a genetic panel done (Foundation One, Caris, etc.?) If I have asked this before, I apologize. Perhaps you would have some options with some of the new targeted therapies, many of which are still at the trial level. Another thought - is recycling meds a potential option or doing some of the less popular treatments such as pure estrogen therapy to reverse hormone resistant breast cancer (which I read about in Bestbird's book)? I plan on trying that before I throw in the towel. If nothing else, I would enjoy a short ride with an estrogen surge - the feel good hormone. I hope you have the chance to do Y90. I did not have the perfect response I wanted but, nevertheless, feel that I am finally ahead of my liver mets and that it bought me a good chunk of time. Y90 doesn't prevent new tumors or treat tumors that are in hibernation mode when the Y90 is performed. It only treats active tumors that are highjacking the blood supply but does seem to work pretty darn well on the tumors it treats. I truly believe there is a survival benefit. Hoping the pipeline of options opens up for you.",

For some reason, many women with breast cancer are low in Vitamin D. My oncologist prescribes 1000mg to all his breast cancer patients (and 2000mg to me since my levels were low).

Jensgotthis, how did you move your bed time down from 11-12 to 9-930?

It brings me a great deal of anxiety and guilt. My supposed bedtime is 11 to awake at 7am but I rarely make it to bed at that time. I consider anything 12am or earlier a success for me personally and even that is rare. I need time to do a few things after my DH and son go to bed. Work plays a part too because I know I only have a few hours at night to get done whatever personal matters I need to get done until the next night after my son is asleep.",

My only child is 4 now and I haven't told him. I was pregnant with him when diagnosed. He definitely sees and notices \"things\" over the years but doesn't know. He is very sensitive in some ways - in touch with his and others emotions, empathetic and he may just understand too much, without having the context of life to put it in perspective. Things are black and white - good or bad, scary or not scary, etc. He asks me a lot of questions about death and wants to know what happens to people after they die, where Jesus is now and how God exists if he was never a person. Explaining that they are in heaven doesn't cut it with him. If he were less clued in, honestly, it might be easier. I am very good at \"spinning\" a positive, yet honest (but mostly positive) picture for my other friends and family but that won't work for him. Nothing gets by him. I did try to mention at one point when he was 3 that I may not be around forever and he told me that was an awful thing to say and really hurtful that I would ever leave and why would I say that to him. It totally backfired. I felt like the worst parent in the world. He thought I was telling him I may pick up and leave him some day on my own volition (especially if he didn't behave well). I couldn't properly steer the conversation back on track without jumping off the deep end which I wasn't ready to do and would have been too upsetting based on where our conversation ended up.",

      "Content": "Sep 13, 2018 08:05AM - edited Sep 13, 2018 08:12AM by JFL Drug prices are so expensive because the drug companies essentially go unchecked - the prices are high because they can charge whatever they want and get away with it. Their primary, if not only, driver is making money and they have a \"hoarding\" mentality to maximize profit. If you ever have a chance to listen in on a public drug company's earnings call (which anyone can join and the call-in info is publicly disclosed by the companies), you will get a taste of exactly what I mean. Earnings calls are often where material trial results are first disclosed due to securities laws. I have tuned in to hear research updates. It is true, marketing, R&D, patent, etc. are costly but not to justify the extent of the arbitrarily high prices of drugs that are big money-makers for the pharma companies. Essentially, the pharma companies engage in \"hoarding\" when they land a successful drug and suck as much money out of the drug as possible, during its limited time under patent, because they do not know where their next big meal will come from and because they have short-termism minded shareholders they need to report to every 3 months who expect the drug companies to beat earnings estimates and increase revenue and profit quarter after quarter. The drug companies figure out every way to maximize the revenue from a particular drug - higher prices (which is a free for all for the drug companies if they are dealing with cancer drugs and there are no viable competitor drugs), seeking additional indications so more people will take the drug (think Ibrance, where it began making hundreds of millions of dollars for the drug maker the first quarter it was FDA approved, given the cost was $15K per patient per month and it didn't have any competition at the time to drive down the price; the drug maker thereafter began looking to have it approved for as many other indications as possible, including early stage BC, to expand the scope of patients taking the drug and further expand the profits which were exceeding 1 billion per quarter in less than a year's time; this is no secret, I learned about the Ibrance strategy by reading earnings releases and listening to quarterly earnings calls), manipulation to drive patients away from generic drugs, competitor drugs and drugs about to come off patent/become generic, marketing via commercials so patients ask their doctor about drugs they would otherwise know nothing about, etc. I have looked into this from many different perspectives and the more I learn, the more disgusted I become. One of the worst examples is the makers of Provigil, who were successfully sued by a class action lawsuit in which many states' attorneys general joined in. When Provigil, the main moneymaker for the company, was set to go off patent, the company ran illegal interference to prevent other drug makers from making generic versions for several years. In the meantime, they intentionally hiked the already expensive price of Provigil (which was rarely covered by insurance due to its expensive price at the time), came out with a nextgen version, Nuvigil, that is not as effective but was intentionally priced cheaper, in an effort to move people off of Provigil and onto Nuvigil before Provigil went off patent and therefore avoid a mass exodus to generic Provigil. Their goal was to hook people on Nuvigil, negotiate to have Nuvigil as a preferred drug on insurance formulary lists while keeping Provigil off the formulary lists, so fewer people would move back to generic Provigil once available.",

The cancer was causing it. Despite that history, I did take 5 years of tamoxifen. I was put on baby aspirin as a preventative, which I still take. It is possible but not likely docs would put her back on tamoxifen. Since she had DVT on the drug, it is probably not worth the risk. I don't want to scare you but I had a friend survive breast cancer only to die of DVT that traveled from her leg to her lung. If Faslodex doesn't work, some people respond to one AI but not another so Aromasin or Femara are options. Ibrance was just approved to add to Femara (or more recently, it is now being added to Faslodex off label).",

I am not mentally ready to deal with this yet (still feeling some denial, shock, anger even though I was diagnosed at the end of 2014.) However, I don't want to miss the boat and want to sort things out before it is too late. I have been good about the travel and life experiences. Just haven't started sorting out the paperwork. I have ensured my beneficiaries on all my various assets/benefits/insurance policies are in order. And have a plan for my bank accounts when things go south - to transfer everything into joint accounts with DH. I want to do a will at some point but feel like my DH couldn't handle doing it with me on the one hand, but would feel hurt if I went out and did it on my own on the other hand. I have a tough time with unloading my physical belongings at this stage. I am in my 30s, in my first owned home, with a baby, creating a family life of my own and rituals. It is hard to consider getting rid of belongings during this \"growth\" phase of life. That begin said, I have moved around a lot over the years for school, work, etc. and have always lived in an apartment or condo, which means I haven't had the luxury of accumulating a lot of extra things. Oddly, I have been on a jewelry binge, going out and buying the jewelry now that I wanted in the future and planned to wait and save until I felt justified in the spending the money, since I may only have a few years left to enjoy it. Sometimes I feel weird about that - buying nice things that I may not own for too long - but at least I am living the way I want to live while I am here. Kandy, you hit the nail on the head in your experience in the medical field. I fear people waiting for me to die and feeling relieved afterwards. I think, to some extent, that is unavoidable even in the best of scenarios where our families truly love us and want us to live. It is hard to be a caretaker and to go through this with someone. However, I wish it weren't the case. This is part of the reason I share my mets dx with very few people and push to live a \"normal\" life while I still can. I don't want to be written off and have people stop investing in me now and I want to minimize the fatigue on my family if at all possible. Whereas some people want to live like they are dying tomorrow while they are here, I want to live like I am never going to die :) ",

If you have one family member or friend that can speak on your behalf and communicate with people about your updates (and ideally, communicate that you are going to be okay and are doing well right now), it can take a huge weight off your back. For those who do know, they see that I look healthy and am pretty active in life and take their cues from that. They assume I am fine now because I look fine and have been keeping up, for the most part. I am currently wearing a wig but no one knows. I put in effort to \"fake it\" because it helps me feel better emotionally to be treated like a normal person, talking about normal subjects, not just cancer. I think over the last 3.5 years, some people have forgotten I have Stage 4. I would never have thought that possible but do know a woman through work whom I met when she had just been diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer, with very, very swollen ascites belly - 9 month pregnant look. I saw her lose her hair and expected she would only have a year or two left. However, over time, I completely forgot about the her cancer.

Generally, being ER and PR positive is a good prognostic indicator. If the liver \"cysts\" are actually metastatic lesions, it is likely they will shrink from the hormone therapy, which would give you some potential answers on those. However, I would ask for a liver biopsy if the doctors insist they are only \"cysts\". As for your own breast lump, I would also insist on a biopsy if you haven't had one, especially since you are BRCA. You mentioned an ultrasound. Not sure if you have had anything beyond mammogram and ultrasound. I was diagnosed at 30 after many, many years of delayed diagnosis despite various symptoms throughout my late teens and twenties and doctors telling me a suspicious lump was nothing to worry about. Sadly, many doctors (even oncologists) will not take you seriously due to your age, even though you are BRCA positive. Better safe than sorry and I hope it is nothing.

No one really knows how any one person's experience will play, not even the medical community. Advanced bone mets can be so excruciatingly painful. Close coordination with a palliative doctor to manage the pain would be a good idea. At the end of the day, it is your decision but I was a few weeks away from dying of bone mets when I was diagnosed - suffering from uncontrollable hypercalcemia despite aggressive medical intervention to control it and heading toward a hypercalcemia coma - but had a miraculous turnaround over 4 years ago. I had mets in pretty much my entire skeletal system with swiss cheese bones. It took a good year for my bones to heal, slowly but surely. I went from barely being able to walk, unable to walk a step up or down, unable to stand up/sit down without putting all my weight on my arms and off my hips and in excruciating pain throughout my entire body 24/7, to completely healing. I didn't know at the time but also had 2 wedge fractures in my vertebrae. I was in misery. A year later, I was running three times a week. I didn't think I would ever be able to run again and was hoping just to be able to walk and put weight on my hips again so I could sit/stand without snapping my hip bones and sleep without extreme pain. There is hope. I still have the \"stable wedge fractures\" as those don't really return to normal state even after the cancel heals but they haven't caused me problems or given me any limitations with physical activity. I do everything I did before. I know that won't last forever but I have had a good run of nearly 4.5 years so far.",

I went into severe anaphylaxis when I tried Taxol, within minutes, and had to be given adrenalin. My throat closed up, my face swelled immensely and became bright red and I started vomiting uncontrollably. It was scary and I have kept an epi-pen with me since that day. However, I have taken Taxotere and Abraxane with no issues. For me, I was told that a very small % of people are allergic to the binding agent in Taxol called Cremaphor. Taxotere and Abraxane use different binding agents - Polysorbate 80 for Taxotere and Nanoparticle Albumin for Abraxane. Did your doctors tell you if they thought you were allergic to the Taxotere itself or could it be the binding agent or some other inactive ingredient? Taxol and Abraxane are the same ingredient from the Pacific Yew Tree, while Taxotere is a semisynthetic version. As for first line, if you can tolerate it, the taxane combo would usually be the recommended treatment. As for vinorelbine (Navelbine), I am on that now. I am not HER+ but heard it works very well in HER2+ cancer and is primarily used in HER2+ cancer treatment. However, it is usually given later in the treatment sequence. Good luck in making your decision. I hope that whatever you end up taking kicks the cancer's butt! ",

Are you taking XGeva or a bisphosphanate to strengthen your bones? It sounds like you are very low hormone positive now at 6%. Xeloda is a much more tolerable chemo - it is pill form/no IV, no hair loss and minimal side effects. If you decide to keep trudging along, you may want to inquire about Xeloda when it is time to move on to another treatment.",
