The radiologist came out and took an ultrasound and a biopsy of the tumor and lymph node on the spot. The biopsy came back positive last Thursday on the tumor and negative on the lymph node. She is triple negative with invasive ductal type with poor differentiated (3 of 3). We saw a breast surgeon Dr. Brown from Beaumont hospital here in Michigan. He basically said she has a good prognosis but will start her on chemo for 20 weeks and then do surgery. He said 90% chance the tumor will shrink and 60% chance it will completely go away. Then there is surgery and she is also going to do genetic testing to see if she has the breast cancer gene and that will determine surgery options. I am learning a lot as each day goes by. I guess our biggest worry is that the chemo does not work but hoping that it will because it is supposed to be more effective on early stage and young women. I joined this site to connect and get as much possible information. Next week she is going to get an MRI, blood work for the gene testing, and meet with the medical oncologists and the radiation oncologist. Then there will be a team meeting and treatment starts. Since the diagnosis she has been eating really well, no sugar etc, and we are going to do everything we can on our side to fight this.Â  Dx 6/20/2017, IDC, Left, 2cm, Stage IIA, Grade 3, ER-/PR-, HER2- Chemotherapy 7/18/2017 AC Log in to post a reply",
