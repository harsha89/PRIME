Went for second mammogram appointment yesterday and ended up having several mammograms and an ultrasound which lead to a biopsy today.   I was so shocked and terrified I didn't ask many questions. Luckily I get my results tomorrow afternoon but tonight is difficult. During the ultrasound, the doctor said the spot in my left breast is either pre-cancerous or cancerous. He never used the word benign and that scares me so much. Can anyone tell me what pre-cancerous really means?  Is there any chance for benign?  Also, any suggestions at all on questions I should ask when I get my results?  I am so grateful to have found this site and to see such great support. My thoughts and prayers are with you all!  I think I need a glass of wine.  Dx 3/21/2014, IDC, 1cm, Stage I, Grade 1, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 5/1/2014 Lumpectomy: Left; Lymph node removal: Left, Sentinel Log in to post a reply",

The information you provided is so helpful and helps me prepare for whatever the news will be. And deep breathes until then... And after. Thank you!!!",
