My thought was I don't want to do this later on, if it recurrs.  I would hate it if it recurs and I didn't do it. I know it is a personal decision. Good luck.",

I have had no nausea whatsoever.  Just heartburn the first round and I think I'm now starting chemo-menopause because I have hot flashes at night..  Yes, I'm losing my hair but it will be temporary. I guess I am on the side of do everything that you can to prevent any micro cells from spreading. A year ago I was watching my sister die of breast cancer when there were no effective treatment options for her even the very aggressive chemo she received.. The fact that you are young and an early stage is a bonus.  I can't comment on your feelings about your son because I don't have any kids.  It is a very personal decision and I know I am highly influenced by my sister's death. Good luck.",

I did get an oncologist to check it out and he said that an allergic reaction like a rash can happen with almost any medication.  Because Benedryl wasn't enough to control it, I was put on a steriod and it was gone in a couple of days. He's kept me on the same chemo for this round but has given me some steroids in case a rash develops.  Make sure you let them know what is going on. I have heard that Neulasta can give you joint pain, although I've been pretty lucky and haven't had any.",
