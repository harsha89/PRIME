I have had a problem swallowing too and didn't think too Â much about it as I have thyroid tissue in my neck due to ? Anyways, I finished my radiation treatment all most two years ago this coming November and still have periods when water and milk of all things keep coming up. What I mean is I swallow and it's like they go down a little way and then just head back up so I end up swallowing quite a few times to try and get the liquid down. Eventually it's stays down. Some foods do the same but not as badly as the liquid. I'm hoping this goes away eventually. Dee",
