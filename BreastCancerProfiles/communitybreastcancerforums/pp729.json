If you have a fax machine, get them to fax it to you.  If not, ask them can you come to pick it up if you feel uncertain about them actually mailing it to you.  The more you know, the more you will be able to help your wife and answer all your questions.  Good luck to you, I know it's worrisome but you are being a great advocate for your wife!!",

In addition, after the lumpectomy, there will be a second pathology report that you should ask for.  In both cases, they are looking at the cells from the samples and tissue that are taken.  The pathology report generally takes 3 to 5 business days after the procedure.  This website, as well as the NIH website, the Mayo Clinic website, and others have info on how to read the pathology report once you have it.  It's a wealth of information.  Enjoy the weekend and Father's Day -- I know Monday will be looming but you'll have all the information you need in about a week or so. ",

Having said that and with 2 years in hindsight, my mom does say that she wished she'd have had a double mastectomy.  Part of it was that she was just so afraid of the surgery and what they might find going into it that she did not.  Now, she sees her ONC every three months and has bloodwork then, as well as occasional scans.  But, she still has the concern that the BC would return in her other breast. Good luck to you and your mom.  If she goes with what her heart is telling her, she can't go wrong. ",

I am sure that if you call around to doctors in your insurance network, you will be able to find one who will respect your wishes not to have it.  It may take some effort on your part, so good luck with that. ",

That may include chemo, radiation, and/or post surgery medications. Meanwhile, one of the best resources that I found with the help of this forum is the NCCN guidelines at: www.nccn.org Click on NCCN Guidelines at the top and then select NCCN Guidelines for Treatment of Cancer by Site, then select Breast Cancer, then select NCCN Guidelines (it's a PDF file). You will have to set up a login name and password to be able to open the PDF file, and you will need your mom's pathology report to work your way through the slides to get to where her particular type of cancer is.  Good luck as you go through the process -- your mom is so lucky to have you to help her.  Mine is NED after a year, so she is doing well and I am hopeful that your mom will have the same outcome.",

FioreTD - I think I can feel the lump, but neither my OB-GYN or the breast surgeon could.  It may just be that I am feeling some of the denser breast tissue that I have or that I am mistaken about feeling it.  Your BS will have the results of the ultrasound in less than a day.  The BS can give you a copy of the report written by the radiologist who reads the US, and then you can do some research on this website and others.  Mine specifically said what it was and that a US-guided core biopsy was recommended along with a BIRADS 4 (suspicious) rating.  The BS that I saw was very through -- she showed me the US films, discussed the US report, did an evaluation, and then walked me through her recommendation for mammo first (since I have not had one in almost a year), and the plan for a biopsy.  I went in with a list of questions about the biopsy and she covered them all for me, then when I got into my car, I wrote notes so I would not forget things.  (Yes, I am a bit anal about things).  If you feel more comfortable bringing someone with you to the appointment, I would say by all means do so.  We do that with my mom's BS and oncologist visits -- someone always goes with her because she feels better having a second set of ears. Hope this helps you and I know the waiting is really hard.  Just remember, most masses are benign.  So I am sending out good wishes to you.  Keep us posted on how your appointment goes.",

I am awaiting to hear from the facility to schedule the biopsy, which she said will likely take place in 2 to 3 weeks.  Since she appears not to be rushed to get this done, I'll just have to be patient.",
