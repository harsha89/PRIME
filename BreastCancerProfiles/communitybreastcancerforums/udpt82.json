First, I know everyone is different but I am curious if anyone knows which reconstruction procedures (other than implants) tend to be most successful after radiation.  At this point, I am considering a lat flap. In the meantime, I have gone for a fitting for a prosthesis and hope to have it next week.  The person fitting me said I can use the regular form when swimming unless I swim often.  I rarely am at the pool, but will be in Hawaii for two weeks before my next surgery.  Do other people use the same form for all activities, daily, gym, beach/pool and then wash it?  I hate to spend money unnecessarily, but want to have the products I need. Also, I tried on a number of different bras and she is ordering some in my size to try.  Some didn't work, especially with puckering on the opposite breast (without nipple or projection).  I also prefer seamless bras, which seemed to limit my choices.  I have seen many different sites online, but am curious if people could recommend sites that are good to work with, especially returns if I am not happy with the fit.  I also would like to order a couple of bathing suits and am afraid that will especially difficult to order. Finally, the fitter has asked for prescriptions from the doctor for one prosthesis and four bras.  If I order online, can I send the bill to the insurance company for some reimbursement?  Would this also apply if I only buy a couple from this fitter and order more online (up to the 4 ordered by the surgeon)? Any advice people can give me would be appreciate.  I really like coming to this site and reading what people have to say from their own experience.   Thanks, Patti  Log in to post a reply",

I was diagnosed in Sept. 2008 (at the age of 48) with Stage III Invasive Lobular CA and had bilat mast, chemo and radiation.  Chemo did push me into menopause, but I was on Tamoxifen until my blood levels confirmed it last year.  I am now on Arimidex. At the recommendation of my MO's associate, I started Zometa (after chemo was completed) and had 3 infusions, one every 6 months.  Then, my MO said that was sufficient.  My only bone density study was done after Zometa and before Arimidex was normal, but that was almost 2 years ago. I am now wondering if I should have received more Zometa infusions to prevent bone mets.  I am curious how long and often women are getting Zometa.  Also, how often are women getting their bone density checked?  I know that the chemo and the Arimidex can do a job on the bones. Also, just for curiousity, what dates are people using for their anniversary?  I can't wait to say I am five years out.  (I was diagnosed on 9/16/08, then chemo, then BM on 2/9/10 and finally radiation). As time goes on, I have also read different things about follow up testing.  My MO does bloodwork but no scans for the breast cancer.  (I do have abdominal MRIs every 6 months because I was diagnosed with Lymphoma in April 2007 and it is a \"watch and wait\". )  I have seen that some women get PET/CT scans and other just bloodwork.  Any idea why this is so different or which is more common?
