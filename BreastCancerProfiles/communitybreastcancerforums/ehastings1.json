Just a few weeks ago I finally decided to have it looked at by my regular doctor, who sent me to have an ultrasound. The radiologist at the ultrasound confirmed that it was a solid mass (2cm x 1cm) and recommended a core needle biopsy, telling me that it was probably a fibroadenoma but they would do this biopsy to make sure. The biopsy was scheduled for 3 weeks later, but in that 3 weeks it seemed that the lump changed from just an oval to more of a peanut shell shape and I could feel two definite ridges running transverse across the mass that I don't remember feeling previously (maybe I'm just paranoid and was hyper-aware of what it felt like during that time?.). I mentioned my perceived changes at the biopsy appointment but they assured me it was unlikely that the mass had changed in 3 weeks and said that they didn't see any changes on the ultrasound. Long story short, I am waiting for the biopsy results now and am wondering, if it is a fibroadenoma, should I have it removed? All of the healthcare providers I have seen seem unalarmed, so I think if I want it removed, I will have to bring it up myself and push to have it done. Maybe they are reluctant to suggest it because I am 21, and people my age don't usually have them removed?... I will add that my mom died of stage IV breast cancer at age 48, so I don't want to mess around with this issue! Anyone out there have to bring up the topic of surgical removal yourself? I don't want to seem pushy and paranoid if it's really no big deal! Log in to post a reply",
