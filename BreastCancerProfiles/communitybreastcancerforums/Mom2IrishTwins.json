    "Content": "Mom2IrishTwins wrote: There is no history of breast cancer in my family, however cancer, there is a lot of and has been fatal. I'm 29 years old, have two kids ages 6 and 7, and home school both children. I went to the doctor recently due to the condition of my right nipple. He asked me to try a yeast infection cream on it, which wasn't successful. Now, I'm waiting on my appointment to see him again as he requested. He wanted to send me for either a mammogram or breast ultrasound, but just a couple days ago, I found a lump between my ribs where my breast bones starts. It's about the length of my thumb, a bit smaller. If I push on it, it radiates pain throughout my entire right side. From my breast and lung, right up my esophagus, through my throat, ear, gums, tongue and into my head. I've been trying to find information on cancers that cause Paget's that metastasis, but I'm not really sure what I'm looking for and don't want to end up with false information. When speaking with my doctor's receptionist today, she has extremely concerned and sounded very sorry for me, like I'm knocking on deaths door. So it has me worried. I'd love some opinions or personal stories, or information if you have any to offer. I'd be more than greatful! Thank you! Log in to post a reply",
