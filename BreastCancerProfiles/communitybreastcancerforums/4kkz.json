You see, I lost my own mom in '96, she was almost 48yrs.  My aunt died at 52 but had cancer at 38 for first time..went twelve yrs w/o it coming back. So, I'm 32 and had 3 children.. One died when two to a drowning.  My sister is 37 and has no children. she had the gene test done and tested + for mutation of the BRCA1 gene.  I got tested that day and still waiting another week. She has decided to wait a yr cos this yr is busy for her...various things...and then wants the double masectomy and ovaries removed. Mind you, she has PCOS and has been on birth control since age 18 and has had abnormal paps and cysts. I know that if I 'm + as well, that I really just want another baby. Is that crazy of me?? I've been healthy, no abnormal paps...only been on birth control pills a few mos once. Had 3 kids, tried to breast feed. but.. ok..if the gene mutation is there all of those things are obsolete, right? nature/nurture means nothing...when battling genes. Anyway...sis sees 1st surgeon friday. should she get a 2nd opinion about removals? if so..whom to rec... ? were thinking of john hopkins or maybe just going to b'ham al... oh, we are in huntsville/alabama... our hosp is pretty high tech actually to those not educated about here. thanks for any response sar Peace, Sarah....\"Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.\" Log in to post a reply",
