Not all docs treat in the same way though so it never hurts to get a second opinion. Wishing you much luck with your treatment--take care!",

I asked for them to do a mammo as well (since that's why my PCP referred me there in the first place). They refused until my PCP called them and told them she wanted the mammo done because there was a clearly palpable lump--which was seen immediately during the mammo. Very frustrating experience.",
