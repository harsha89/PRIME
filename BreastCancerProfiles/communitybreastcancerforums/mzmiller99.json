When you do hear from the surgeon, you'll be able to start on the rest of the journey, no matter where it leads.  So, do what you need to comfort yourself until you hear from them...chocolate, flowers, shop 'til you drop...whatever gets you through the night (and day). You'll find many friends here, as we have all discovered, so stay close and keep in touch. Susan",

Good luck.  I hope you get in soon so you can put your mind to ease.  Let us know how you make out. Susan",

We all have emotional ups and downs, and anxiety is always lurking close by, but who says you've failed any test?  Just getting this far through life means you ARE strong.  That is your A+ for the course and you don't have to prove yourself to anyone!  What does your onco say about the Wellbutrin?  Are there other meds that do work with Tamox?  I'm on Wellbutrin, too, and Effexor, and would be OK switching to something else, but not ever going off completely. (The world does not like me when I'm not on something!)  When is your appointment for the hormonal decision?  Soon, hopefully, so that you can get some answers to your fears.  I'd love to say that we are all strong, but I know I feel cranky, whiny, and cowardly most of the time.   And, don't beat on yourself for not feeling like working out like a maniac or for eating \"bad\" things - for goodness sake, one battle at a time!  If you're a stress eater, well, what can you expect when you're under this much stress?? Maybe just going for a head and heart clearing walk is what you need.  Not an intense workout.  Just some fresh air and solitude. Hopefully, other women will have some helpful words for you, but please know that your post touched my heart, and I'd do whatever I could to give you comfort and support.  Please feel my arms around you, sweetie.

Hmmm.  I sound like the mother I am.  Sorry to ramble.  It's so easy to remember the terror and helplessness in the beginning.  It gets better...really.  #10  I guess this is the one where I tell you to keep in touch with us.  We're here for each other, every miserable step of the way, with humor, compassion, caring, and support!

I had a sugery cancelled once - my fault.  I had been fasting since the previous night and it was nearly noon (running late in the OR!), so I took a piece of gum from my daughter.  Duh, I didn't realize that would cancel my surgery - I honestly did not see that on the list of don'ts. I totally lost it!  All of the prep for nothing, and one more day off work. Last summer, my partial mast. was hours late, due to another long surgery ahead of me, and I got all teary and upset, too, but I did finally get in. Good luck with your next attempt.  I'm sure you'll have no delays after this. Susan",

However, now that things are starting to progress, and I've had the surgery, and it looks like the radiation will start by the end of the month, I feel soooo much better. As we've all said, you are in the worst part of it now...the waiting. The fact that it is summer and ALL of the docs go on holiday is amazing! I was still a bit annoyed at my surgeon when I saw her yesterday for leaving me hanging for two weeks while she was at the shore! As much as we know they need vacations, it doesn't seem fair that they tell us we have cancer and then take off! Please give yourself permission to break down whenever you need to. You have every right! As for the drugs, I'm still trying out different ones. It would be so nice to sleep. You're in our thoughts, Susan",

I was pretty foggy from the hydrocodone and wouldn't have wanted to drive, anyway.  I did do my usual 45 min. walk the next morning, but my boob and underarm were not happy campers.  I did nap a bit for the next few days...not my usual routine, but from the assault on my body, stress, etc., I guess I needed it.   And the node incision was so much worse (due to the position) than the lumpectomy, that I propped my arm up on a pillow at night and tucked my soft tee shirt in my arm pit as much as I could during the day, so that it wouldn't rub against sports bra.  But, I didn't have a port put in, so I don't know about that part.
