I receive 3x weekly Herceptin (which followed 6 cycles of chemo.)and will probably do so for life but a tiny price to pay for still being here! I feel so blessed as , despite giving my previous job up due to terminal diagnosis, I have now have a new career. I've seen my daughter start menstruating., embrace her first bra and boyfriend, attain A levels and gain a place at uni .Plus I've seen my son achieve A levels, go through Uni and secure his first job. A message of hope. My liver was 70% tumour before chemo . With that and Herceptin the tumours are microscopic.I go to the gym x3 week , have no pain and live my life to the full. Zometa was stopped a year ago as no benefits noted after 3 years. Praise God for the sheer fact I am so well. keep strong :-)",
