The doctor a wanted her to go into immeadiate chemo and wanted her to be in a study group, the let months go by and realized she wtill wasnt getting any think of treatment, by this time my mom decided that she wasnt going to put her body through the torture, she has decided to just live with out treatment. She had very uncarrying doctors who never went out of their way to encourage my mom to continue on, no encouragement at all, she felt completely alone, never a clear answer. Well its been almost 2 years, other then still feeling pain in her arm from the surgery, she seems ok. Ideally i like to tell my self shes all better, but unless there was a divine intervention, she isnt ok.  She has been going through her things and giving them to specific people, she seems to be preparing for death. it of course breaks my heart but she is so adamant about doing things because she doesnt think she has alot of time, how can i know how much time i have with her? is there anyway she could be free of cancer without any of the treatments?
