Tumors popped up again.  They did a 2nd surgery but 6 weeks later new tumors appeared.  I was then put on Ixempra. Didn't work, then I had intra-arterial chemo directly to the liver with Carbo. That didn't work.  Then I had theraspheres.  Tiny beads of radiation  injected directly  to the liver like the chemo.  This seems to have stabilized the liver for now, but he put me on halavan and x-geva. I'm still on arimidex to block all the hormones that may still be secreted.  They took out my ovaries when I had my 1st liver resection to keep the estrogen at bay.  Marsha, if your ER/PR + I'd be concerned about taking estrogen.  I can't even eat Soy.   Debra, you might check into theraspheres or some other form of radiation.  I have a friend that had BC recurrence to the liver and it was 80% cancer and she had TomoTherapy radiation and she's been cancer free for 6 years now.  Hope this information helps.  Best of luck to you and everyone else!!!",
