I have full head hair coverage and it wasn't like I was going to wear my wig until it was completely grown in! So - for Easter Mass- no wig! Yeah!",

You will just know the day you are there and I doubt you will have any regrets. I don't. Some days if feels like a super sassy short cut, and some days it feels like it's just growing out after bald. But people adjust really quickly and I think are happy to see progress in our health improving-- or at least in moving away from chemotherapy. Woman at the food store leaning in and sort of whispered to me on Friday \"I've always watched to cut my hair that short-- how did you do it?\" -- I just bit my tongue and said just cut it!!!!  Sass up the earrings, turn up some collars and you'll be moving on!!",
