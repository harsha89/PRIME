    "Content": "wildflowerjoy wrote: Friday, I had a guided wire excision.... not really a lumpectomy because it was to clean up the margins of Atypical ductal hyperplasia. And take out another area that looked funny next to the first surgery. Saturday, I noticed I was itching a bit and thought it might be from the tape. I woke up this morning with everything on the side that had the procedure, my neck and my left arm covered in a very fine rash. It is getting larger and itches. I took one Benadryl and woke up from a short nap with it spread over more of the same area. It is not just where the tape was but up my neck to my chin and into my armpit and down my forearm. I took another Benadryl. Now, what? It itches a lot! Log in to post a reply",
