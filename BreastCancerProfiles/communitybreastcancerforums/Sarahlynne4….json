When I called for one I was told serveral times I needed to be referred, so I called my gyno back to ask for a referral and she insisted I gonsee a breast specialist first, given my family history (uncle also died of pancreatic cancer in his late 40s, and he was my mom's brother, which I have now found out pancreatic and breast cancer coincide). I'm calling breast specialist again Monday since no no one got back to me Friday. And will go from there regarding dermatologist",

I was told both times it was fungal and prescribed creams. The third time I called my doc and she finally said she wanted me to see a breast cancer specialist. Had that appointment and she assured me it wasn't ibc and also thinks it's a fungal problem, she prescribed me an oral antibiotic and a cream, rash started to get better but just started flaring up again! I've been noticing that it gets worse when I'm ovulating or menstrating, anyone else pay attention to that? Also my youngest is 2 but I stopped breast feeding over a year ago, however I still lactate and doc said I likely will the rest of my life. I'm calling my breast specialist Monday to let her know that the antibiotic and cream aren't working but also have a follow up and ultrasound scheduled in December. I will also keep everyone updated. Im 32 my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at 39 and passed away at 43",
