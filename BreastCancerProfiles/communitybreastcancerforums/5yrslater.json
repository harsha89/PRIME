    "Content": "5yrslater wrote: Hello everyone, I was just wondering if anyone had experienced weird feelings in their breast after lumpectomy chemo and radiation. I am almost 5 years out from all treatment. I have had so many different pains, soreness, tenderness, and stinging feelings in my breast these past years. At first I went to the doctor and would let him know, I even had my mammogram a month early one year because I was afraid the cancer had returned. But everything has been clear. Just recently I started having a more full feeling and a different kind of uncomfortableness. I'm trying to wait it out and see if it goes away like many of these other symptoms. It's just so very difficult. I'm trying to stay positive, but your mind wants to go to a dark place. Any input at all would be helpful. I'm not sure whether I should get in touch with my doctor again or not. I am not a hypochondriac and I don't want to be a baby about this. Just want to be safe. I am grateful for the Lord and when I pray to him he brings me peace. Log in to post a reply",
