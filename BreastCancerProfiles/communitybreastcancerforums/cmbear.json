Fortunately, for me too, the chemo melted it all away. What was the reasoning for your neo-therapy? There are several websites that will give you probabilities, but each person has SOOO many different variables that effect their future that it is really all a crapshoot. I have been told anywhere from 60 to 80 to 89% chance of survival. I worried about it for a long time and then I eventually gave up on that. All I can do is  what I can to prevent it from coming back, and not stress about it. ",

NOW, in hind site, I have found that blood draws are a pain in the you know what because all the veins in my non-affected arm are blown. Should I have kept it in for every six month exam, or MRI's with contrast? Maybe. Or maybe the nurses have to be a little more skilled to get blood from me. Btw, I have my port in a little specimen jar in a drawer. Kind of creepy, I know but it's my own personal reminder that I am moving on past this whole mess.",

We are vibrant, loving, beautiful, and loved women who happen to share an illness that will not take our souls. If we can get thru the physical aspects--with a little help from meds and great friends--and the mental aspects--with the support of all you lovely ladies-- we will all be stronger for it. And as for being a survivor. . . I'll personally claim it when I done with treatment and they tell me with no uncertainty that I am cancer free.

It helps to cut it real short before you start chemo so you don't see big clumps of hair fall out. Its not as painful when you hair is shorter --remember the first morning I found it on my pillowcase. Time to shave!! I had a port, it was never not considered between 2 rounds of chemo and all the blood draws. It does depend on how many chemo tx you will have. Glad I had it, of course even happier when it came out! I had nueropathy fairly bad in my feet, didn't lose my nails but they did look pretty awful for awhile. Amazing what a little nail polish will cover up! Tree tea oil helps. I had mouth issues, sores, lack of taste. Your MO can prescribe Magic Mouthwash to help with that. I worked all thru Taxol, only taking off the day of chemo. After that, I had 4X AC. The worst SE effect was the horrible joint pain. Hard to get in and out of a chair. I was working retail and on my feet all day. Totally wiped out at the end of the day.  My hair actually started to grow back then--wispy sad little things. I wore a wig to work because I just didn't want the hassle of talking about it. But at home, it was baseball hats and a scarf here and there. It's all what you are comfortable with. I live in Florida and darn if those wigs don't get itchy in the heat. My first haircut was a few months after chemo, just cause it was a little straggly. I'm now a 1 1/2 years out and I've lost track of how many times I've gotten it cut--and its past my shoulders. It does come back!!  My biggest surprise about chemo was the actual experience was not painful or awful at all. I brought a bag with all kinds of things to read, listen to, etc. I usually yakked the whole time with my MIL (my chemo partner) or slept. I slept ALOT!! They also give you all kinds of drugs to help you thru chemo.  Can't say it was enjoyable, but it wasn't as bad as I had feared.  Good luck with your TX. What kind of chemo will you be having? ",

That and my joints hurt.  I have been creaming it up, my doc suggested Natrabio's candula cream, but after listening to all you lovely ladies I may splurge on some miaderm. I am deathly afraid of burning since I am still very numb, don't think I would feel the start of a burn. Consequently, i find myself staring at my chest a lot to make sure it hasn't turned pink.

In fact the wound site is still numb. Is that normal? Slept one night in the recliner, last night on the pullout couch. Both had their advantages, but tonight will be on the couch again. The rough part was watching my DH empty my drains and then pull off my bandages. He kept reassuring me that this was temporary and it would all be better soon. Needless to say, he took it better than me. The look in his eyes is hard to take. I know he loves me dearly, but he is scared and doesn't want me to see that. I hate that he has to go thru this. But I am fortunate to have him.  Haven't gotten the path report back, but since the neo chemo shrunk the tumor so much, I am expecting nothing but positive news. And on the fun side, still waiting for the colace to kick in.. . .any time now!!  ",

None of my mammos showed my 8 cm ILC tumor. It's easy to get frustrated by the inaccuracies of the screening process. The good news is you had no node involvement, that is awesome!!! Cindy ME-good luck with chemo today. What are you scheduled for? I took everything but the kitchen sink when I first started chemo. Ended up only bringing my own pillow, blanket and my ereader, even though I hardly ever had time to read anything. Either I was too busy yakking with my chemo partner or sleeping. Do not be afraid of your anti-nausea meds, they will become your friends. You can do this!! BTW, I fell asleep on my side last night. WOO-HOO! But woke up at 4 and could not get comfortable. Ended up on the recliner. Someday I will get this sleep thing down! ",

My drain sites leaked for several days after they removed the drains, but 2 weeks out, I would call your BS. Yesterday, I removed my last steristrip. Now I feel truly naked. But it did take some of the discomfort away. I have heard mixed reports about the numbness. Some of it goes away but it stays numb around the surgery site. My numbness on my cancer side goes up my chest to my shoulder blade and under my arm. It feels like I have an elastic band around my armpit--by the end of the day it is quite painful. That is if \"numbness\" can be painful.   dmho--glad the drain issue was resolved. One down, two to go! Sending good  thoughts that your skin is healing, slowly, but healing!! Gentle Hugs!! ",

So far no leak. When it bends straight down or gets lose, it leaks. I am going in this a.m. to have doc look at it, two days earlier than my scheduled one week out appt. It probably means my drains might stay in longer, ickk, but at least I'll get  peace of mind that there is nothing wrong. What bothered me yesterday was when listening about Congressman Giffords brain drain, the medical reporter said that if a drain leaks out, that means that if something can get out, something can get in(bacteria). Definitely don't want that!! Vikki, I had Nuerontin for neuropathy in my feet and hands during Taxol treatment. I had 11 weeks of Taxol--suppose to have had 12. My doc was concerned about my neuropathy and thought the Taxol had done what it needed to do in the 11 treatments, so she ended it early. Itook the neurontin until the worst part of my neuropathy stopped. Doc didn't want me to be on the drug for extended time due to side effects. I never noticed any effects except chemo brain--which is hard to pin down the exact cause.Absolutely the WORST side effect I had of chemo.  And again to all the women going in this week, stay strong, and see you on the other side! ",

My boss is not the understanding type and pressuring me to come back before I feel ready and my family is ticked at me that I gave in to her. Advice please!!!! ",

What a roller coaster to be on, and I am sorry y'all have had to go this extra pain.  I haven't posted for awhile but I still read daily. Guess I have been feeling out of it,since my docs didn't want to do recon for awhile. I am feeling kind of down listening to all of you returning to being  closer to a \"normal\" look. I look at my concave chest, and there are days I feel deformed and wonder if I will ever accept this \"new\" me.  Phlllllattt!!  Pity party!! Started rads last week, and it is incredibly easy process although you have to leave your pride and modesty at the door. Just wondering why all my male docs and nurses have to be so good looking?? : ) Makes the day quite interesting!! Hope everyone has a fantastic week, do something fun just for yourself!! I am going this afternoon to get my first post chemo hair cut. It's not long but there are some stragglers that make me feel like a crazy woman. Yesterday I absent mindedly stepped out of the house w/o a hat or scarf and felt horribly self conscience. Not there yet. Soon I hope!! ",

It's probably more annoying than anything.

Finally got my gyn to refer me to SOMEBODY to look at it. I saw the BS, he looked at it and said yup, very suspicious. He did an US biopsy that morning. Didn't see a radiologist till I started chemo. I would skip the consult and find a doc that will do the biopsy, surgeon or rad doc. Seems like an extra step that is not totally needed. Unless you want to use it as second opinion.  Best of luck! ",

Decided on the BMX ( half fear of the unknown and half vanity of not being one sided) Totally selfish but what the heck. Bs surgeon is wary of IBC even Onc not concerned. Never did biopsy for that,  just the ilc, even though that is what he initially thought I had that.(red, orange peeled skin). So now I am a little freaked that he is tacking on another issue late in the game--just a little confused. He said pathology report after BMX will give us all the answers. And since I had such a good response to neo-advajunct chemo that I shouldn't be concerned. Easy for him to say.  I don't have a gym for the next few weeks, any one have any suggestions for at home exercises besides sit-ups? I know I am suppose to get up and move but with my last AC treatment four days ago and my Neulasta 3 days ago, I am still moving like a snail. I need some motivation!!! ",

What a wonderful feeling!! Sorry to hear you have to have the MX after the first surgery, that is not  right in so many ways. My surgery is the week before yours and I am plenty nervous too. Terri-I would be having a little hissy fit if I were you. I hope it all works out for you, I know having that family support there is a very essential part of recovery. Got my fingers crossed for you. And thanks for all the exercise advice, now that it is thawing outside, I may start my walking again. Living in Florida we do get spoiled for our warm weather!! ",

I kinda would like to think that it was worth something, and your case,it was the best of all worlds. Thanks for the positive thoughts, and I will try to keep up my attitude going into next week. Laurie and Gutsy--Glad to see you are handling recovery so well. Gutsy your loopy note made me laugh--it is all too real, isn't it?!!  Day by day, you are all an inspiration. BTW, a co-worker was just diagnosed this week with BC. I am heartbroken cuz she has been a true friend to me during the last many months. And she just had back surgery before the holidays. It's just not right, too many of us out there. ",

I have been going to work when my brain was only functioning at minimal capacity. I wanted to show that things hadn't changed and that I was still capable of doing everything that I could before. My life has changed and will be changed for the rest of my life. I don't want to wallow in it but sometimes I want to quit it all and run away. I'm tired of thinking about BC, worrying about it, talking about it. Like you, I am drained. I want time to have a rebirth, to start over and feel whole again.  Good luck today to GW, Min and Maria, just let go and yourself be taken care of.   ",

Guess I started my exercises too late.  Sue and Renee, great news!!! What a relief for you!! Now on to healing!!! Cindy, Cindala and Joan, I have that same pain in my back, guess its got to be related to the surgery. Will be great to know what causes it! I get the whole scar and not wanting to see it. I am having phantom pain, want to scratch whats not there. About half of my steri strips have come off(with a little help) but not ready to see the whole scar bare and naked. I guess I am in that stage of grief--denial. Sometimes I just want to cry and and fast forward a year. I want the moment when BC is not my main focus in life.  Hope this week brings healing and strength to all. ",
