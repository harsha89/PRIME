My rariation oncologist said he'd never seen pleurisy related to radiation before, and he's been in practice for some time. He did admit the relation was a possibility, though. Everyone in the radiation department that I have contact with, said they'd never seen it before, but they all believed my concern that it was a possibility and a nurse even said to me \"We learn so much from you (patients)\", I urged them to search \"radiation and pleurisy\" which was what I did to find this forum. Pain meds and rest have helped me feel much better, I only missed two treatments, but I am worried that it'll happen again.",
