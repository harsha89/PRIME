    "Content": "husband001 wrote: TCH Chemo- Hey Everyone- My wife (30) just started her first treatment of TCH last Thursday. She did not experience any side effects for the first 48 hours. After that her energy level went to almost nothing, she had some lower GI issues, and some minor nausea. Starting Monday night (72 hours after the first dose) she started to bounce back and by Wednesday she was back to 100%. My question is, is this normal what we can expect for the next 5 treatments? I'm trying to figure out if the side effects get worse the more she gets. Any help/wisdom would be greatly appreciated. Thanks again! Log in to post a reply",
