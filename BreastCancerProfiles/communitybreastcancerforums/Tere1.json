My only dilemma is that my MD has told me that due to my large breast, the pathologist cannot seem to find the cancer in the breast tissue that was removed during bilateral mastectomy on Dec 29th... I had mammo, MRI, ultrasound and another mammo prior to having mastectomy to be sure I was + prior to making decision to have mastectomy (already was + BRCA). I was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma with poorly differentiated cells. Has anyone else had this experience? I am now reluctant to have chemo (that I was told I would need due to the type of cancer). But where did the cancer go??? Should I still go through with the chemo? Confused!!!",

He has now ordered an Oncotype DX test before deciding on treatment plan. Does anyone know if triple negative with a positive BRCA necessarily mean that the Oncotype will also be positive? Thanks to all for listening and sharing",
