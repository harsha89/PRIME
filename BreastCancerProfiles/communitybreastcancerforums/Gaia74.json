Long story but the incisions opened at home and I had the implants removed 3 weeks after mastectomy. Ended up needing radiation, PS agreed we could see about trying again for recon after rads. I'm not interested and so ended up with nipple sparing skin sparing no recon. Everyone is surprised with the unintentional outcome, surgeon said she never would have thought it would have worked- it's all very tidy and flat. Nipples are a bit floppy and uncomfortable as they are the only things that rub on fabric, but all in all it looks \u201cgood.\u201d",

I had a BMX in Jan 18 with immediate reconstruction that failed- yes thats right, the incisions both came open at home in the woods while the implants bore down on the incisions. Needless to say, they came out. I'm flat now, with nipples as I had a nipple sparing surgery. And I also had significant trauma to the pecs, I would imagine, having the implants in and out a few times. I'm lucky in that I don't have significant pain on my chest, no burning hot sensations, just incredible tightness and increasing and very substantial shoulder pain that seems very widespread on my back. Of course this also runs straight up my neck and now induces multiple muscle spasms, finally making my head feel like I have meningitis and vertigo. I see a PT regularly as well as do myofascial release with a separate practioner. Despite stretching, strengthening, yoga, walking, skiing, massage, MFR and PT I cannot seem to break the pain or the tension. Ive got cording and webbing as well as lymphedema. I've got two young children and I am a mess. Its beyond difficult to manage the pain on my own, it requires all of my concentration and I have no energy left for joy or lightness. Nearly every morning after trying to sleep all night (Not successfully due to pain) I cry and cry. It feels like depression, but I get the sense if I could get out from under the pain syndrome/cycle I'd have relief. I do not know how to manage this snowballing crisis of pain and emotions, like you I'm frustrated and unsure of what might help. CBD topically does seem to have some effect, am thinking of trying to get some medical marijuana as CDB internally does nada. Have you tried acupuncture? ",
