My breast cancer is different from your mom\u2019s (I actually had TWO (overachiever! LOL)\u2014one is er+/pr+ and the other is her2+), but my other characteristics are similar. I\u2019m 44, with stage 2a IDC, no lymph nodes and larger tumor was 3.1 cm. I\u2019ve had a mastectomy (because my two tumors were in different quadrants) and will be starting TCH in a few weeks with 6 cycles (one every 3 weeks). The chemo was added to my plan when they realized my smaller tumor was Her2+. I was originally told only hormone therapy when they thought both were the same. I know two examples don\u2019t quite make a pattern, but it seems like our doctors have recommended similar treatment paths for our early stage breast cancers. I wish you the best in helping your mom decide what treatment makes the most sense for her! Terri",

I am a researcher by nature so have read, read, and re-read what to expect during treatment. It may be crazy but my strategy is \"expect the worst and be pleasantly surprised when it isn't that bad!\" It is scary, but I've always felt like I can do anything for a little while...and this is just my current reality. Prayers for all of us as we prepare! Terri ",
