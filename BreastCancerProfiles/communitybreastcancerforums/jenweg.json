Designermom - I hope you are still feeling little to no se's!! Brat352 - I understand the yuck feeling ugh.  Make sure you of course drink tons and just sleep as much as possible.  That is about the only thing that helped me! RS711 - Glad to hear the patch works well.  Hopefully my insurance will approve it.  Insurance companies are such a pain in the a**!  How do they decide what drug they will cover and what they won't, just crazy. akitalover - good luck with your first chemo.  That sucks that your husband will be away but good that you have people to check on you.  My first treatment was rough however many many people don't have any issues so I hope you dont' either.",
