I've had a PET scan which was negative. An infusaport has been inserted and I will start Chemotherapy this coming Wednesday. I am doing whatever my Doctors are telling me to do , at this point I'm not able to make clear decisions for myself. My daughter has been a great help to me and has been researching for me and seems to think the doctors are doing the right thing. I don't know if this is any help to you but at least knowing someone is hearing you may be of some comfort to you. This is the most difficult journey my life has ever begun, as I'm sure it is for you. Thanks for letting me vent and reading this. FRAN.",
