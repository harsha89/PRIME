I welcome anywisdom and encouragement you may have to share. Here's my story: I'm 38 yo and had my first mammo (3D) in Feb '17. My ob/gyn sent me because my breasts felt very dense upon examination. They called me back immediately after mammo and said I needed an U/S. The online patient portal reported the following- HD breast density, 13 mm faint oval nodule in left breast behind nipple, probable low-lying lymph node on left. Birads 0. I had the U/S the following week and the Dr informed me wasn't worried and I made a 6 month follow up appt. That appt is coming up in early Aug. I left the U/S appt feeling as though I'd been patted on the head and told to move along. Since Feb my left breast has started to have some new symptoms including: a sharp, quick stabbing pain in the exact same spot at random Both breasts have grown by 2 cups sizes Left breast has the dimpled/rippled skin along the bottom underside I'm have the sensation of \"let down\" as if I were nursing several times a day in both breasts. (No, I'm not pregnant. Had hysterectomy in Oct '16) This is the most odd and haunting symptom. Im terrible at self-examination. I don't know what I'm looking for and it all feels hard, bumpy and tender frankly which I assume is due to the high density tissue. I've been taught and read so much on it but the high density makes it difficult. I feel my own frustration mounting as I write this. I plan to call the Dr and see if I need to up my U/S appt but we have family vacations planned and I wouldn't been able to do it much earlier than early Aug anyhow. I appreciate any kind words at this point. Feeling a lot of feelings. Thanks in advance. Log in to post a reply",
