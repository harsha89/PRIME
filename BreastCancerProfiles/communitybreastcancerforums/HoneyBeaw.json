The waiting is horrible and I refused to wait. I pushed and pushed the Dr until they agreed to do the surgery sooner, I just could not wait as I had found the lump election days 2016 and when they didn't get clear margins first time around I was a basket case. I ended with mx on the left and have not done any reconstruction yet, not sure I will. .Why are they making you wait so long for surgery are you doing chemo first ? Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions Huggs my dear",

I also think as mention above that some just get so smug in their profession that they are not as careful or cautious as they should be and that causes lives . I had two Dr and a radiologist tell me that a inverted nipple and lump was simply a plugged milk duct, it wasn't until I threw a fit and demanded to see a surgeon did I finally get someone to listen, so Im not sure if that was all a mistake, neglect or just smug ass professionals not wanting to take the time to do what we depend on them to do .",

I have been making a stink about it which may in the end get me banned from our local county hospital but if it saves someone from going through what Ihave been through so be it . I know 2 other ladies that had breast cancer and were given clean results from the same local radiologist . I also tell everyone I know to get a 3-d, it may not be the complete answer but its better on dense breast then a regular one and like others I was never once told that I should be getting a 3-d and or a MRI based on how dense my breast were......I think Drs get to smug in there little worlds and don't really do all they can do for those that depend on them .",

I was a total bundle of nerves and so over come with anxiety and fear. The infusion went well. The Chemo team was very careful to explain everything to me and walked us through the process, and all SE and what to do . I was given steroids and anti nausea med in the IV before the actual chemo and continued to take Steroids for 3 days and anti nausea for 4 days. I did exactly as they instructed , drinking lots of water, using baking soda, salt mouth wash taking the Claritin for help in controlling the bone pain after the Neulasta. I did get mouth and nose sores along with some constipation, all manageable. Yeast infection on my bottom still working on My biggest issue was I could NOT Sleep for 3-4 days, I felt so crazy and out of control, my emotions were all over the place. Did not want to be left alone.. Dr thinks steroids may be the issue. Has anyone had this issue with Steroids ,",

I to have noticed so many with same dx as mine yet treatment totally different. Its a little scary as it makes you wonder, are you being under treated or others being over treated.. I understand age and other medical issue come into play with treatment, it just seems Drs are all over the place with treatment plans for same dx. I wish there was a some studies I could find that would help me understand clearly why he feels no radiation is needed.",
