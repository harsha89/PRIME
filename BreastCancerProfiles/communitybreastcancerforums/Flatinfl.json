I also had chemo and radiation. I was completely honest with both of them and have never tried to hide any of it. We have had lots of discussions about cancer and continue to do so. It saddens me that it is a part of their lives at such an early age, but that is our reality.  My daughter asked the other day if the cancer was gone and if I was going to die from cancer.  I told her, it is gone for now and while I may die someday(we all do) it won't be soon. We have a wonderful school counselor who started a group for kids who have a parent that is ill.  Of the three parents, I am the only one still here a year later. I hope that I dealt with this the \"right\" way, but parenting is hard in even the best circumstances. I think we should take cues from our kids and let them lead the questions but be as honest as possible with them. Kim",
