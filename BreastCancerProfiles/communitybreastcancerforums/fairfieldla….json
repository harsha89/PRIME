I hoped it was the anaesthetic but it appears to be getting worse - bread, cake, and chicken a particular problem.  I'm eating a lot of soup! I haven't had radiation but wonder if there is any connection at all between drugs used during surgery and this problem.  I am hoping it goes away because I worry about oesphogeal cancer.",
