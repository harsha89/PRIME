Met with the surgeon yesterday and felt like there is no real sense of urgency. I apparently have other areas of concern in the same breast that they didn't really worry about until my biopsy came back positive. They did another biopsy of one of the other areas yesterday and now I wait 3-5 days for those results.  From what I gathered from her yesterday, she intends to see what these results show and then schedule an MRI which has to take place 7-14 days after my period starts. So, best case scenario, I'm looking at mid-July before we even begin to talk surgery or find out about lymph node involvement. There has been no discussion about other tests to check if it has spread anywhere else.  Is this normal? Am I unreasonable to think it should move along a little faster?

Had a bilateral mastectomy in August, 4 rounds of Taxotere/Cytoxin and then 28 treatments of radiation. My breast surgeon and radiation oncologist strongly recommended radiation but left it up to me as well. When it all came down to it, I felt that, for me, it was one more thing in the arsenal to throw at it. I also have 3 boys between the ages of 12 and 27 and would stand on my head if it meant there was a better chance of having this never come back.",

Big difference! Much more comfortable with the proposed plan going forward.  Thanks so much for all the feedback!",
