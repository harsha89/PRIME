Redbarb:  Thanks so much for your prayers!  Fotopet:  Looks like you, me and Redbarb have the same protocol (TC, rads, tamoxifen...just different dates.

Jenny B...thanks for posting your hair updates...you really have helped me get prepared.  I hope you are feeling better. To Fotopet- Thanks again for starting this group and good luck to you. To all of you who have just started...continue to drink lots of water.  Just know that you may feel bad one day, but you will feel better soon.  So my one question is there anyone that did not have a Neulasta shot?  My oncologist told me me that I would only get one if I needed it.  I don't go back until my next TC infusion on 5/24.  Just curious as I see so many having the shot the day after your first infusion. Remember PMA (Positive Mental Attitude)!  We all can do this!",

Fotopet- Thanks for your well wishes.  Check in with your nurse about your arm.  I have Thrombophlebitis...where the vein hardened and looks like a bruise above the injection site from the first infusion where I had the allergic reaction.  I have to put warm compresses on it and they won't use this vein again. Patricia48- Yoga sounds like just what I need..thanks for sharing! CTherese-  Thanks for making me laugh...I love the idea of A Big Wig Party! To All:  Thanks for your posts!  It really helps.  PMA!",

Starting to get anxious again as tomorrow is TC#2.  My worse thing so far has been my allergic reaction to Taxtorere when I couldn't breathe...just hoping that this time they can get the pre-meds and drip rate working so I don't have that experience. So sorry to hear about those that have had to go to the hospital...I am sending lots of positive thoughts your way in hope that you have lots of better days ahead. Now back to HAIR...so I just had this hope that I would not lose all my hair as I have medium to long thick hair.  I was use to shedding hair...but I definitely have to say that my hair really hurts and I need to face reality that yes I am going to lose all my hair.  Washed my hair and my part has now doubled in width, with a huge bald spot on the back.  I think I am just afraid to get it shaved and see what I look like in the mirror!  For all of those that have already gone through the hair experience...thanks for posting...I am feeling your anxiety and pain...you are all so brave! For all of you starting this week...good luck...keep posting...the May Group is great! Remember.......P(positive) M(mental) A(attitude)!  Wishing a good week to all!",
