My wife was 35 y/o when she was first diagnosed back in sept 2002. dx invasive ductal ca Shes stage 11b with 1 node positive. she underwent  MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY and  chemo AC 4 cycles ER + and PR+ and her 2 neg so she was on tamoxifen for 5 years... Last month april 2008, she was diagnosed with chest wall recurrence on the pectoralis muscle and it was excised 3.5 cm with + 33/34 matted lymph nodes in the muscle and the  supraclavicular area  with clear margins. Further exam revealed the hormonal status of the tumor changed to triple neg . metastatic work up negative in the liver and bones but questionable in the lungs( several subcentimeters nodules in both lungs) by CT scan. our surgical onco did not suggest biopsy of the lung nodules because they are too small and shes going to have chemo anyway  because of the chest wall recurrence  Presently she is on her 2nd cycle of taxotere and xeloda ..it has been very  difficult for both of us since then to accept that at her age  of 41 now, we are dealing with this kind of problem...   would like to ask for any inputs.... btw we are from the philippines.. tnks Log in to post a reply",

She is injected with granocyte on the 4th and 6th day after chemo because the wbc and neutrophils goes down but on the 8th day it goes back up to normal levels. we will have repeat ct scan after the 3rd cycle.. will get in touch with you if i have questions. tnks ",

That is after 5 years of the primary breast cancer being operated on her R breast. Our surgeon removed the tumor and the sorrounding lymph nodes, underwent 6 rounds of taxotere and xeloda and 33 doses of radiation treatment in the tumor site.. Presently she is undergoing Dendritic Cell Vaccination or immunotheraphy. anybody here who has experienced or undergoing the same treatment? i understand that this is also involves stem cells?",
