The CT scan picked up my uterus enlargement. My oncologist sent me to an gynecologist oncologist. My uterus is 9.6 cm larger than average and the endometrial lining uneven. Inside there was very tiny free space. So, I had a D&C hysteroscopy with byopsy and uterine ablation. I get those results on February 13th.",

I had just turned 31 a month before. I am now 32 with a soon to be 15 yr old, 9 and 5 yr old. I did 8 rounds of tch with 4 weeks of taxotere. (I only have 2 more herceptin treatments left.) Lumpectomy in Sept and 33 rounds of radiation. I finished Dec 4th. The hardest part for me, was going through this without my mom. My mother in law, best friend, cousin, children and husband stood next to me during this journey. Now I'm trying to find my new normal. You ladies will get through this like another journey to concur.",
