After treatment 10, I woke up at 1am with horrible chest pain. It was a crushing pain on my upper chest that made me very nauseous. Hurt to breathe and I thought I was having a heart attack. My husband called an ambulance and I was off to the ER. After a CT scan, chest X-ray, and blood work the 2 ER Drs and the on call radiologist came back with the diagnosis of radiation induced pleurisy. They prescribed prednisone and naproxen. I spoke with my Onc later that day and she said the pleurisy was from an infection not radiation. That it couldn't be radiation induced. I had developed a dry cough a couple of days before and it arrived with an excruciating headache. I believe this was the beginning of the problem that resulted in pleurisy. I spoke with my Onc about the cough when it started and she said it was likely a cold. Though no one around me was sick and I had no other symptoms, i accepted this at face value until the ER visit. It seems like the entire medical community accepts that radiation is damaging during treatment with the glaring exception of radiologists. Why is that? Why do radiologists insist that damage can only occur after radiation is complete? It defies logic to assume that bad side effects can only manifest 1-6 months after treatment. These rare side effects can occur during treatment. The question for me now is should I stop treatment or try to continue. At this point I am deeply worried about developing pleurisy again and it leading to permanent scarring, pulmonary fibrosis, or a blood clot in my lung. It feels like I'm having to choose a medicine that could be worse than the disease.",
