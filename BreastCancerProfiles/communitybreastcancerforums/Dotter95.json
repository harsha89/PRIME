I decided on brachytherapy for a couple of reasons - the short treatment time, minimal burning and the fact that you can have radiation again if (God forbid) you have BC again. I live in Ontario, Canada, and there is a Brachytherapy specialist at the breast cancer center. He does interstitial brachytherapy, where small flexible tubes are inserted into the breast one at a time under a general anesthetic. The end result is much like a SAVI, but all the tubes can be tailored to fit your particular tumor confirmation. I will have the tubes placed tomorrow morning, then 9 treatments beginning tomorrow afternoon and ending on Friday. I am pretty nervous (don't feel much like sleepingðŸ˜• But will be really glad to be FINISHED on Friday!  Thanks, Pyrrh, for all your posts. It's so helpful to hear of other people's experiences. I will post too. Fighting girl, we start so close together! Hope you have an uneventful time! Looking forward to reading your posts! ",

My last Day of brachytherapy was uneventful - the best kind! When the tubes were removed, there was no pain - actually couldn't even feel it. There was just a sense of relief as the pressure caused by the squishing of the breast was released. Now, three days later, there is minimal swelling of the breast, and the entrance and exit points have healed and are small round red spots. No redness around or signs of infection. During my treatment, I didn't wear a surgical bra, just a stretchy tank top with a Guaze pad between it and my breast. I can't tolerate tape of any kind. This worked even as I slept, and I certainly recommend it as it was comfy. Guess it would only work if you have smallish breasts, though. Each treatment, the radiation techs applied polysporin around each button to prevent infection and to keep the tubes lubricated and loose so removal would be easy. I have found brachytherapy to be a great choice for me and I am really thankful I fit into the criteria. The surgery aspect was a bit scary, but in retrospect not so bad. The short treatment time and no skin issues plus the benefit of still having rads in my arsenal should I ever develop BC again has far outweighed the surgery issue. I would do this again in a heartbeat.! Fighting girl - you will be finished tomorrow I think. Hope all goes well for you - please let me know! Pyrrh, so you are able to sleep on your stomach again?! I'm not quite there yet but it sure will be nice to be normal again!",

There aren't many women who choose brachytherapy here, so I was very well treated with lots of attention - a bit of an anomaly I guess! The only glitch is that I couldn't get started on the radiation today for some reason, so treatments go until late Friday aftrnoon ( and I was wrong - only 8 treatments, not 9). Anyway, breast is feeling swollen a bit and not too happy, but the pain meds (tylenol3) are doing the trick. I think the hard part is past - I am feeling great about choosing this route. I just have a dressing held in place by a stretchy tank top as my skin does not deal well with tape. The surgery lasted about 2 hours, then I had a CT to make sure the tubes were all in the right location. I have 11 tubes in 3 rows. The physicists were making the treatment plan this afternoon, so the RO said that if any of the tubes were not really necessary, they would be removed tomorrow. They did a simulation of the radiation treatment. When the radiation is done, little \"hoses\" are connected to each of the tubes in my breast. They screw on - it's like I am a human meccano set! (This dates me btw) and it wasn't painful at all. Apparently the radioactive seeds are almost at the end of their useable life ( being replaced next week) so my treatments will be a long time comparatively - about 20 minutes (5 min or so for fresh ones). Oh well, I'll sing to myself or something! I asked my RO why the SAVI device was not used, and he said it was not available in Canada as it has not received approval from Health Canada. Interesting",

The open part of the tubes are on the side closest to my arm. The breast looks kind of squished, but really there isn't a lot of discomfort. Absolutely no pain when they did the first treatment this morning ( I am waiting for the second treatment now). They also decided two of the tubes were unnecessary so they were removed. I was worried it would hurt, but didn't at all! I dint have any bruising yet according to the technicians, and where the two tubes were taken out are only little red marks - nothing really. I had no problem sleeping last night, and find taking a tylenol3 occasionally is all I need for pain management. So far so good! Hope your treatment today goes well. Let me know!",
