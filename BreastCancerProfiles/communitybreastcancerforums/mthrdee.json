Honest story.....one appointment with a new oncologist and she had just completed a breast exam while continuing a running conversation with me.  She turns back to me and says you can get dressed now and I say......aren't you going to do an exam.  I cannot even explain the look I got from her. So there you go, childhood you are taught not to show your privates to strangers and now at 47 years of age, I don't even notice strangers touching them!!!!",
