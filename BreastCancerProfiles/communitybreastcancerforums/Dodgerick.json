This has been a scary journey! Now that the mastectomies surgery is done, doctor says no more surgery to remove additional lump nodes (yay), oncotype DX came back with a low score of 17 (no chemo, yay!)...I expect my radiation treatments will probably begin in April too! I just would like to get these expanders filled so I can get radiation over with! (I've only had one fill since surgery). Does anyone know anything about radiation with expanders in place?",

I have a quick question, has anyone had problems with their toenails falling off from (radiation)? My oncologist recommended a genomic test called ONCOTYPE DX and the results from my tumor was a score of 17, so I didn't have to have chemotherapy. I have only had 25 radiation treatments. My toenails started falling off about 2 1/2 weeks ago and radiation is the only thing that has changed....can radiation cause you toenails to turn purple and fall off? Just wondering if anyone else had this problem? Good luck and blessings to all of you who are still doing radiation! ",

I REALLY need some reassurance, PLEASE! It's driving me crazy!!! After being diagnosed on November 29, 2017 with ILC and DCIS in my right breast, I had bilateral mastectomies on January 6, 2018. I decided that with a 40% chance of cancer also showing up in my left breast, my best bet would be to have them both removed...as a side note, the pathology reports shows they found LCIS in my left breast! Glad we opted for BMX! The 2cm tumor was ER+, PR+, and HER-2 negative. My surgeon hadn't anticipated lymph node involvement and so she just removed the sentinel lobe. On my followup appointment on February 7, 2018 my surgeon told me that the pathology report found the sentinel lymph node she had removed was involved by cancer with a 1.9cm extracapsular extension present. In spite of lymph node involvement, my oncologist suggested the ONCOTYPE DX to determine if I would benefit by chemotherapy. About a month later my ONCOTYPE DX came back with a score of 17, and my oncologist determined chemotherapy would not be necessary or add significant benefit in this situation. I was so excited that I wouldn't have chemo! On April 25, 2018 I started 5 weeks of radiation to my chest wall and regional lymph nodes, I completed radiation with minimal side effects on May 31, 2018. I'm looking for encouraging news from other breast cancer survivors of ILC and DCIS with lymph node involvement, that have also skipped chemotherapy....PLEASE?",
