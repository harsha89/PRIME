My surgeon was great at explaining everything, so I felt I had a really good understanding of what I was getting myself into. 1st I had the needle biopsy where they put in the metal markers, then I had the wire inserted the day of my lumpectomy. My BC was sooo small it was impossible to see with the naked eye. The surgeon needed the markers and needle to guide him to to area to cut out. Unfortunately for me, he did not get enough margins, so I ended up having a 2nd lumpectomy, which turned out to be a great thing, because they found move cancer. I had a really tough time getting over the anesthesia the 1st surgery, so I only had a local for the second surgery, and that was a piece of cake. It's a little freaky seeing your breast all wrapped up - you can't tell if it will look weird or not. When the bandage 1st came off, my poor nipple was indented and looked really weird, but after a day of freedom from bandages it popped back out and looked relatively normal. The whole experience was very surreal. But hang in there sisters of the lump.... it will all seem like distant dream one day. ",

So only 2 more regular zaps & then 6 boosts. Colette37 - how are you doing. Been thinking of you today and hoping you're doing OK. Alaina - only 4 more zaps! WOW. Did they tell you why - no boosts? PauldingMom - 1 more zap & then just your boosts. We're on the home stretch. Hang in there my pink ladies!",

Pauldingmom - really sorry to hear that you have 3 more zaps then you thought. That would be unsettleing. I do so enjoy crossing my zaps off the calendar. Would be hard to add 3 more. I'm hoping I can get zapped 2 times in 1 day next week, so I can be done on Wed. and not have to go back after Thanksgiving. ONLY 7 more to go! Colette... haven't heard from you in a while.

It adds a very small % to the cancer not coming back, and has terrible side effects and a % of creating bigger problems then the bc I had. I have been a workaholic for a long time, and am taking this whole thing as a huge kick in the butt to get my act together. I decided I will make some major changes in my life style and get this body into good physical shape.  I quit drinking coffee, and am working on improving my diet. Will start drinking green tea as soon as I am done with radiation, and will start an exercise program as soon as I get my energy back.... which I am hoping will be in the next 2 weeks. Question to all you who have finished with radiation: Did you find the boosts more tiring then the regular treatments? How long after being done with radiation did your wounds heal? How long before your energy came back? Today I have been fried. Slept on and off all day, and it's not quite 8:30 and I'm ready for bed. Is this from the boost or just an accumulation of all the radiation?",

Read a ton, and had a really informative medical oncologist that gave great information and didn't try to ram it down my throat. The side effects were just too much for me to wrap my head around. Today I had treatment #4 and have 27 more to go. Question... From day one about 4 hours after the treatment I felt the smallest amount of tenderness in my breast. It's gotten a little more pronounced each day, and after today's treatment I feel the tenderness not only over the scarring, but also on the side of my breast near my armpit.  Anyone Else Get Tenderness So Soon In Their Treatment?",

But I truly believe that what you think and feel is part of the healing. You might want to vomit after reading this.... but when I am getting zapped, I thank the radiation and visualize it killing any lurking cancer cells. I think that because of this treatment I will finally been done with this chapter of my life called \"OMG I have Breast Cancer\". I have been on this run away train since last March, and in only 3 1/2 weeks I will be getting off, and will resume my life. I also feel that this is a giant wake-up call for me. I have re-evaluated my life. I'm spending more time with family and friends. (I admit I was a real workaholic) and am stretching and taking time to get outside and enjoy the day. OK... I'm from Vermont, and we're all tree hugger type folks here. But seriously. Be strong and greatful for what you have. AND yes, I am writing this for me too. This is one of the hardest things I have ever gone through.... but I do think the bout of poison ivy I had that covered my arms and legs was a little worse.... well.... maybe not. But it was very brutal. Hugs to you sisters of the rad. Hang in there... I'm rooting for us all!",

My poor nipple is all dried out, and underneigh it the skin has split and is slightly infected. I will only get 1 day of rest this weekend, cause I will get treatment on Sunday to be done before Thanksgiving. The nurses & doctor looked at it, and suggested I get some 'Domeboro'. It is this powder that you add to water, soak a soft cloth in and lay on the open sore for 15 min. Suppose to draw out the puss and dry it out. I did this, and then washed if off and layered on aloe. Hoping it doesn't get too much worse. The sore is kinda close to the incision, but the doctor couldn't tell if it would get zapped during the boost, until they set me up for the boost. Anyone have any other suggestions?",

Must have been really hard for bc ladies of yesteryears who did not have the internet to connect with other pink ladies while going through the emotional and physical ups and downs of bc. Today I had my last full zap. Tomorrow I move on to boosts. 5 days 6 boosts. The last day I go out with a double dip - 8:30 am & back again at 3:30. My brave little nip is hanging in there. Really helped to have a day off, and the domeboro the nurses recommended has really helped a lot. I'm soaking my nipple in 1/2 packet in 1 cup warm water for 15 min. then letting it air dry. It seems to pull out the goop from my infection (which I wipe away with a paper towel) and then it seems to dry up the open wound. Found out today that the sore spot on my nip is so close to my incision that it will be in the boost area. Oh Well.... only 5 more days then it will just be a story from my past. I had an acupuncture treatment today. It's almost hard to believe that having a couple of needles in my arms & lets for about 20 min. can make such a difference to how I feel. It seems to bring me back to equilibrium. I have more energy and feel more balanced emotionally & physically. I've been following the \"Natural Girl' thread for a couple of days. Lots of talk of how to support the body after treatment with supplements, food, yoga, exercise. Since I have decided not to take Tamoxifen, I have no more treatments.... so I'm going to make some major changes in my life to help my body stay as healthy as possible and never have to go down the bc road again.",

Had the 1st of 6 yesterday and it did not like it at all. I continue to soak it in domeboro to pull out the infection. I have found the best way to get a good soak is to put the soaking solution in a sake' cup (looks kind of like a shot glass) lean my nipple in and the sit up while holding the sake' cup in place for 15 min. The wound is looking very ugly... and the doc. didn't want me to put anything on it to start healing it till after my boosts. But I had to do something, so I put a smiggen of tea tree oil in my sake' cup and put that on my wound. Feels better already. Don't know if any of you have played around with tea tree oil, but I just love the stuff. It stops a yeast infection immediately and is great on cold sores - BUT, you use just a teeny, tiny amount deluted in water. 4 more days, 4 more days..... OMG, I am so ready to be done with this phase of my life. Hope you and yours are doing well.  ",

I found that any type of cream made the infection worse. It needs to dry out and keep dry. The domeboro really helped with that! Don't know if you read far back enough... but the best way I found to really soak my nipple was to mix the powder in warm water then dip in a sake' cup or a shot glass. Lean over and put your nipple into the glass, press up into the breast, then you can sit for 20 min. or so, and give it a good soaking. Dry it well and keep it dry. I even quit putting aloe on it until I was done with the boosts. Yesterday the big ugly scab around my nipple came off. The area around my nibble is still swollen and feels like lizard skin, but it seems to be getting better each day. Now that the infection is gone, I am slathering it in aloe, which feels really good. Still letting it air out as much as possible. I used 1/2 packet of domeboro in 1/2 cups warm water. Hang in there... once your done zapping the area, the infection heals up very quickly!
