Now I believe it has caught me at last. For the past 2 months I have had aching & soreness in my left breast. No lump, but it feels dense & hurts when I press on it ~ especially at night when I sleep in my stomach. It's not related to my cycle. I have a doctor's appointment next week but am already sure it's bc ~ what else could it be? I am an other wise healthy 46 year old, very sad & scared. I have already resigned mysled to a bilateral mastectomy ~ I don't want to live iin fear forever. Â  I plan to be treated at Stanford Hospital in Palo Alto. Anyone had any experience there? Thanks for being here for me! ~Tina Log in to post a reply",
