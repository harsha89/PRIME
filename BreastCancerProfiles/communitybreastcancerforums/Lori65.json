    "Content": "Lori65 wrote: I recently found your website and was particularly interested in the section on how HRT  increases the incidence of breast.  According to what I read the increase is related to the use of both progesterone and estrogen or estrogen only, but I have been prescribed progesterone only.  I have been having a very difficult time with hot flashes and night sweats as I move into menopause.  Both my mother and maternal grandmother have had breast cancer.  What do you know about increased incidence and progesterone only HRT?
