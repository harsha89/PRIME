I had no lymphedema problems post surgery (excisional biopsy followed by a lumpectomy), chemo, or radiation therapy. Then had my yearly mammogram done and wham it started. Took me a few days to figure out what was going on (swelling of the breast tissue as well as radiating out to the side, underarm, and across my scapular. It took me another 3 weeks to be fitted and receive the compression bras. I started wearing my compression sleeve because I did not want any of this to radiate down my arm. I am receiving massage therapy as well as trying Kenisio tape. I now know that if I had this to do all over again I would have opted for a mastectomy!  Surgery 12/1/2011 Lumpectomy: Right; Lymph node removal: Right, Sentinel, Underarm/Axillary Hormonal Therapy 1/22/2012 Femara (letrozole) Targeted Therapy 1/22/2012 Herceptin (trastuzumab) Chemotherapy 1/22/2012 Carboplatin (Paraplatin), Taxotere (docetaxel) Radiation Therapy 5/15/2012 Breast, Lymph nodes Log in to post a reply",

If I had had a mastectomy I would have avoided radiation therapy and its side effects as well as the twice yearly mammograms I have to go through now. And it was the latest mammogram that caused my LE. I have another one to look forward to in six months unless someone has a suggestion here for an alternative. I have been trying to learn more about thermograms and was hoping someone here had info about or experience with. Or info about any alternative to mammograms. I'm open. ",
