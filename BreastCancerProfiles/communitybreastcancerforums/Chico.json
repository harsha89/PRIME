BTW I was 12 years from original dx however as I have oestoarthritis and lots of back pain the bone mets in my spine and ribs may have been around for a while. I am on 3rd cycle of a trial in the UK using Ibrance and Letrozole with Denosumab thrown into the mix. My first scan is due in January. On a trial I am not allowed to do many things such as take herbs or have acupuncture etc however I would really like to gain knowledge from people who have managed to outdo the odds and are willing to share that information. So many of the threads are great and Bestbird and Zarovka etc share great information but it is difficult to go back through all the threads to find info so I thought perhaps keeping this thread going may just concentrate on the MBC Long-timers and give us newbies hope and ideas. Merry Christmas everyone and wishing you all a Happy 2017. Chico xx",

On the other hand I have a wonderful life that I wish to continue enjoying for as long as possible so 2017 will see me cutting back and joining the fitness girls. Happy 2017 to you all. Chico xx",

Onc's are great however I think the people on the forums live the life and are more willing to share the info. Hope you and everyone is enjoying the run up to the holidays. Chico x",

I will certainly report back what my Onc suggests. I am finding this thread very interesting and exciting. It\u2019s early days but there seems to be something in adding worming pills, statins, metformin etc to our other meds and many Oncs & GPs seem to be being supportive and some are even encouraging us to try this protocol. Miaomix I am cheering you on both for trying these items but also for standing up for the animals in our food chain. I am a long time vegetarian so am very pleased to see so many great alternate products now available to those of us who want them.",

Also in thanking Cure-ious for sharing her research with us all. I live in the U.K. and have considered contacting COC (Care Oncology Clinic) but again like Chicagoan I have been stable, with extensive bone mets, on I/L plus Xgeva since 2016, and would rather wait for things to change before adding more into the mix. I do have a friend on the protocol who is doing well however she did have problems with the very high dose of statins that she was prescribed. My Onc suggested that taking a statin may be useful even though I don\u2019t have particularly high cholesterol and this I have done. He also said it would be ok to add a low dose aspirin which so far I haven\u2019t done. Because I have a very high carb and sugar diet I may consider adding metformin sometime soon however my glucose levels are quite low. I will wait to ask my Onc after my next scan in July. I will then also ask if he thinks starting the worming tablet would be useful.  ",

He basically replied \u201cI have yet to be convinced about any of the COC protocols. Certainly a number of side-effects, but I'm not aware of any good evidence for benefit. Strictly though, there's no info that it would be damaging to the current treatment either\u201d. Considering that this was not a face to face conversation I felt that it was a fairly positive response from a research Onc who is used to dealing with the \u201cscience\u201d. The main thing is he certainly was not saying that I/we should not go down this route. Ashas already been said on this thread the fantastic Miaomix, Schnauzer etc will be running their own trial. I have my next scan and meeting with my Onc in July when I will give him a more in depth grilling and will then decide if/when to join you ladies. I will however be following you with great interest and for the moment anyway cheering you on from the sidelines.",

It could of course be the cancer, arthritis, s/es\u2019s or I/L or the Xgeva. I would be very interested to know if anyone else gets back pain following the shot. I have asked both my Onc\u2019s about having the shots less often or even having a break but they say that they are waiting for the results of some research to advise the best dosing! So anyone else have the problem or know anything about dosing research?",
