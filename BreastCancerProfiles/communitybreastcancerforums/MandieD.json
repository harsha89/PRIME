There are a lot of medical things that are way less expensive here, even if you're paying it all out of pocket. For example, I paid about 2000 Euro total between ultrasounds from my own gyno, the mammogram she prescribed, an initial biopsy on what turned out to be (thank God) two fibroadenomas, their removal and the night in the hospital I won because I passed out after catching a look at the surgeon's bloodied scrubs (even though she had told me not to look!) That was full-freight; my US-based insurer cheerfully paid 90% of it, as it was well cheaper than it would have been in the US. If the BRCA test not as absurdly expensive as it is in the States, I highly recommend taking your late spring/early fall vacation here :)",

I'll still try to pin down a more specific figure for Germany. Since Germany's medical system is a weird patchwork of public and private, there might well be competing labs.",
