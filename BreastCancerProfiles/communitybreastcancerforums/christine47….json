Glad everyone is making out ok with the RADS. My eyebrows are really, really thin, 7 weeks out from chemo and now they deciede to leave me, oh well there are worse things.",

I am 47, married and have two boys (12 and 14).  I work full time but have not worked since Dec, but hope to return part-time tormmorrow, and work between treatments, I work in medicail office so flu season has been concern for my onc.  I had bilateral masectomy with TEs on Dec 2, and additional axillary node disection on Dec 28 (hopefully my stats show up on bottom?).  No issues with surgerys, but still discomfort from TEs and worried sick about getting LE. I am having TAC x 6, I have completed 2 rounds and next round is on Friday.  Side effects very much like everyone else.  I had horrible indigestion after 1st round and was given Aciphex rx which has worked well, both rounds started with consipation but have figured out how to manage, and take nausea meds on the clock.  No appitite for 1st week, followed by 2 ok weeks.  I have had issues with sleep and now taking ambien which helps and also occasionally add zanax. Someone mentioned scans, I had an ovary \"light up\" on my PET scan, normal size and I will have another scan after this weeks chemo, I am praying it was just a functional ovary since I was still very regular with periods and this was mid cycle.  I am BRAC 1, neg and BRAC 2 test was mutation of unknown significance, anyone else have this?  Well enough for now, just wanted to introduce myself and join your group.  Best to all this week!

Like the rest, chemopause has hit me, especially at night, I get primarily head flashes, not my whole body, just my head and neck.  I assume I will start the tamoxifen as soon as chemo ends.  Does anyone know if this keeps you in menopause?  I am 47 and was premenopause before chemo.  I just ready a study that suggests it is a good thing if you have flashes on tamox, as it means the medication is doing the job. Sounds like everyone is doing well and we are all moving along with upcoming surgeries, rads, etc.  Feel like I have gotten to know everyone in the last few months, and look forward to seeing us move on to better things this summer.",

I do not have ativan, instead xanax, and I have taken both the xanan and ambien at night. One for sleep and the other to help with the anxiety. Check with your onc, and if you need it, take it.  I thought I might need to check into the Betty Ford Center when I finished treatment, but am pleased to say, that I have not needed my \"drugs\" now since Sunday (finished chemo on thurs).   hang in there!",

I spent 2 nights in the hospital, more because of nausea and long surgery time, maybe you will go home in a day or the same day.  Having someone with you at home for a few days would be helpful.  Also extra pillows for your bed, lying flat was abit uncomfortable at first.  Also tops that button or zip, you can not and should not reach over your head at first, and pants or shorts with elastic waist bands are great.  I was permitted to take a quick shower the next day, as they used glue on the incisions. I am done with my surgery (except implant exchange), and like you worry about everything.  I wait for the day when I can wake up and not think about breast cancer.  At least I no longer think about it every minute, just every hour. Are you having your surgery at a large medical center in NC, I had mine at Baptist Medical Center?",

What make me nervous is reading about reoccurances and ladies with small primary lesions and mets!  How the heck does this happen.  I surely hope after all we go thru, we are done with BC!!

Someone mentioned Vitamin D levels in an earlier comment, my level was very low at diagnosis, now back to normal range, be sure you are checked. Hot flashes, I had them on chemo, then seemed to do better right after chemo, now after 3 weeks of Tamoxifen, they are more frequent.  I did read that hot flashes where an indicator of tamoxifen effectiveness, lets hope that is true. I am now less than 2 weeks away from port removal and implant exchange, starting to get just a little nervous.  I have alot to do at work and home before my surgery, so at least the time will go fast.  My boys will both be at summer camp when I have my surgery so at least I won't need to worry about them.

Elaineg--sorry to hear about your hair trouble, maybe when you finish the herceptin things will pick up.  Maybe talk with your onc or find a good dermatologist who deals with hair issues.  When I saw my onc early this month he said my hair looked good, I laughed, what does he know he is totally bald.",

My eyebrows are coming back so quick, I may need to pluck a few crazy ones.  I am at the coast this week on vacation and this is keeping me away from looking in the mirror all day long.  I love having almost no hair on the beach, so easy to just put on a hat and go, no hair to get in the sun screen, etc.",

Any input is helpful, Thanks.",
