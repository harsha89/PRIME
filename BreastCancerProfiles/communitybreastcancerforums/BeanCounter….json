I had my ovaries removed since I'm estrogen receptor positive, so now I'm dealing with hot flashes, chills, and stiffness. I would love to hear how others deal with these symptoms, especially natural remedies because I don't like to take medications unless I have to. I would love to hear how your treatment has been over the last two years. God bless, Kim ",
