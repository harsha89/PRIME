I guess being 20 years old might have something to do with that. So I went to Macy's and there is a vast array of stretchy products - Flexee was the brand I bought.  It wasn't nearly as expensive as the spanx and a bit more giving.  I bought both another thigh-to-diaphram product and some underwear that looks like a high-waisted boy short with compression to just above the belly button.  I'm loving the boy shorts - and they aren't hideous. Good luck finding something.. it was almost too much choice. And good luck to Jac and Paula -- you'll do great, and the pre-surgery anxiety will be over soon! ",

Laurie - yeah, I think the care at UW is great, but I'm pretty damn frustrated with their scheduling system. Now that I have a date (and I could afford to wait a bit, although I think there was still some intervention by my BS), things seem to be fine.  Some times I think I should have looked into the New Orleans group.. but I'm also pretty happy to stay close to home.  I love your recent post.  How 'bout this freezing weather! Zogo - thanks, the photo is from New Zealand -- I've had 3 work trips there, one just after my first diagnosis, one just after radiation, one just after my second diagnosis.  I'm probably the only person who holds negative connotations with NZ.  I've got one more trip in February.. think I'll be able to enjoy it then???",

It's great to hear from all of you who have made it through your surgeries.  I hope it feels like a relief to be done with the anxiety - now the goal is clear: get healthy and mobile as smoothly and soon as possible.  I'm certainly ready to be done with the anxiety part and get my life back. Seems like there's a few of us from Seattle.. at least this is an OK time to not be out there and enjoying the outdoors.  I'll be OK with a stockpile of tea, netflix, trashy novels and my new recliner (although my boyfriend has definitely bonded with both the recliner and the new IPad I got for recovery). Have a good weekend to all of you. - Andrea",

Things look good (well, as good as a bunch of scars and bruises can get).  Trying to get excited about a little prune juice right now - that stuff is dreadful.  I think I can slow down on the Oxycodone pretty soon - my reward will be NO Prune Juice.",

So what is everyone wearing these days?  I got a surgical camisole pre-surgery, but when I put it on post-surgery, it seems too tight and pressed up against incisions.  But maybe that's the point?  So far (1 week as of today, but feels like a lifetime), I've only been wearing loose pajama tops.  I'm also awaiting a path report today - I'm so sorry, vis0121, that yours was more than expected.  Good luck to all of you having surgery this week.. there definitely is a peace of mind after it's done.. maybe oxycodone induced, but more peaceful nonetheless.",

Hope everyone had a good holiday and that the healing is going as well as it can.",
