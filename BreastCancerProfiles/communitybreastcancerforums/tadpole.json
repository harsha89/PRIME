So now I'm left up in the air until Aug. 5, 'cause the doctors are on vacation, to find out what's next.  (None of it good, I'm thinking).  I soooooo want to see my grandchild born this Dec., but was told to talk to my family, basically to get my affairs in order.  (They already are). Anyone have/had experience with this, or know someone else who has?  In the past four weeks, I have had three friends die of cancer, one a very close friend who died within a month of being diagnosed, and I'm so frickin' tired of this sneaky ba***rd disease. It's been seven years, and I thought I was doing pretty good.  I'm just sad, is all.

I came home from the hospital Thursday and ended up being re-admitted Friday with a high fever.  Just got home last night.  I am SO not impressed with hospitals - only once got my Xeloda on time even when I reminded the nurses, twice it was the wrong dose, I was actually told by one nurse not to complain, I was lucky I got it when I did, most nurses would not speak English to me (or could not, I don't know). Yes, I speak French but when you feel like crap and have to translate it's an extra stress. At one point I was on a heart monitor and wanted to go pee and the nurse said she didn't have time to unhook me, (which takes all of one minute), I would just have to wait, so I did it myself. Yes, I'm sure everyone's busy and overworked, but where is the compassion, the bedside manner anymore?  When I trained as a nursing assistant years ago things sure were different. Anyway, I'm sure everybody here is quite familiar with how hospitals can be.  We have to tell the kids this weekend, and my brothers and their wives want to come visit, but I don't want to see anyone till I can get my head around this a bit, and I'm too tired to entertain and no appetite to eat. Hope they understand, but I can't make it easy for other people anymore - the well has run dry. So, I'll know more next Monday and will update. Take care, everybody.",
