Anneyrae123 I pray you find a pain management Dr. who will help you with your pain. I'm in alot of pain and can not function on pain meds. Although during chemo I was taking Percocet every 4 hours. Thank God I didn't become addicted and believe that addicts including alcoholics can not help that they are addicted, just like people who suffer from depression can not help that they are depressed. Life isn't easy, but we deal with the card we are dealt to the best of our ability.  ",

I had 4 months of chemo and am having alot of chest pain especially after swimming which I think is scar tissue breaking up. Has anyone besides me still having pain? Everyday is different and there is no swelling in my arm even though I had 11 nodes taken out. Thanks",

My breasts are extremely painful, stabbing pains along with my left arm from the lymph nodes being removed. My onc put me on Ativan for the pain.  Sometimes it helps and sometimes it doesn't.  I also take 3 or 4 Advil every 6 hours.  I just want to feel better. My onc is sending me to PT for truncal Lymphedema.  I am hoping my insurance will cover it.  My employer is giving me a hard time about going. Sometimes my back hurts too.  I also have bad joint pain in my hands, fingers, knees, shoulders, and arms.",
