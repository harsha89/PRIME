Most of her issues is just from having cancer so many times with so many surgeries on top of it so its hard to compare it to what I will go through. Were you able to spare the nipple & areola? Is the outer appearance a lot different? I also don't want mine to look too fake but not sure how big or little to go. When I was 16 I had DD & very perky fake looking boobs(which was very uncomfortable & annoying, I hated it). I am about 10 lbs ligther & it all disappeared from my boobs putting me at a comfortable D. They are saggy now. I hope I am not asking too many questions but I haven't had anyone to talk to that has gone through the same thing other than my Mom but her situation is different. Thank you soooo much for all this info! I go next month for my 6 month MRI & will kinda determine how soon I should have my surgery. I am getting married next year(depending on my surgery situation) too so it has been tough to decide if I will have enough time to get the surgery done before & be back to my normal self. *",

I am thinking about going a little bit smaller than I am...probably a C. I am a size 0 waist & have been a DD...to a D now & it isn't fun.

They recommend I get my ovaries out by the time I am 35. But for now just do yearly ultrasounds(especially since im so young & want kids). My dr. Said I will need breast MRI's every year. I had my first 6 months ago that showed a benign cysts so I go back next month for another one & guess i will go from there as to what I should do. They have told me that you take 11 years from when your Mom has BC & that age is when you begin to be at higher risk. My Mom was 37 so my dr. said I should have my mastectomy before I am 26. I really just feel like a ticking time bomb. I hope this helps.",

It is sooo hard when you are young. People(dr. office & insurance) I talk to always say i'm too young for this or why am I getting an MRI? I just got my insurance to approve coverage for my first MRI I had 6 months ago & round 2 is not looking any easier.

I feel so bad too cause I am not sitting here with breast cancer. I am sitting here with a great opportunity to save myself from it & its all so emotionally draining.  Candice- I am so glad to hear from you. This is so hard being so young.

My plan is to have the surgery after summer, probably closer to October. It has still been difficult accepting this all but after hearing from you guys & asking my doctor a lot more questions about life after the surgery. He felt very confident that I will bounce right back. Thank you all for your words it has truly helped me tremendously!! Angelina- I haven't heard of the mouth wash test. I am not sure if it would make a differences or not. I would maybe do some research on it. One way could be better than the other but to me I would guess genes are genes. *",

My oldest brother who is 34 had a back surgery a few years ago and the surgeon cut his main artery to his heart. After complaining for 2 days he fainted and realized he really was bleeding internally, almost losing his life. It was very scary and has forever changed his life and will never be the same. Surgery and doctors have always been a fear of mine and I have seen my Mom go through so many just fine but what happen to my brother has really freaked me out!!!   *",

I am 23 and was tested positive for BRAC1 last year and in 2 weeks will be having a bilateral prophylactic mastectomy with reconstruction. My Mom has had breast cancer 3 times and had a reconstructive mastectomy after her last battle. Breast cancer has been around me my whole life. My Aunt passed away from it a few years ago & cousins on my mom's side have passed from it. My sister is 31 and negative. I knew that my chances of being positive were very high considering my family history but I did not know what an emotional road it was going to put me on. I did not expect to feel the way I did when I heard the news. I decided to go with the surgery as I felt it was going to be the best option and even though I have a HUGE fear of doctors and surgery, my fear of hearing I have breast cancer is a lot bigger! I am fortunate that I have the option to not go through what my Mom did. On to the relationship part, I have been with my now Fiance for 4.5 years. From the beginning I have been very open with what I have gone through with my Mom and how much breast cancer has been a part of my life and how important it is for me to be proactive. I know it may be different since we were almost 4 years into our relationship when I found out I was BRAC1 but it is very important that the man in your life is supportive and understanding. The first thing my fiance said to me was \"boobs or no boobs, I just don't want you to have cancer.\" My fiance has not dealt or been around stuff like this at all but has handled my level of stress and emotions very well. I did do a lot of the doctor appointments by myself as I wanted to feel that everything I was doing was what \"I\" felt was best for me. I of course discussed things with him and he has gone to one of my last consultations so he could meet the surgeon and have him explain & answer any questions. I know it is all scary and you don't want to scare your boyfriend off but it is super super important that you have the support you need. I unfortunately feel there isn't a \"right\" time to tell someone but I do know it is such a relief once it is done. Even if you are not BRAC positive it is still important to be proactive and know your risk of breast cancer as well as your loved ones. I hope this has helped. I am sure we have a lot of the same experiences and feelings dealing with our Mom's having breast cancer at such a young age. I did not think that going through what I am going through was going to effect me in the way that it did. I know I do not have breast cancer but to deal with these decision at my age and the surgery is overwhelming. Just stay positive, take everything day by day, think things through(you don't have to make a decision over night), and ask your doctors ANY questions you may have. This site has helped me tremendously and let me know that I am NOT ALONE! One last thing, if you do not have the surgery or just decide to be proactive, make sure you are doing MRI's...we are too young for mammograms and ultrasounds aren't the best detection. Eat healthy and be active! Hope you find peace and comfort in it all.  All my love.",
