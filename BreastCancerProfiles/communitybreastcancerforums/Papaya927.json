    "Content": "Aug 25, 2017 01:10AM - edited Aug 25, 2017 01:21AM by Papaya927 I would recommend the Cedar Sinai Breast Center - I recently went there for a second opinion on a benign breast lesion, and received excellent care. I called and asked for an appointment with a breast surgeon, and the surgeon guided me through the initial testing (she read my imaging and ordered a core biopsy) to surgery. Please let me know if I can provide further information, and all the best to your family.",
