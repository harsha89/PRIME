I actually hid from my entire family that I had a progression for almost three years! My reasons were similar to the ones you expressed. Why worry my parents/siblings? Did I want to deal with the added stress it would put ON ME if they knew (the constant questions about when my next PET was...I think it is harder for those close to us to wait between scans than it is for us, and the false limitations they might impose on me due to their unrealistic perceptions about my what my actual experience of going through chemo was...chemo is a scarier word than it has to be, for many). I didnt loose my hair with the subsequent treatments, and could avoid appearing tired or ill by planning my visits carefully, even while living only minutes away. Family dynamics can be complicated. For ME, since my primary emotional support network was outside of the \"nuclear\" family, this worked best. What they didn't know didn't hurt them, I figured. I was recently forced to \"come out\" to them because I finally graduated to a chemo that involved hair loss. Looking back, I know I made the right choice. They will never know about those three years because I will never tell them. It saved them a whole lot of anxiety and me a whole lot of stressing about their anxiety. This may or may not be applicable to your situation.....only you know your family and the dynamicsof the relationships. But there you have it. So, I know you may get some responses saying you MUST tell your family, but I'm taking this opportunity to say that the decision is really up to you. Either choice is equally as valid. YOU are the one with the disease. First and foremost should be YOUR emotional and physical well being. No one can ensure that but you. If sitting on disclosure a bit longer is what you need before making any final decisions, go for it. If you withhold even longer, that is OK. No guilt. Either way, try to enjoy your reunion and don't let the cancer control your experience of it. If you make the decision not to disclose during the reunion, you can always change your \"discovery date\" of when your POSSIBLE progression occurred to suit your needs, just remember what fib you come up with and stick to it. I do think disclosing a fictional later date when you knew about it earlier, then going back and saying \"well I lied\" later creates unnecessary feelings of mistrust and hurt that would not be helpful in the future. Your point that you really have nothing definitive to tell anyone is quite valid as well. The CT scans are not definative, as you said. Actually, now that I am \"outed\", I still choose to withhold some information and adjust dates as necessary to help me cope. I always need some time after a negative or positive result to wrap my head around it before I discuss it with anyone, so I rarely tell anyone the ACTUAL date of any of my scans. Once I have dealt with the test results myself, then I disclose what I think is prudent, when I think the time is right, on an individual basis. However, my one sister is the family gossip, so once she knows anything the jig is up! :) On the other side of the coin is the question of whether you think you might need some emotional support yourself during the reunion, from someone AT the reunion. If you need that, it does not mean you have to disclose to EVERYBODY, so long as the person(s) you choose to let in can be trusted to keep your confidence. You deserve to have that support if you need it. I would think that disclosing such a thing to so many people at once MIGHT be more overwhelming for you than you think (even if it just spreads through the family grapevine rather than you speaking to everyone about it individually) so do consider it carefully. There will be many different personalities and reactions, an assortment of questions (hopefully none will be just plain ignorant), but only you know your family and can predict what might come. I want to remind you that the possibility of or existance of mets to the liver and or the lung does not give you or anyone else more information about the date of your demise! I had liver mets in three spots three years ago, we changed chemo, and they disappeared not to return so far. This can happen in the lungs too. So, try not to scare the hell out of yourself with this possibility of progression, OK? Try to keep it in the context of another possible bump in the road you are travelling, and remember there is no way to know IF the PET is positive if this particular progression is an important turn of events in the big picture. Certainly your treatment may change, but you always knew that would happen at some point. Worry about what that treatment MIGHT be, IF it is necessary, after the PET. One day at a time. A tough decision. It would be nice if there was one person close to you that you could let in on your quandry, so you have some familiar support in making the decision. Hoping that you come to a comfortable decision and are able to enjoy seeing your family. After all, that is the point of getting to see everyone, right? DG",

He was right, it seems to help more than the vicoden. It must be some sort of inflammation. He suggested mine might be costochindritis. Look that up to see if your symptoms match. If it hurts when you put pressure on the joint where your rib meets your sternum, that is a positive sign that it is costochondritis (which is an inflammation of those joints). That can be caused by all sorts of benign things, which you will see when you look it up.  I put my money in your mets ( and the accompanying damage) in your spine though. Mornings are always worst because you have gone without pain meds all night. Once you eat and take meds it gets a bit better, right? How is your mattress? Something to think about. I cant afford a new one but I bought a memory foam mattress topper a few months back that seems to help so I have less pain in the morning.  However, if you have any problems breathing at all, you should go to the ER to have a chest CT to rule out a pulmonary embolism, OK? Don't play with that. I don't think it is on the list of potential SEs of Xeloda, but better to be safe than sorry, right?  Keep us posted!  DG",

      "Content": "DragonGirl wrote: Hello everyone, Well I've been absent from the boards for a while, struggling with more progression in my spine and the accompanying pain. As I've mentioned before, years ago (like 7 years ago) I was put on methadone for pain management since everything else made me sick to my stomach. It has worked wonderfully, however I've had difficulties when undergoing surgery or being admitted for pain spikes due to the fact that so few docs know how to prescribe additional pain medications for patients using methadone for baseline pain management. I've had more than my share of hours being left in pain while residents and surgeons flailed around trying to get a grip on my pain, under medicating me because they didn't understand methadone and were afraid they would kill me with more pain meds. The original doctor who put me on the methadone basically did so then left me to the wolves when hospitalized during my hysterectomy, so needless to say I fired him. My primary care doc took up the slack all these years and since I haven't needed surgery nor had any unexpected pain events or any hospital admissions, all has been well. I did consult with Sloan Kettering at one point to get taken off the methadone, and made a gallant effort at reducing my dose, but the recommended alternative medication had onerous side effects and I ended up staying with the methadone after all, and my dose has gone up over time. It is however, still pretty low, relatively speaking. Now things are changing. I started Abraxane in late last summer and since then started having chest, back, neck and rib pain. None of my MRIs pointed to any obvious cause like nerve impingement or fracture although my spinal mets are spreading. So, I've been riding along with my oncologists' speculation that the pain is due to muscle spasm secondary to the chemo. I have mets throughout my entire spine, on every vertebrae. I find it hard to believe that all that bone destruction (destruction of the vasculature of the vertebrae and vertebrae height) isn't contributing somehow to the pain, but you know the drill, if they can't see a smoking gun on the MRI, your pain is questionable and finding the source is like finding a needle in a haystack. It has been documented in my file that I have fibromyalgia, although I have none of the pressure points. That was added when I started aromatase inhibitors back in 2005 before they knew how much aromastase inhibitors contributed to arthralgias...and has not been removed. Also it has been documented that I have \"Chronic Pain Syndrome\" which is basically a way of saying it is all in my head....(never mind the extensive mets). The first thing I am going to do is finally challenge my oncologist on these \"diagnosis\" because frankly I think they are not only wrong, but creating a picture for other providers about my pain that is innacurate. Anyway, I was admitted for pain management last week. Since my oncologist does not manage my pain (due to his unfamiliarity with using methadone), I was not admitted to the oncology service, but to internal medicine.  I think the hospitalist assigned to me had the general impression that my pain was more stress and anxiety induced than related to the cancer. The documented fibromyalgia amd Chronic Pain Syndrome diagnosis probably encouraged that thinking. I did have what seemed to be the absolute worst case of torticullis I have ever endured! I could not rotate my neck and the headache was awefull! I had suferred several less severe episodes of this over the past few months but this one drove me to the ER in desperation. Being the good patient and staying with the program I agreed that my pain was definatly being created by one big nasty muscle spasm. So, I took what I was prescribed amd waited for relief. As I later learned, the hospitalist prescribed Dilaudid at a dose meant for an opiod niave patient and consequently, I got no relief. ( I have been on opiods for 8 years since my diagnosis). He continued to prescribe the dilaudid exactly in that manner despite my ongoing pain complaints that the pain was emerging an hour before my next dose of dilaudid was scheduled. Then, a CT scan of my neck revealed swelling of unkown origin around my cervicle vertebrae. I was told it could be infection (and given one IV push dose of antibiotics) or it could be bleeding. Did that change my pain medication regimine, now that a picture actually showed a source of pain? No. Instead I was switched to Oral dilauded, which as I later discovered, has a lower bioavailability than IV dilauded in a dose that was LESS THAN the IV equivalent I had been given earlier. Huh? (I have an old high school friend who does palliative care in the VA system and I ran what I was given past her and she explained to me all the errors the hospitalist made, which according to her are very common). Long story short I left the hospital AMA because I wasn't getting any help and knew if I was home I could at least get comfortable in my recliner and begin taking my hydrocodone breakthrough meds again (they had abrubtly ceased giving me that thinking the dilaudid would make up for it I guess). It was awefull and so frightening. I was so pissed at the doctor who knew I was in pain but disappeared for hours leaving me to suffer that I gave him a piece of my mind before I left. That earned me a security escort from the building...seriously...I kid you not! Oh and by the way, no one ever bothered to tell me what risks I was taking by checking myself out...they just shoved a form under my nose and said sign here. I guess I wasn't bleeding internally...I'm still here...so that is good. Mercifully the pain has decreased over the last few days to something resembling only slight discomfort and I am back in my normal pain regimine. I am having yet another MRI tommorrow. I saw a pain management doctor that my oncologist recommended but I was not pleased with him. He had only worked with 3 cancer patients in the past, his english was difficult to understand, and I felt as if he really didn't want to take me on as a patient. He spent more time explaining the pain management contract and piss test I would have to take in order for him to take me on as a patient than he did answering my questions. AND, he would not answer my questions about the inapropriateness of the hospitalist prescribing for me as f I was an opiod niave patient. I felt no trust coming my way from this guy, only his concern about covering his ass in case I was an addict, and that of the hospitalist who clearly was just practicing beyond his own experience level and should have asked for help from someone else. I will not place my trust in him to become my permanent pain management doctor. At least my primary care doctor cares (she goes above and beyond) and she has had me as a patient for 11 years. She knows who I am, and who I am not (I.e., an addict) I have bemoaned over and over again the lack of palliative care services for long term survivors in smaller communities. I know it is time to call in a heavy hitter from Sloan, Dana Farber or whatever. As much as I love my primary care doctor, there is a limit to her abilities in the pain management area and I dont want to put her in a bad position, or risk my own health by asking her to practice beyond her scope. My insurance should cover a visit to a palliative care provider outside of my area because there are none here! The problem is, I need recommendations! (My friend doesn't know anyone because she practices far away from NYS). So, if anyone has had a GOOD experience with a University or Hospital Based Palliative Care specialist (cancer pain management) within reasonable distance from upstate New York, could you PM me with their name and some background information? I can always go back to the person I saw at Sloan years ago but truth be told she didn't WOW me, so any recommendations anyone might have would help. PLEASE PM me the names though....I don't think we are supposed to do that in open threads! I am considering asking to be titrated off the methadone entirely onto a drug more doctors are familiar with (side effects be damned), so that I can get off this roller coster until I am in the hands of Hospice, who will know what they are doing.

Just be sure whoever is prescribing the pain meds for you is notified if you are to be hospitalized so they can call the shots for you on your pain meds (be sure they have rights to practice at whatever hospital you use). I assume you have a real pain management doc or your oncologist is managing your pain. I take a lot less methadone than you...15 mg in AM, 15 mg in PM, with hydrocodone for breakthrough. This has just not been cutting it lately when the \"spasms\" come up. Hopefully that is all it will turn out to be, although the swelling around my spinal chord has yet to be explained...I ended up having the MRI today so we'll see. I spoke to my radiation oncologist briefly before the MRI today and he seems to think there is more to it than that, and it might be time for some more radiation. Yuk. I looked at the disc for the MRI after I was done and from my very inexperienced perspective, I would say he may be right. C4 looks awefully close to pressing on my spinal canal, closer than on the last MRI of only 4 weeks ago. Holy crap, what a mess! Every time I see my MRI I get more and more infuriated that anyone insinuates my pain isn't real! Fibromyalgia and Chronic Pain Syndrome my ass! Maybe I should start carrying the images around on my cell phone! Is that possible? My problem is there are  so far no competent pain specialists here that I would entrust with my overall pain management while on methadone, and my oncologist is not familiar with prescribing it. My primary care doc is so caring and has been by my side through all this come hell or high water. She is really the only doctor I have who I completely trust, who knows me really well. She treats most of my family and knows where all the skeletons are buried, understands the sources of my stress and anxiety, and knows I am no complainer and will put up with a lot of pain before asking for a dose increase (I actually hate pain medication).  It's going to be hard to trust someone else with managing my pain. I knew this day would come but sort of dragged my feet finding someone who could take up when my primary was getting out of her league. I had a fallback at one local hospital as the in house pharmacist was always available to jump in and help, so I had what turned out to be a false sense of security with that. My oncologist now no longer rounds at that hospital so now I have to go to another one where I have no such connection. I was just beginning to look for alternative providers when this bit me in the ass. I had hoped the guy my oncologist referred me to would work out, but I'm just not comfortable with him. I really want someone who has worked with cancer patients before on a regular basis. I have no problem with the speeches and urine tests. I have proven to my PC that I am a reliable patient with such meds for the last seven years, but if they want me to pee in a cup, so be it. But, I have to be able to communicate clearly with whoever I pick and feel like he/she cares and will be in for the long haul, you know? The guy I just saw will be ok in a pinch if I am hospitalized again, he practices at the hospital where my oncology group does admits, so at least know I know if all else fails I can ask for him (he said) if admitted again. However, I want to find someone who will work with me on an outpatient basis too, will take the time to get to know me and not treat me like just another bean in the machine. My friend that practices Palliative Care out West counseled me to get off the methadone given the circumstances and maybe try oxycontin again. I should need much less than when I originally tried it and it made me sick, I had a tumor pressing on my spinal chord back then which has since been ablated with radiation. Anyway, what I mean by my location is I live in upstate NY but could travel to NYC, Boston, (yes on Syracuse) or pretty much any place in New York State or Massachusetts. NYCChutzpah.....who do you use? New York City would probably be the easiest for me as I could take Amtrack and have possible places to crash overnight if needed. Boston same thing. I would also consider Syracuse, although that means driving. The ideal situation would be to hook up with a palliative care specialist that would be willing to get me off the methadone either at their facility or by working with my primary care doc or oncologist, and then consult with same on an ongoing basis oncr I have a new pain management plan using medications everyone is familiar with! Thanks for your help! DG",

NONE of this would be possible without what we have learned from fighting HIV! HIV is not, nor I doubt will it ever be a \"curable\" disease as it mutates quickly. However, today a person (not all) can live a full lifespan with HIV as a chronic disease. I lost many, many friends during the 80's and 90's to HIV/AIDS, so many good people died young as a result of inaction and ignorance. Once the attention and money were directed appropriately, the progress that was made treating a disease that was an automatic death sentence back then is remarkable. Who is to say that this kind of progress can not be made with metastatic cancer? Of course, we have to be SEEN first. The time has come for us. Silence = Death DG",

My problem is, I try to exercise and I get out of breath and get tremendous hot flashes any time I do anything that requires exertion. I can walk distances, but can not run in any way shape or form. I can't walk the treadmill with an incline because I get a hot flash, and then get out of breath. Pretty much, I can't exercise vigorously without getting hot flashes and getting out of breath. I've been tested up the wazu as I believe this is more than just deconditioning from being sick. The pulmonology/cardiology stress test showed I have a low ventilatory reserve and the doctor who analyzed the test suggested that I might have peripheral vascular disease. My lungs are clear except for some ateleclatsis (closed off spaces in the bottom of my lungs). The pulmonologist says the lung issue wouldn't cause my problem. She ran bloodwork to rule out autoimmune causes of vascular disease and everything came up roses. Despite the suggestion that there may be peripheral vascular disease (on the part of the doctor who ran the test) the consensus of my other docs is simply that I am deconditioned. They don't really see the need for further testing (although my GP, who is a doll, has referred me to a vascular specialist for my peace of mind). Has anyone experienced similar symptoms (i.e., extreme hot flashes and breathlessness upon exertion)? The two come hand in hand, always.  Any input would be appreciated.

My cardiologist says my heart is OK, no damage from the avastin. I thought of that too. I also wondered if the avastin could cause peripheral vascular damage given that it targets endothelial growth factor, but I am told there is no evidence of that anywhere in the literature or research. Might I ask, how was your wife's heart damage discovered? I wonder because I don't know I could still have some damage even though my tests are coming up OK. I finished the taxol/avastin in July 2006 so I would think if my heart was damaged it would be apparent by now, I don't know. Any thoughts you want to share would be appreciated. I have some background in medicine and know that everyone's body is different. Two brains are better than one though! Thanks",

I have had spinal mets so I'm not so flexible as to be able to do yoga! I can't even sit on the floor comfortably! But the pool is good. I just wish I could do more, you know, ride my bike, take a hike, play with my neices. The hot flashes and breathlessness are so debilitating. I still find it hard to believe that it is simple deconditioning and estrogen imbalance that are causing such severe symptoms. Maybe so. Geez, I can't imagine biking that far while undergoing treatment! You must have been in good shape when you were diagnosed. Unfortunately, I did kind of let myself go. I was always a skinny minny so I never worried about my weight. Since I worked full time and went to school at night there was little time for working out. I did walk a lot since I worked at a school as a teaching assistant and was always on my feet. I don't feel I was in that bad of shape, but maybe I was. thanks for your input and support!",

Anyway, bone mets are very responsive to radiation and/or chemo. I was diagnosed with bone mets 3 years ago, had radiation and chemo and have been NED since my treatment ended in July 2006. (I am on Femara and Zometa) The good news is there is a family of drugs called biophosphonates (i.e., Zometa) that can replace the damaged bone and prevent further mets from develping in the bone. So, there's good news with the bad news. Your MRI or bone scan will show the extent of your bone mets and will determine how it is treated. In the meantime, make sure the doc manages your pain well. Don't put up with being in pain! It is unnecessary! See a pain specialist if you feel like your doc isn't making you comfortable. Most likely, the pain will subside quite quickly if you have radiation...not to worry...it works REALLY fast! The radiation makes you pretty tired, but it's not so bad as far as side effects goes (in my experience with radiation to spine). Bone mets can cause some pretty serious damage if it is extensive, but it sounds like you had your BC diagnosis before your mets so the doc probably caught it early on. You would be in a boatload of pain if it were extensive (i.e., tumors pressing on your spinal cord). Be pro-active. Ask to look at your films so you know where the tumors are. That will help you since as we age, we do get little aches and pains that aren't necessarily indiciative of further or new mets!  Good luck!   ",

      "Content": "Oct 18, 2013 11:33PM DragonGirl wrote: Hi rangermom,  I would take the MRI encouraging news, but as always, with a grain of salt. Usually a cyst is basically a thin wall with nothing in the middle (imagine an oval shape white on the perimeter but black inside...or visa versa depending on the imaging sequence used), whereas a tumor would show up as a solid colored mass. They look very different.  What the other sentence translates to is that there is a spot where there is what looks like two separate cysts sitting right next to each other (imagine two empty ovals with the long sides of the perimeters touching). The points where the two perimeters touch may just be that, the spots where two cysts touch each other. OR there is only one spot \"focus\" there with a line that goes through the middle (one oval with a line through the middle \"septation\"). If it is the latter case, then that spot MAY not be two cysts next to eachother but, somethinng else, since there is dense tissue running through the middle of it. However, I think most tumors appear as a solid mass, perhaps not uniform in density all throughout, but fairly solid.  (The walls of a cyst, the perimeter, are denser as they are made up of tissue, whereas the intererior of a cyst is filled with fluid which is less dense than tissue.) I hope this helps you see it. A question I would have for the oncologist is if it is common for women of your age to have liver cysts? (Nothing personal about your age.) I know that the older we get, the more likely we are to develop things like cysts in our kidneys, so maybe it is the same in the liver? Did you ask the oncologist about doing a biopsy on the liver \"cysts\". Of course,  biopsies where there are multiple foci can be problematic. Which foci do you biopsy? Will the one you biopsy reflect the status of the others? Some parts of the liver are near important veins and can be dangerous to biopsy. The bottom line about choosing to do a biopsy is what information you expect to get from it. There are two reason why you would do one (if the foci looked like tumors, which yours apparently don't). First would be to determine IF there is any cancer, as just because there is a solid mass doesnt mean for sure it is cancer. Second would be to determine the pathology of the cancer (is it still the same as your primary tumor?) Yes, sometimes metastatic tumors CAN have a different for pathology than the primary tumor, which can be informative for treatment choices. Your foci don't sound like they look like tumors much, although the one referenced in the anterior right lobe (front right lobe of liver) is questionable. If you have more than three adjacent foci (FYI) even if they look like tumors generally those are not surgically removed. Sometimes when you have three or less, some oncologists are doing surgery to remove such liver tumors for MBC. I think it is definitely worth having the conversation with your oncologist about why or why not do a biopsy or PET scan so you understand why he has made the decision he has. I hope this information helps you in that conversation.  It is a sticky whicket of a situation. FYI, I have rib pain in all sorts of spots where I do not have metastasis, and have had it for years as well. There are nerves that run along the ribs (intercostals) that can be irritated by all sorts of things, back problems, muscle spasms and so on. Your spinal mets, even if they are old and not active, could at any time be the cause of such pain. Since your spine is full o mets (as is mine) it is somewhat unstable and with any movement you can have a nerve pinched...stay like that for months and then suddenly resolve as quickly as it came on, or stay pinched. Your muscles are doing the work of stabelizing your body that your spine would be doing if it weren't swiss chesse. So, you are no doubt are prone to muscle spasms, in fact so used to them that you barely notice most, and probably live in a persistent state of spasms that come and go. Have you tried lidoderm patches for your rib pain? I recommend them. This can all be so confusing when our spines are so screwed up! The nerves start there and run all over the place so you can have pain in the weirdest places that is originating from your spine! Right now my whole right rib cage is killing me, but no broken ribs and a clear chest xray, plus no evidence of chord compression on recent Thoracic MRI! I swear it started when I got the damn flu shot last week! Or maybe it was thge lawn chair I heaved into the shed last week with my right arm trying to get it as far in the back as possible. Oops! Anyway, glad the reunion worked out. I know you are exasperated. Me too! Call the oncologist armed with whatever advice you glean!  Good luck! DG",

Regardless of what stage this woman was diagnosed at, we really should not expect much from her at this point. I can say that prior to my diagnosis, I was as ignorant about BC as the next person. It took me a while to educate myself properly. She deserves as much credit if not more for doing that live as the next person, even though the message wasn't complete. Some women are so afraid of mammograms they don't get them. It sounds so infantile and stupid to US, but it exists, and the story may have convinced such a woman to get tested.

As a \"reporter\" one would have hoped she did a better job with her research and presentation, but she is no more guilty than the next person of getting in over her head. Unfortunately, Komen and the pink is where folks go for information and THEY continue to fail to modify their message. A new SOURCE had to be established that provides the right information and message. For that, more money and corporate support are required.

Now I have a new liver mets that is triple negative. This sucks as I was on Halavan and it was doing a good job with the bone mets, but the liver lesion popped up while on that treatment. Surgical removal is not an option for the liver lesion per my onc \"it will just come back.\" So, I'm moving on to Gemzar (I guess he doesn't want to slam me with carboplatin too yet, which I am ok with, I'd like to be able to function somewhat this summer.)  I'm new to this triple negative game and don't know much about treatment when two different subtypes of BC are active concurrently. I'd appreciate any advice about approved treatments, side effects,.etc. I know this doesn't bode well for me and my time is winding down, and that's ok. I just want to be sure I know all my options and maybe talk with someone who has been in the same boat! I know basically that there has been some success with combinations with Carboplatins and even Avastin of late (although I don't think one can get Avastin unless you are in a clinical trial.  I think the same goes for the Parp inhibitors.) So, are carboplatin combos really the only readily available approved options unless I look at clinical trials? I am considering a trip to my guy at Sloan Kettering for a second opinion but hearing from you all is often helpful too. I definately don't want to flog myself with poison and will call it quits with treatment before I become too sick or dependent. Quality time over quantity and all that. On another note, it looks like my left hip socket is toast, or perhaps close to it. I saw a bunch of bone spurs on the xray (the only test done so far and my onc has yet to call me with the results....the tech just let me look...no fractures that I could see). Anyway, I'm assuming I am not a candidate for any kind of reparative surgery, so, any advice on how to maintain my mobility would be appeciated (I can't use crutches because they send my neck off into wicked spasms). Any suggestions on inexpensive light scooters? I know Medicare/Medicaid only pays for electric wheelchairs for in home daily use. Thanks ladies!

      "Content": "Oct 14, 2009 12:51PM - edited Oct 14, 2009 01:10PM by DragonGirl Hello Hannah, It's been a while since I've visited here...I'm 43 and was diagnosed with Stage IV mets extensively to spine and ribs at age 39. Just so you know where I'm coming from, I tried Tamoxifen, it didn't work, which I knew within a month because my back pain got progressively worse. I was then given Avastin/Taxol (a kind of chemo) and went into complete remission within 6 months. My mets were pretty extensive and was about to damage my spinal cord, also it was very painful. That is why I had radiation immediatley. It eased the pain incredibly quickly, although not entirely. It sounds like your mom's pain is not too bad (which is probably why they are not putting her through radiation for the mets). Radiation is incredibly tiring so it's a good thing if she can do without. The Femara, if it is a good drug for her, can knock that mets out of her bones just as well as radiation. However, radiation is usually available as an alternative to treat the pain so tell your mom to keep that in mind. As my oncologist told me, they don't give out any medals for being a hero when it comes to pain! I've been on Femara for four years with no new disease. So, the good news here is Femara can be a wonderfully effective drug. First off, as far as your mom's fatigue goes, she's going to be tired simply by virtue of the fact that her body is fighting cancer. It is to be expected, but does get better as you get better. Femara is notorious for causing fatigue as well however, so that may be playing a part. Also, Zometa causes fatigue the first few days after you get your infusion. Then there's the fatigue from the emotional turmoil of getting a cancer diagnosis, which alone can knock you off your feet. Tell mom it's going to take quite a while for her to start getting her zip back and not to rush herself. By quite a while I mean at least a few months, OK? Encourage her to ask for help and respect her body when it tells her she needs to rest. My mom also got cancer (after I did) although not stage IV, when she was in her mid 70s. She was very active (golf and so on) but her treatment brought her to a grinding halt for about six months. She's back on the golf course now though. She tires a little more easily but that could be attributed to her age alone! In addition to fatigue, in SOME patients both Zometa and Femara can cause increased bone pain, muscle and joint aches. This can make interpreting your mother's pain confusing so you should be aware of this. They used to say that the fatigue and bone pain from Zometa usually eased within the week after you get your treatment, but there is new evidence based on a recent FDA update on the drug that these side effects can persist longer than that, FYI. You should pull up the manufacturer's information on side effects from the internet for your reference on both drugs. Don't panic now, as time goes on your mom will begin to learn how the drugs effect her and what is usual and unusual pain or other side effects. It's just hard it first. I would say for now if she has any new pain at all or unusual symptoms she should err on the side of caution and contact the doctor by phone to ask whether she needs to be seen.It might be hard at first to tell whether new symptoms should be attributed to the cancer spreading, or to the treatments to stop the cancer. Given that, don't worry about calling too much. The doctors know the first few months in your mom's situation can be very scary and a bit of reassurance from the doc goes a long way when every little ache and pain worries you. Your mom is no spring chicken so she's going to have aches and pains that just come with life too you know. In this situation it will be easy for her to be frightened by things that normally would not worry her. Getting the advice of the doctor by phone can go a long way toward easing the anxiety that comes with learning to live in your \"new body\" with your new meds on board. One word of caution here, your mom's bones may be more prone to fracture now so she should be extra careful to not do things that might cause her to fall. Hannah, everyone's experience with breast cancer and all of these drugs is different, so it is really hard to tell  based on someone else's experience how your mom's body will react. Breast cancer is not just one disease, there are all sorts of kinds of breast cancer and all sorts of kinds of breast cancer cells, which is why it is so difficult to treat, and why everyone's body reacts differently to treatments. What works for one may do nothing for another and visa versa. Please let your mom know this so she understands as time goes on that if one drug does not work as quickly as she might hope, it doesn't mean it won't....and if it doesn't end up working, there is always another one out there to try!  There is no one \"cure\" for cancer, each person has their own particular \"cure\" or treatment that may work. Your mom's diagnosis is by no means a death sentance! The fact that the mets is confined to her bones is really good news (in a weird sort of way) because bone mets can be managed much easier than mets to organs. New drugs are coming out quickly and as someone else metioned in a post, breast cancer can be treated as a chronic disease for sometimes very long periods of time even at Stage IV. Generally, 23 days is a pretty short period of time to be able to tell if a drug is working. If her pain was getting worse, as mine did within the first month of my diagnosis and tamoxifen treatment, I would say she should get and MRI again to see if the mets is spreading. Since your mom's pain is stable or getting better, that is a good sign. It may take a few months though to tell for sure if the drug is doing it's thing. More than likely her doctor will watch and wait for about three months before doing a PET scan to see what's going on. You are correct in that the MRI and CT scans when read by a qualified radiologist can be very useful for surveillance, however with bone mets it's sometimes hard to tell from these scans what is a healed lesion and what is not. A PET scan can tell the difference because it \"lights up\" live (not destroyed by treatment) active cancer cells. Basically, your mom drinks some contrast and is injected with radioactive sugar. Live active cancer cells take up sugar at higher rates than normal cells. Dead ones don't take it up at all, as they are dead and don't need the glucose. So, the live cancer cells \"light up\" as the radioactive sugar travels through her body during the scan. Most PET scanners now simultaneously do a CT scan, which helps the radiologist in seeing more cleary where tumors that are active are located. (So don't be confused if you hear the word CT scan being said when she gets a PET scan). As I said before though, the doctor might use an MRI or CT scan to take a look at a specific area if your mom feels some pain there to assess disease progression, rather than going right to a PET scan. The MRI will see new lesions on her spine or other bones fine since she is so early in her diagnosis. It is with time that this test becomes a little less reliable in detecting new vs. old lesions.  Here's some questions your mom and you should talk to the doctor about in addition to the ones you asked here (always ask your doctor the same things you ask on the boards....no one here is a doctor): 1. If your mom has not had a mastectomy yet (I didn't have mine until a year after my diagnosis) what's the plan for that? I didn't have mine immediately because since the cancer had already spread, getting the systemic cancer under control was the priority. I had it later as a preventative measure as the chance of re-occurance in that breast was higher. That was my choice however, they don't necessarily \"have to\" take the breast in a Stage IV circumstance. 2. Ask the doctor to talk with your mom about the side effects of the drugs she's on in detail. Also, ask him to explain about the potential for osteonecrosis of the jaw since she is taking Zometa. (Her dentist should know she is on Zometa and be educated about how that will effect her dental care in the future. In RARE cases, patients taking biophosphonates like Zometa can develop osteonecrosis of the jaw either spontaneously or as a result of invasive proceedures). 3. Make sure the doctor is on top of your mom's pain. Believe it or not some oncologists under-treat pain and if your mom is not a complainer, she may be unnecessarily suffering. 4. I'm assuming your mom is done with menopause, but if there is ANY question as to her status with that it should be discussed as many breast cancer tumors are fed by estrogen/progesterone. 5. Ask the doctor about genetic testing. As of now, there are tests to detect two breast cancer genes which your mom might carry which MAY have been passed on to you or the male children in your family. Note that having these genes doesn't necessarily mean you will get cancer. You should get informed about these genes and the pros and cons of getting this kind of genetic testing. I would recommed consulting a specialist in this area for a good explanation, you don't have to get the test just because you get the consult. (Note that these genes are relatively rare, many breast cancer survivors do not carry them.) 6. Ask the doctor about what kind of surveillance he plans to arrange for on your mother's breast(s). Alternating MRI's with mammograms every six months was the rule until recently even with stage IV breast cancer survivors as second breast cancers can develop in the same or opposite breast. Things change rapidy though, recently my docs advised that mammos every 6 months was sufficient for me. As the daughter of a breast cancer survivor, talk to your own doctor about what kind of surveillance is appropriate for you. This will depend on your full family medical history. 7. Ask your doctor about the availability of counseling services in your area for you, your mom and your family. Your mom may need someone to talk to that is not part of the family, as may you or anyone else in the family. The emotional aspects of a breast cancer diagnosis are really important to quality of life for everyone and should not be ignored. It's hard and counseling can help! Also ask about support services in the area. 8. Make sure at some point, not necessarily now, your mom has an opportunity to discuss her wishes with her doctor about her treatment choices now and if the disease should progress. It's important she has a doctor who understands her feelings about pain, nausea and other drug side effects. Some of us are more tolerant of certain things than others. It's better to talk about this (when things settle down) rather than during a crisis situation, especially if you have specific fears. I say this because, for example, I am particularly intolerant of nausea since I have a pre-exisiting gastrointestinal problem. Nausea scares me a lot, and my doctor know this and acts accordingly. It seems like something small, but to me it's not. Knowing he understands my fears makes me less anxious. 9. This is not for the doctor....as soon as it is emotionally possible for your mom and the family, make sure she gets her affairs in order i.e., has appointed a health care proxy, has signed a living will, signed a power of attorney should she be unable to manager her financial affairs, and executes a will. (A living will and a Will are two different things). Also, I believe there is a separate form you have to sign for Medicare (in addition to a power of attorney) to get access to your mom's medicare information. Find out about this. Get it all out of the way ASAP. It's a hard process but you don't want to have to worry about these things not being done. Make sure all her doctor's have a copy of her health care proxy. I'm not saying this to be negative, just to be practical. There MAY be times during your mom's treatment when she'll need to depend on you to manage her day to day financial or medical affairs for her. The new HIPPA laws are very stringent and you don't want to have to be arguing with some clerk about whether or not you can have a copy of her medical records when you are taking her to a new doc or something. The damn cable company won't tell you the time of day about her account without authorization! Seriously! Oh yeah, type an emergency medication and contact list to put in her wallet. This is really usefull to have when she goes to the doctor. Keep it updated so if she goes to an appointment without you all she has to do is pull it out and give it to the secretary to copy. Keep one in your wallet too. (I look after my parents and know how important it is to get all this done from experience!)  The hardest part about a stage IV cancer diagnosis is learning to live in today, rather than consume your time with worring about tomorrow. Mom can't control tomorrow and neither can you, so you should both make a conscious point of reminding yourself every day to stay in that day. It will help keep you sane. This is probably the most important thing I have said! Be sure to pass it on to your mom...print it on a card, make a poster...really, it helps.  You and your mom will be in my prayers. As frightened as you both are, believe it or not there can be good things that come from this if you keep yourself open to them. I know this both as a breast cancer survivor, and the daughter of one.  Good luck!",

As Chickadee said, everything your onc is doing is reasonable, the situation just sucks. The Aromasin is a good idea in any event as recent studies have shown that taking Aromasin beyond the old standard of five years from diagnosis is a helpful preventative measure against recurrence. It is also one of the first of the line drugs you would be given if you had metastatic BC that was hormone positive. Your situation is so difficult given your tumor markers and the first PET results, I know. It is the not knowing, learning to manage day to day with the unknown hanging out there, that is the biggest adjustment you will have to make. I know it seems impossible right now, but it can be done! Many of us here have become quite adept at waiting the usually standard three months for a PET scan to see if there has been any progression in our disease. That however, comes from years of experience with the disease. Your anxiety is a completely normal response, and it is very hard to deal with without any tools for coping with it. I am so glad you have decided to seek help from a psychiatrist! Certainly some kind of anti-anxilotic medication might help. Definitely ask about that when you see the psychiatrist. Also, I recommend you ask for the name of a competent therapist to see, that has previous experience with cancer patients. Behavioral therapy specifically is incredibly helpful because it will provide you with some tools you will need to manage the anxiety (and depression, if you are experiencing that). I think you would find it helpful not only for managing this crisis, but for living your life in general! There are some simple things you can do to make all this easier, like getting some exercise, eating well and getting good sleep. The way I manage my anxiety (along with medication and therapy) is to figure out every day when I wake up, what I have control over, and what I do not. I address the things I can control (like diet, exercise and so on). I try to recognize the things I cant control (like what my next PET scan will reveal) and if I catch myself dwelling on such things I redirect myself, my thinking, to something more productive and healthy for me. It is absolutely not as easy as it sounds, but with the help of a therapist I have learned how to do this, not all of the time, but enough to keep my head affixed to my body and go about my daily business, and try to enjoy my life. I can definitely say learning how to do this has enriched my life overall, and it is the one silver lining that cancer has had to offer me. I appreciate the small things more, and take less for granted, without necessarily dwelling on my cancer while I am doing it. Right now I know you are in a sort of hazy, fuzzy state, which we've all been through. It is very hard, but it does get better, I promise...and I never promise anything that I don't know is true. Get yourself to the psychiatrist to get some medication to peel you off the ceiling, that is your mission right now, nothing else. One day at a time. Set realistic goals for the day....if you don't get it all done, well then you are learning what your new limits are. Accepting those limits sucks, but is a necessary evil. You may find the Aromasin makes you tired, or cranky, or gives you some muscle aches and pains. This is normal. Most people get these side effects to some degree or another, but you are unique, so don't compare your experience to anyone else's, OK? You may be lucky and feel nothing (my sister has NO side effects on Aromasin, the lucky bugger), so just see how it goes. We are all here to help see you through. DG",

This will spell out the exact details of when they will pay and what evidence they require to issue benefits. Do not assume that they will not pay unless something reads \"metastatic breast cancer.\" (My first question was, what kind of cancer insurance policy only pays when the cancer is metastatic or \"terminal\". Sounds fishy to me.) Anyway, beware that the insurer representatives are not your friend! They may try to stall you on issuing benefits by taking advantage of your lack of knowledge about the disease, and even lie about the specific terms if the contract policy. You MUST get a copy if the CONTRACT, not just the summary upon which you based your decision to buy the policy. Insurers are legally obliged to provide you with a copy of the full contract in which the terms and conditions of the contract are spelled out. Write a letter to them requesting a copy. If they do not respond immediately, contact your State's Insurance Regulatory Agency immediately and complain. If they send you a refusal letter, send a copy of it to the Agency with your complaint letter. Metastatic Breast Cancer is diagnosed (confirmed) in many ways, not just by a positive biopsy for BC in a distant site from the breast. As you said, some sites can not be biopsied safely. This does not mean you do not have metastatic breast cancer. There are standards for diagnosis that exist and the contract hopefully references these standards correctly. If not, the insurer may be violating State and Federal Law. Let's hope not. I have found that the representatives that answer phones for insurers know little about what a policy contract actually says. I am aware that in some cases, these representatives can purposefully deceive you about the terms of the policy in order to prevent you from collecting benefits. So, stop screwing around with the little people and get a copy of the contract!! YOU must be your own advocate! If you know any lawyers, having them review the policy contract with you would help. I respectfully disagree that your reports would have to change from \"suspicious for metastasis\" to \"metastatic breast cancer.\" Some of my more recent reports have read \"suspicious\" simply because the radiologist didn't know my history, didn't know their were earlier images to compare ccurrent images to, and all sorts of other stupid reasons!! Also, there are commonly referenced standards for a MBC diagnosis that all physicians use, as well as reputable insurers, that do not include a positive biopsy or MRI etc reading \"metastatic BC.\" It's all in the details, so get educated and get a copy of the details. Sorry you have to go through all this, but welcome to the fray....half the battle is becoming educated enough so that you get the treatment AND the benefits you need and deserve. Hang in there! DG",

However, I have found that it is very help full in treating the anxiety/depression that often comes with this diagnosis. Do not be afraid to take it. I have never had any side effects from it, I doubt you will find many women who would say they did. Post traumatic stress is a serious problem and you absolutely need to do address it, and the medication WILL help you. I have also used Ativan in the past (when initially diagnosed) for the kind of extreme anxiety you are experiencing now. It will also be helpful, so use it! Just be careful to get used to how the drugs effect you as everyone has a different sensitivity level to these drugs. You shouldn't be driving on the Ativan, as it will make you sleepy. If you need something you can use during the day when you want to get around and drive, and the ativan sedates you, ask for the xanax. I now use xanax ocassionally for anxiety, but through working with a therapist I have learned other ways to cope with my anxiety. Xanax is a less strong drug, and is meant to treat shorter boughts of anxiety (panic attacks or just short anxiety attacks during anticipated stressfull situations). What you are going through is absolutely to be expected, so please do take the advice of the psychiatrist and stay in close touch with him/her as to how you are responding to the medications. It is SOOOO common in the beginning to worry that every ache and pain is the mets, as I think I told you. The Aromasin alone can cause more aches and pains than the mets itself! Try to remember that. If you need pain medication to treat the Aromasin induced pain/aches, ask for it. These days it is commonly known that aromatase inhibitors like Aromasin can cause some women serious aches and pains. They don't give out any gold medals for \"sticking it out\", if you are in pain ask for help. You WILL over time, learn to distinguish between what pain/aches the Aromasin is causing and what pain is new or unusual, which COULD possibly be mets. Keeping a journal of your pain levels during the day and after certain activities (which are bound to increase your pain but may not mean it is your mets causing it, can help). Try to stay active. When you wake up in the morning you will probably feel achy and have a bit of pain, and not feel like getting out of bed. The best thing you can do is GET UP! Once you start moving around you will feel better. Trying to stay active will actually help minimize your pain by keeping you stretched out and limber, just be careful as instructed by your doctor. Ask for specific do's and don't, based in where your mets are and how they may have weakened your bones. Try not to overprotect yourself. I can tell you I have mets in EVERY vertebrae in my spine, my hips and ribs, but still get around just fine. I have to be careful about lifting or doing any impact type sports....but that is it! You'd be surprised how much metastatic burden in your spine you could have and still be active! As far as the PET scans go, the insurance company should not be giving you any problems, because the PET scans (or bone scans/MRIs) are used to \"stage \" your disease....\"not as in what stage are you?\" But as in \"have you had any progression?\" Your tumor markers are pretty much irrelevant when it comes to using those to support or oppose a scan. It is absolutely necessary for you to have repeat scans at regular intervals. Different doctors use different scans, but generally a PET scan every 3-4 months is what you can expect as basic regular follow up. I would not worry too much about that unless your doctor has indicated it might be a problem. Each scan request is submitted to the insurance company. It takes a few days for your doctor to get a reply. Sometimes he may have to provide additional information to them to get an approval, but don't sweat that if it happens. Insurance companies have instituted new protocols recently to cut down on unnecessary imaging ordered by doctors, but when it comes to Stage IV cancer, I have not personally experienced and problems. You could ask to speak with a financial counselor at your oncologists office if you need reassurance in this. They usually know what companies give them a hard time and what companies do not. Ladies, as a reminder, if you are on Medicare the time to renew or change your plan is coming? October 15th to December 7th this years. Review your old plan for any changes, explore any new ones that might offer you better coverage with a fine tooth comb, and don't forget to call Medicare with a list of your current meds so they can match you to a Part D provider that covers what you are taking. Special Note: certain oncology medications that you may be prescribed are not covered under Part D (Medicare Prescription Drug Plan) but fall under Part B coverage. These are things like medications you take at home....pills like Xeloda and Affintor for example) and some other treatments. Ask tour MO if he anticipates the possibility that you may need to go to using one of those types of drugs in the next year, and if so try to pick a plan than will cover them under Part B. NOTE: NOT ALL Medicare plans cover cancer meds usually considered Part B treatments, so check the fine print in your policy to see that it does!! Refer to the Medicare And You Handbook you should he receiving in the mail for more explanations of how all the \"Parts\" of Medicare work! Lisajo, you probably still have insurance from your job? If not, and you are struggling with COBRA premiums or have no coverage, look into the new policies available just for individuals without insurance under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) state exchanges. The Affordable Care Act IS LAW my friends! Use the incredible opportunities it offers you to get affordable insurance if you are struggling in that area! Even though the financial consultants are actually \"forbidden\" to promote one insurance plan over another, I have found that if you quietly ask them which companies \"work and play well with oncology patients\", you can learn something from their unique experience! So, discretely ask! For clarification of the above, ...Aromasin is covered under Part D of Medicare, as are I think all of the aromatase inhibitors. It is the chemos in a pill, or infusions administered at home that fall under Part B mostly. I'm so glad to hear that I have been able to help out a few of you by sharing my insights and experiences. Just know that exactly like you, I am not always so put together! I do still struggle and have bad days, they are just fewer and further between. Anything I've learned has been through the years of work with, and benefitting from the support and encouragement I have received from my very competent therapist, and some dedicated good friends. Don't be afraid to reach out and ask for help! As Chanah pointed out, the isolation and fear combined is all our worst enemy! ;) DG",

Maybe you need a shorter acting drug (xanax) for anxiety during the day, that will not sedate you? If you are not sleeping right, that alone could be causing the confusion. Are you eating and hydrated? Low blood sugar or dehydration could be causing all those symptoms as well, especially if you are not sleeping well. You must EAT/DRINK! It seems unlikely that you would get such an immediate negative side effect to the effexor. I believe it takes more than a week for that drug to get to a constant level in your bloodstream. Normally you are started at a very low dose, and then titrated up to a \"therapeutic dose\" (a dose that will actually have an effect in your anxiety). This is done to ease any potential side effects as you get used to the drug. Really, that drug is supposed to prevent those symptoms which can be secondary to anxiety, as it inhibits your fight or flight response, which is autonomic (epinepherine/norepinepherine). However, it could be the Effexor, I haven't looked up the side effects recently. <NOTE: POST EDITED.....see post below for side effects of Effexor, which include sweating and shaking.> Try taking the Effexor in the morning after food. The shaky sweats could actually also be an exaggerated response to the Aromasin, actually a really BAD hot flash! The aromatase inhibitors mess with your body's thermo regulation system. Basically, they narrow the threshold your body originally had for tolerance of heat and cold temperatures and certain stimulants and depressants. The doctors don't know how. A warm environment, caffeine, cigarettes and anxiety can trigger a hot flash. Then.....anxiety (and pain) can feed the hot flash, making it worse. Sometimes you can get thrown into sort of a continuous loop where you get a hot flash, then you get anxious about the hot flash, then the hot flash gets worse. At times I would get shakey and get the sweats under those circumstances. It was the Effexor that made them go away ultimately. It is a drug originally designed to help with anxiety and seems to somehow also help women with hot flashes for other reasons, perhaps having to do with helping to normalize your body's ability to maintain a constant temperature and restore that thermo regulatory threshold back to normal (before you began the Aromasin (Usually any side effects of these types of drugs do pass within the first week or so.) The doctor may advise trying a lower dose....if so, give do that a shot if you are able. Try to keep a tab on when those symptoms pop up, does a hot flash preceed them? Does what you eat or the room temperature seem to cause them or make them worse? This will help you when you talk to the doctor, to differentiate what drug is really causing the symptoms. DG",

Yes, breast cancer cells can change characteristics, like hormone receptivity, but if that happens, the tumors with different characteristics are not considered another NEW cancer. What MAY have happened is the breast cancer cells that escaped (perhaps from your tram flap) underwent genetic mutations over time that induced changes in the characteristics of the cancer cells that eventually found their way to your groin. Then again, the biopsy may reveal cancer cells that have the same characteristics (did not undergo genetic mutation) as your original tumors. (OR, there is no cancer there at all, the biopsy will tell the tale.) Any cancer cells found in your groin are absolutely more likely to be related to, and come from, your primary cancer. So, the biopsy is done to see first if there IS cancer, then they do a pathology test to see if those cancer cells are any different than your original tumor. This will help guide what treatment you would get, targeting exactly what type of breast cancer cells are now in your body. It is sort if like the AIDS virus. It took years for treatments to be developed because the virus would constantly mutate in order to continue living...to escape the traps of the current antivirals. Smart little suckers those virus cells. The same goes with some infections. There are now antibiotic resistant strains of infections (MRSA) because as a culture antibiotics were overused. The smart little bacterial cells mutated so they could slip past the antibiotic treatments we have and continue to live and reproduce. Breast cancer cells are smart to. They mutate in order to continue to survive and reproduce. Actually, the ability of breast cancer cells to do this was only recognized within the past few years. So, whenever a recurrence occurs, you may have a biopsy to keep track of what mutations may have ocurred over time, if any. (Except in your spine....those kind of biopsies are hard to do, so less frequently done.) Anyway, so stop worrying that you have contracted \"another cancer\" as this is not true (unless the groin biopsy results reveal that, but that would sort if be like lightening striking twice...it happens, but not often). I really urge you to do some reading to help you educate yourself about all this stuff. It will save you a lot if misspent anxiety created because your doctor I think is assuming you know more than you do! Start with the Diagnosing, Staging and Treatment pages provided on the home page of this website. Also, go to the NIH (National Institute of Health) webpage and put \"Breast Cancer\" in the search box. This website has very thorough information that isn't too overcomplicated, with some great little animations that help you SEE and understand what is going on in your body. I'm concerned that your lack of knowledge about the disease is creating a situation where you are getting more anxious than absolutely necessary. Knowledge is power, and the more you know, the more empowered you will feel. I know some people are intimidated by the science, and some would just rather let the doctor guide them and not ask questions, but when anxiety is being created because of lack of information, knowledge is the tool to put that in check. Doctors talk fast and sometimes assume we know more than we actually do. It is sad, but true. So, also do a few things to help yourself: Write down your questions when the arise (keep a running notebook laying around the house for these, it's easy to forget things). Before you go to the doctor, read your last set of questions. (What I do is write a question and then leave several lines of space after it to use to write down the doctor's answer when I get there.) Use your list if questions to guide your conversation with the doctor. Don't leave until you've asked and had answered everything you wanted to. Advise your doctor this is the new way you want to try to conduct your appointments, so you don't forget what to ask, and what the answer was. Don't be afraid to ask for more lengthy explanations if you are confused, or ask him/her to re-explain something. It's your dine and they work for you, Ask for any good reference material the doctor might have. The drug companies often provide little pamphlets that explain how their drugs works. Also, the oncology offices sometimes have written material that can be useful. Reach out to then American Cancer society for support and information. Use the internet, but carefully! There is a lot of misinformation and horror stories out there. This website provides great, reliable information, as does the NIH website. (Ladies, add your references for resources if you have them). I ask for a copy of the report for all my test results. I keep a binder of them. This helps me get information to other doctors, and allows he to go back and read the report if I forget something. They are not that hard to understand.....you can look up medical terms online or, as I do, go over the report line by line with my doctor. Bring a buddy with you to your appointments to help keep you on track with your questions and write down the answers for you, so you can focus on the conversation at hand. I know it is work, and it is intimidating, but I think you may find it helps.",

As your treatment continues, you may start to become more familiar with some patterns in your pain, and be able to differentiate what is the cause. But, the best policy is to always talk to your doctor if you are unsure, if only to resolve any anxiety you might be having about your pain. The anxiety can be worse than the pain, so don't try to be a hero and \"wait it out.\" Trust me on this one....it's not worth it, trying to play the stoic hero. One of my oncologists once told me \"we don't give out any medals for tolerating pain\", best words of advice I ever got! Hang in there! DG",

      "Content": "Aug 24, 2013 02:16PM - edited Aug 24, 2013 02:50PM by DragonGirl Lisa, I think you need to slow down and take a breath. You have a lot of questions and you are frightened. First, I think you should go ahead and call your oncologist to ask these questions rather than sit around wondering and letting your anxiety build. Tell the nurse what is going on, how frightened you are, and confused, and ask to speak to your oncologist ASAP. Don't be shy, just lay it out there so the nurse knows to get the doctor to call you (not have the nurse call you back with answers). Make a list of all your questions to help you remember to cover everything during the conversation with the doctor. I will attempt to respond to a few of your questions. These answers are based on my understanding, as an 8 year MBC survivor, but I am not a doctor, so do call yours. An increase in your tumor markers is of course, reason for concern and further testing, which you have had. However, there is no level of tumor marker than denotes ANY change in stage of cancer. Consequently, NO, the fact that your markers are that high does not automatically mean you are stage IV. In fact, there is still a lot of controversy within the medical community about the helpfulness of tumor markers in making diagnostic or treatment related decisions. I myself have NO tumor markers, never had, so they mean nothing in relation to the progress of my disease, and this is not uncommon. Each test you have had is done for a particular reason. I must say, that your oncologist is being extremely thorough, which is GREAT news for you. Each test you have had tells the doctor more. Bone scans, for example, can be more accurate sometimes in revealing bone metastasis than PET scans, but less diagnostically relevant to diagnosing organ metastasis. PET scans are a good, all purpose tool to look for metastasis in all places, but as I indicated before, some doctors/radiologists prefer bone scans to rule in or out bone disease specifically. PET scans are NOT always 100% reliable in diagnosing metastasis. Sometimes, things can light up that are NOT cancer. For example, muscles that have been recently overused or damaged (like a strain) can light up on a PET scan. Also, bones broken in the past can light up consistently on PET scans but not do not have cancer in them. (I have a rib that I broke years ago that always lights up on my PET scans.) Sometimes even spots on organs can light up, but are not cancerous. (That is why a biopsy is done ultimately on any spots that light up if there may be doubts whether they are cancerous or not.) The doctor looks at ALL the information given, tumor markers, various scans, and biopsies, as well as past history and then tries to put together a picture of what is going on. They rely on the radiologists to help them in doing this. It's all about the BIG PICTURE, especially for someone like you with your test results and history. For those of us that are already diagnosed at stage IV, a lot of assumptions are made about certain test results (that something is cancer) that would not be made for someone like you. Once the horse is out of the barn, so to speak, if it looks like cancer, smells like cancer and so on.....you get the gist. This is not so in your situation. So, having said that, I can comment on your situation as follows: Apparently the areas of concern seem to be the increase in tumor markers, and the level of FDG uptake (the radioactive suger they inject in you when you have a PET scan) in your groin and axillary lymph nodes. A PET scan measures how much of the radioactive sugar is taken up by cells in your body and rates that uptake using a scale (FDG uptake). All of your cells take up the radioactive sugar, but cancer cells (or some cells like overused muscle cells) take up MORE of it. How much more helps the radiologist determine how active the cancer (or other cellular activity that can like look like cancer) is. Low numbers, low uptake, high numbers, high uptake. Having cells in your groin area light up can be (but isn't necessarily always) indicative of DISTANT spread of cancer (i.e., metastasis). Your doctor had the first groin biopsy done to test the tissue in the area that lit up on your PET scan to see if there are cancer cells present. It sounds like the biopsy was not conclusive, meaning whatever cells they did get with the needle biopsy are not conclusively showing cancer. This happens. It is a small needle and sometimes the radiologist, for lack of a better way of explaining it, misses the spot he intended to hit. Also, sometimes when the cells are affixed to the pathology slide they are crushed or otherwise destroyed, making the slides useless. I had this happen to me once. You are having a second biopsy to make sure to get a good sampling of cells for the pathology tests. The groin area biopsies will be the determining factor in whether or not you are, in fact, stage IV, because they are far from the primary tumor site (your breast). The lymph nodes in your armpit that lit up, if they are cancerous (a biopsy will tell the tale) do not determine whether you are at Stage IV or NOT. Having \"positive\" lymph nodes is never good, BUT, the question is, has the cancer spread THROUGH and BEYOND those lymph nodes? That is why he his biopsying your groin first. You can have positive lymph nodes and NOT be stage IV. The more nodes involved, and how far they are from the first lymph node in the chain (the sentinel node) helps determine what stage you are at (up to but not including Stage IV). Stage IV cancer is spread (metastasis) of the cancer to distant sites(not including the \"axillary = armpit\" lymph nodes). Having positive axillary lymph nodes means the cancer was not all taken out during your first procedure (mastectomy or lumpectomy?). (This happens more often than is publically acknowledged by the PINK people). This is NOT necessarily due to any errors made during your earlier procedures. They do the best they can when they do a lumpectomy/mastectomy to get clean margins (cancer free area around the primary tumor), but sometimes the little cancerous cells have already slipped through that area and could not be detected, and made their way to your lymph nodes OR your blood stream (cancer cells travel through both mechanisms). It is a sad and frequently unacknowledged truth that not all early detected and treated breast cancers are cured. Many women think they are \"cured\" sometimes for many, many years, only to have the cancer rear it's ugly head again. So, that is my take and explanation of what is going in, based on the information you provided. BUT, you should still call your doctor immediately and ask to meet with him to get it from his/her mouth, as I am NOT a doctor and do not have access to all your test results or history. I COULD be making errors in my assessment because I don't have all the information. I believe my knowledge about staging is accurate, but you should get it from your doctor's mouth. Right now it is not possible for the doctor to tell you if your are stage IV or not. You simply need the groin biopsy to rule that out (which is why you are having that biopsy first). How he/she treats your cancer recurrance (assuming you have one) hinges on those results, and then probably biopsies if your axillary lymph nodes will be needed to confirm there is cancer there (there is still a chance it is not). If you have cancer in your groin, that would change the approach to treating you radically from how you will be treated if only the axillary nodes are cancerous, I believe. I hope this explanation helps. Ladies, please correct me if I have supplied any comments that you believe to be incorrect or misleading. Good luck Lisa...the waiting is very hard, I know, but you will get through this. CALL your doctor, that is what he/she is there for. It is never a good idea to live in your fears and confusion when a simple phone call may be able to clarify things for you and perhaps relieve some anxiety. You should definitely get this cleared up ASAP, before you have the groin biopsy and get the results. DG",

Also, please clarify/confirm what I told you so you are sure you have a good understanding of what a positive result would mean, if that happens. I'm guessing with a biopsy in the groin area, a local anesthetic will not do. There are nerves in that area that might cause you pain, and the radiologist doing the biopsy will be concerned with you moving around. Going through this twice is enough! I think you will be more comfortable with being sedated. You won't be intubated or anything, just given a nice dreamy mix of drugs which may put you to sleep, or keep you sort of awake but feeling no pain. Good luck....my prayers are with you!

You could scare yourself silly with things you read or are told that may be TOTALLY unlikely! As I said before I think, a PET scan is not always definitive. Beyond the things I think I mentioned that could be false positives for cancer, I'm sure there are many more. My best advice would be to take the good in that information and hold it in your heart in a positive way, as offering hope that it is not cancer at all. Stick with that. Flailing about for answers that only the pathology report can provide is sometimes detrimental, although I know the waiting can seem interminable. Really, I know his hard that is, we all do. Try to stay busy with distractions until the report comes in, if at all possible. Do something special for yourself and try to keep your head away from any worst case scenarios as much as possible.

So, October 18 should not be such a dreaded date, as no matter what the markers say, they really not be providing you with substantial information. What you really should be relying on is the scans (PET specifically) and biopsy. Sure, it is possible that you don't have mets I suppose. However, as I think I said before your treatment is the same either way. Unfortunately you are in sort of a watch and wait situation. That is hard. I think what you need to be thinking about is relearning how to cope with this kind of uncertainty in your life. We all walk around with some basic assumptions about what will happen in out lives, and getting cancer or getting hit by a truck isn't on the list. For whatever reason, even though we KNOW that COULD happen, we are able to live without it dominating our thoughts in a daily basis. Your diagnosis and the possibility of mets however, has smacked you in the face. You have been forced out of your comfy denial, and it sucks. The bottom line is though, that comfy little space was always an illusion. Anything can happen really, and that goes both ways, for good and bad things. Now you have to find YOUR way to LIVE in THAT space without it overwhelming you. It isn't easy, but it is possible. Mets or no mets, your life has changed forever, the illusion is gone, and THIS is the real challenge we ALL face. So, if you want to circle and obsess on something, circle on that idea rather than if it is mets or not, because either way, that is your new journey. Embrace it, confront it and live through it and you will be better at living your life no matter what. Hang in there, DG",

You really don't have enough evidence to say that for sure you are stage IV, in the first place. Even if you did have enough evidence one way or the other, your day to day experience would not ALWAYS be one of constant thoughts about the inevitability of your death sooner rather than later. I can attest to that. As time goes by, you learn how to manage all of the uncertainty, stress and anxiety better, if you make efforts to do so and ask for help. The beginning year is absolutely a nightmare, no argument here, but it can and does get easier to manage, even though there is no \"rewind button.\" There is ALWAYS hope that new treatments will evolve that might extend even Stage IV survivor's lives to a more natural lifespan. I had a friend diagnosed with full blown AIDS back in the late 1980's. At the time, we were all certain he would die like so many other of our friends did, sonner rather than later. He is still with us, has worked almost entirely throughout the ups and downs of his disease, in a very difficult, high profile, high stress job. No question he had some very difficult times and a few close calls, nevertheless, he is still with us and the advances that have been made in the treatment of that disease now enable him to live with an even better quality of life now, and with the expectation that he will live a normal life span. When he was diagnosed,as you may recall, that diagnosis was also considered an automatic death sentence. So, you just never can tell what will really happen until the fat lady sings. Hope is an important thing and can be a very powerful thing in our lives on many levels (spiritually and also I believe physically). I was not in any way trying to imply that you should give up hope! Even with a definitive diagnosis of stage IV disease, and a fairly straight forward day to day realistic understanding that this disease could and will probably kill me, BUT, I STILL HARBOUR HOPE that it will not. Don't give up your hope. Living with metastatic breast cancer (or in your case the possibility of having that) does change forever how you look at your life and how you perceive the world. It does take away that fairy tale belief system that nothing bad is going to happen to you, and it takes parts of your old life with it. Sometimes the sense of loss that comes with that can be absolutely overwhelming, and is very difficult to cope with. It is in fact a kind of death in and of itself, and you will grieve for your old life, your fairy tale, over time. It is a process. You CAN navigate through that though. YOU are still LIVING......NOT DYING! That is in itself the gift, the silver lining to the cloud, you become more aware of what is important in your life, and work harder at trying to live it well and to the fullest rather than taking every day for granted. What you have to do is not ACCEPT that you are DYING, but ACCEPT that you have to LEARN to LIVE in a different way! Change is always hard, especially when it comes crashing down around your ears. Your days however will become less and less overwhelming as time passes. You WILL find yourself eventually having days not when you forget that you have breast cancer, but when you are able to knit that into the fabric of your life without it overtaking every minute of your life. NO ONE can sustain living in an emotional space where their thoughts are completely dominated by their disease, your mind protected you before from all the bad \"what ifs\", and it WILL snap back into play eventually permitting you more time in which you have those moments, then hours of freedom from the oppressiveness. AND, those darker periods, which will come and go, will become more manageable and less frightening. You are just at the beginning, give yourself a break, and some time. I was a teacher so I know how hard your work day is, especially when struggling with your personal life right now. Funny story...well maybe not funny ha ha but... I discovered I had Metastatic BC during the middle of an 8th grade science class full of unruly inner city adolescents. I was called to the office for a phone call (from my doctor). I asked one of the hall monitors (named Mr. Cancer....really, I'm not making that up) to watch the class for a few minutes while I stepped out. So, I am standing in the main office, surrounded by kids and secretaries, and I pick up the phone. I had an xray of my spine a few days before following a minor fender bender.....I couldn't imagine WHY I was getting a call through the office during the day from my doctor. So the doctor says, do you have some privacy? Which of course I did not. So she tells me to call her back when I can find some place. The only place I could find was a dark, smelly, dank janitor's closet to make the call on my cell. I get her on the phone and she breaks the news to me. Can you imagine? I will never forget! So I hang up, have about two minutes to absorb what I was just told, and then there is a knock on the closet door.....it is Mr. Cancer asking me to come back into the room because he has to respond to a fight between students somewhere else in the school. So, back I go, into the chaotic room full of 35 8th graders, for the remaining 20 minutes of the period. Talk about having to flip from one state of mind to another in mere minutes! Somehow I got through it though....my brain just kicked in with its little denial mechanism and I made it through without falling apart (barely). Anyway, the point is, your mind is a powerful thing. It WILL protect you from losing it, and will help you adjust to your new reality more and more as time goes by. So, don't force yourself, don't force your mind into a corner. OK? It is OK to \"pretend\" as you put it, although that is the wrong word for what you are going. You are living with hope and that is good, especially if that gets you through the day. Get up in the morning, brace yourself for your day with the kids. Remind yourself of how privileged you are to be able to be a TEACHER. Remind yourself that you do good work....you save lives. Yes, you are definitely going to die, some day. Everyone does. But you are no where in a position to know when that will happen, nor are the doctors at this point. You have no expiration date, and bottom line is, you really don't have much control over that. I know it comes from the 12 steps, as does One Day At A Time, but it works. Accept the things you can not change (you have BC), change the things you can (how can I change my life to LIVE BETTER), and have the wisdom to know the difference. The better you get at that, the easier your days will become. What you are going through is a process.....it takes time....be gentle with yourself. DG",

As I said, normally a psychiatrist will start you at a lower dose, then titrate your dose up to a therapeutic level, to prevent side effects. You can ask the psychiatrist about this. If the symptoms definitely began when you started the Effexor, well then I suppose you found your smoking gun, but wanted you to be aware there could be other causes of those symptoms. Again, he can always lower your dose (if he started you at a higher dose) until you get used to the drug. Then you may not get those side effects. Do think about all the other possible causes and assess yourself so you can have a good productive conversation with the doctor. The more he knows about what you are going through and experiencing, the better he can help you. Sometimes you have to offer information rather than wait to be asked. Psychiatry is a dynamic process which requires input from both you and the doctor! If he has not referred you to a therapist, I would ask about one. Talk therapy can really help, sometimes even more than the medications! DG",

I would guess that in the future he will use a combination of diagnostic tools, not just your markers, to try to figure out if your chest/groin are MBC. He was probably just giving you the short answer there....not to be alarmed. I would simply anticipate perhaps further scans to ascertain your actual staging in addition to watching your markers. In the meantime, you are already being treated as if you have MBC, which happens to be the SAME treatment you would get if you were early stage and trying to prevent a recurrence. So, it's all kind of a wash, if that makes sense. Aromasin is given to early stage BC survivors to prevent recurrances for in excess of Five years after initial diagnosis, based on recent studies. There is ALWAYS a chance for a woman who survived early stage BC to go on and have a recurrence that may become metastatic many years later. The \"cure\" is not always a cure. So, you could consider yourself to be an early stage survivor by simply taking appropriate precautions to prevent a recurrence if you wanted to....that may be the game the insurance company is playing right now. BUT, still gets copy of the contract so you know what they are up to. DG",

I've been through pretty much most of the hormone therapies, and have read extensively about them. All of them can cause diffuse aching and joint pain. Also, Zometa is notorious for causing this. The level of this type of pain can vary widely from person to person. Some people get severe debilitating pain, some do not. For those struggling with moderate to severe pain, just know that you are not alone. I remember well my first years of treatment, when my first oncologist was very dismissive about my pain. That was horrible to contend with. After educating myself I found that I was experiencing real side effects, and that my seemingly out of the ordinary level of pain was in fact, not all that uncommon. If you are experiencing very debilitating levels if pain, seek the assistance of a pain specialist that has experience treating breast cancer patients. If you can not find one in your area (they are difficult to find), look to the closest large city near where you live and see if they have a University Cancer Center that offers Palliative Care Services. This is a new and emerging field in cancer care for those of us living with cancer in a long term basis. It is not the same as Hospice Care. Google the term Palliative Care to learn more about it. You could see a Palliative Care Specialist out of town, then try to coordinate your pain management between the out of town specialist, and your oncologist, primary care doctor, or local pain specialist. You should not have to suffer, there are good ways to manage your pain without wiping yourself out with too much narcotics. Also, alternative therapies like massage amd acupincture do help some people (if they can afford it). Also, some chemotherapies can also cause diffuse aching pain. Read up about whatever treatment you are on. Bone pain from cancer is sometimes \"pinpoint\" in nature, meaning it is confined to the area around where your tumor is. However, if you have bone mets in your spine especially, pain from home mets can radiate to other parts of your body that you may not expect. Your spine, after all, is the place where all your nerves connect to your brain, and your extremities and organs. So, if you have a tumor for example at L4 to L5 on your spine (lumbar discs, Google a picture of the spine with the nerves \"spinal cord\"), you may get pain radiating down through your buttocks into your legs. This is because the tumor can press on nearby nerves, causing the pain to radiate to your extreme ties. The same goes for all the vertebrae in your spine, they all connect to different parts of your body via your nervous system. Also, from what I have read and been told, bone mets can damage the vascular system inside your bones (yes, your vertebrae and other bones do have a blood supply in them). If the blood supply is damaged by mets, the changes in the flow of blood through the bone's vascular system can generate pain. This pain can be either pinpoint, or somewhat diffuse in nature (diffuse meaning in the area generally around where the problem is in this case...not your whole body). This is just a short summary to help you guys out. If you are having pain, reading a bit about the different types of pain and learning some basic anatomy might help you identify and explain what you are experiencing to your doctor. The most important thing to remember is that pain is subjective...meaning there is no \"test\" anyone can do to measure your pain. Some doctors and nurses will state that if your blood pressure is not high, you can not possibly be in that much pain.....this is the worst fallacy out there, so don't buy into that. No one can tell how much pain you have but you, and your doctor is there to assist you in managing it. What you experience is particular to your body, and others with the same diagnosis may experience entirely different sensations. That is normal and OK, there is nothing \"wrong with you\" and it is not \" in your head.\" (Although left untreated, depression and anxiety can exacerbate your pain.....if you have those problems, treating them properly will assist you in managing your pain.) Establish a good, open repore with your health care providers about your pain, and if you feel your pain is not being managed well, speak up, or change providers if you have to. A word of caution: Tylenol and opiods contain Tylenol can be very dangerous if taken improperly. They can damage your liver permanently. Read directions on over the counter medications and take the dosing instructions seriously. Do not exceed your recommended dose of pain medications without talking to your provider. There is a maximum amount of Tylenol which your body can process and ,manage safely, DO NOT exceed this amount! Consult your doctor for more information. Good luck and stay pain free ( or as close to it as you can get)! :)",

I was stage IV with bone mets only from the get go, which was 8 years ago.) I was treated with Xeloda and those nasty liver mets went away, never to be heard from again! So, no matter what happened, remember that while liver mets is not good news, it does not necessarily classify as a harbinger of worse things to come sooner rather than later. All the other stories here from others proves that! So much depends on the doctors you chose, and how they communicate, what your relationship is with them. If you are not happy with any doctor you see, and how they communicate, let them know ASAP! If they are not willing to work on the relationship, or they are incapable of adjusting their communication style or attitude to your emotional needs, then move on. Wht an oncologist has seen in their practice influences a lot how they think and their attitude, but they are only one person! They are PEOPLE too, with shortcomings and emotions, in a difficult field. Some make adaptations to help them adjust to dealing with terminally ill patients that may help THEM deal with THEIR emotions, but can produce detrimental effects on their patients own ability to adapt. If you perceive a disconnect between your doctor and yourself, definitely address it by first discussing out with him/her and then trying to fix it. If it doesn't work out, you can fire any one of them at your discretion. So much of your journey, how you manage it, has to do with how you and your doctors communicate and if you are on the same page in terms of how YOU need to handle your journey emotionally. Tell your doctor what you need. This does not mean you are asking him/her to blow smoke up your ass, just to THINK about what they say, before they say it, and to be honest about what they know to be true for sure, and what it pure conjecture. Be your own advocate, not a shrinking flower! Some doctors CAN adjust....I had some issues with mine at first but we worked on it together and all is well. MD Anderson has a great reputatation, but you can find doctors with a bad attitude anywhere, just throw a rock and you'll hit one! Keep your head up MikeJohn, and try not to let the words of one absolute moron dictate and change how you think every day. For sure, that guy was talking out of his ass, we all seem to agree here, us fellow survivors. No one can know the answer to that question at this point, that is the bottom line. I know you've had a rough road and some pretty crappy side effects from recent treatments, but that doesn't mean your expiration date is any closer...nor necessarily does the appearance of liver mets. This disease is just too unpredictable! The thing you need to focus on, to work on, perhaps with the help of a therapist with experience working with cancer patients, is how to LIVE LIFE WITH THE UNKOWN spread out ahead of you. Really, everyone does this, mostly by pretending they will live a charmed life according to their plans. BUT, life is what happens while you are making plans. You just have to learn to adapt to your new perception, a new scheme of the world. It can be done. Rather than looking for confirmation of your expiration date, you need to refocus your energy on living each day for that day. Let the future work out itself, in the FUTURE. Control what you can, learn the difference between what you can and can not control, and the things you can not control give up to the Universe, your higher power, or chance/luck, whatever works for you. Really, NO ONE knows what the future will really bring to them, just most people live in a grander illusion than we advanced cancer patients do. BUT, that does not mean you have to give up your dreams.... Hang in there and try to remember that words are just that, words, they hold no power over you, never did, never will, if you don't let them. DG Let us know what happenned",

      "Content": "Sep 8, 2013 05:24PM - edited Sep 8, 2013 05:27PM by DragonGirl Grammy R, I don't think having the lesion on the contralateral side of where your BC was means much of anything as far as whether it is MBC or not. As your know, MBC travels through not only lymphatic system but blood as well, and can pop up anywhere. If it was on the SAME side, that wouldn't mean it was more likely to be MBC either. Having said that, I went back and looked up my old scans. I had (and still do have) limited atelectasis in both lungs. I did however have two suspicious areas on my left lung, which subsequently disappeared, and were determined NOT to have been BC. I guess it all depends on how the lesions/areas look. Some lesions look more like BC metastasis than others, but sometimes it is hard for the radiologists to tell for sure what they are actually seeing. In radioloigist speak, \"suspicious for metastatic disease\" and \"likely metastatic,\" as I recently explained to someone else, translate to \"I just can't tell\" and is often used by radiologists when they already KNOW you have had a previous BC diagnosis at the primary tumor site, but arnt sure what they are seeing. You know, guilt by association, looks like MBC, smells like MBC, so maybe it is MBC. But reading CAT Scans and MRI's is a complex process and the quality of the image, the quality of the equipment, the talent of the radiologist and the appearance of the \"lesions\" can all collide to paint a confusing picture sometimes. Then of course there is the possibility of false positives on imaging studies, which do happen. So, it is possible that the lesion is NOT BC, which is why your MO hasn't staged you yet. But, I can tell you are a bit like me, you would rather prepare for the worst and hope for the best. I get that, absolutely. It is a valid strategy and works well for some, so I wont tell you to stop doing it! I would however squeeze your MO or RO for more information about the Chest scan if you can get it, you know, get the actual report at least and ask WHY they are having trouble classifying the lesion. Remind him you have medical background and you are just damn nosey and want more information! Sometimes they withhold because they dont eant to confuse you witg medical terminology they THINK is over your head? The reason you are getting crap about the xanax is the stupid drug addicts, you are correct, HOWEVER, being limited to 5 days of lorazepam may not be her permenant solution. I would have given you xanax, it is shorter acting and not so strong. That is the best med for transient panic attacks to start with, that I know of. A month's prescription of xanax at 2 to 3 ( .5mg pills) is definitely not out of order assuming you arent taking any other meds that might depress your respiratory system. I would call your radiation or medical oncologist and get that straightened out. As an NP, she may just be required by the practice to be less generous than the RO's are, for legal purposes, that might explain that. You are your best own advocate, so call the doc and explain your concern about the limited prescription and see what he says. Perhaps there is a valid reason WHY? Maybe they want to have your try it for five days and then see how it works, and then adjust dosage or med type then. They are discouraged from writing script upon script of benzos....so maybe they didn't want to give you more than five days until they knew it was the right drug. Who knows? ASK! Don't worry about being pushy, they will just have to adjust! Hang in there! (Might I suggest a psychiatry consult? It might be good to get yourself set up with one now, sometimes it can takes weeks or months to get on ones' schedule. Then if you require continuing use of benzos beyond your radiation treatment you will have a doctor willing to write for you, which is an expert in that field. Also, therapy has always helped me with the anxiety...I HATE pills unless I HAVE to use them!)",

Forgive my bad memory, but did your chest nodes show positive for BC on the PET scan? I thought I recalled that there wasn't a definitive answer on that. PLEASE do not make inquiries or discuss what stage you are, or are not, with a nurse or middle person. You must speak directly to your oncologist. Messages can be passed on in ways that do not make clear the purpose of inquiry, and responses relayed back can be as a result, also unclear. I believe that at this time, as I recall, regardless of what the PET is or is not showing with respect to your chest nodes and groin, the doctor is treating you AS IF you are Stage IV, isn't that so? This would explain his response to the nurses inquiry, which she probably did not make with much of an explanation about your current state of mind. He probably has NO IDEA how upset, anxious and confused you are. PLEASE speak to him/her personally with any such inquiries, also with respect to your need for help with your anxiety. If the nurse/staff says they will take a message, INSIST that you want to speak to the doctor personally. This is the only way to avoid confusion in your communications, and get the help you need ASAP. If the oncologist is not prepared to write you a prescription, ask him/her to place a call to the psychiatrist which emphasizes your need for an immediate response. Sometimes you need another doctor to call for you to get immediate action (although one would hope you would not have to go to that extreme). Your primary care doctor could also call for you, or recommend a psychiatrist that he/she knows personally that will be more responsive. You have to decide whether you are willing to give whatever medications are prescribed a chance (it takes many anti depressents or long acting anti anxilotics TIME to work (weeks), and often times the undesirable side effects dissipate with time). However, only you can determine if you can tolerate those side effects over that period of time. Mild nausea is to be expected with antidepressants, and usually goes away within a few days, as do some of the other side effects. Your reaction to the Effexor is something you need to discuss personally with the psychiatrist so he can decide what to do....I doubt your oncologist would want to address that problem, but he CAN call the psychiatrist for you to get the ball rolling. It sounds like right now, you definitely need an anti anxiety medication that you can tolerate that helps you immediately, and xanax is a good option for that. Does it help at all? It is a short acting drug, like it helps only for a few hours, which is why the psychiatrist wanted you to try the Effexor. But, there are other choices out there. Definitely do NOT start and stop any of the meds the psychiatrist prescribed repeatedly, this can cause worse problems than you already have. The antidepressant you refer to (Prozac) as with most anti depressents, take a few weeks to work. You can NOT take them one day and not the other, and expect them to work. To the contrary, doing so could make you feel worse. Also, please be very careful with his much xanax you take, do not exceed the recommended dose. That can be dangerous, AND you will run out of pills before the month ends, and then you may face all sorts of nonsense with getting more as that drug is very strictly controlled by the DEA. If you still have the Ativan, I hope who ever gave you the xanax knows about that, and advised you if it is OK to take both, and how many when. Together they can be even more dangerous as they can depress your respiratory system. If all else fails, report to the emergency room! There is no shame in going there to ask for help with your anxiety. We've all been there hon.......it's OK to go there for help if you need it NOW. STOP READING BAD STORIES ON THE INTERNET!! For every Stage IV pperson that posts horror stories on the internet, there are others who ARE living with GOOD quality of life, they just are not posting on the internet! It is less likely that these women are participating in the forums and so on, for obvious reasons (they feel good and need less support), but they (we) ARE out there! Really, you have to STOP I think. I remember exactly what you are going through. Stick with this thread where you will get support and good advice, but stay away from the other threads, OK? They are not helping you, only increasing your anxiety and fear. Try to get one of your docs to place a call to the psychiatrist for you and make an emergency appointment, it go to the ER, OK? It gets easier....I promise. DG",

      "Content": "Oct 17, 2013 02:52AM - edited Oct 17, 2013 03:29AM by DragonGirl Lisa,  Glad you got to speak to your doctor's partner, and you are feeling a bit better. I'm not sure why your doctor is a big fan of tumor markers. Many women here say that their doctors think they are somewhat unreliable in using to predict the course of their disease. In any event, as I think I said before, no matter what your tumor markers say, those results have NOTHING to do with whether you are stage four, or not.  Stage four disease is defined as when BC tumors have taken up residence in sites outside of your breast (and axillary lymph nodes...the ones under your arm that arise from your breast).  Metastasis can happen in the presence of increased tumor markers, decreased tumor markers, or no tumor markers at all. I think I told you I have never had any tumor markers in my blood, yet I am stage four. Some women just don't express tumor markers in their blood, yet still have breast cancer, at any stage. Tumor markers in your blood do not dictate what STAGE of BC you have, they are more an indication of whether the tumors you do have are growing or not. More BC cells, more tumor markers created /secreted into your bloodstream, in general, but NOT ALWSYS. They are used more to determine if treatments may or may not be working on tumors already detected, for a BC patient at any stage. Tumor Markers are simply a molecular compound that can be found in SOME women's blood that are produced as a result of there being a BC tumor present, anywhere. So, you can have tumor markers as a result of having very early stage BC, because the tumor in your breast secretes a chemical compound (tumor marker) into your bloodstream that we know is a flag for the presence of a tumor. However, there is no way to tell WHERE the tumor markers came from, the tumor in the original and site of BC in the breast, or from sites of metastatic disease in sites outside of the breast (if there ARE tumors outaide of the breast/axillary lymph nodes).I hope that clarifies things a bit. Having increased tumor markers does not mean that your disease has necessarily spread outside of your breast at all. The markers DO NOT CARRY the cancer, they are a molecular compound that appear sometimes as a RESULT of BC being present in your body. The theory goes, the higher the level of markers, either the bigger the original BC tumor has gotten (thus secreting more markers into your blood). Or, sometimes, the higher the level of tumors markers there are, the more tumors there are. But, the higher level DOES NOT necessarily mean your original tumor has metastasized.....you could be getting a secondary tumour in the breast! So, no matter what your tumor markers are doing when you have them tested this week, the information will have no bearing on what STAGE you are. In women that have tumors markers, they can be used to help, along with other diagnostic information like PET scans, Breast MRI, Mammogram, Bone Scans etc, depending on what stage they are in, to determine if a treatment you are on is working well or not. Sometimes tumor markers go down when a a treatment is working (but not always). Conversely, they can go up during treatment which might indicate a treatment MAY BE failing, (but not always). The markers don't in an of themselves always determine if you are responding positively or negatively to treatment, hence their intrinsic unreliability in use as a sole predictor of your response to treatment. Usually tumor marker results are looked at in conjunction with other modes of testing (additional PET scans or Bone Scans/MRI) to get a good fix on reposnse to treatment. If your tumor markers go DOWN, that is of course a good sign, as it means the markers in your blood that correspond LOSELY to how many tumor cells are present in your body. However, a decreased tumor marker count is not always a guarantee that your disease is still not spreading outside of your breast. As I said, the tumor markers do NOT carry the cancer, they are a chemical compound found in some peoole's blood when a tumor is present, sometimes just in your breast....and sometimes not (if you have tumotprs outside of the breast.. I encourage you to get off this idea that if your tumor markers change in any way that those results dictate what stage you are, because that is not so. What determines STAGE is the presence or absence of actual tumors (not tumor markers, which appear in your blood secondary to the presence of any BC tumor) in specific places in your body distant to the original site of the BC, your breast. Distant means anything outside of your breast and axillary lymph nodes (nodes under your arm). Your chest lymph nodes would be considered a distant site of metastasis, if it could be determined that there is BC present and not some other benign inflammatory process (like in your groin). Right now, it seems there is no definitive information available to tell you if those nodes have BC in them or not. If they do, then what will eventually happen, more than likely, is they will light up more on PET scan at some point, in a SUFFICIENTLY High enough level on the FDG scale, and in a larger size, then the doc will be able to say for sure if there is BC in them. An increase in tumor markers could be the harbinger of the firmation of new tumor cells, but there is just no way to tell WHERE the new tumor cells are!  So, if tumor markers go up, and a mammogram and/or MRI of the breast shows no changes in the size and location of your original breast tumor, then your doctor MIGHT order a PET scan to look for other tumors elsewhere, and recheck your chest nodes....or, he may take a wait and watch approach for another month or so. Increased tumor markers do not show WHERE the increase in tumor activity is coming from, and you can not assume they are coming from the chest nodes, which we don't even know are cancerous. There could be a random fluctuation from your original breast tumor, for example. The FDG scale is the scale they use to measure how much of the radioactive sugar they inject in to you before your PET scan is taken up in cells. All cells take up to some degree, this radioactive suger. Cancer cells (tumors are a big conglomeration of cancer cells that are reproducing and thus making the tumor larger) take up the radioactive sugar faster and at higher levels than normal cells. So, if a group of cells take up the radioactive sugar at a faster and higher level (using the FDG scale) they are determined to be cancerous. So, on subsequent PET scans, which you will need to have at some point, those lymph nodes in your chest which seem to be taking up the radioactive sugar at a low enough rate and level to indicate they may NOT have cancer, but be undergoing an inflammatory process, could on next scan show a decrease or increase in those rates and levels. What you would hope for is either the FDG values stay the same, or decrease! Your doctor will probably only use the tumor marker levels to inform him how soon he should give you another PET scan to see if the chest nodes look different in PET. He can't just PET Scan you every month, insurance would not allow it, and honestly any changes normally take longer to happen. The spacing of PET scans is usually every 3 to 4 months, that is for someone who has active metastatic BC. Sometimes longer for MBC with No Evidence of Disease. For women who don't have MBC but lower stage BC, PET scans are sometimes not used at all, that is for women with very early stage disease. Technically, if the lymph nodes in your chest are benign, and the groin is benign, you are not stage IV. Having said that, since the nodes in your chest that have lit up on PET scan can not be biopsied, the only way to confirm they have BC in them is if they light up SUFFICIENTLY on your PET scan in a way that definitively shows them to be BC. Sometimes inflammation can cause areas in a PET scan to light up, for various reasons other than BC. However, if they do not light up A LOT, it can be unclear if there is really BC there, or some other inflammatory process. Lymph nodes can become inflamed due to infections and viruses as well. ( I do not believe tumour markers are known to change due to increased or decreased inflammation, I think maybe you are confused about that, but correct me if I am wrong.) So, as I said before, the chest nodes which lit up only a small bit on PET Scan and were \"pea sized\", may not be cancer at all. Only time will tell, with further observations and testing. However, the doctor is treating you \"as if\" they were cancer, and thus has labelled you Stage IV more for convenience and perhaps to overcome some insurance nonsense he might encounter if he didn't label you as stage IV. In reality, the treatment you are having now is the same treatment you would be getting whether you are Stage IV, or not. It just so happens that your current treatment (I am assuming you are taking Tamoxafin, Aromasin, Arimadex or Femara, or perhaps Herceptin) is what you would be taking as follow up care for non metastatic disease, and metastatic disease! Correct me if you are on something else. So, you are covered either way. It sounds strange, but it is true. If you look up the NCCN Guidelines for BC TReatment, you will see that this is true. There us a website (WWW.NCCN.org) and I think they have an iPad and android app. So, I've provided a lot of information here, but I always say, I don't have access to all your medical history, so I am going on only what you have provided. YOU MUST sit down with the doctor (oncologist) and get your understanding of what all the tests he is ordering are for, and how they are used in conjunction with each other test to make decisions. Please make a list of your questions and the assumptions you have been struggling with to bring with you to the appointment so you can have a frank, productive conversation that clears up your concerns. If he gets off track with the discussion, bring him back to your list. In fact, make a copy and provide it to him at the beginning of the meeting. Bring a friend that can listen and take notes about his answers. Also, I encourage you to read the information provided on this website which does explain much of what I have provided to you here, and more. Knowledge is power and will make you a better adovate for yourself. It will help you with your anxiety if you have a good firm understanding of the basics, which are provided on this webpage (start at the Breastcancer.org Homepage) rather than filling in the dots as your worries and fears bring up more questions. That is time well spent, rather than reading horror stories which have information in them that you may not even understand yet. Also, the National Institute if Health webpage has wonderful resources for patients, with cool easy to understand animations, that will help you along. THIS is the kind of reading you should be doing. Ignore the statistics about how long you may have etc. It's all conjecture as far as I am concerned. None of us are statistics. You have no expiration date stamped on your foot. We all have our own unique experience with this disease, and many of us are outliers (like me.....I've had this for 8 years and am enjoying a good quality of life....and I am not the only one). I thought I would be long gone (based on those statistics) and here I am. I wish I had the benefit of talking to someone like me, way back when......I spent way too much time worrying about my death that I could have spent LIVING my LIFE! Don't make the same mistake!  Just remember, you won't be getting any information Friday that will be earth shattering. The markers are only a small piece of a larger puzzle, educate yourself about them, what they really do or don't mean. Try to establish an open/honest repore with your oncoloigist so he can help you clarify your understanding of what is going on in your body, and in your head. Ask him to explain the next few steps in terms of your treatment/surveillance plan, so you can work as a TEAM! Tell him you would rather speak to him directly whenever possible when you have concerns or questions (I have found that communicating through a middle person, like a nurse, opens up all sorts of opportunities for miscommunication that can lead to greater anxiety.) Bring a good friend or your partner (if they are up to it and you have one) to take notes and help keep the conversation on track.  I know the waiting is interminable, and very hard. However, the more you know about the plan, the easier that waiting time between tests and scans will get. These days I rarely worry about test results much, I've learned not to go through all the \"what ifs\" in my brain, not to torture myself that way. I have the test and then wait until I get results to process what they mean, and what the next steps are. I've stopped guessing about things I can't control, because doing that lets the cancer interfere with my day to day life too much. If you do learn definitely thatyou have metastatic disease, and at some point that will become clear, you will be able to adjust to a new life living with it. It CAN be done....it just takes time. Be good to yourself, and DO seek out a competant talk therapist (I have found behavioral therapy has helped me a lot in managing my thoughts and fears/anxiety). Pills can help, but there's no replacing that one on one support. Let me know how it goes. You can always PM me, anytime. Just please remember what I said about the markers, what they are and what they are used for. Do clarify with your oncologist the role he perceives they play in the big picture. I am not discounting their usefullness, just think you need him to elaborate on HOW he uses them in the decision making process, so you are both on the same page. Remember he is just a guy with an MD after his name, but still human like all the rest of use. This is a relationship you will be in for a long time, and it will take time for you two to get into a groove where the communication works well.  In the meantime, better living through pharmaceuticals! Hang in there!  ;)  DG",

After having MBC for five years, only in the bones, I was diagnosed with three small liver tumors. Believed me, I know how frightened you are! I had a biopsy done of the liver tumor which showed it was slightly different than my original pathology, ER+/PR-, HER2- ( originally ER+/PR+, HER2-). I did not qualify for surgical resection of the metastasis because I had too many small tumors, but these days some oncologists are recommending resection of certain liver tumors, under certain circumstances. Something to discuss with your doctor, along with whether or not you should get the Liver tumors biopsied. Anyway, I changed treatment to Xeloda from the last aromatase inhibitor available to me and I had a complete response in the Liver....(NED!), although my disease has progressed in my spine since then. No sign of liver metastasis for almost three years. I know we have different bodies and tumor types, but I thought you might be encouraged to hear that it IS possible to stop the spread in an organ like your liver. This change does not necessarily mean you are any closer to the end, or spread to other organs. Anything is still possible, so try not to go \"there\". Hang on to those dreams girl! BTW, you can live day to day, and still have your dreams......and while this is definatley not good news, I think you should talk to YOUR doctor about what he/she thinks. It's never good to have these conversations, get this kind of news from a doctor with whom you have not established a working relationship. ;) DG",

Talk to YOUR oncologist about how that interaction went and what the other doctor said and see what he says about the interaction (NOT your expiration date, which no one can predict). Honestly, the nerve of that other doctor! It simply isn't his place to say such a thing to someone who isn't his patient! He clearly does not know anything about patient/doctor communication. I hate those guys who think saying the worst possible thing is the best way to go so patients don't get their hopes up! (Sounds like that is his MO) They think they are God and have no understanding of what the impact of such a statement really is! Absolutely NO ONE could predict that based on where you are! If YOUR doctor does not express EXTREME dismay that this other doctor would even have that conversation with you rather than wait for him to return, I would definitely seek a consult elsewhere. This isn't about when you will die, it's about your relationship with YOUR doctor. That is something almost sacred and should not be interfered with by someone filling in for him. Even if you straight out asked him, he should have deferred and said that was a conversation best had with your own doctor! I am solo sorry you had that experience...and mad...at the doctor.
