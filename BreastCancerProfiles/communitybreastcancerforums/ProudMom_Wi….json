Taxol has been soooo much better.  I was afraid of Taxol because of neuropathy, but for me it has been so much easier than the AC.  So far no signs of neuropathy (knock on wood).  The only meds I take with Taxol are Vicodin on the 3-5 days for the joint pains and Ativan to sleep at night, I have this problem with not be able to sleep since I started chemo.  I think it is more of a mental thing for me.  My doctor said she will help to ween me off of Ativan once I am done with treatments.

My cancer was not close to my chest wall.  With the BMX I had clear margins all around.  Only had cancer in my left breast, a small of amount of DCIS near my nipple and 1.3cm of IDC unifocal in the upper left quandrant, not close to the chest wall at all.  No other cancer found except in the 2 SN.  No LVI either.  Everything else in the pathology report was good.  Had at PET/CT scan after the BMX and it did not detect anything.  Everytime I ask an oncologist the question \"If I had the ALND would you still radiate me?\"  The answer is either \"not sure, need to re-evaluate\" or \"No, we would not recommend radiation if the ALND came back with no other lymph nodes having cancer\".  That is why I have been fighting the 'standard of care' with regards to radiating the chest wall.

I was clinically node-negative going into my BMX, and the two positive nodes found were not found until the final pathology came in, so I had to decide about the ALND. I decided to decline for these reason which applied to my situation: a) Although 3 sentinel nodes were removed they also ended up taking an intramammary node and axillary node, both negative.   b) Only the first two sentinel nodes were positive, the third was negative. I know it can skip, as SpecialK had that experience. c) Had a 9% probability of additional lyphm node involvement. d) Although I had 9mm and 6mm of cancer in my lymph nodes, I had no evidence of LVI. e) I read a study published in Oct. 2010 www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCo... which basically said \"Axillary radiation therapy may control the axilla in sentinel lymph node-positive patients as effectively as complete axillary lymph node dissection, and could become an alternative treatment of the axilla for patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes\". Since then additional studies have been concluded and published which discuss whether or not ALND is needed in certain cases. http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/305/6/569. Among patients with limited SLN metastatic breast cancer treated with breast conservation and systemic therapy, the use of SLND alone compared with ALND did not result in inferior survival. http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/29/34/4479.full \"In conclusion, on the basis of the results of Z0011, a significant proportion of patients with one to two positive SLNs and BCS can safely forego ALND. The majority of these patients do not need to be subjected to the short-term and long-term morbidity of ALND.\"   So based on my pathology and the other treatments I was going to do, chemo and radiation of the axilla and supraclavical, I decided that it was not worth the risk for me to have the ALND. Everyone's situation is different. If you are unsure of the recommendations of your doctors, please go and get second or third opinions, and discuss recent studies. You need to be comfortable with the decision you make. Good luck.",

Thankfully my oncologist is supportive of the decision I made. With regards to scans, at my request my surgical oncologist had me do a PET/CT Scan soon after my BMX after the pathology showed positive lymph nodes because I did not want to do the ALND and needed additional information in order to make my decision.   My medical oncologist that I went with told me that she would not have recommended the scan because the odds were it would not have shown anything, because the scan usually only picks up stuff (cancerous or benign) that is more than 1 cm, and the odds were that if the cancer did get past my lymph nodes, they would be too small to be detected by the scan.  Future scans will only be needed if I had symptoms indicating that were was a problem because with the advancements in chemotherapy, and the other treatment(s) I would be doing, i.e., radiation and Tamoxifen, if heaven forbid the cancer survived, since my chemo was slow growing, it would take several years to show up in a scan.  I hope this helps.  ",

We also talked about the carotid artery.  He said there was not way to avoid it with the supraclavical radiation.  So 20-30+ yrs down the road I may develop a problem which could increase the risk for a stroke.  But then again, maybe not.  Then he once again brought up radiating my chest wall since he discussed my case with additional colleagues, and once again I said no.  He said he would be remiss in his duties if he did not try to persuade me.  But he said it is my body, my cancer, no two cancers are the same, everyone responds differently to treatment and it is utilimately my choice and he supports my decision.  He might keep trying to talk me into it, but at least he is also supporting me.  I guess this means he cares which is a good thing.",

The only real problem which continues to be a literal pain is the constipation.  It has been better this time around, so hopefully I am getting a handle on it and next time it will be even better.  I also have had no problems with the Neulasta pain.  I have been very fortunate.  Although I am really nervous about Neuropathy, especially since I will be having DD Taxol in about a month.   Here's to the start of another week and hoping we are all doing great!!!!  Even if there is a bump in the road, we will all get through this.  I have faith and am sending you all good vibes. ",

The second rash only appeared on my hands and it was like a bunch little blisters, but I started taking Benadryl and that ended up clearing both up.  Yes my fingers were peeling really bad as I finished up with AC.  I started using Coconut Oil and it has worked much better than any of the lotions I was trying before.   With Taxol I did get some joint and muscle pain and ended up taking Vicodin, but only 4 total, so it was manageable.  No issues with my intestines per se, although I think they are still recovering from AC.  I actually have an appetite and I think I have gained some weight.  My eyes are also not bothering as much.  Every day they seem to get better.  No signs of neuropathy so far.   I upped the L-Glutamine to 15g 2x/day, but kept everything the same with the rest of my supplements.  I also am going for acupuncture two days before my infusion.   So in a nutshell, so far Taxol has been much better than AC.  I am praying it stays that way for the remaining 3 treatments.  Hope your treatment go well. ",

I go in for my second to last infusion tomorrow (Taxol).  Only one more left after this.  When I had my labs this time my onc decided to have my hormone levels checked ... and I am now officially in chemopause.  Yippy!!!  She says I have a 50/50 chance of staying in menopause (I am 46), hopefully that will be the case.  I am going to take Tamoxifen for 5 years, unless the SEs get really bad, more benefits for me with Tamoxifen than an AI.  My liver enzymes came back down, but she is not going to increase the Taxol to where it was.  She said why put the strain on my liver when I can save that task for some good red wine.  Also my WBCs dropped from 22 down to 3, so I have to do the Neulasta shot again and if I break out in a rash she said I could try Claritin or Benedryl.  I know Benadryl works but it just makes me soooo sleepy.   Sending {{HUGS}} to everyone.",

I did have a reaction to the Neulasta shot, broke out in a rash.  I am still taking it though am trying to control it with Claritin now, if that doesn't work I will use Benadryl again, since I know it works, but it makes me really drowsy. My boys are older (18 & 16), so they are pretty self sufficient.  The hardest part for them was when I went through the BMX.  They have adjusted to the chemo treatments and are really supportative and as understanding as they can be under the circumstances.  My husband is really supportative, but he stressed too.  Thankfully lots of friends and family have been helping with meals and driving me for appointments, etc... which has helped us out and make them all feel better that they are helping us too, which they really are. Definitely drink lots of fluids!!!!  Good luck and let us know how we can support you.  You will make it through.",

Every so often when having a bad day and I just knew I would have problems sleeping (usually infusion days) I would not cut the pills but take 1mg at around 6pm planning on another one around midnight.  Sometimes I would not fall asleep and just read or watched TV, but it would relax me, and then when would take another 1mg at midnight and would fall asleep within 20 minutes.  As I said, I really hate having to take medication in order to sleep.  I try every so often to skip it, sometimes I can.  Once all these treatments are done my oncologist said she will work with me to ween off of them and I will also be looking into natural remedies to help me with it too.  Hope this helps.  ",

Also don't know if this would go through your MO or not, but ask to have a uterine ultra sound at least one a year since you will be on Tamoxifen as a precaution.  If you don't have physical therapist/LE specialist find out if your MO can put in a referral or recommend one.  Always good to stay ahead of the curve with the potential for LE.  I guess also ask if there are other blood tests, levels that should be checked.  I have read that there is some marker which can indicate if cancer has returned, but I have also read that it is unreliable.  I need to talk to my MO when I see her in a few weeks. Congrats being close to finishing rads.

I know how you must feel to think that you won't have chemo at the time of your BMX.  I was clinically node negative, then surprise, 2/4 positive when the final pathology came back.  So now chemo and possible radiation all because of those two little positive nodes. My Onc said my hair will start to grow back not that long after I finished the AC part and start on the Taxol, just as my eyebrows and eyelashes start to fall out.  Oh joy.  But different chemicals do different things. I really hate that we are all having to go threw this, but one thing I have learned on this journey so far is how strong the woman on this site are.  Although I am scared beyond belief, I know that I can do it.  When I get down, all I need to do is read some of the wonderful postings to get some strength to face what is next.   I am so honestly grateful for this website and all the brave women who are kind enough to share their experiences, knowledge and information to help others as they battle to really crappy disease. ",

I did experience bone pain in my sternum about 8 days after the shot once. She said everyone is different and sometimes your body may react a little differently from treatment to treatment. Hope this helps. yorleh - Welcome and we are here for you. jogshuttle - My oncologist said it was not uncommon for liver enzymes to spike when going from AC to Taxol. So she wanted to see if by reducing it by 20% if that would improve it. She said the 20% reduction was still in the acceptable range for effective treatment for a person of my size and weight. When I got home I searched the web to see if the L-Glutamine would have effected the liver and found that in rare cases too much L-Glutamine could effect liver enzymes. I forgot to mention to her that I had upped the L-Glutamine and forgot about it when I had the appointment - bad me. So I emailed her about it and she wanted me to bumped it back down to where I was before. But I was so afraid of neuropathy, that I did a gradual decline of it. I went down to 20g for a few days, then down to 15g/day and now I am back down to about 10g/day. No signs of neuropathy. My last blood test showed two of the liver enzymes are now back in the normal range and the third one is just slightly elevated. So my onc. did not increase the DD Taxol for round three and I am sticking with 10g/day. We did not discuss what would happen if the liver enzymes did not go down, didn't want to think about it unless I had to I guess. jcoutee - A mastectomeny is a personal decision, when you have the choice, and you are young. I chose a BMX because of my family history even though I am BCRA neg., plus I was 45 at time of dx and I was done with having kids, and in all honestly, mine were floppy and droopy, so I decided to remove the stress and hope to be smaller and perkier when the treatments were over. I was also hoping to avoid radiation, but that didn't happen in my case, I will be having radiation to my lymph nodes soon. If you decide to go that route, just remember if you get implants (either silicone or saline) they need to be replaced about every 10 years. Also, find out the type of follow up you would receive to check for a recurrance or new breast cancer if you have a MX. There seems to be no \"standard\" for this. You might not be comfortable with how they plan to follow up with you through the years if you go the MX route.",

I never did the ice bags during transfusion as UTMom suggested, but I have heard from several people that it really helped them.  So definitely give it a try with your next infusion.  Also with Taxol I took Vicodin on days 3-5 because of joint pains.  Am on it now since it is day 4 for me, hopefully I am making sense with what I am writing since I am under the influence  .

WarriorrPrincess24 - Sorry you are having such a difficult time with neuropathy.  Have you talked to your doctor about whether you can switch to another type of chemo, perhaps Abraxane, or another one, or are you too far along for this to occur?  Can he reduce the dosage to help with the SEs?  My understanding about Abraxane is that it causes less SEs than Taxol, and although it may cause neuropathy it is suppose not be as harsh. I personally know a couple of people who have had discussions with their oncologists to stop chemo early because of side-effects.  They discussed the impact it would have on the prognosis before they made the decision to stop.  Two ended up continuing with their treatments but at lower doses, the third stopped chemo treatments.  Thankfully all three are healthy at this time, although none has hit the five year mark yet, but I am hopeful for all of them.  It is a personal decison based on your pathology and discussion with your oncologist.   I hope others have more information to share with you. Sending you {{{HUGS}}} and hoping the SEs get better and your discussion with oncologist goes well tomorrow.  Please let us know how you are. ",

MaryMeg - Congratulations - HAPPY DANCE!!!  A friend of mine had her mammary nodes zapped a little over three years ago when she had a recurrance after MX.  I am happy to report she is doing great with no sign of cancer.    Hair is really starting to grow back now on top of my head.  It is really soft.  The only time I wear anything on my head is if I am cold, otherwise I have been going natural.  The mix of dark brown and grey hair on my head looks like I actually frosted my hair.  It looks kind of neat.  I have only shaved my legs once in over six months, hoping to avoid that a little longer if possible.  Not having to shave was one of the silver linings with this experience.  ",

For me at 46 I think my ovaries are permanently shut down, and I personally could not be happier.  I am done with having kids.  My OB/GYN says he will monitor my hormone level closely over the next 5 years and if there is any sign that they are coming back, then they will be removed when I am done with tamoxifen before moving to an AI.  Like christine47, I will also be having my uterus and ovaries watched closely. JulieH - I heard the same thing about the lashes and brows needing to be re-programmed.   MaryMeg - For my skin I have been using Miaderm, which I purchased over the internet.  I know some folks have said that 100% aloe vera (no alcohol in it) works great too (it just never worked all that great for me on those few occassions when I would get a sunburn, probably because it had alcohol in it), so I decided to use as a backup if needed, but haven't needed too.  Also I am drinking turmeric tea (some folks take curcumin - a think there is actually a trail or study being done curcumin helping skin during rads), and also staying well hydrated and eating avacados (or yummy homemade guacamole).  Disclaimer:  Only the skin from the side of my neck over to my axilla, both front and back are being effective by my rad treatment, so I am not haveing to deal with other issues with breast/chest wall radition, so this could be why what I am using/doing appears to work well for me.   tsundermann - cool more than halfway through rads.  I actually enjoy going to my rads treatment, not to be zapped, but because I met this wonderful woman who is also going through it right before me and we have great talks and work on a puzzle in the waiting room.  Glad to see you are more than half way through.  It great to get over that half way mark. I went to see my Physical Therapist/LE Specialist yesterday because I was having shooting pain in my left arm from my axilla to my wrist.  Started around the end of the send week of rads, but only in the mornings.  She said I show no signs of LE (yippy!) and the pain was due to a nerve, which could have been triggered by rads or from one of the surgeries.  I am to keep wearing my compression sleeves as instructed and she taught me a few new stretches and had to properly do a manual lymph massage.  She also taught me a better way to massage my saline implants to get the soft and moveable - DH gets to help with this  Got two more rad txs done, only 5 left.  Will get my blood drawn on Monday and get zapped before the results come in, just in case.  RO said as long as the count is stabile or continues to go up he will continue with treatments.  Keeping my fingers crossed.  ",

Inplants are settling in, although I am lopsided.  If the right side (non-cancer side) does not drop in the next few months need to decide whether or not to have it 'fixed'.  Can't tell if I wear a bra, but I don't want to have to wear a bra all the time.  Exercising, although I know I need to do more, I am trying to slowly build it up, because I don't want to over do it again. bdavis - I hope the wound is healing and you are not having any more complications. I was just wondering, for those of you who have completed all the invasive treatments, i.e., surgery, chemo and/or rads, how are you feeling about the future? Most days I am sooo hopeful, believing that the surgery removed all cancer, and if any little micro sized cancers escaped that the chemo and rads got it.  And if it tries to re-establish itself the Tamoxifen will starve it.  Other days I think that I just need to get to 10 years NED (since I am ER+/PR+) and then if it were to recur that medical advances will have occured and it would be caught really early and the new treatments will eliminate it for good.  I try to be hopeful all the time, but there are days and times when I just plain out worry.  I guess the important thing is my attitude on life has changed a bit and I am not stressing over the little stuff and am doing my best to enjoy all the time I can with family and friends, and not putting off stuff that I have put off for years. Think of all of you daily and really hoping everyone is doing great. ",

JulieH - I hope your DH is doing well with his treatments and is in remission. I am still NED, yippy!, but still have checks every three months.  No scans, just physical checks and blood work (no tumor markers though).  Chemo brain is still around for me too MaryMeg, but it has gotten better, hopefully it will continue to improve.  It is definitely worse when I get tired. I am definitely stronger physically, exercising and eating better.  I acknowledge that my diet could be better, but I enjoy a couple of glasses of red wine a week, and I just love dark chocolate a little too much.  But my weight is staying steady, although I probably should loose about 3-5 pounds.  Also I am actually sleeping 7 hours at night most nights without taking anything to help me sleep, but still need some help sleeping at least 3-4 times a month.   So overall I believe I am doing well and I hope and pray everyone else is doing even better.   I wanted to let you know that all the support you showed me really helped and I try to encourage others I meet who unfortunately have to go on this journey to, to come and visit BCO and to join threads, especially during treatment, because it really helped me.  Thank you all!",

I went back to all of them and asked their opinon of what the others recommended and then did my own research.  The three were TC, AC+T and TAC.  Although there are studies for TC vs AC there wasn't enough information on TC vs AC+T.  Basically they all said AC+T would work just as well for me, it just carried the additional, yet small risk of heart issues down the road.  Based on my particular situation and health I chose DD AC+T and am doing what I can to prevent the SE which could impact my heart, etc...  plus since my nodes situation was a bit unknown I decided to be more aggressive otherswise I would have gone with TC. Anniemomofthree - good luch with the Cold Cap!!  Interested to know if it works, have heard mixed results. MarMeg - I love New Zealand!!! Spend 2 1/2 wondeful weeks there about 7 years ago and did not want to leave. Hugs to everyone as we start this new phase.  Edited to correct dosage on Glutamine, it should be 1 teaspoon.",

Hope it helps some of you.  JulieH - I am not doing Claritin at this time, I wanted to see if the vitamins and supplements I am taking, with the OK of my onc, works.  If not, then I will try the Claritin with the next round.  I was also told to take Tylenol 30 minutes before I get the shot, then every 6 hours as needed.  No motrin or aleve.  If I have problems then I am suppose to call to get something stronger like Vicodin. ",

The positives I have found so far, reconnecting with friends and family.  We are all so busy, but because of this damn crappy cancer we are all connecting more.  I have learned to have more patience, this is a biggy for me.  Still need to work on it more, but I am definitely making improvements on it.  I don't let what others think bother me as much, there are more important things in life now.  I actually went commando with my bald head and it felt great.  I don't care if people stare.  I have cancer damn it and I am going to beat it, if you don't like my bald head then don't stare.  Also planning for the future is no longer only for saving up for 10-20 years down the road, which we still do, but not as much, but we are making plans to enjoy more things as a family and as a couple now, even if it means just grabbing the tent and taking off for weekend (when the weather is better).    To those asking about alcohol -  my onc said one drink once or twice a week during the down time between chemo treatments was OK.  I did try a few sips of beer, but just didn't taste good, so I had DH finish it.  Tried red wine also, and that just didn't taste good either.  So I decided to just stay away from the alcohol.  Everyone is different though. What's with some of the text being italic, when I had it as regular text? ",

Oh, last week I finally felt some pain from the Neulasta shot (my third one).  Don't know why, it could be because I had cut back on the L-Glutamine powder or not.  Who knows, but wow, started with my arm, then leg, then I freaked when when my sternum was hurting.  When I realized what was happening.  I then ran into the kitchen and took some L-Glutamine powder and 2 tylenol and then I was fine in about an hour.  Hopefully that won't happen again.",

For those of you doing DD Taxol I just got back from my doctor appointment and tomorrow will be my infusion.  Basically this is her approach, every oncologist may do a different variation.  The will start me with pre-meds of Benedryl, Decatron, Zofran and an antacid (can't rememer which one).  Then they give me a small dose of the Taxol and watch me for a reaction for about 45 minutes.  If all goes well then they will proceed with the rest of the Taxol.  If I have a reaction, then the will deal with it and she will be seeing sooner than planned. There are no prescriptions for me to take this time.  If I have a problem with nausea, since I still have a few meds left from the first phase, she said I could take Zofran, Compazine (which I never used), or Ativan.   But she said most of her patients don't need any nausea medication.  If I end of needing it, then I am to also call her. She said the major side effect I might experience is bone/joint pain.  If so, I can start with Tylenol, if it doesn't work, I am to call her and she will get me a prescription for something stronger.  She said some patients still get a little constipated, so I should continue to drink Smooth Ease Tea if needed.  She says the constipation usually isn't as bad since her patients usually don't need to take the Zofran. So I have my fingers crossed that it will go smoothly.  We will see and I will let you know. Good luck to everyone.  Oh - Loved the dancing boots and the dance video too.  You ladies are wonderful. ",

I believe UTMom and MaryMeg still are not done with chemo yet, is that correct?  Anyone still going through chemo? marial - I had my last DD Taxol April 13th.  I stopped taking the L-Glutamine about two weeks after and seemed fine, so I decided to stop taking my B6/B12 and then I started getting numbness.  Started taking the B6/B12 again (50mg 2x/day) and it went away.  My MO said to keep taking the vitamins for at least another 6 months, maybe longer depending if symptoms return or not.  Then who knows how the Tamoxifen will factor into it with me either.  Sorry you got an infection.   All the stuff with fighting BC just keeps popping up.  But we are all going to win the battle!!! ",

JulieH - been thinking about you today. Hope all is going well and they have figured out what is causing the pain in your right arm. I finished radiation today, and didn't have to go to the ER.  It was close, my Neutrophils started to drop again, but I discussed it with my RO earlier in the week and he agreed that as long as I was feeling well and had no fever we would continue as long as my levels did not go below 1000, and they didn't.  He suggested that I wait a week or two just to give my body (aka blood levels) time to recover and then start the 5 years of Tamoxifen, but it is my decision.  I think I am going to wait a week and then start taking it on July 1st so I can add a little 'fun' to our family plans for the July 4th holiday. Hope everyone has a wonderful weekend. ",

(not really through exercise) and my doctor wants me to stabilize my weight and not loose any more.  In fact she would like me to gain at least 5 more pounds (in muscle preferrably).    I have basically given up coffee and alcohol.  I am only drinking green tea, ginger tea, tumeric tea, juice and water with lemon.  I now make myself fruit smoothies about 4-5 times a week and am eating more veggies and fruits throughout the day and with meals, making sure to have yogurt daily, and am paying attention to food labels and trying to eat healthy.  Oh, I am also eating fish, which I don't like, about once every 2 weeks.   I am exercising more, but still need to do more.  I have a recombinant bike and my goal is to do at least 20 miles a week, and do Pilates at home with a DVD about twice a week.  Although it is hard to do on those chemo weeks, so sometimes I fall a little short, but if I can't do all of it, I try to at least do some of it.  Once chemo ends I plan on signing up for Yoga and doing more outdoor stuff, like walking and hiking again. I am taking supplements, but what I take with be altered as I end chemo, start radiation, and then again when I start tamoxifen.  So I am making slow changes, but still have a ways to go, but feel like I am heading in the right direction.",

I am getting my port out on April 25 with my exchange surgery, so the PS will be doing it, so hopefully this means less scaring.  I hate my port.  Don't get me wrong, I am glad I got it for chemo, but I will be sooo glad when it is gone.  I think I am more excited about it getting removed than getting my new fake breasts.  I think for me the port removal signifies that chemo is truly over. Good luck to all of you with treatments this week.  This site has been such a blessing for me.  Thank you. ",

The only problem which showed up with the blood tests for me had to due with my high liver enzymes. Shot up after the first and then again after the last one. jcoutee - Yeah, almost done. tsundermann - Congrats on the exchange surgery and good luck on Friday with your rad sim.

I have been battling tears most of the day.  This evening I will be seeing numerous mutual friends at a school function and am dreading how to deal with conversations which I now will come up.   I honestly don't know how I am suppose sound upbeat, hopeful and honest about where I am in my fight, thankful for all the support my friends and community have given to me and my family, and at the same time deal with the concerns that we will all be sharing regarding our mutual friend without losing it emotionally.   I HATE CANCER!!!!!  No matter what kind.  A cure needs to be found DAMN IT and soon.   Thank you for being a safe place to vent. ",

Hope everyone one has a wonderful Happy Valentine's Day tomorrow.  Dark Chocolhate is suppose to be good for fighting cancer ",

JulieH - thanks for the info on the hand/foot syndrome, my onc told me the same thing today, that I had that along with my other rash, so the benadryl only worked on one, and the other just cleared up around the same time.  Mine was a late reaction to the AC and she said should not reappear with Taxol.  Got my labs back, my liver enzymes are high, so my Taxol is being reduced by 20% and my oncologist wanted me to decrease the L-Glutamine just in case it was effecting my liver.  So I am going to 10mg/ 2x day now.  Also my White Blood Count was high, so she wants me to skip the Neulasta shot - maybe I won't get a rash again.  I guess this is one way to find out if my other rash was a reaction to the shot or not. So I get my second Taxol tomorrow and then only 2 more left.  I can hardly wait.   You women have also inspired me to plan a nice family vacation this summer to Hawaii after I am done with RADS.  Thank you.",

Hope everyone has a wonderful weekend.  ",

Just like some of you have said, meantally I was great, but physically it took longer, and then it didn't help that I had the exchange so soon after.   I was anemic and had elevated liver enzymes (again) right before surgery, but they went ahead with the surgery because my WBC and Platets were OK. Of course I became more anemic and had issues last week with my temperature going up, but never over 100, and not feeling good generally. Today I am finally feeling like my body is recovering.  I retrospect, think the exchange surgery should have waited at least one more week, but I understand why my PS wanted to do so soon. Melanie_Anne - Hair, hmmm.  The existing hair on my head which did not fall out has grown a tiny bit, but I don't think any new hair on my head has sprouted yet. Hope you feel better with the new meds. JulieH - I will be starting rads on May 16. The tattoos were not bad. Got two of them. Did not feel one, the other one hurt like a really sharp pinch and the pain lasted for about a minute. Honestly though I do not understand why people would get a tattoo for fun. Just the thought of having the pinch over and over again in order to make a design does not sit well with me.  When I was younger I thought about getting one, so glad I never did.  I would have been a wimp and stopped the process without it being completed.  Wouldn't that have turned out pretty? JeanH - Yippy, one more to go, the end is near. moe0279 - That 3rd AC was the toughest for me too, and I know others in our group have said the same thing, and my oncologist told me for most of her patients, the 3rd AC is the toughest.  I had to start taking 1mg of Ativan every night I think after the second AC treatment and still take it every night. Talk with your onc and see if they can make any changes to your meds to help you through it.  You are almost done. You can do it.  Sending you {{{HUGS}}}.",

Went up to Lake Tahoa, wore my compression sleeves for the change in elevation, had no problems. Started Tamoxifen too, and so far so good. UTMom2014 - Hang in there, you are almost done with chemo.   Sorry about tooth issues. I had a fake tooth (cap) pop out during chemo. My MO said as long as the dental work was not done during my NADIR time it was OK. My dentist was great and came in over a weekend for me to fix it. What a great guy. tsundermann - Yep I am in chemo pause too and hoping those ovaries are shut down for good. My MO said for about 50% of woman in their mid-40s their ovaries stay shut down. However for the other 50% the ovaries can restart, even with low levels of estrogen. That's what you need to watch for. Because 5 years down when you are done with Tamoxifen if your ovaries start producing estrogen, even at low levels, if you are switched to an AI, it won't be effective on the estrogen produced by your ovaries. So you need to keep monitoring your estrogen levels. I might end up taking my ovaries out at that point. It is a wait and see approach, because they might say it is OK to take Tamoxifen for longer periods of time by then also. JeanH - My DH loves to rub my head because the hair it is soo soft. My hot flashes haven been tolerable. Started during chemo and have gotten a little bit more frequent with Tamoxifen, but so far manageable, although I just started last Friday with Tamoxifen. Knock on wood, hopefully it won't get bad. My hot flahes arrive like clock work though, start around 5pm, come in waves. But during the day nothing. Kind of wierd, but I will take it. bdavis - My eyebrows came roaring back. I was going to pluck them and my DH is begging me not too. He says I look cute with my soft fuzzy hair and dark, thicker eyebrows. So I will refrain for a while. Figured he has had to deal with quite a bit with all of this, so I make him happy with not plucking for a while. JulieH - Glad your skin has held up well during rads. Yeah, two more to go. Actually you are probably down to one as I type this. Tomorrow you will feel great, because one more phase of your treatment will be over. I started restorative yoga too (had to stop because of my neutrophil levels being low), but I really liked it and plan on starting up again once my levels have returned. Oh yeah, even though I finished rads a week and a half ago, I went for my lab work last Wed. and my Neutrophils had tanked to 900 again. Yep Neutropenia for me, so I stayed away from people up in Lake Tahoe and just relaxed on a deck reading a book. I felt great though. I think they dropped because two days after finishing rads I went with my older son to his Freshman Orientation (which was a long drive) and just did too much walking and not enough resting. Plus we did not get home until almost midnight the night before my blood test. So I get new labs drawn tomorrow and if they are good I am allowed to resume yoga again. Considering the problems I have had with my blood counts through radiation, I am so glad I was given the Neulasta shot during chemo, otherwise I don't think I would have made it through. chistine47 - How much Vitamin D have you been taking to get your levels up? My were low and I have been working to get them back up. I am taking between 2000-2500 IU a day. My MO said if my levels stay down with my next check up with her in a few weeks she might give me a prescription strenth dose. Enjoy this short work week.  ",

Tamoxifen is the only one which pre-menopausal can take.  Menopausal women can take either Tamoxifen or and AI, depending on their medical history. Make sure you have both an Estradiol and FSH blood tests done to make sure you are officially in menapause.  My MO said for accuracy purposes the FSH test should be done after you have been off of Tamoxifen for at least a month because the Tamoxifen can inter with those results and you don't want to switch to an AI if you are not truly in menapause because AIs do not block estrogen produced by ovaries.  ",

For me, and this is just me, my life with my children and husband is more important than having breasts (which were saggy anyways).  I plan on fighting this damn disease with everything I have and if the reconstruction gets in the way, I am ready to forgo it. I chose the BMX mainly because I wanted to decrease the chances for recurrance or a new cancer.  After getting my pathology report, I know I made the correct choice for me, because 2/4 nodes were positive.  But once again, that is me, every cancer is different as each person is unique.  So look at your own circumstances and current diagnosis and know that no matter what your family and friends will continue to love you and support you on this journey.  ",

I also live in CA and am being treated through the UC medical system and am very impressed with it so far.  You ladies are so informative and caring it is just so amazing and comforting that this community exists.  I wish it didn't, but grateful that it does.  You are all very inspiring with your postings.",

I had a 9% probability of further nodal involvement and was planning on aggressive chemo, and fell into the grey area for radiation. For me, the benefit of ALND was to see if additional nodes were involved and if the ones removed were, then they were removed (but there could still have been others left behind). It would have made no difference in the recommedation for chemo or radiation in my situation. So based on the information I had, I decided I didn't want to increase the risk of lymphedema with doing both.  I chose radiation because it was a field of radiation and not just going into there and scooping out an area. Have you seen a radiation oncologist yet? The reason I am asking is because sometimes they have a different opinion regarding the recommendation of radiation than a surgeon or medical oncologist, especially since you have LVI and some encapsulation. So a radiation oncologist may recommend rads even if you have an ALND. It is your choice and your body.  Best wishes. ",

The process on reconstruction was more than I had anticipated.  At first I had second thoughts about it and wondered if I should have even bothered with reconstruction.  But I am doing fine with it now that I have had my saline implants for about 6 weeks and know it was the correct decision.   Although having a MX with reconstruction is the same as BMX with reconstruction, recovering would be a little bit more difficult because you have impacted both sides with the BMX.  Both arms will be affected.  Have to sleep on your back longer too.",

So he puts me on anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxants and wants me to do physical therapy. I ask if there is a possibility of bone mets and he said he didn't think so but the X-Rays will be reviewed by a radiologist. Two days later get a call telling me that the DDD is extensive and I need an MRI, but no further comment on it this could be bone mets, and no physical therapy until further testing is completed. So now I am waiting on the MRI to be scheduled. Do you think I should be advocating for DEXA scan or PET/CT Scan on top of the MRI or is that too much and I should just wait for the MRI results? I did have a PET/CT a little over two years ago and it was clear. Thank you for any advise/wisdom.",

Must be a candidate for breast XRT. - Must be at high risk of regional recurrence, due to: positive axillary nodes, or negative axillary nodes and primary tumor 2 cm or greater or primary tumor at least 5 cm or greater and less than 10 axillary nodes removed and one of the following: ER-, SBR grade 3 or lymphovascular invasion. - Sentinel node pts. are eligable if they are node negative, but still meet criteria for high risk pts. If positive sentinel nodes, must have a level I and II ALND. Edited: Thanks TonLee for that link for more details on the study, I was typing and didn't see it until after I posted. ",

I had a really tough time with the ddAC portion of the regimen and had to go out on medical leave, I think mainly because I didn't get enough sleep/rest (if lucky about 4 hours a day). Once I stopped working and started taking meds to help me sleep life improved and I thought I could go back to work during the Taxol portion, but my MO wanted me to stay out, so I did. I had issues related to concentration, couldn't remember words when communicating with others, forgot things easily, got irritable because I knew I was wasn't communicating like I should be. What I think helped me was playing lots of brain games, even if I lost or they took my longer to do (scrabble, suduko, chess, etc...), reading (even if I had to take notes to remember what I just read), keeping a journal, leaving post-its all over and setting my alarm so I would not forget things, and exercise/yoga. Things improved over time and when I went back to work I still wasn't back to where I was before but could function and produce good work, although it took me longer than before. Now I am 2.5 years out from finishing chemo and I don't see any impact on my work (and neither does my employer - good reviews). I still think I experience minor effects from chemo, but only my DH notices them now, then again maybe it is just because I am getting older and I just want to blame it on chemo brain.  ",

From what I have read, and in discussions with others, I think that Tamoxifen does both, delays the growth of stray BC cells because it starves the BC from it's source of food, which can result in the cancer being destroyed because it starves to death.   The trick to me is what to do after 5 years on Tamoxifen in case there are still some cancer cells laying dormant waiting for the environment to change so they can start growing again.  I am working on improving my bodies environment so that when I am done with Tamoxifen my immune system will be stronger, but still need to consider whether to move to an AI, have ovaries removed, use alternatives such as DIM or grape seed, etc...   It will be interesting to see what the recommendations will be in 5 years.",

Mammogram found two tumors this past fall year.  DCIS and IDC (1.3cm).  No one was ever able to feel either tumor during a physical exam, and they tried to feel them with ulta-sound guidance. So for me, I am appreciative of having a mammogram on a yearly basis.  They might not catch everything, but for some one like it, it did. ",

Start doing your homework on who would like to get opinons from now, contact them and tell them of your situation, what you would like to consult with the doctor about (and if you might be wanting the doctor to treat you), and what type of information they need (definitely a pathology report and any other test results), how far in advance they need you to schedule an appointment, and then you can plan accordingly. If you question the findings of the biopsy, you can request that the slides be sent out to another lab. If your doctors want you to have therapy (chemo and/or rads) before surgery and you are not comfortable with that, definitely get additional opinions with the findings of your tests so far. This is the worst part of the journey, not knowing all the information on what exactly you need to do to fight this crappy cancer. Once you know what you are facing, get a treatment plan in place, it really allows you to just concentrate on winning the fight.

The majority of everyone I consulted with agreed with my decision, not all, two really thought I should not go outside the 'standard of care' and that I should radiate my chest wall too.   Once I made the decision, I felt very comfortable with it.  It actually removed some of the stress I was feeling. Every situation is different, I would suggest to get at least two opinions from radiation oncologists before making a decision that you are comfortable with.  It is your body, your decision.   Good luck and feel free to PM me.",

I am a worry wart lately too.  I did call the on-call doctor I think three times with stuff about my drains until they came out, and then of course the call when I had fluid build up.   I figured better to be safe than sorry.   My husband keeps telling me never to be afraid to call your doctor.  Your fight against cancer is too important to be hesitant over making a phone call. ",

I just picked up my compression sleeves yesterday on the advise of a physical therapist. She said I could wear them actually during the treatment and the RO is fine with that. She told me to use them, when appropriate, all throughout my 5 weeks of radiation and then for a month or two afterwards to help minimize the risk of LE, then we can re-evalute afterwards when I should use them. I only had a SNB, I refused the ALND, but the risk is still there. KCMomx3  - thank you for those encouraging words. ",

TonLee - my understanding is that we are to avoid aluminum and anything which contains 'metals' in it.  My RO said some soaps have 'metals' in them and to stay clear of them too, he recommended Dove soap.  I was also told a combo of cornstarch and baking soda works as a deordorant and is OK to use too.  Tomorrow is my first day to get zapped.  Will be buying 25 lottery tickets on my way there.  Absolutely love that idea and hope to win some money to spend on my vacation when this is all over with.",

For me the risk of rads to my chest wall was too much vs the potential benefit.   I am 46, but with my family history of cancer, although I am BRCA neg., I wanted to keep something in my arsenal in case I got a local recurrance, because once you radiate, you usually can't radiate the area again.  I hope that with the treatments I am doing there will not be a recurrance, but I also know there are no guarantees and I had to do what I thought was best for me. Good luck, and once again, feel free to PM me. ",

JulieH - Hi again.  I read that a baking powder / cornstarch combo is suppose be safe and works well.  Others have mentioned  you can use a rollon called \"Crystal\" which you can by at Trader Joes during Rads.  I have been using Crystal since my dx but forgot to ask my RO if I could use it during treatment or not, oops.
