I am going this route to improve the radiated area in preparation for an implant. This option was more appealing to me than a lat flap + implant. Prior to the tissue expander, I will have 2 more graft procedures, each 3 months apart. I will report my future progress for anyone that may be considering this option. Thanks to all of you wonderful ladies for the information you share on this site. I have learned so much and feel that this is a great place to find options for our continued journey Hugs! Lorraine",
