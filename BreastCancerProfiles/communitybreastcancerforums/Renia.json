We had an appoitment with an oncologist last week, and with radiation oncologist as well. Now we got the results of the oncotype, which means starting radiation next. I called to make the appoitment for simulation ( the first one) and Dr Fein is on vacation next week, so the first one I got is on the 30th. Then it takes about 10 days for the department to get all arranged, and she will start her radiotherapy in mid May, or so. I am concerned that it is taking too long from the surgery to additional therapy. Does it matter how long you wait? I would imagine waiting to long is an issue, but how long is to long? A month or two? Please let me know your thoughts.",

We had the appointment with general surgeon on the 11th and he refereed us to a colleague who is a breast surgeon and who most likely will take over the case. I was told that we should expect a surgery in the last week of Feb or first week of March. I am worried that we are waisting too much time, and not acting sooner. Please let me know, as even though I was reassured that the time elapsing between diagnosis and surgery is not too long, I am still worried. I welcome any advice, Renata  Log in to post a reply",
