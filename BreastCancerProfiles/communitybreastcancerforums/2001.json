    "Content": "2001 wrote: i have mild lymphedema in my right hand...in the hand span part of my hand.  It just developed after a skin sparing/.nipple sparing mastectomy.  11 years ago I had lumpectomy and 8 nodes removed.  I guess during this skin/nipple sparing mastectomy they cut into the lymjphatics and that is what caused mild lymphedema.  What if I need future breast surgery on tha side, will it cause lymphedema to get worse?  Or does it depend on if they are doing surgery on lymph nodes/vessels?
