In ref to radiation..my onc wants me to have..but he is the \"throw the whole book at it\" type.  I have read everything I can find on it and it appears I am under the standard \"line\" for \"you NEED to do it\".  Its if your tumor was over 5 cm and you were positive in more than 7 lymphs.  The percentage that it will come back in the site that had MX with radiation is only slightly higher than without ..and both are extremely small.  Also, the survival rate percentage is the same.  I have decided not to have it as the side effects and possible risk of lymphedemia...not to mention..cancer again (!)..is not worth it since I am below the level anyway.  I had surgeon test skin that was left and I was clear.  The chemo..I want..if there is a cell in my toe I want it out!!   ",

I'm starting to lose my hair a bit now...I had it buzzed day after chemo..so not that startling yet..and hairs are short so its ok. It..ugh..other places that is weird.  Course what hasn't been weird about all this? My BFF for the past 20 years..was hit by a city trash truck while riding a moped Thurs.  She was airlifted to Charlotte and has a concussion, broke arm and they had to take her leg.  I am soo happy that is all!  Its amazing she wasn't hurt worse or killed.  She's always been extremely active and she will get through this..but it puts my issues in perspective as well.  On a great note, when she comes awake briefly..she is herself..positive and appreciating humor..I told her..that she really needed to quit being competitive with me ..no need to \"top\" me!  She smiled and said I couldn't have all the attention.",

I had wierdest time after my chemo..took until day 6..then felt great..day 11 dawned and was like I was sucker punched!  Felt same as I did on day 3 when chemo feeling hit. It wasnt until day 13 that I felt good again. I guess my counts dropped.  I really hadn't expected that after only one treatment. Rambo-Very happy you had felt GREAT..this makes you really grateful for the good days, huh? Villa-I had same issue on middle of the night..kinda queazy stomach--I would get up ..half asleep and eat 3 saltines with 3 small slices of hard cheddar and it settled my stomach.  I love oatmeal..steel cut..butter, salt and pepper..but have to have it with boiled egg or bacon (or both!)..but CRAVED grits the day of chemo and day after, when those horrible steroids were in me. Im glad all of ya'll are starting to feel better!  Heres to good days until the hit us again!  ",

I thought I might back up a month to get more feedback as I know ya'll are past where I am.  So here goes...I have a tentative appt today with surgeon in case I need to get any removed..but main fup appt is Tuesday. One, I know, is not ready does at least 50-70 per day (down from 110, though)..but the 2nd one has never done much. but has always been around 35. 2 days ago it didnt do anything, but my husband squeezed out lines as we thought might be clogged. so then I did about 30 in the next 24 hours..my question is..I think I could possibly go ahead and get this one taken out, but not sure if I should rush it as it is on the border of 30..if it was earlier in the week, I would keep for another day or so..however, Tuesday seems forever...butttt, I will still have this other in and would I be able to feel a difference without this one drain.  I am still taking lortabs due to it hurts where they go in at, plus other pain in top of where breast use to be..I've just heard horror stories of getting them out too soon.  Can anyone help with any advice..?  Greatly appreciated!",
