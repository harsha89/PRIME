They've both said my case doesn't fall into one of the \"buckets\" with the Oncotype test, and the result (16) is a grey area... I'm thrilled with the score, but the tumor was large...so, it's kind of a contradiction.",

This Dr. Had me first write down his cell phone number, and welcomed me to call him at any time with any questions or concerns. He then explained that he spoke to my BS. PS, and MO before meeting with me and went over my entire med file. He does think that there is a benefit to me by doing rads, because it was a large tumor in a smaller type body shape... But would not recommend radiating the lymph nodes under my arm or over my collarbone. He said the SNB was absolutely clear and there's no benefit to doing that much radiation, for me...and because of my age (43 considered young) he would recommend it. He was very compassionate and caring, asked how my boys were handling things. Said that it may be helpful to set up my appts for after school so the boys could come with me and they would let them operate the equipment and push the button, to take any fear or anxiety away... I still have until a month after chemo ends to decide, but he said it would potentially reduce my \"local\" recurrence rate from 15% down to 5%.... so lots to think about. But, I feel very comfortable with him....",

Had breakfast, got the kids ready / to school, went to the PS to get \"filled\", went to my office for a bit to catch up, then met my husband for lunch. Feeling pretty good, but cold! It's 17 here and windy! My chemo \"class\" was short on details too (like toothbrushes, nail polish, mouth sores, etc). I heard 99% of it here on these boards. My theory is that they don't want to tell you too much, because it can be scary and make you more anxious than you need to be. My MO gave me her cell # and told me to call her at any time with questions or concerns, she didn't know which SE I may or may not have, but would address them as they came up. Thankfully, besides being achey (from the Neulasta), I've haven't suffered any other side effects yet, so, I don't want to obsess about them either. For me, the worst part of starting chemo was thinking about starting chemo and the anxiety of having horrible SE. Luckily, I've been feeling pretty good, and I'm sure will be less anxious when my second treatment comes up. Now I don't have that \"fear of the unknown\"",

My MO, when I asked her said, \"I don't think so, but, I'm not a radiological oncologist, and you have the right to an opinion from one.... So, she referred me (twice as it turns out, couldn't stand the 1st guy). Long story short, even with great margins (they both agreed to that), and no nodal involvement. They explained that my Low Oncotype score (16) is for Distant recurrence, not local recurrence, and since I'm \"so young\" (43, hahaha, don't feel so young) and tumor was larger than 2 inches, the protocol is to at least do rads to the incisional scar, bring down my 10 year local recurrence rate of 15% to under 5%.... My MO said that she totally agrees after hearing it explained that way and is glad she referred me to the head of this well respected group. Interestingly, one of her colleagues, a male MO, went thru BC a couple of years ago and also agreed to the incisional scar radiation. My cancer was on the right side, so I'm less worried about heart issues. I do have a lot of time to decide... Wouldn't start until a month after Chemo....",

Healing really well and feel about 85% back to normal (physically, anyway). My Oncotype score is 16, 10 w 5 years of Tamaxofin... So there was some back and forth on whether or not to do the chemo, but, I've decided to go ahead with it. Also, had a meeting about radiation on Friday that left me very confused. I had a good size tumor (ILC) but everyone agrees that the surgeon got exceptionally good margins. Surgeon and oncologist said they didn't think I'd need radiation, and really were on the fence with the chemo, but \"you have a right to get an opinion from a radiological oncologist\"... He recommends rads, too! Ugh.... Because of my age 43... And it was a large tumor. He said because of the clear nodes, and really good margins and pretty low Oncotype score, I don't fit into any \"bucket\", but if I were his wife, he would recommend rads. He is going to discuss with his tumor board (8 of them) and we will meet again on Jan 11th... He said they wouldn't even start rads until after chemo, so relax and absorb the info. He also said: \"given your profile (test results, etc) I'm not wrong if I decided not to do rads, or even chemo for that matter, but, we have no way of knowing if you're right, either\".... So confusing.,",

It was a tough decision, but I'm glad I made it. It definitely helped that my MO is female, young (about 37-38 ish) and is considered brilliant. She went into BC oncology because her Mom had breast cancer 16 years ago. I also have 3 young children (7,9,16) and I'm determined to do everything aggressively to be here to see them grow up. If I was 65-75 with my \"scorecard' I probably would not hesitate, and would turn down the chemo with an Oncotype score of 16 with no nodal involvement and no vascular invasion.",

Didn't want to wait \"for the other shoe to drop\" with mammograms, us, MRI on \"good\" breast. I'm a nervous type when it comes to waiting on medical results. I know myself very well, and didn't want to put myself through that. 4. My type of cancer has a 20-30% chance of at some point appearing in the opposite breast. 5. After consulting with a PS and going over everything, he said he'd do whatever I wanted, but wanted to disclose that matching a brand new breast to a 43 year old breast is cosmetically very difficult and wanted to make sure I was aware of that.

The good thing about your Dr is that he's very proactive.

That's an indication that your doctor is interested in gathering as much information as he/she can before making a treatment recommendation to you. They will also take into consideration your ER PR and her status, lymph node involvement, LVI, (lymphnovascular invasion, if any) your age, any existing health concerns, etc before devising your treatment plan. I did do chemo, even with a low Oncotype score because things like my age (43) otherwise good health, and size of tumor, trumped the low Oncotype score in the end. I got thru it with very little side effects. Stay strong and occupied until you know what your plan will be. Joyce",

You're right about imaging and ILC (invasive lobular cancer), I never missed a mammogram since I was 32 (maternal aunt had BC) and the fact that my MO said the tumor was probably there (just not able to be picked up on imaging) thru a few mammograms, sealed the deal on a BMX. I would have to get MRI's and ultrasounds every six months and emotionally that was just too much for me. I know myself very well, and didn't want to wait for the other shoe to drop. Now, if it was a different type of cancer, and less likely to recur in the opposite breast, I'd have to think about that. The other thing that made me decide on BMX: I have dense breasts, so even more difficult to detect changes. I just mentally came to an end after getting various opinions and thought \"enough is enough, my breasts fed 3 babies, they did what they were meant to do, now I feel like they're turning on me\" and that was that... I couldn't wait for the BMX surgery to be over. But, women feel very different about this issue, and everyone's feelings are valid.",

Some of us come to BC with other issues like diabetes, previous cancers, advanced age, etc. As for me, I don't have any other health issues, I eat well, exercise, normal weight, blood pressure, etc... BC was a complete shock. But, I'm tolerating TC pretty well. I haven't had any nausea, so haven't had to take the added meds they give you for that SE. I have had fatigue which hits on day 3-4 after treatment, but, I've still been able to function and take care of my kids (7,9,16). My biggest SE has been bone pain from the Neulasta shot, but found a tip on here to take Claritin and that actually works... I've lost my hair, but have had to nail or mouth sore issues. I own my own company, so I've been very fortunate in that regard. I've become like Howie Mandel with a fear of germs, so I've been lucky to just come and go at the office as I see fit. I don't want to pick anything up that would land me in the hospital or delay treatment. I feel about 80% of myself for the week before the next treatment, and make it a point to get in 30 minutes of exercise, usually on the treadmill everyday, which is less than what I was doing before my BMX surgery (at least an hour a day)",

About 3 weeks into radiation a large lump popped up on my neck (left side, under my ear about an inch). Well, my Drs absolutely freaked. Because it was on the opposite side from my BC and I had no positive nodes, no LVI, they were pretty confident that it didn't have anything to do with BC. However, lymphoma was a concern. I underwent two ultrasounds, and 3 CT scans in the past few months to monitor it. Everything looked good, glad I got those scans because I probably wouldn't otherwise being stage II. All radiologist reports indicated that it was a left cleft brachial cyst, which is a congenital birth defect. When were forming in utero, we have \"gills\" on both sides of our neck that should seal and close up. Mine did not. After keeping an eye on it for several months (sometimes they go down on their own) my RO and MO decided to send me to an ENT surgeon. I'm thankful they did. He being more of an expert could see that it was wrapped around my jugular and needed to be removed ASAP. I had that surgery on Friday. The mass on imaging was about 3 cm. When he removed it, it was larger than a golf ball, and fluid filled. It was benign. Very scary. Maybe you could ask for a referral to an ENT surgeon? Btw, the consensus from all Drs was that the stress of surgery, chemo and radiation caused it to react at this time.",

So, I think your doctor is spot on, and you should get the MRI, which chances are, will be \"all clear\", but will give you a baseline as you get older.

She did take Zofran for nausea, but worked through it, did radiation at the same time as chemo, and had no hair loss! It was a serious cancer, too. Anaplastic astrocytoma, Grade III, Stage III. With all of the fund raising and hype over BC, don't you think there would be better treatments, more advances by now? I just read that the Komen foundation spends 40% of every dollar raised on \"awareness\" campaigns and another 20-25% on corporate fees and other programs not directly related to BC. How much of our donation $$$ is actually going to research? Anyone know?",

It tends to form a \"line\" of cancer cells, rather than a \"lump\" and it very difficult to detect. It was the same for me. My MO said that my ILC tumor was probably present thru my last 2-3 mammograms. It was only detected because a more astute radiologist noticed a \"pulling\" of breast tissue on my last mammogram that he thought looked suspicious. It was never felt by me, my Gyn, the BS the PS or the MO. All examined me before surgery. Scary! With ILC there is a much higher chance, about 30%, that at some time it will appear in your opposite breast. So, because of that and a few other reasons, I decided on BMX. Coincidentally, while I was in surgery, MY SIL's surgeon called her with the results of her biopsy!!! She had a walnut size area of DCIS with a very small amount of IDC in the center. She chose a lumpectomy and started radiation last week. Some in our family are questioning her lumpectomy too. But....most people don't realize that there are different types of BC and they have different characteristics. How's the weather where you are??? If it's nice, go outside for a walk! I'd much rather that than my treadmill. But, use the treadmill for yucky days like snow, cold, or rain. Joyce",

So, don't let your mom being petite worry you too much. Will you or someone else be able to help her with things like laundry, groceries, dinner etc, because she will feel fatigue.",

One of my technicians just went thru BC radiation, so she promised to walk me thru and answer / address any concerns as they come up. Oh, I have to wear a t shirt over my bathing suit this summer, and cannot be exposed to sun.... Delightful I was also taken \"upstairs\" to meet Abby Peck, former Olympian.

She passed away last August, after being breast cancer free for 18 years. She had a UMX, chemo, radiation and was in the group of the first BC patients to get tamoxifen. She did very well for many years (diagnosed mid 40's), and was monitored closely at first, then annually. I don't know the exact details of what went down, but, according to my Mom, her sister: After she and my uncle retired and moved from CT to DE, she got a new dr who told her after ten years, BC free, the standard was to just do a mammogram annually on her remaining breast. She was in good health other than borderline diabetes. Well, once the recurrence was discovered (fatigue, pain in liver) she went to Johns Hopkins and was told that she should have had more followup than just a mammogram annually.... What that was, I don't know, but by the time the recurrence was discovered, it was in her liver, bones, and brain. I don't know what the answer is, but, I think I want to be monitored closely.",

Diagnosed mid-October, did lots of research and got lots of opinions. Decided on a bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. I have ILC, SNB was negative and Oncotype is 16 (just got that back). Before surgery the doctors (3) consensus was to do chemo, now, they're \"split\" because of the 16 score (10 w 5 years of Tamoxifin). My oncologist, whom I love (she's young, really smart, specializes in BC because her mom had it 16 years ago, still doing fine),said that she'd do the chemo... So, I'm going to do it., Starting the week between Christmas and New Years (woo hoo). She said: TC 4x... What am I in for? I'm 43, otherwise healthy, used to exercising, not overweight, she said it's very important NOT to gain weight during chemo. I'm 5'7 and weigh 153, didn't lose one pound during surgery and 4 days in hospital... How could that be? Breasts had to weigh something?!?! So unfair., So, I'm nervous, because she emphasized this... And exercise, and said that she was sure I'd be fine and it's only 12 weeks, Any tips? Please?",

It's a guys place to get a haircut, but they do have two women who work there and I've seen them both occasionally when I bring the boys. Well, I walk in today and one if them exclaims in front of everyone \"omg! Your hair looks great!\" Cooper (my 7 yr old) climbs up into her chair. She starts asking mt 20 questions!!! Where did you get it done? Is it low lights plus highlights? Why did I get it cut? Do you like it shorter? How long does it take the hairdresser to do it? She went ON and ON!!!! If we werent in an open room 25x25 with about 8-10 men and boys present, I would've stopped her and told her it was a wig! But, I sat there sweating bullets and answering her... Meanwhile Cooper is looking at me with his eyes as big as saucers and a little grin on his face! I swear to god, I thought he was going to \"out\" me! This is the same kid that said to the waitress at Olive Garden on Sunday, when she asked me if I wanted a sample of wine...\"she can't, she's on chemo\" !!! Ugh....",

I know for me, every ache and pain is analyzed in my head, over and over. It's paralyzingly painful. Remember when I went thru that period where my alkaline phosphatase level was raised and my MO told me 3 times it was because of chemo? Finally, she said \"I'm confident it's raised because of the chemo, but, I'm going to order a bone scan because I can see that you're not able to move forward without it\". I was terrified of that bone scan, but she was right... At my last appt with her, she told me that her Mom (BC survivor 16 years) was in that day for bloodwork and called my MO after meeting with her own oncologist. She said that her Mom asked her \"tell me the truth, is my bloodwork really ok?\" \"Look up to see if he (mo) wrote any notes that he didn't tell me about\" She really gets the anxiety that we feel, yet is calming at the same time. I've thought of talking to someone about this anxiety, but really, unless they have BC, they can't really know what I'm going through... I wish there was some kind of scanner in my shower that would beep if I had anything to worry about, then I'd get it out of my head for the day!",

I literally had an instant headache and stayed in all day today, just left the house to pick up the boys after school. Oh, and my friend whose daughter has strep throat dropped off a lasagna for us. I cooked the heck out of it!",

He said radiation causes anemia, so they keep a close watch on your blood levels.

Oh, if it were only that simple! Anyone else see the news about breast cancer being over diagnosed? Made me so mad! From so many posts that I read on BCO I've come to the conclusion that doctors need continuing education with breast cancer... There are so many posts from women on this board that make me say \"What was that Dr thinking?\" it's crazy. I'm very thankful for the treatment that I've received since I've been diagnosed, but in the back of my head, I worry about screening and health care in this country for women. Right when I was diagnosed, the news was about recommending women not be screened until they're 50...I'm 43. And every three years is good enough with pap smears... My PS made a statement to me when I was trying to decide about chemo (Oncotype 16). He said,\"if you lived in the UK or Canada and had negative nodes, you'd be done right now. You wouldn't even be given a choice. But, the US had a 29% higher survival rate for BC.\" I do worry about women coming behind us and the Oncotype test. I can definitely seeing insurance companies refusing to cover women like me with low risk scores. My Drs have been pretty vocal that coverage will change, not fir the better, if health care is mandated. I'm sure youve all read posts from women in UK and elsewhere that wait WEEKS for mammograms, biopsies, test results, it's scary. Just my thoughts...",

He an admitted control freak, but I have to say, he's my favorite doctor on my team and he does really excellent work. As far as Tamoxifin v AI... I really don't know. My MO just said because I'm premenopausal and ER and PR positive, I'd be doing Tamoxifin for 5 years... It was also stated on my Oncotype test results, specifically Tamoxifin. I'm sure someone on here will know why. Welcome to the group! Joyce",

And... Anyone else experiencing this? When my drains were put in under my BMX on both sides, it's sore.

For me, before my BMX, I met with my MO and she said based upon the size of the tumor, and my age 43 (considered young for BC) she was 90% sure I'd be doing chemo. Then my Oncotype score came in at 16, so she was \"on the fence\". She told me that \"you wouldn't be wrong to turn down chemo, but I can't tell you that you'd be right either\" because I didn't fit into any \"box\" that made it clear cut. I didn't have any node involvement, and no vascular invasion. It was a tough decision, but we did decide to go ahead with chemo. I'm doing 4 TC (3rd is this Thursday). She did tell me that her group (10 MO's) uses 11 as the cutoff for young, otherwise healthy patients. And also, with that low of a score she would not prescribe any chemo that may cause heart damage later on. I've heard other women refer to TC as \"chemo lite\" and while I would never agree to that, it hasn't been too terribly bad and I mentally feel more confident knowing that I did what I could to prevent a recurrance. I know some will not agree with me, but, I just think that the Oncotype score is just one tool to be used to determine recurrance and if one should or shouldn't do chemo. You need to be confident and believe in your own decisions. Good luck tomorrow!",

I definitely do not want to regain any weight, as I feel so much bettet and have so much more energy at 153 as opposed to the heavier weight. So, I'm concerned with that and that the oncologist stressed that women that don't gain weight, have better outcomes.... She did say (and she's very naturally thin) that chemo does have a tendency to make you gain a little bit of weight, but alot of women, over eat in the weeks between treatment, anticipating that they are going to be sick and lose weight in the week after treatment, and they (her patients) don't end up being as physically sick as they feared.  So, she said to be aware of that. I've prepared my kids about my hair loss..... (three boys: 7,9 &16).  I've reassured them that the cancer is not going to cause me to lose my hair, but the medicine that will help make the cancer not come back will make me lose my hair, that was reassuring to them).  I also made them all laugh when I suggested that they shave their heads in support of me....hahaha! They all said, that's ok, but, we're not doing that! (They all have buzz cuts anyway)",

Interestingly, my PS put me through a bunch of range of motion and strength tests before the surgery, and I'm physically fit. I'm concerned about weight gain because: psychologically I know it will be hard for me to take one more thing! I just recently lost 30 lbs and am very happy right now with my weight. My oncologist said some weight gain is normal, but to watch. She said a lot of women overeat between chemo in anticipation of being sick...and a good number aren't that sick after all. Also, she said that in her experience, women with a healthy weight do better during and after treatment. There's actually a gym attached to the facility that I will receive my chemo and my insurance covers the membership (it's owned by the Drs in her practice). She also recommended swimming and again said she'd write a prescription for it so I could use an indoor pool near my home that is located in a rehab hospital.",

If you took that test out of the equation, according to my MO, you'd do chemo because the tumor was larger than 2cm. My score was 16, no nodal involvement, no vascular invasion, larger tumor, but low Oncotype score. After going back and forth, I decided to go ahead with chemo. I'm 43, no other health issues, tolerating TC (just did 3 of 4 on Thursday) well. If I were over 65 with a 16 Oncotype score, I think I would have have done the chemo. But at 43 with three boys to raise and a tumor over 2 cm, my gut was telling me to do it. Your score of 5 is so low.... My MO's group uses 11 as a cutoff for chemo, but I'm thinking it's mostly women. Although, one of the MO's himself (Dr Heim, Scranton PA) had breast cancer. Maybe look him up? I think the size of your tumor is the difficult part in the decision?",
