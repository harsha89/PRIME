My biopsy was Jan 22nd and got my results Wed. Jan 27....B9 intraductal papilloma.... I have another biopsy scheduled for my left breast.  Please - Please - Please try not to surf the net for additonal information. You will find yourself on the computer for hours...day-in and day-out.  This kind of thing can stress you out...and believe me, I know....just last weekend I broke-out in hives from stressing about my results.  Please try to do something to kept your mind off of your results...Do know that you are in my thoughts and prayers...and you are going to be fine.

      "Content": "Inspireme wrote: Was wondering has anyone here experienced some bloody/yellowish watery discharge in one breast? I have a history of fibrocystic disease.  My doctor discovered a brown-yellowish discharge in my breast back in Sept 09.  Had the mammogram and was told by radiologist that nothing could be found and it appeared to be fine.  So I continued to have this discharge only when the nipple is squeezed.  2 weeks ago, I squeeze my nipple while taking a shower and this time blood was present.  Since then I've had the mammogram and ultrasound (which showed a mass behind the nipple) and just last Monday, I had the MRI which showed abnormalities in both breast. I was told that they were going to focus on the right breast having the discharge.  Now, I am scheduled to have a biopsy on Thursday, Jan 21st.  Currently, I am experiencing a slight discomfort similar to lactating breast pain. I am so terrified... trying to prepare myself for the worst and praying for the best outcome.  I know that God will not give me more than I can handle. Let me back up.... A little about me.... I am 47 years old, married with a 22 yr old daughter and a 17 year son.  2004 I had a partial hysterectomy, and 2007, had emergency surgery to have a ruptured cyst and ovaries removed. Since 2007 I've been on HRT - Hormone Replacement Therapy.  My mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer (stage IV) in Feb. 2006 and died Nov. 22, 2006.
