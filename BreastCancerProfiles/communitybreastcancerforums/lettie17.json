Yes, I agree with geekyknitte and kcat2013.  Waiting is really no fun at all.  As if nobody understands that we need the answers right away.  Just take a deep breath... fill yourself with positive energies.  I know it's easier said than done, but just try.  Don't stress yourself out, because cancer feeds on stress.  Just try your best to do everything as normal... in fact, if you are in an exercise class, do more of it until your planned surgery... eat as healthy as you can... and just enjoy each day the best way you can.  Those are the things I learned while I was in-waiting as well.  Tips from cancer-survivor friends.   I just had bilateral mastectomy about 3 weeks ago, and I recovered quickly with no swelling, no unmanageable pains that I only took vicodin for a day; drains out by the 10th day.  My doctors said that these can be attributed to my active lifestyle prior to surgery.   I am not cancer-free yet though.  The tissues taken out from my breasts showed bigger cancer size (though still contained in the duct), but positive margins.  So, my breast surgeon has to go in again in 3-4 months when my expanders will be exchanged with implants.   Of course, I am getting so impatient also waiting for that 3-4th month, as only then will they be able to find out if indeed my surgeon will successfully get clear margins and that no cancer cells will be left behind. But, it's okay; I just have to keep on the fight. Sure, I have my ups and downs, too.  Thanks to this site, where we can vent and also share. Cheers, MakeLemonade!  I hope you get the results quick and I wish you can make the right decision when it comes.   ",
