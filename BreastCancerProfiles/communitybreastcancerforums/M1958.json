If they say I need a biopsy then we'll go have it done. If that comes back showing cancer then and only then will I set my children down and tell them. I don't believe in putting it out on FB. I will have to let other family members know, but my kids come first. They are all grown but will still be hard for them as they have seen alot of our family members die from this disease. I am looking positively at this and telling myself that the chances are great that they caught it early if it comes back as cancer. Thank you for listening to my story. I feel thankful that this site is here so I can talk freely about myself and what I am and may be going through.",

And if turns out benign then no harm no foul, they won't have to go through the needless worry. Bad enough the 2 of us are in limbo and waiting for Tuesday.Another reason behind my holding off till the last guns fired is my daughter's having some medical issues herself. Her Dr just ran some tests on her because her kidneys are not functioning properly, and she's lost alot of weight that was not planned, so they are checking her for Lupus first and if that's negative then they start looking at cancer. So she has enough on her plate right now. And my 2 boys know that she's having some problems, so no need to tell them anything until I have to.",

My mother died of colon cancer at the age of 55, her mother died of pancreatic CA at the age of 80, she had a sister with breast CA, one with myeosarcoma, and another with basal cell carcinoma. Alot of my cousin's have had different cancers, lymphoma, leukemia, kidney, lung, malignant melanoma, and some of their children have had cancer also. This is all on my mother's side. My brother was diagnosed almost 5 years ago with stage 4 nonHodgkin's lymphoma large B cell, he's been in remission 4 years. I myself have had pre cancer of the cervix at the age of 32 and a polyp removed from my colon at the age of 35. Well here's my story: I had my yearly mammogram on 2/20/2017 on 2/21/2017 the day before my birthday they called to tell me they found microcalcifications in my right breast and I need to come in for a diagnostic mammogram. They had wanted me in yesterday, but we have plans with family and friends to celebrate my birthday today, and did not want to be the bearer of bad news. So I go in on Tuesday to have it done and I was told that I need to stay until it's read and they decide what we do from there. I am feeling a little anxious but not bad, as I'm an RN and know what the drill is but the part that bothers me most is if the results are bad, I have to tell my kids and my family. My husband already knows and will be there with me when I go Tuesday. I should also note that I have heterogeneous breast tissue. Thank you for listening. Log in to post a reply",

With all the cancer in my family I'm leaning towards a mastectomy if need be. My husband says he'd still love me breast or no breast. My aunt was given the option of tumor removal from her right leg/ thigh or amputation of the whole leg. She asked her surgeon if she was his mother what would he tell her he said amputation and that's what she chose. The tumor was mid thigh and a strong chance with removal of tumor only it would spread. Her choice gave her 35 more years. So right now she's my inspiration if it comes down to lumpectomy or mastectomy. I choose the later.",

But they want to follow me for the next 18 months with mammograms done every 6 months x 3. To see if it changes and if I notice any changes at all to let my PCP know immediately. It's very small lateral right breast down n deep. Husband's still a little worried about the diagnosis and the fact that they want to watch it for 6 months. So we'll see now we play the waiting game.

I too am in a waiting game but much older, I just had a birthday this month 59 years old, 2 days before my birthday had yearly mammogram done have been getting them since I was 30, but that is because I have had a mother who died of colon cancer at 55, and her mother died of pancreatic CA at 80 I believe. They started me early as they didn't know at the time if my mother had had ovarian CA ,or colon CA. My whole family on my mother's side is riddled with cancer. Bone, lymphoma, skin, melanoma, leukemia, breast, kidney, lung, brain, and I myself have had pre cancer of the cervix, ( at the age of 32) and at the age of 35 a polyp removed from my colon the size of a pea. Love poodles and your NP are giving you good advice, if your mom was young when she had colon CA they recommend that children should be screened earlier in life than the normal recommendation for colon CA. I would keep an eye on your breast lump, but more concerning I would have a colonoscopy scheduled. I know it's hard not to have anxiety when there's so much junk on the web, I have a little bit my self, and I know pretty much what to expect as I am an RN. Please keep us posted and know we all care.",
