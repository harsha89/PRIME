The nurses ask what's wrong & I just say nothing, I'm waiting. I had one nurse tell me about patient hippo laws & I told her I could hear everything through the walls anyway. I don't know if it hurries them along but sometimes I think it does. It lets them know that I am still here. I was also told I couldn't read my chart after I took it out of the door. It was mine, I kept reading it anyway. I ask for water, I ask for the bathroom, anything to let them see me. I think Footballnut is a very smart lady. I get the pity looks too but if people want to help me then I'll take it. I've been trying to use all the dumb comments to remind women to get their mammos. If they ask about my cancer then I tell them all about it.  Too many women have stupid excuses not to get it done.  Feeling good today. Rest easy Ya'll",
