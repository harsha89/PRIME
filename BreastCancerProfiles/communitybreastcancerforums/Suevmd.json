I was a little freaked out by the call back and absolutely devastated when the 3 d and ultrasound indicated a biopsy was needed. I had about 4 weeks of stress from start to finish. Try to remember that only 1 out of 10 people called back will end up having breast cancer and only 3 out of 10 people with a biopsy end up having cancer. Luckily my bx was benign ( fibrocystic changes and PASH which is a benign condition). Hang in there, I still feel like I'm recovering from the ordeal and remain now deeply distrustful of my breasts. The road you are on now is really scary, but at least the professional I met were beyond wonderful. Good luck!!!",

      "Content": "Suevmd wrote: Wow, what a terrible roller coaster we are all on. I was called back for the first time just before Xmas. I had a singular asymmetric area in my left breast. Scary, but I clung to the \"9 out of 10 women called back do not have cancer\". My rational brain understood this, but my 3 am brain was sure that I would be that \"1\" that did. I had to wait 18 days to get back into the clinic because it was the end of the year and they were booked solid. Agonizing. Luckily, I found this site and stayed on these early forums and it really helped my anxiety. I was still crazy anxious, but it really helped. My repeat 3D and u/s supported a bx. I was rated a Bi Rad 4 and told to come back for a bx in 7 days. I really lost it. Even though the odds were still in my favor, it was devastating. I tried to remind myself of the 7 out of 10 were benign, but I went to all of the ugly, catastrophic places in my head. Again, this forum sustained me. Being able to be a part of someone else's journey (good or bad) took me out of myself for a moment at a time. I had the bx and the radiologist commented that she was pretty sure my odds were 80/90 % benign. The biopsy was a breeze and results were back in 24 hours ( large scale breast center). Thankfully, my results were benign fibrocystic changes with a dash of PASH on the side ( which is totally benign also) . I have to go back in 6 months for a repeat mammo and us to reestablish a baseline. I have a small clip in the area of interest which was largely obliterated by the 5 cores. I feel lucky to have such fortunate results. I feeL lucky because I clarified some family history that was important. I'm making the switch to a plant based diet to stay as healthy and inflammation free as possible. This was one of the most scary things that has ever happened to me. I remain deeply distrustful of my breasts. Hopefully, that will fade. I know that I have lots of mammograms left in my life and playing the odds more callbacks. So be it. Good luck to everyone. You sustained me over a very scary month of my life and I learned so much. Log in to post a reply",
