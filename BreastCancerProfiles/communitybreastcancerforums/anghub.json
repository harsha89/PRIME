I meet with the Rad Onc next Friday. My margins from lumpectomy on path report read as follows: Margins: DCIS extends to within 2.5mm of the posterior margin, 5mm of the superior margin and 9mm of the anterior margin; other margins are widely free. I know the radiation is supposed to lower my risk of recurrence but I want to ask the Rad Onc if I REALLY need to have the additional radiation. My surgeon also mentioned Tamoxifen after radiation. HELP!!",
