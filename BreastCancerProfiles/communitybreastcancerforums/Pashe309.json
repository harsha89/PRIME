The first week I have late afternoon appointments--love. The rest of the appointments are at 1:45pm-this sucks.  I am planning to work through the treatments and trying to get anywhere over lunch will be trying. If the afternoons become impossible I may have to reconsider working. I was told I could use  TOM's roll-on deordorant. Read all the side effects that are potentially possible and I am mentally planning that there will be none...We'll see how that works later. My best to you all and a special thanks to all that have served our country. FREEDOM IS NOT FREE enjoy your Memorial Day!",

I go to work and then have to leave work and come back to work every day after treatment.  ",
