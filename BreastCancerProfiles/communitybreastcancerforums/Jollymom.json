I awhile back I became NED thru the PARP inhibitor trial at MDA. I have remained NED since.  I'm still on the protocol because BiPar has yet to make any changes to the trial for people in my situation, and from what I understand there are ALOT of people out there who are in my situation and are frustrated.  The protocol is so rigorous. I literally live at MDA.  I had to demand some time to regroup for my family.  MDA wrote a great article about me this past week.  Of course they didn't put in that I had become NED, I wasn't ok with that.  But that being said it has been posted and there is a link also at the bottom for the interview with the head of the PARP trial at MDA. I hope that this brings hope to some of you.  Theres no telling how long I'll stay NED. I pray and I hope everyday that this continues for many years to come, that I'll be able to watch my 7and 4 year olds grow up and become men. I post this with great sadness in my heart but with great hope for the future.

Its huge.  I just found out that I org had 9 tumors in my liver, the largest was 4.3cm, and I had 3 on my kidneys, the largest there was 2.9cm.  The only thing left is some scar tissue on my left kidney.  I'm still in shock.  They bad thing is that they have nothing in place for this occurance as of yet because its still in trial phase, so BiPar was just sent all the data from all the trials around the nation and they are suppose to be making an amendment to the trial for these sort of things.  I dont want to be on this until I become toxic and then we wont have this in our arsenal any longer.  So as of now I'm still going to be chugging along until they say hey lets take a break, because if I demand a break and it comes back then whos to say I'll get back on the PARP until its FDA approved.  I was just asked by my research nurse that MDA wants me to do a piece for a cancer publication.  How exciting. Its possible ladies, it is possible. Hopefully I'll stay ned for a long while.  I have two little boys who need their mommy by golly.  Must keep going!

Was disease free until Jan of this year and we found a single tumor in my right lung.  They removed it and I did 6 rounds of Xempra.  A month later I had a pet scan done and they found the mets to my liver (2) and in a lymph in my chest.  So now I'm now on Xeloda and Avastin.  I had some problems with the bottom of my feet hurting so badly that I couldn't walk during the 2nd round but nothing else.  My onc took me off for 3 days and its amazing what it does for your feet with only a few days of being off of it.  Blew my mind how quickly it happened. I was originally on 3500 a day but she dropped it to 3000mg when the feet problem arose.  I do use Aquaphor religiously on my feet and hands tho to ward off the possibility of my hands cracking and peeling. Otherwise I'm just tired but my QOL is great! I'm 36 and have 2 little boys 6 and 3 that keep me going nonstop.  I am triple neg tho, so hopefully if this isn't working I'm suppose to be in the PARP trial.  But I'm hoping that this is working!  Good luck!",
