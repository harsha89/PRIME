Now, if I.can just get a darned job! At 54, I do not relish the idea of having to move in with my 75 yr old mother. I believe that somewhere in this mess of my life there is a lesson to be learned",

It seems weird, but it feels as if I have more control over my cancer than I have with my working/living situation. I have an interview on the 28th. It is a 3rd interview and I am 1 of 4 out of 65 applicants. The job wouldn't start until mid-August. My strategy for dealing with 2 devastating situations at the same time is to compartmentalize and deal with each situation as if the other did not exist. It's too much for this tiny brain of mine to comprehend all at once.",
