Thanks everyone - and Binney - great pictures!!! Theresa   ",

We're hoping to do something special for my son as he heads off to his first year of college.  I thought we'd do something different, and white water rafting came to me, since we've never gone with the kids (and it's been years for us).  My question - is it possible to do, or is it a dumb idea after having lymph nodes removed? I do have a sleeve and gauntlet that I wear when flying. Should I wear them? Or, should I just bag the whole idea?     really wanted to do something memorable with him (and something that is actually fun for an 18 year old.....)  Thanks!
