My brca comes back on the 23rd. I am having a really tough time emotionally, and have developed fluid and bloodclots after the lumpectomy so I am really uncomfortable as well. If my brca comes back positive and I decide to go with BMX I just don't know if I can go thru with reconstruction. The thought of TE's literally sickens me. The one step seemed more appealing. The plastic surgeon I met with does not do the procedure I would have to look around. I think I would be a candidate. I am 47, a C-D cup, no sagging, radiation would not be necessary if I opt for BMX. However I think I have very tight muscles. I remember when I had my c-section (15 years ago) the drs said my muscles were so hard and tight they usually only see that in professional dancers. I don't know if I can handle months of pain, discomfort, appointments.....",

The rec from my Dr's is that if I am BRCA negative to have radiation, ovaries out, and tamoxifen, However they feel that if BRCA positive I should have a PBMX. Even though they say that if BRCA positive doing all the above mentioned risk reducers I can get my risk to 12-15% which seems quite good to me. Am I crazy? Also I am usually a very decisive person and with this situation if positive I just don't know what the right answer is. 12-15 doesn't seem so bad, but I realize if it were to come back it could be invasive next time....",

Has anyone else experienced this issue? And if so any tips on how to feel better? I had a similar pain prior to a shingles outbreak and thought maybe I was having another outbreak (I have immune issues and have had repeated bouts of shingles) but I really believe this is intestinal related.

There is a grouping of calcium microcalcifications that are more conspicuous than previously seen and suspicious and will be having a biopsy Monday morning. I'm not even sure how I feel I think I am just numb. I spoke directly with the tech as I know her quite well and I could tell by her voice that these are pointing to malignancy. I have been down this road twice so I know the questions to ask. I know nothing is set in stone until the pathology report comes back but I do believe I am looking at a Mastectomy. I had radiation and I have other health issues that would make reconstruction questionable. I think my biggest concern all along all these years has been if it comes back will it be invasive this time. I'm not even sure why I am writing this I guess I am looking for others to reach out who may have had a similar experience.",
