I had my port put in last Thursday. And start on Wednesday. My tumor is a grade 3 and my clinical diagnosis changed from stage IIb to stage three after my MRI. I\u2019ve named her big Bertha and she is growing pretty quick. I will have four A/C infusions the 4 T infusions. Going in every other week. Honestly it can\u2019t start fast enough. Don\u2019t worry about your port placement it wasn\u2019t bad at all. I bruised pretty good and it feels really weird but other than that it\u2019s all good! Keeping you in my thoughts!!!",

Made an appointment the next day with GYN and actually got in that day. This past Tuesday I went in for an US and mammogram. My prior two mammograms were fine. While in for the US I watched the screen and saw the mass. It is about an inch big. I made the comment of \u201coh is it a cyst\u201d. The MD and tech both said they wished it was. As you can imagine I heard nothing after that. My biopsy is Tuesday. This girl is freaking out! Is this big? Is it possible for a mass to grow in 10 months (last mammogram in June). Am I overreacting???? I think I have read every google topic....ugh. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated Log in to post a reply",
