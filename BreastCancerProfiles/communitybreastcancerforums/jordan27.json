I had a bilateral on 2-18 with expanders. That went really well. Never in pain, just sore. My nodes are negative. This is my second bout with breast cancer. In 2004 was diagnosed on left, with a lumpectomy and 36 rad. treatments, then 2007 on the right. I'm really scared but knowing that there are others walking in my shoes is reassuring . This site has been an  blessing for me. So count me in !!!",

Drink lots of water and I found Gatorade to help as well. Try to think positively and you will be fine. Let me know. Hugs and prayers, Leslie (jordan27)",
