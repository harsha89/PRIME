I am feeling rather upset to say the least about losing my hair, but I reckon I might as well stick up two fingers at the cancer by changing my hairstyle three times a week, ha ha! My own hair isn't much to write home about, but it still stings that it will be going. Somehow, despite having the surgery and everything, it won't be real until my hair falls out. Does that make any sense? I'm also getting a bone scan sometime soon, really hoping it doesn't show any other nasties up! My MRI and CT scans were thankfully clear. Looking forward to getting to know you all better!",

It went fine- I still feel grand for now, the side effects won't kick in for another few hours or so, apparently. The first three rounds are FEC and the second three rounds will be taxotere. I thought it was going to be a drip, but because I had the picc line put in, the nurse just pushed it all through that, so it was all quite quick. One of the drugs made me sting all over, but it was over quickly. The nurse warned me that it would feel like I was sitting on nettles, and she wasn't wrong! So- not too bad so far. It's done. One down, five to go. I also saw \"The Wig Lady\" and my government supplied wig is en route. I have gone for a long style, the shorter ones were not good with my chubby cheeks. My husband said they made me look like Kelly Osborne. Will be kicking his ass for that later!!!! The wig looked so nice that I will definitely model it for you all once it arrives. It's a big improvement on my natural frizzy mess! OK, off to put my feet up for a while. I actually feel fine, and might work for a couple of hours this afternoon. :-)",

I will try and do better! I got out of hospiral today where I have been since Thursday. Unfortunately, both my round of FEC so far have resulted in a septic episode with severe neutrophenia. It's very frustrating. I am due to have one more round of FEC before moving on to three rounds of taxotere, but they are having to rethink doses etc now because my body isn't really coping with the chemo. I'll have to wait and see what they suggest. I just want it all over and done with, and the thought that they might lower the dose and give me more cycles of chemo is very depressing. Hair- mine is nearly all gone. It has been pretty upsetting. I hate wearing a wig, but am wearing one in work. Apart from that, I am in a headscarf pretty constantly! I don't even want my partner or children to see me without! Anyhow, once again I am so sorry for starting this thread and then abandoning it! I want to be a part of the group and hope you guys don't mind me coming back. Thanks Annie for your posts to my blog! I really appreciated it!",

I felt fine for about six hours, then started to feel like I had a bad hangover. By 7pm last night, I started to be sick- really sick- and couldn't keep anything down at all. Despite the steriods, though, I did manage to sleep last night and feel much better this morning. Only a little nausea and no sickness so far. I am working. So, there's hope! I know it's only day 2 though, but I am glad I've been able to do some work.  OregonPenny- I don't have one of those cathetars in place. It sounds awful, can you get it checked on? Can anyone explain to me what the different between a picc and a port are, and why different things are used for different people? How many of you are getting something like that?",

I did buy one this morning, not at huge expense, on ebay (if it isn't good, I didn't spend a lot of money, so no great loss) so will see how that goes! I'm devastated about losing my hair- it somehow won't seem real until it falls out- if that makes any sense- but I am going to try and have some fun with wigs to try and make myself feel less bad. Nothing like a bit of retail therapy- wigs can be the new dress for me, lol! My co-workers will have a great laugh wondering which hair I will be wearing each day if I get my way, ha ha!  Thanks everyone again, I am off to look up Raquelle Welch wigs! :) Good luck and hugs to all of you. xx",
