Wish I had known about it sooner, so much good info and support here! Had a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy on Aug 11. Initial path was negative. Final path showed cancer in the node, what a let down! Scheduled for axillary dissectio Sept 1. First overnight hospital stay ever. Had chemo preop, which shrunk my tumor enough to have the lumpectomy. Surgeon did a great job, and the incisions look great. Anxious to be sure all the cancer is OUT!!! Good luck to everyone here.",
