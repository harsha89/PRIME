I HAVE NOT been sorry about removing them. Just be sure you make the decision that is the best for you.------kad2kar",

Im tired,not refreshed in the am, but I do get some sleep. If you do get AMbien, BE READY for bed and get in it immediately after taking the pill and I mean IMMEDIATELY!!! Good Luck and I hope sweet dreams sooner rather than late------kad2kar   By the way I have a type of arthritis that was the reason for AMbien.",

I didnt need rads, chemo was suggested but I knew I would not be able to handled that. I have NOT been sorry one moment for my own decision, but I also know that I could get another CANCER somewhere else {not cervix,ovaries} I had my \"history\" taken lock,stock & barrel 20 years ago.Not due to cancer. Everyone needs to travel thier own path with gentle advice,helpful advice, from as many factions as possible. We can only tell our own story, not anyone else's.  ThankYou for listening---------kad2kar",

Just dx in july and had rt breast removed 2days after our 46th anniversary (been together since I was 15). My mammos over the yrs have looked scary to me but never a Dr. This one didnt look scary (& to me left looked the same as rt but dr said no).  So see everybody and make sure you LIKE & feel  VERY COMFORTABLE with each person you will be dealing with. I did not like Radiologist OR Oncologist so Im just dealing with my surgeon & plastic surgeon. Go  into Surgery,before,during and after the August 2010 group. That group has had such wonderful info and Loving attitudes. start on page 1 and read through pg 23. It helped me very much. God Bless You and your DH. p.s. there is a blog done by a husband and it may be helpful to yours. Its called BAD BOOBIES and another title Im not sure of. Hope this helps a bit",
