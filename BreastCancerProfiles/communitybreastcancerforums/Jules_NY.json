I went out on the patio just now without anything in my head cause I forgot and when I realized I ran in the house holding back tears because I was more annoyed than upset that someone might have seen me. My kids are 5 and 7 and they aren't really phased either. When I told them I was going to lose my hair my son was excited and fell over laughing, then he said I promise I won't laugh when it happens. My daughter has said occ that she misses my hair. We are trying to make this phase of our lives as normal as possible to them with no secrets and answer all their questions. It is a bit easier to do that with them since they don't really know the worst case scenario when someone is diagnosed with cancer. ",

Those are based on so many variables that they are not completely accurate for individualized use. Plus the published statistics are old (in medical terms) they need time to collect data for 5 years and then publish it. Who knows what new drugs can come along in that time to decrease recurrence. In the past being HER2+ had an extremely poor prognosis. But now with target therapies around that has changed dramatically!!",

If you use it after chemo to help your already growing hair (if there are no underlying hair loss issues) then it will work sooner and when you stop your hair will not fall out again (that part is true). My hair is coming in uneven, I have a receding hairline and male pattern baldness thing goin on. I used minoxidil on those areas and I really think it helps.
