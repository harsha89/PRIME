For me shaving was the better option. I was worried about my kids they were only 4 and 6 first time around but 11 and 9 this time around  but they have been great and I have left it up to them how they tell there friends about it....wishing you all the best with your treatment xxxx",

She does the daily juicing NO DIARY (this is her non negotiable) mainly veggie and fruit. It is an interesting read. I do one raw meal a day, I juice, have limited diary, meat and eat as many veggies and fruit as I can. Wont cure me but helps me manage chemo really well and apart from my stage 4 challenge I am fit and healthy....",

I have now had nearly two weeks off work and have very little energy to do anything. For the first few days I felt very sick, had a headache and was dizzy but those symptoms have all gone. I have no desire to do anything at all I get myself up and dressed each day but then spend most of the day watching TV or reading. I am sleeping fine at night and don't sleep during the day. I am also not that interested in food at all. I have done a lot of chemo treatments over the years and have never had fatigue like this before. Does anyone have any advise on how to manage this?? I am desperate to get back to normal life as soon as possible and also enjoy been off chemo. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I have just finished 18 weeks taxol and Herceptin and will continue on with the Herceptin until I progress. My scan showed that I had responded well to the chemo with most liver mets gone and the ones left are much smaller. I agree with you that my liver mets are also what worry me the most. I wish you all the best for your new treatment I hope you get great results with minimal SE's . I found the taxol very manageable and continued to work and carry on with home life as normal. xxxx",
