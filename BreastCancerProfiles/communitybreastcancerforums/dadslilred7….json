He said he was almost certain that it was not cancerous, and he wanted to wait 5 or six months to repeat the mammogram to see what changes were present. I told him I did not want to wait, that I wanted to go ahead and biopsy, and he said if I really wanted to go through it, he would do it, but felt it was a waste of time. He said he would give it a BIRAD category 3, not four. He did agree to do the mammogram in 3 months rather than six, and said if I felt like I wanted to go ahead and biopsy to call his office. I have no clue what to do, but I have well-meaning friends that are telling me DON'T WAIT....that their cousin's mother in law's best friend's great aunt Lucy was told the same thing and had to eventually have a double mastectomy and is fighting for her life now. I just don't know what to do from here. This surgeon cam highly recommended to me, so I feel I should trust him, but this is MY body, and I am not at ease with this decision!",
