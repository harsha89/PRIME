I posted previously (Dr. found lump; not what I was expecting) and thank all for their replies to that post.   As I started doing research and reading the posts on this board, I've learned a lot about the correlation of vitamin D and breast cancer.  I found out last year that I was Vitamin D deficent (24) with high calcium levels and started taking supplements.  Was just retested and my level is lower -- 21!   Combine the vitamin d and discovery of the lump -- I'm really starting to be concerned.  I'm scheduled for diagnostic mammogram and ultra sound on Nov. 5.  I'm 35 (soon to be 36) with no history of bc in my family.  The waiting is driving me crazy! In what I'm reading on vit d and bc, I can't determine what comes first...if you become vit d deficient after bc because of treatment and therefore the need to supplement.  OR if already being vit d deficient can be a symptom of having breast cancer, or worse if vitamin d deficiency can cause bc?  This is all so very confusing!  Any thoughts/feedback greatly appreciated!

I went to my GP today (actually her nurse practioner).  The purpose of my visit was just for a \"quick\" routine physical so I could get some paperwork filled out for my employer and insurance company saying I had some type of preventive medical service done this year.  I was thinking it would be quick...I'd be out of there after they checked my reflexes, etc.  Not exactly the case. She did a breast exam (last one I had was in summer, 2007.  I've never had any problems -- never been told lumpy or anything. I am about average cup size.  She checked the left breast rather quickly, but when she moved over the right, she lingered in one spot, went over to the left breast in the same spot and checked and compared a few times.  She had a deep in thought look on her face as she is doing this.  She then had me feel and asked me do you feel that?  Unfortunately, I did feel it.  It is a hard area, maybe an inch long or so (if that), but not round -- more like a bumpy ridge.  Doesn't seem to move around, in fact is almost seems like it is \"attached\" or part of the breast.  It is just below the nipple and seems rather deep, but no pain.  She asked me if I had any pain in my nipples.  Ironically, I have had some tenderness in the right nipple and at times, I think there is a slight discharge, as it seems at the tip of the nipple will get a bit crusty -- but never really caused me any alarm or reason to investigage further.  I admit I haven't done the BSE regularly (really at all). She had the doctor come in and she too felt it.  They have ordered a diagnostic mammogram and ultra sound.  I'm a mother of two boys, age 36.  I'm trying not to let this consume my thoughts.  But, it is bothering me.  Any guidance on the likelihood of this being something to worry about?  Could something like this surface so quickly -- last check was just two years ago. Thank you all for \"listening\" and your thoughts. Log in to post a reply",

Had one mammogram when I was 36 after dr. thought she felt something, but after mammogram all was great - breast mostly fatty. Having some other female issues and dr. was on me to get mammogram done due to age and time since first only one. So I did today. Before I ever left the parking lot, I had a call from my doctor saying I needed a diagnostic mammogram done. Here's some excerpts from the screening mammogram: The focal asymmetry in the left breast lower inner aspect middle depth is indeterminate. There are scattered fibroglandular elements in both breasts. (wasn't like that 8 years ago; was fatty). There are multiple asymmetries in the right breast upper outer aspect middle depth. Anyone else have similar findings? Any insights on how concerning this might or might not be? Thanks in advance for any responses. Log in to post a reply",
