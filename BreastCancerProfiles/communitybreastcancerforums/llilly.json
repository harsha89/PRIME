Diagnosed in October 2011 at age 47, ER+, PR+, Her 2-, 1 out of 15 lymph nodes positive (sentinel node), oncotype dx score was 16 (10% recurrance rate), tumor grade 1, Stage 11A.  Premature ovarian failure before diagnosis.  Cancer was on left side, but I opted for a bilateral mastectomy.  I was asked to be in a clinical trial where you were selected to have chemo or not - my participation would be not having the chemo. Howver, my Oncologist and I agreed despite my low oncotype, it was wise with 1 positive lymph node to proceed with 4 rounds of TC, no rads and 5 years on Arimidex.  I had 2 tumors, the largest was 1.2 cm with lymphovascular invasion and small amount of extracapsular extension outside the 1 positive sentinel node.  Clear margins.  The chemo was doable and I was told I would get the most benefit from being on Arimidex for 5 years.  Will get a bone density DEXA scan every 2 years.  It has been a year since I have been on Arimidex and and side effects seem minimal.   Thank you for starting this thread.   It is very helpful to read about everyone's experiences.  ",
