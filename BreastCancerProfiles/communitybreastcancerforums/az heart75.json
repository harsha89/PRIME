I found a lump in right breast. Doc had an mri done 2 day later which came back birad 4. Then may 2, 4 ultrasounds, 3 mammos and a triple needle biopsy and had to be on a plane by 4 that afternoon for family vacation. Forgot to mention i have saline implants 10years. Results came back possible fibroadanoma but cant rule ot phyllodes tumor. So had a lumpectomy done in June. Said ng fibroadanoma ng phyllodes. So i was content. Then in Oct. My breast swelled up 2 times bigger then left. Found a lump again same place. Cancer doc desided to do a partial mastectomy. Results came back saying to rich for content. ?? as told it was a fibroadanoma.6 month check up was June 16th mammo and ultrasound came back fine. Aug 1 found 2 hard knotts in left. And mind u my right breast is still swollen. Another mri sent me straight over to ultrasound. Birad 3 both. My left they think r complex cyst and my tumor is back in my right at 11:00 Possibly a fibroadanoma and something like palpable thickening at 2:00 and possibly a cyst at 12:00. kentic features rapid with plateau. They said. Its only 4 mm. My right breast is still swollen gradually getting worse into armpit it hurts all the way up into Shoulder and neck. i have went from a 135 to 105. Now im b12 deficient too. Cancer doc said its hormonal because i still have ovaries (partial hysterectomy 2013). Really so my breast has been swollen for almost a year straight. How is that monthly. Ugggg. My second opinion (cancer doc didn't know i seen him) said he dont feel comfortable talking me on. And my cancer doc said he wants me to get a second opinion from university of iowa city. I never had problems with cyst or fibroadanoma. Even my family never had themjust aggressive cancer. They said implants can hide things. They r afraid to biopsy. Im just confused and give up. I just want to know if anyone else with implant had the same issues and r the cancer signs the same with implants? My nipple on right is flat.my vains r really noticeable they stand out. My poor right boob. I will stop rambling now. Uuug. Just tired. Forgot to mention im going to 40 sept 28. And i have 3 beautiful daughters. 20 and twins that r 18. Log in to post a reply",
