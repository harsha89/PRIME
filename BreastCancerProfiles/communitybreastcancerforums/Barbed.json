I thought this a bit odd as from what I can see - you are supposed to stop them before havign CT scans but I don't know why. Does anyone know why you need to stop these medications and if/how they affect the scan? It's one thing to have scanxiety but having this random factor thrown in - makes it worse. Only a week to wait. Hang in there - those waiting too. Barbed.

Like 208sandy I've had lots of scans and they've never mentioned it before. I have an \"upper limit of normal\" (slightly enlarged) heart and I know that can cause blood clots as well as it being a post-chemo complication so I was just worried that there was something else wrong now - other than the potential metastatic cancer. I'm in denial atm though and convinced I have imagined everything (chronic swallowing problem) and shouldn't have made a fuss. I'm obviously over-concerned about my health and my rising tumour markers aren't really anything to worry about. Fortunately, I have found ways to distract myself - I have some repairs and a small bit of decorating to finish. Roll on results. Have a good weekend all. (Grey and damp in London.) Barbed.",
