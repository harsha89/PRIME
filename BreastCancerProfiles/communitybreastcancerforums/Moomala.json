Radiation this week for back pain. I'll see the oncologist for full systemic treatment plan next week. My diagnosis comes 24 years after my original diagnosis. For the first few weeks I wasn't eating or sleeping much at all. Things are a little better now, but oh my goodness, this brain will not stop! DivineMrsM, thanks for the suggestion that anxiety and depression don't always go hand in hand. I'm going to talk with my doctor about this too. I've had really awful reactions to AD's and gave up. I've been using a little more xanax than I'm comfortable with and although the oncologist said she wasn't worried about the way I'm using it, it bothers me a little and I think something like Buspar might be better for a long-term use.
