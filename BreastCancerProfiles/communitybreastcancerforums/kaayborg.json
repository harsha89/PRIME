So far I have done: 1) day1 gem/carb, day8 gem/carbo, 1 wk recovery 2) reduced gemzar with day1 gem/carb, day8 gem/carbo, 1 wk recovery 3) reduced gemzar with day1 gem/carb, day8 gem/carbo, 2 wks recovery 4) further reduced gemzar with day1 gem/carb, day8 gem/carbo, 2 wks recovery What has happened for the last 2 cycles is I get day1 gem/carbo but have to skip the second, causing a 3 wk recovery and I'm near positive it's going to happen again regardless of the further reduced gemzar. Any info out there are whether it is best to keep the day 1 and day 8 but add more weeks of recovery or to drop a treatment and have shorter recoveries? I discuss this with my onc on Friday.

Go slow sounds like good advice but I don't really know what that means exactly. It's a unique terrain for each of us to navigate, I suppose. I always think that I'll keep my children posted of news honestly as it comes in but other times I think the roller coaster is enough for me to take, why drag them along, especially since sometimes you're down just a short while before you're up again. So often they could be none the wiser and go on with their protected childhoods for years even. When I am sure the end is near, I'll tell them certainly but there will always be the question of how soon is too soon, how late is too late. Mostly, I don't want to my children to be secretly fearful when my openness could at least offer parental comfort and truth without exaggerations they'd be prone to create when left in the dark. My heart goes out to you. You are in such a tough place, a place no one wishes to be, with questions no one wishes to face and yet you do face them and think deeply about how to live and die in the best interest of your daughter. I never feel much courageous because it's not like there's a way to opt out of this, but courageous you are.

No measurements to give you about the growth. Basically new tumors are growing so close to old ones and to each other, they cannot accurately measure them. Tumor load is estimated to be worse than it was at diagnosis two years ago. Liver function is okay, abnormal and higher still but no immediate threat of failure. However, Dr. Lustberg stated it is very important that this treatment work. Progression is rapid. We have been considering for some time at what point it would be appropriate to tell the girls that these treatments won't keep me alive forever. Today's news helped us to decide along with the counsel of staff at the Spielman. While we still remain hopeful that I may get a durable response out of eribulin, if I do not, and things progress faster than the next treatment can keep up with, the end will be soon. I feel they deserve the opportunity to process this over time and with us, not alone. The conversation went as well as I think it could have. A horrible thing to have to do but I know God will take care of us all, and we believe it was the right thing to do and the right time to do it. Things to hope and pray for: a change in the tumor make up...achieving HER2+ status occurs 30% of the time and gives many more potentially effective treatment options, or anything else that opens doors insurance approval of immunotherapy off label to add to eribulin, increasing chances of its effectiveness and durability a liver that tolerates decline slowly so treatments have a chance to be effective the resiliency of our children...us too",

I'm depending on oxycodone more than ever. The plan is to give pembro another cycle or two but looking at my AST today at over 200, when it was just over 100 on Monday and in double digits 5 days before that makes me wonder if I shouldn't start abraxane which may give a faster response.

Normally a terrifying place to be stuck, but on this roller coaster, stuck on the up is grand. Perhaps the biggest hill should be named Ned. I did get some info from my onc about TMs and why changing treatment at the earliest progression is not often best. First, she defines early as just a few mm of progression. She also thinks the risks of changing treatments prematurely and developing resistance to treatments faster, outweigh any risks of waiting a bit and watching more closely to be sure if something is really up or not. She doesn't use tumor markers but has begun to use them a bit more with patients who desire it or are used to it in other practices. She thinks they are most helpful with bone mets. Of course she offered to do them for me, but I declined. I'm not sure I would be able to take much stock in them. I'm not sure I'd want the false worry. What do you think?",

It was wonderful and I only thought of cancer a few moments throughout, not even every day! Sad to be back and facing reality but also so glad for the opportunity to go, bond with family and enjoy some astoundingly beautiful parts of the US, new to my eyes and soul. Cjanet, I am so sorry to not be able to immediately respond with my good story about gem/carbo. I've been on it for over a year and while I've had some reductions, delays, had to add first Neulasta, then Neupogen for white counts and eventually dropped the gemzar altogether, it's a tx I am head over heals in love with. The extent of my liver mets had me wondering how many months I might live, not years but I saw sizable and immediate reduction (9-10 cm tumors now to roughly 2-4 cm). Now holding stable. My onc has a current patient (also TNBC) who has been on it for 3 years and counting. Hoping to follow in her footsteps though recent platelet issues do have me wondering. Platelets are why we dropped gemzar recently. So far so good, even with now having developed an allergic reaction to carboplatin. Tues is chemo again and hoping for the best. Please feel free to contact me with any questions. Gem/carbo is the one thing I know my way around pretty well. Artist, I'll be thinking of you as you get your scan results Tuesday and as you start back to school. Sigh...so hard to say so long to summer. Thursday is my day back, though technically Friday is an unpaid room set-up day. Yay to Gramen for stable scans!!! And to Gatorgirl for being stable 8 years. Lynne, sorry to hear about your new liver mets but so glad to have you here. This is such a great group of ladies. Momallthetime, I'm thinking of you and Dani as you find answers to the weight loss issue. Nothing more to offer there but seems you've gotten good advice. Shetland, good to hear from you again! Stephanie, I'm never quite sure what to say in response to your posts but always feel there is something to be said. Shetland's put it perfectly. Thanks for the words, Shetland. I echo.  ",

Without excuse for their behavior. An apology is owed to you but my advice is not to wait for it before trying (TRYING) to forgive it, letting go and moving on.

An email with description of my ever expanding hard stomach and reduced appetite was enough to put my onc in full swing...scans ordered, biopsy ordered, US guided tap ordered (just in case), eribulin insurance approval ordered as well as opdivo off-study. I wasn't expecting all that. Just thought I'd give heads up to help her prep for my appointment following up about Xeloda and now I'm starting eribulin tomorrow instead. I feel comforted that she's so on it, but all the immediacy makes me feel I'm in serious trouble if something doesn't pan out fast.

Having progressed on carbo I question whether you should go back to it but I also did well on if so long. In theory a combo could reactivate its power???? Would be nice anyway. Would be nice if every idea and circumstance came with data. The stinkin trouble with trials is the wash out. I have so much cancer in my liver and it grows so fast. Immun132 has only a 2 week wash which is why it appeals. Pretty nice data too. Exciting to hear about the fast track. We added pembro off trial with insurance approval. Would love to switch to atezo with abraxane and will likely try but my onc thinks it will be doubly difficult to get approval and also takes time. This is why I had 2 cycles if eribulin before we could get the pembro. May try same with abraxane. But for now hoping for pembro magic. There are many trials for TNBC with immunotherapy but all tend to exclude you if you've had prior immunotherapy. Need to see what else there is. Y90...still just not sure where it fits for me. If I could get some wiggle room with tumor size, I'd go for it. Now it requires too much time off treatment. I can't take the risk right now. My onc had multiple patients for whom it did not go well. I was so excited about it but now am scared. ",

I've just realized in these 2 progression periods I've had how incredibly fast this cancer of mine grows and the fact it leaves so little time to land the right treatment is very discouraging. I do wish I had smaller cancer load with a bit more room for error. Z, you're advice about having things lined up is exactly right and I have been trying to abide by it. I have consulted with a specialist about Y90 and it was emphasized to me that the time would be right at progression with a stable liver. I'm not sure when that will be for me. Leaving a treatment that works to do it feels pretty risky. I'd have to feel that Y90 would be a home run. Leaving working treatment and coming back to it later can't guarantee it will work later. Cells may have changed and I would lose out on time gained on the effective treatment. Crystal ball would be nice. The procedure time and recovery before beginning systemic again could put me in peril, especially if it turns out not to work. My liver doesn't have much room for more inflammation. I am one pregnant women at the moment and this liver baby head will not stop pushing below my left rib cage. I've broken out the narcotics tonight. FYI: no fluids, just mad liver baby. Parp inhibitors...I do really think that is something I need to try for. I\"ve been told by two MOs that while I am not brca positive, I seem to have a similarly high mutation load and so might respond similarly. Lost out on the immuno/parp trial at NIH and now am ineligible b/c of pembro. I should look into finding another. I will check out the study at Standford for sure. If they'll fly me out that's doable I guess. Quite the distance still, though. I emailed my onc and she is open to discussing the idea of gemzar and abraxane, since I did not progress on gemzar but stopped due to toxicity. Toxicity and insurance coverage would be the hurdles. I like the idea though. Thanks so much for the suggestion. Anyone with experience on how many times insurance company's tend to be willing to approve drugs off-study? We are sending all info out to Sarah Cannon tomorrow. I do hate it's randomized but I think IMMU-132 is worth the shot. I have appt. and eribulin/pembro set up tomorrow unless my liver numbers have shot up and I kind of think they may have. At last progression ALT was in 80s and then shot up to 140s 3 days later. Friday it was in the 80s and I worry it might be following suit based on my increasing discomfort. I think the plan is abraxane if we don't feel we can wait longer for pembro to work. Anyone know an average for how long you must be on immuno before results are noticeable. I seem to get chemo results right away. For gem/carbo and eribulin it was evident after the first one or two treatments (not cycles). Speaking of numbers...I don't have a good gauge on when you're really in trouble. At dx I was 297 ALP 67 ALT 102 AST 0 .5 Bilirubin direct. Worst at last progression was 185 ALP 105 ALT 143 AST 0.1 Bilirubin direct, and now I am 346 ALP 67 ALT 81 AST 0.2 Bilirubin direct How does this compare to where you ladies have been at progression? Congrats on those years Leftfoot. Keep them coming. JFL, that's terrbile about the shingles. Makes me so excited to start abaxane but I'll still do it. Just want to live!  ",

I think you're right to give it a bit more time but do watch your symptoms carefully and convey them to your onc. Hoping your enzymes come back with some more reassurance. If they are significantly climbing still, I might be less ready to give gem/carbo more time.

Then, you push it all back, get out of the car or walk out of the bathroom and just keep moving. I've taken a few times when no one was around to let them loose well and good, but am also surprised that that's over pretty quickly. It's more a quiet drip, than a waterfall...which is strange to me because I've cried rivers over lesser challenges for sure. I like to be honest and I don't feel like I'm faking around other people so much as I am deliberate with my thoughts because, for the love of Pete, I can't walk around all the time thinking about this and getting all drippy. I also still kind of feel like the reality of the whole thing has still yet to fully hit me. Grandchildren...another stage iv gal I know locally just had her first grandbaby. I expressed my lack of hope for this. She said, \"Don't give up on grandkids. Just don't.\" She and I both know there is plenty of reason to think that impossible but I'll accept her \"just don't\" and try my best to go with it. A little less of stretch, but still a mighty one, I hope to see all three of my girls graduate from high school. Most times, that is my goal, which is so pathetic given I, too, planned on shuffling through to the end with my old fart. One of my shared waterfall moments came in bed when I noted wrinkles at the corner of my DH's eyes...because that caused this thought to pop, \"I was supposed to see you older than this, so, much, much older than this.\" As for God, I was born and raised as a big time believer but my faith has turned out to be more of something I've chosen in the midst of doubt. Some know for sure that heaven awaits us, that God is with us and looking out for us. I don't know for sure but choose to believe it and feel my life is better for it. I can't accept that cancer is God's plan for anyone's life but tend to think of it as part of this imperfect world, something sad and dark but from which God will wring as much good as he can. It's that goodness which I can feel for certain that keeps my faith alive. I was reading to my girls tonight, the Tale of Despereaux. Kate DiCamillo wrote, \"And hope is like love...a ridiculous, wonderful, powerful thing.\" That speaks volumes, doesn't it?",

I wouldn't share your shaken confidence in her. Though, I'd hope it not be the case, sometimes this sets people on the defensive and they're less inclined to want to help. Good question about my onc's reasoning...my assumption was to buy time on an effective drug before putting it in the \"done\" basket. Progression noted might be just a slow progression b/c it is still being kept in check by the chemo (so it is still working in a way) and I could gain many more months on it under careful watch to ensure it stays nice and slow or stable. As for going more places, I'm under the impression that something could show up anywhere and anytime and not necessarily have come from liver progression. I'm not sure that liver progression makes it more likely to have it show up somewhere else or not. All good questions to ask. And, I think it's always possible that her decision not to change at first sign of progression has something to do with the specifics of my situation. Who knows? You should see the movie. I don't usually go for \"spy\" movies so much but love Tom so I saw with my husband. I loved it..great theme of human capacity to extend love for all. Thinking I want to watch it again.",

I am usually worried about my platelets b/c they have gone close to the border on day 1 lately and historically have decreased between days 1 and 8 but suddenly, the new thing has been to go up between days 1 and 8. Not sure why, but \"Yea, Platelets!\" I like to cheer them on, for what it's worth. While I was busy with my platelet pep-talk, my rbc counts decided to take the plunge this last time. I was at the transfusion level but didn't have to have one b/c I didn't have any symptoms. It's hard to say what will happen each time. But, I feel well and so far my tumors stay stupid in finding a way around gem/carbo's punches...thus the love I feel for the toxic combo. Hip, hip!!",

That is what I have decided to do anyway. I'll have been on the same chemo for 2 years this August and hope to get several more years out of it.

I asked about why now rather than when I have progression and am in need of a new effective treatment. She said two things: One is that the procedure can only be done with liver enzymes in a particular range; they cannot be too elevated. Second was that sometimes the liver can change very rapidly and the window we have to find a new treatment can be small when dealing with larger highly aggressive tumors (that's me). So shrinking the tumors more may buy us some time before encountering a \"crisis mode\" where the liver is at high risk. This is similar to where I was at diagnosis, though not quite. Sounds good to me as far this reasoning goes, though interestingly she had no recommendation for me whether to do or not. There is no long term data for the breast cancer patient, only those with primary liver cancer. At this point, risks seem pretty small with potential to gain good results. I'm eager to meet with the radiologist to know more. Any news from the others of you considering this treatment?",

I think this is mostly the case for me...not fearing results as much as impatient for them. Shetland, fear of original symptoms is something that definitely sets me back from time to time. Even had some extra scans thrown in there once because I absolutely convinced myself I was going down the inflamed liver path again. I was not, which I say not to minimize your suspicions in the least, and I love that my doctor ordered up those scans, even though she thought I 'd be fine to wait and see. Anyway, I still find myself in that place, thinking \"Oh, no! I didn't eat that much and I feel full already.\" Or, feeling uncomfortably bloated, etc. But, I've decided to push it aside as far as I can will myself to do so. I take some comfort in what my onc told me at the time of my last moment of hypochondria (something that absolutely never ailed me prior to cancer dx). She said that many women highly attuned to their own bodies often can detect progression before she can clinically detect it. However, detecting progression earlier doesn't give cause for changing treatment earlier...there's no advantage changing earlier. So, I'm trusting in that and figuring that if things are indeed going south, I'll figure it out eventually, worried or not. Hoping you find peace in whatever happens. That's my prayer for myself.",

This confused me too and I asked my onc about it when I got the results of my liver biopsy. A mutation that Dani has would be a genetic one, part of her DNA that could exist with or without having cancer but is predictive of her cancer risk and does guide treatment of cancer. Tumors can also have their own mutations not linked to genetics. I'm not brca positive, tumor or otherwise but I asked the question because my tumor study turned up a mutation whose name I happened to remember being negative for on my genetics test. So long story short, it is a thing and both help inform treatment options. Another important thing to remember is that tumor mutations can change so it's good to have them retested especially when a previously effective treatment has stopped working. Also, know that having the brca tumor mutation does not put your family at risk for having a mutation as a genetic mutation would.",

So sorry about the falling out. I do hope what is best works out for you, Ohio or wherever. If you were in Columbus I could recommend the perfect doctor for you. Artist, great about the car, but hating the enzyme thing. You do always find the bright side. I was just thinking this about you when you spoke about your wrist and usual summer activities begone. You'll just find something else to do. I do hope the lower dose continues to work well and the something else drug is a ways out yet. I feel just the same about my chemo being reduced and reduced and now gemzar is out altogether. Hoping for the best on Tuesday with just the carbo. Zarovka and Shetland - NED feels like such a pipe dream to me given the amt. of cancer in my liver and its aggressiveness that I thank you so much for sharing the info that stable may be just as good. I'm gonna go ahead and believe that. I just can't stand reading those median survival stats though. I'll just have to keep believing I'm above average..way, way above and beyond! Welcome, naturegirl! I'm with Artist about the diet. I do common sense, healthy eating, sleeping and exercise. Like Zarovka, I read The Anti-Cancer book applied many of his suggestions particularly those about food but I'm not super rigid about anything. I do plan to check out the Dr. Weil thing Z mentions. Anti-inflammatory foods are important I think so I keep all the cruciferous veggies as Shetland mentioned. I purposely stayed offline during vacation but I did miss you all and snuck in a read about halfway. I left cancer behind for a while, mostly. Of course, thoughts came here and there and I had a few drip drops of tears at a few sad thoughts that popped right in the brain without my permission. The worst was my gazing foundly at a mom at the beach and her 4 sweet young girls. They were such a beautiful family and for some reason I imagined her so close with them throughout their growing up and getting married and having their own families and her just being there for them always and then I began to feel robbed and I was just so jealous because I am sure that mom didn't have cancer but then again how would I know what she has. You know the stupid thoughts. Anyway, all in all it was a good time but I am glad to be back home. I love home. Chemo Tues. Wish me luck with the carbo and no allergic reaction. Best to all! ",

I'm on the couch to 5K progression, though I don't up the intensity every week but rather on my own schedule when I feel that it's become a bit too easy and that my heart rate no longer meets the rigorous level. Currently I run 3 min walk 1.5 min, run 5 min walk 2.5 minutes, then repeat. I thought I would hate running but it turns out I like it a lot and it truly does give me more energy. I too think that if I didn't have treatments knocking me down a bit, I would be an energetic wonder. I do regret that I didn't do this years ago. I feel so great! Not sure what to do once cold sets in. I love it b/c I'm outside. Started in the spring. Anyway, I had chemo today but platelets were discouraging. Only 80 after a three week break and only half the carbo cycle. No way I'll pass next Tues but they still want to try for it. If not we'll try for treatments on days 1 and 15 instead of 8. I doubt that's gonna pan out either. I also need to slow the infusion even more as I had another allergic reaction, though I caught the symptoms earlier and it was much easier to control. Feeling in limbo but do agree that we must just keep trying it and see what happens.",

How about a big one for all of us? I am strangely okay about the whole thing though. Probably not so realistic but I've got this idea in my head that carbo is just going to keep me stable even if I only can get it once a month or at reduced dosage. I'm just feeling so stupidly positive. Why bother with reality or likelihoods? What happens seems to be anyone's guess. So? How was the bike ride? I'm so glad your wrist is up to it. ",

Unfortunately, the way it works with our contract is that maternity leave comes out of sick leave so having had 3 children in the last 12 years, I don't have as many sick days banked as I would if I were a man (only this illness illuminated this inequity...had no complaints about it before). They're not exhausted but one year of treatment uses more than the 15 days I earn in a year, so once my surplus is gone, I'll be running short. I can use up to 45 donated days as well so hopefully it will all pan out. I am careful to use as sparingly as possible. I'd prefer to keep the half days. My daughters are 12, 10 and 7.

Also another line before immuno seems to decrease likely effectiveness of immuno. And, this trial requires I have new progression before beginning. I wish there were a fast track. Here's the study and the abstract from Ph1...begin at smiley face for the good part. I think those great results may be in a population of mostly BRCA mutations but still, they look so good. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02484404 Purpose Data suggest that DNA damage by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition and/or reduced vascular endothelial growth factor signaling by vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibition may complement antitumor activity of immune checkpoint blockade. We hypothesize the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor, durvalumab, olaparib, or cediranib combinations are tolerable and active in recurrent women's cancers. Patients and Methods This phase I study tested durvalumab doublets in parallel 3 + 3 dose escalations. Durvalumab was administered at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 1,500 mg every 4 weeks with either olaparib tablets twice daily or cediranib on two schedules. The primary end point was the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Response rate and pharmacokinetic analysis were secondary end points. Results Between June 2015 and May 2016, 26 women were enrolled. The RP2D was durvalumab 1,500 mg every 4 weeks with olaparib 300 mg twice a day, or cediranib 20 mg, 5 days on/2 days off. No dose-limiting toxicity was recorded with durvalumab plus olaparib. The cediranib intermittent schedule (n = 6) was examined because of recurrent grade 2 and non-dose-limiting toxicity grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AEs) on the daily schedule (n = 8). Treatment-emergent AEs included hypertension (two of eight), diarrhea (two of eight), pulmonary embolism (two of eight), pulmonary hypertension (one of eight), and lymphopenia (one of eight). Durvalumab plus intermittent cediranib grade 3 and 4 AEs were hypertension (one of six) and fatigue (one of six). Exposure to durvalumab increased cediranib area under the curve and maximum plasma concentration on the daily, but not intermittent, schedules. Two partial responses (≥15 months and ≥ 11 months) and eight stable diseases ≥ 4 months (median, 8 months [4 to 14.5 months]) were seen in patients who received durvalumab plus olaparib, yielding an 83% disease control rate. Six partial responses (≥ 5 to ≥ 8 months) and three stable diseases ≥ 4 months (4 to ≥ 8 months) were seen in 12 evaluable patients who received durvalumab plus cediranib, for a 50% response rate and a 75% disease control rate. Response to therapy was independent of PD-L1 expression.Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first reported anti-PD-L1 plus olaparib or cediranib combination therapy. The RP2Ds of durvalumab plus olaparib and durvalumab plus intermittent cediranib are tolerable and active. Phase II studies with biomarker evaluation are ongoing.",

It surely is like being diagnosed all over again. I am ultimately okay and know the facts and that I have many treatments yet to try. Tnbc is frightening in it's own right though. It grows so fast. I have to find another effective standard tx before I can attempt a trial again. They all have at least 3 week wash outs. If X doesn't work, and I can't find a single tbnc gal on these boards for whom it has, I won't be able to wait for the trial as next line...that would be at least 11 weeks without effective treatment. I think my liver would be a complete mess by then. I do so hope to be able to take a shot with immunotherapy at some point. That's where the durable responses are for tbnc. Though only a lucky few land them, I gotta know if I'm one of them.

Please know I rejoice with all great news and think about each of you when you power through the wait of what's next or what does this new feeling mean. We all know the drill. Stupid brain of mine can't even remember what I last posted here. Good news is that we've found a good treatment. Eribulin is killing it but me too. I think I'm finding my way around side effects though. The tumor fevers are the pits and they come with liver pain and massive headaches. Getting the timing right for taking Aleve in the fever cycles is what has helped. Figured out the pattern I think. Just had my second treatment of cycle one on Tuesday...one week delayed due to low neutrophils. Now we've added Neulasta so that should not be a problem again. Also just learned that Merck will cover cost of Keytruda for me so may add that too. Yikes about that with possibly being harder still but I'm willing to put up with some yuck for a while. Let's at least get these tumors back to measurable and separated from each other before we let up a bit. Hair's gonna go on Sunday night. Not excited about that but the ick of shedding like mad makes me ready. Have family pic scheduled for Sunday. Hoping to make it til then. Off to bed I go. One thing I will say is I am sleeping well.",

We're trying to give pembro a little more time to work and watching liver numbers and symptoms carefully. My onc is scanning early (Dec 27) even though it will be difficult to gauge success of treatment because she wants to keep tabs on how much worse things are potentially getting to help us decide if we should abandon ship and move on to something else. It will be a hard call. Increase of pain and pressure feels so hard to gauge. I feel it may getting worse but also think the duration of the discomfort makes it seem worse anyway. It surely is harder to find a positive attitude when there is pain that is constant reminder of the problem. I have two appts set up in Nashville while we visit family, at Sarah Cannon and Vanderbilt to consider trial options. Depending on how scans look we made decide to skip treatment and start the wash for a trial. I wish your team was listening to your symptoms more and thinking ahead. You may need to push them to do so. I forget how long you've been on Taxol. Need to go back and read. Wishing the best for you and all. So much going on round here lately.",

I'd love some fetal position crying but that does hurt. I can only sleep on my back. I have a wedge pillow so I use it about half the night for a little position variety. I spoke to my onc more about pain management. I was doing oxycodone every 4 hours round the clock but the past few days I've wanted more at 3 hours. She rx slow release morphine which I haven't tried yet. She also okayed use of copaipa oil or CBD oil along with the oxycodone or morphine. I've decided to add the copaipa to the oxycodone first. Should have it tomorrow. The pharmacy hand out for morphine scared the bajesus out of me. Don't be afraid to talk pain control. I am glad I did and hope something else helps a bit more. As for the IMMU trial, it states that no single tumor can have a dimension that exceeds 7 cm. I am at 6 cm or so they think. Still hard to accurately measure. There was a line that said some tumors over 7cm may be considered if approved by the medical monitor. So I think you have hope. Plus a good chemo should be able to get the tiny shrinkage you need to be eligible. I'm still considering the trial if we can get reds to stabilize.",

My onc said that small progressions wouldn't necessarily change the course of treatment as you want to get the most out of every drug you're on before switching. Unfortunately, I have no idea what is a small versus large progression. I suspect it might matter where the met is and how you are feeling. My mets are all liver and they are all much larger than yours but I again, I think size might not matter as much in the liver. It can function on such a small percentage of health...less than 50% for sure I can say based on my reports. Praying for your scan. You do mean Jan. 7, correct?",

More than half of my liver was filled with tumors, smaller ones being too many to count and at least two larger (10 x 6 and 10 x 7 cm, think medium potatoes). Before chemo took away my pain due to liver discomfort, I found 5 mg of oxycodone helpful (10 made me dizzy and nauseous). I had a CT of chest, pelvis, and abdomen 9 weeks after starting treatment and it showed that gem/carbo had cut the mets down to less than half the liver (this is an estimate the amount of the liver compromised...it is not actually contained to just one lobe or half of the liver but widespread). The two larger tumors are measured each scan to check treatment effectiveness. At 9 weeks they measured roughly 2 x 4 and 4 x 6 cm. My 18 week scan showed no reduction in size. I'm due for my next scan in 3 weeks. Still feel great so hoping this is indication of more stable scans. Praying for great results for you, too!",

I am on my first line of treatment so no tumor resistance yet (tx for almost a year now) but I expect it eventually. It's part of the stage 4 game. You find a treatment that works, it becomes resistant, you find another. Having to change treatments is scary to me as it brings me back to territory of the unknown and of course, I much prefer knowing where I am. Still, knowing so many here who have made treatment changes and all is okay helps tremendously. As for diet, I have always been had a fairly healthy diet but made some changes post my stage 1 dx to prevent recurrence. I cut back on meat, esp red, added more fish and vegetarian dishes. Ate more fresh veggies, added more Indian food (for turmeric benefits), flax seed, drank green tea to death, pretty much eliminated added sugars. I also began regular exercise (daily yoga and walking). These efforts scored me massive liver tumors in less than a year so I was a little bitter and will never believe diet is going to save me. Still, I think a great diet and exercise make you feel better and weather treatment better so I eventually came round to keeping the diet changes but with more allowance for dessert. Recently my onc has encouraged I get more cardio per a new trial about exercise and stage 4 breast cancer out of Sloan Kettering. There is a thread about this study with a gal who is actually in the study. I am gradually becoming a runner with the couch to 5K regimen (though I take it slower and do each stage until I feel like advancing). I thought I would hate running but I like it actually. I also believe in drinking lots of water. That being shared, I encourage you to do what makes you feel best. This diagnosis is about getting to live your life to the fullest. Our consolation prize is the gift of not taking life for granted.",

Third, you may find that whatever chemo you do, it is more tolerable than that for your initial dx. This seems to be true for many of us and no hair loss is a perk with several chemos, too.

No reason to think this but I do tend to make up things. Anyway, I understand that you are so scared. 4 months is not long enough for a treatment. I have to think though that there will be something else that will give you more mileage. This seems to be the case for so many others. Just b/c taxol was 4 mos. doesn't mean everything will be. And as for fairness, it is pretty clear cancer does not care. And sometimes it does entirely feel like it strikes the best people most often. I just can't believe any of it. Not for you or me or anybody. Atrocity!",

Ultimately, I'm not convinced anyone gets a better result there than with conventional care alone, but I do understand wanting to do everything you can. What I do wonder is if CTCA's standard medicine is as good as that of top conventional treatment centers. I also wonder if I wonder this b/c my aunt left my current center to go there and died in a year's time. They do cite superior survival rates, though some have called into question the validity of their data. It's a tough and personal choice.

Throughout my onc preferred to keep the the tx in subsequent weeks though they have done days 1 and 15 with some success for others. She also favored dropping gemzar with the hunch carbo is what works best for TNBC. Has worked so far. Wishing you the best to stay on current tx, provided it is doing what it's supposed to do.

It accurately pointed to effective treatment for me, though technically my onc sent me on the right path before the results even came back. I think you should get a second opinion. It seems very strange to have said that to you when it seems like basic practice to suggest this for breast cancer, at least as far as I understand. Does your onc specialize in breast cancer? Also, I do believe there are studies similar to F1. My onc mentioned that later on we may do genomic testing again as different ones test for different things. F1 was encouraged first b/c I believe it is the most or one of the most comprehensive ones. I was cautioned that sometimes insurance won't pay and have read of others here who had that problem so weighing cost to likely benefit may be something to consider, but if it is covered, I think the choice is obvious, and you should push for despite what your onc says. As for chemo, scrolling through and checking signatures in this thread might be a good way to pick up on them. All chemos can be effective with trip neg. I think some are more effective than others on different mets. E.g. gemzar is particularly effective on liver mets and is why we started with it. Xeloda and Abraxane in an immunotherapy trial are what have been lined up for my future treatments. ",

Forget the cute youthful pic you see with each post. I'm bald, browless, lash less, ungodly thin. Crepey dry skin covering bones and a belly swelled to at least the final month or two of the 3rd trimester with no expectant joy. Add to that a black eye. This is how I came out of the MRI which definitely diagnosed mets to my spine, focused on three vertebrae with possibility of diffuse mets in marrow. Also vertebrae have collapsed on to the spinal cord a bit but liver mets are stable and all things considered, I do feel pretty well...look awful. I see my onc on Tuesday then hubby and I fly off to St. Thomas. At my lowest point I thought it very possible I don't make it to the summer and I just had to see the sunshine and feel the warm air before I go, not to mention needed some sweet rest and time away with my love. Things improved shortly after booking the trip. Nevertheless, I have no regrets and can't wait to see those beautiful blue skies and waters. Seems we may do some radiation to spine and keep with cisplatin and gemzar as long as we can. Not sure I have much hope for a trial. My counts just take too long to recover to their standard.

What other options were considered in addition to Avastan? Why do they think Avastan is the best choice?

If not, I'd ask why not. I also really like what xxyed said about about statistics. No one can guarantee whether your next chemo will extend your life or not. Count on Avastan to extend your life. When it stops doing its job, count on something else. I know treatments will eventually run out but I'm not convinced you're there yet. Keep seeking the information you need. Let us know what you find out. Each question helps us all. ",

I find comfort in the knowing more and more people walking in similar shoes. I am 38 and was diagnosed on my family beach vacation in FL with extensive liver mets, just 7 months after treatment for stage 1a triple negative breast cancer. My girls are 12, 9, and 6 years old. I had two large tumors 6x10cm and 8x10cm, which at last look shrunk to 2x4 and 4x7 and will hopefully be even smaller when we take a looksy again next Thursday. I also have an uncountable number of smaller tumors in both lobes of my liver. So far I haven't met anyone with as much cancer in their liver as me. But, I'm doing great! I feel great, my treatment is working well (Gem and Carbo are my new besties), and I feel much more hope than I did at the onset of dx. I can see myself living out some beautiful , full years where before I could only see my death. The doctor in the tiny hospital in FL made a very big point to me about seeking treatment in a large center. I really encourage you to explore all of your options as far as that goes. Suggestions to get treatment locally but see an oncologist further away sound good to me. You may also wish to look into Cancer Treatment Centers of America. They will fly you for treatments for free but you do need the right insurance. They'll check for you. My aunt was treated there and spoke very highly but it didn't work for me insurance-wise or for convenience. I am close to a great center locally so it was a better choice for me. Best wishes and keep us updated. So glad your husband was able to be home for your first treatment. His words that you posted in a different topic really moved me. He knows well the truth. It is about today and the better I am able to embrace that truth, the better I live. You're in my prayers. Missy",

The next treatment I have lined up will include hair loss. I did scarves happily enough the first time but most comfortable was always bald or a loose knit cap...not the most attractive look. I never did this in public but always soon after getting home from work. Comfy clothes and head gear by 8pm or 7. When I think about what I hope will be years (rather than just 4 months as before) of being without hair, I'm not sure I can take the scarves or wigs that long. The plan is to brave it. I worry most about making others uncomfortable to be honest. Or, I think I'm being honest. Cancer has taught me that I am much vainer than I thought. I like what you said here: If it doesn't bother me, I don't see why I should worry about anyone else getting freaked out. I am going to try to remember that. MaryK, you must remember I am supposed to have two treatments in 2 weeks time and 2 weeks off but lately, I've had just one at a reduced dose followed by 3 weeks off. This has happened at least twice. Old energy is emerging...so super swell. Normally, I do feel pretty good (but not super well) but I did have tinnitus, not ringing but the heart-pounding sound in my ears earlier on. Is that your ear thing?

I have been on it a year and it is working very well for me. 10 cm liver tumors have been reduced to half or less in size and are currently staying stable (or so I hope - latest scan results due in today). No hair loss! Yay! I feel very well on gem/carbo as far as side effects go. I'm fatigued but functional on days 3-5, and am also a bit moody on those days, which drives me the most nuts. I've had trouble with white counts and have added Neulasta and later Neupogen to help with those. Currently platelets are really struggling and I've missed several treatments. We're looking to drop gemzar to help as it is perhaps the carbo that is most effective since I'm triple negative. It is encouraging to read how well you have been doing since dx is 2007. So glad to have you posting here. Let us know how everything goes with gem/carbo. ",

I met with a wonderful RO on Thursday. I really feel like I've won the lottery as far a medical professionals go. Here's the best first. On average 40-60% of patients respond and response lasts for an average of 6-12 mos. with no other treatment during that time. He does currently have a bc patient 2 years out and still not having to start chemo again. Sounds great! Maybe I can be her. Or better yet maybe I could be one of the colon or liver cancer patients 6-7 years out still not having to return to chemo. I had no idea such great results were out there. I'm not banking on them of course but who doesn't like a little dose of hope now and then. As for me, I for sure want this in my bag of tricks but the question is when. For me, this seems like a lovely next step for when my platelets tank. And the RO confirmed this before I even asked. I seem to have found a sweet spot for them with the carbo but they have been borderline most of this year so it does stand to reason they'll eventually get fed up. Or, perhaps the big P will come my way. So long as it doesn't rear its ugly head elsewhere in ways more threatening than my liver, after progression would be a good time, too. Ultimately, we're not gonna mess with this good thing I have going now. So I slide SIRT in position after carbo and before an immuno trial in the future plans list. ",

Oh, my, how progression rocks one's confidence. What to do? Also, had Gardant 360 done and will do biopsy again to get more info.

My platelets were flying high but neutrophils dropped from 631 to 20 in one day???? Why in the world did that happen? We will try again on Friday.

Liver enzymes fluctuate normally and even a healthy person can experience an enzyme slightly elevated from time to time and this is not a concern. I remember feeling the same way when a similar situation happened to me and my doctor said the above. Thought for sure the numbers would be climbing but it went right back to normal and stayed that way for a long time. Additionally, now my numbers are all high and when they fluctuate by 20 or so it is considered stable. If over time they continue to climb that is a different story but I really think right now, you have no reason to worry. My AST had climbed 80 points to over 200 in just 3 days and this had me in a panic but today it is back to where it was. Mo said it was due to the dehydration that had me try to raise hemoglobin for the trial. I am much relieved. Liver enzymes are funny things. ",

Had one platelet delay and now do Neulasta. I also have some painful veins that continue to act up post treatments even though I've had a port for a while now. I do wish I had gotten the port from the get-go. I took and antibiotic for the vein pain (phlebitis) and it has helped (no longer need ibuprofen for the flair ups). I don't recommend gem/carbo without a port...I thought I was okay at the time (didn't mind the burning during tx so much) but problems came later and have persisted...didn't know this was a possibility so maybe I'm rare. Not terrible but we don't need more annoyances if they can be avoided. Sugarbaby, after gem/carbo fails and I hope it doesn't any time soon (I know of 2 people who did multiple years on it), if liver function is still good, I'll do Xeloda. The roller coaster...ohhh, at the moment I think I'm over my worry about what's next, what if...,etc. because all is good at the moment, but one thing even hints at going wrong and I'm sure I'll slip back into pity and fear.

It's tested for hundreds of things but mine only hit three, one that confirms why gem/carbo works so well, one that doesn't point to any known helpful treatments, and one for some drug that is only standard treatment for hormone positive cancers but I might be able to get as part of a trial or with some begging at the feet of my insurance company (apparently my young age can help in the begging). The biopsy can be done again later to check for changes in the tumor make-up that might point to more targeted treatment options. The James Research Hospital (at Ohio State University) where I am being treated also has its own genomic testing platform that might find something different for trial matching. On a different note, I think I have recalled the gal I thought I remembered whose tumors changed from trip-neg to hormone positive and I got it backward. She was hormone positive and morphed to trip-neg. Not the cool direction.",

I don't feel like it but I'm going to try to ride my bike for a few this morning to see if that perks me up any before work. Sometimes I think it's just moodiness too. It seems my period tries to come back over breaks and then chemo shuts it all down again. Good news is my skin clears up pronto. Thank you steroids. Best wishes with gem/carbo. It's done very well for me. I'm hoping to stay on for a good while longer but my platelets are still hanging on the borders.",

I feel my doctor is on it and has already been searching for the best trials for me so I haven't looked on my own. As for your concern re: getting a placebo, we all of course wish to be in the test group but being in the placebo group does not mean you get nothing. You will still get a treatment that is understood to be effective. The one I am looking to do is with abraxane (a chemo) and an immunotherapy. I'd either get abraxane alone or in combination with the immuno drug. There is a chance do a study at OSU where all get the trial drug, so of course this is what I most want. \"Kaayborg. May your carbo go well. I've been reading about immunotherapy and it seems like you are a candidate for immunotherapy. Here is one list of clinical trials. And here is another. May Carboplatin be easy and work for a long time, but Immunotherapy is something to start researching. Immunotherapy has been accepted as promising for breast cancer, particularly TN HER+ and heavily treated cancers.\" I don't have a list of chemos good for TN but from reading on these boards I've come across several different ones. Xeloda, Abraxane, Gemzar, Carboplatin, Taxol, CMF. There are likely more and certain ones work better for different types of mets. They also work in different ways so just because you don't respond to one doesn't mean the others are junk. (Pretty sure AC/T didn't do a thing for me since I had a liver full of mets just 7 months post tx). For me, my onc also mentioned Afinitor a targeted therapy standard for hormone positive but one that is proving to work with TN in some trials. My tumor tests showed it might work for me and so my onc thought we could petition the insurance companies to cover it as standard care or perhaps get it as a trial drug down the line. So, point being there should be several options for you. I'd ask your onc what he/she thinks you should try next and next. I've told my onc that it gives me peace of mind to be one or two steps ahead so she's willing to guess the future plan of action the best she can.",

They tape all in place and just a small tube hangs outside your shirt...no need to leave anything open. It's so unnoticeable that my center puts a colored sticker on you just to make sure no one forgets to de-access you before you leave. If you get a power port it can be used for blood draws, CT scans, chemo...just about anything, anywhere. So much more comfortable during infusions as you can move freely and never feel a pull. I forget it's there. You can even get numbing cream so you don't even feel the stick. I got the rx but never filled it as the stick is so much easier than any IV was, I never thought it worth the trouble. The only negative for me is that mine is extremely visible (I am very thin). Nurses love it b/c it's so easy to find but not so much me. I was self-conscience about swim suit season and tried so hard to find a tank-style suit that would hide it.

My tumor was tested to see if anything changed to positive. That would open up a few more treatment options so it is always good to check. I'm negative everything so no luck with that yet, but it could still change so we retest at each progression. As for prognosis, isn't that the BIG question. Many MOs don't venture to put a time frame estimate on things (there is truly no way to forecast how each individual will respond to treatment), but from what I've gathered from others here, that is a typical time frame given, 2-3 years. Bone mets only is better generally speaking. You have no idea where you fit in the whole scheme of things. Triple negatives have a worse prognosis but there are ladies on here with TNBC who have outlived those not TNBC. There are a couple ladies I know of who are 8 or 9 years out from their mets dx with TNBC. I try to think about that end of the spectrum, but it is hard especially at the beginning and then again when progression hits, which is where I am sitting right now. And sadly yes, chemo is not going to work forever. Pray for dumb cancer that takes a long time to find a way around each weapon and for tolerable side effects. The goal is to find effective treatment and stay on as long as possible so you can add up those years. Definitely keep looking at trials. Immunotherapy is proving most successful with TNBC. Though not many respond, those who do can get a really long time out of it. I hope to take my shot at immuno at some point. Wishing the very best for all of us. The beginning is such a tough place to be. It's a roller coaster ride for sure but it does get better with time. Lots of good life to live!",

I also sent a few more to the study coordinator. I really like what you said about the importance of exploring hypothetical options before progression. Too true. I would be in the durvalumab-o arm...which all the further makes this study hard to pass up. You have me reconsidering Xeloda next. Any pulse on the current info regarding heavily pre-treated cancers and immunos' effectiveness? My previous understanding was immunos are best earlier rather than later, which is why we were really hoping for immuno next. Atezo's single agent effectiveness drops from 27% to 7% from first line to second line, for example. Not sure how tomorrow's going to shake out but I have feeling I'll either end up doing Xeloda or going for Opdivo off-study, alone or with Abraxane. Doubt I'll be waiting for durvalumab. Anybody know if Abraxane sometimes works if Taxol did not? No way to know for sure but having had Taxol at stage 1a and ending up with a liver choke full of cancer 6 months later leads me to believe it maybe wasn't so hot. Also, anyone experience \"heartburn\" as a result of an angry liver? I've got pain right under my breasts, upper rib cage area and through to my back in same area, and it's worse in the evening when I have more abdominal bloating, though today, it was fairly uncomfortable even during the day. This happened right before my mets diagnosis so I think I just need to get on treatment and fast. Will see what the numbers are with tomorrow's blood draw. ",

When she left my husband and I looked at each other, both thinking the exact same thing. \"\"She said everything Z said\" ...before we could even ask it, even the part of about not telling the trial coordinators I'm starting another treatment. She was funny about this, not wanting me to think her shady in any way but clearly she is frustrated as well with the bureaucracy and said as much. So it's Xeloda. Happy to have a plan but bummed for the first time ever to be facing a three day weekend. One more day delay in getting started on something. Gosh, I hope it works. The speed of this cancer just freaks me out. Liver enzymes were elevated some over last week but not so very much to have to go with a bigger gun than Xeloda. I'll do blood tests weekly for a while to keep check. All in all I feel good about the decision and the appt. The one crappy piece is that the cancer may have escaped the liver. Have a palpable nodule just north of my navel. Could be just fatty tissue. I think I already know it's not. Please Xeloda, stop this train.",

I have some more specific questions for you but no time to word that out right now. I did want to say right away that trip negatives not changing to positives is absolutely false. My doctor gave me a very specific stat that trip-neg turns HER+ about 30% of the time. This is one of the things we hoped would have happened for me to open more treatment doors and why it is our plan to biopsy again when chemos stop working (it can change at any time in the journey). I don't know about changing to hormone positives but for some reason I think I am remembering a post from someone where that had occurred. My doctor did not mention that though so I'm thinking maybe not something that occurs, or not very often, or she would have mentioned it as well. As for the gem/carbo schedule, it can be done that way. I get gem and carbo on day 1 and 8, though I'm not aware of it helping with counts one way or another.",

I am wondering if it is more a matter of what type of patient a particular trial is looking for. Homehelp, she also told me last Tuesday that these drugs are very close to market for breast cancer. I didn't ask how close but I inferred from the context of the conversation that if I can truly get a lot more mileage out of this chemo, I might not even have to do a trial. This may be pipe dream wishing but it's always nice to have something to hope for. Speaking of mileage, however, I flunked chemo today. Whites were too low. Now my schedule will be Day 1 chemo, Days 2-4 Neupogen, Day 8 chemo, Day 9 Neulasta, two weeks recovery, repeat. Hopefully Neupogen can do its thang! There is no predicting anything with this disease. My counts should have been fine based on patterns of the past. Oh, well!",

But, if it's not one thing it's another. I developed the allergic reaction that sometimes occurs with multiple carbo treatments...face turned blotchy beet red, developed hives, some itchiness on the back of my neck, and slight tightening of my throat. Got everything back in control within an hour after lots of drugs. It was a bit frightening with a room full of nurses, the pharmacist and doctor in the room, looking at me, gauging that I'm getting worse not better and injecting more meds. But not allowing yourself to panic (my 7 year old was with us) does have a way of actually keeping you calm and all is well now, though I spent the last several hours sleeping all that off. I am continuing now with just carbo, dropping the gemzar to help with platelets. So I guess I need update. We'll be adding new premeds with my carbo next time and lengthening the admin time. Thanks for the info on adding the signature. I don't make decisions easily so it'll be a while before I determine what I might want to add.",

Josie, I completely get what you mean about trying to keep names and situations straight. Chemo brain is of no assistance either, but what I do love so much about all the ladies here is the grace we extend to one another. You can get us all mixed up and we won't care a lick. We just want to know we're not alone and we want to support each other however we can. It would be nice if there were a way to reply as you read instead of having to wait until the end. Hyde - I do wish you the best in staying with Mr. Ned. Let us know! Rosieo, I had some facial twitches that my onc checked with a brain MRI which came back clear. I wish the same for you and suspect it will be. It had worried me a bit too as I was not expecting her to order an MRI when I mentioned it, but she just wanted to be sure she wasn't missing something. Steph, the trials my onc have mentioned for me are at Vanderbilt and at OSU (my home center). I don't know much about them but she was excited about them for me. I am not PDL1 positive and asked her about this but she said they are getting good results even for those not positive. I'm guessing there are trials you can be in where it does not matter. Ks - I considered CTCA in Chicago. My aunt went there and she had wonderful things to say about it. She was TNBC stage iv for a year but got treatment there for only her last 5-6 months. I looked into it as an option but my insurance wasn't accepted. Even before that I wasn't sure that the care they give would be superior to my home center and worth the travel. Never had to make the choice though as money made it for me. Best wishes to you! I do love their complemetary medicine aspect. Back to chemo on Tuesday. Hoping to keep my newly tanned complexion and leave deep purple/red for the beets (I did post about my allergic reaction last time, I think).

When I found out I had mets my first thought was of my aunt who was TN and passed away 1 year after her stage 4 dx, just 6 mos before mine...sigh. (I do miss her so much and wish often that we could have shared longer on this journey. She thought I hadn't a worry in the world being stage 1a when she was 4.) I also read some study for which 12 mos was the mean survival with the longest being 100 months. I worried I'd follow my aunt's footsteps and that study's average but here I am with yesterday being one year for me since mets dx (totally forgot to celebrate)! Now I focus on the 100 months plus some given our tx options just keep getting better. Someone recently shared with me in a different thread a great article about mean survival rates. I'll post it following this otherwise I'll end up losing what I've written so far. There is a also a gal I read a post for just a few days ago who is going to be 8 years with TN mets this August. She's still doing great! Right after my dx, I actually went searching through the boards for ladies with TN and liver mets and found a poster who will be at 9 years in November. I hold on to these stories and hope mine will be the same. Both have gotten many great years from trials. Often I default to the assumption that b/c I'm TN I'll not fair as well as those with other types and more treatment options. But that is not always true either. Maybe ours odds aren't as good but in the end it only comes down to how you, yourself respond to treatment...stats are just stats.",

Scans are usually done every 8-12 weeks and they will tell if it's working. If scans are stable, it's working. If shrinking, all the better. I don't have any palpable cancer to gauge how I'm doing so I can only go on symptoms and scans. I like my scans closer to the 8 weeks than the 12. Scans can always be done sooner so ask if you need to. I was in a panic once about progression based on how I felt and my doctor did early scans for me even though she was not concerned. Scans were good and I got peace of mind and have found myself I bit more patient since (but not that patient).",

I highly recommend getting one. Gemzar burns during the infusion. It's not terrible and I put up with it for several infusions as I didn't want a port. However, it also really kills your veins. I had tons of hard knots and eventually after a 6 stick attempt to get an IV in, I got the port for the next round. Sooooo easy with a port, no burning...wonderful. We're in this for the long haul so I recommend the port 100%. Even after I had the port, my veins continued to be sore due to phlebitis. I thought I'd permanently damaged them but it did go away in a few weeks after no longer using them. Of course, not everyone has this trouble, but Gemzar is known to be particularly rough on the veins. You'll be fine for the first round if you can't get a port right away (a heating pad helps with the discomfort) but get a port I tell you. I have not regretted it!",

Mine did not actually turn up much helpful information so I'd have to defer to others to help you gauge its value if it comes at a large cost. If you do a trial and there is requirement of having a certain protein expression, the testing would be done for you most likely (I think they like their own testing, even biopsies often must be redone, I think, others confirm, please). Also, at least in my situation, I don't have expression of the protein for PD-L1 trials but plenty of results say it doesn't actually matter entirely so it's still a good option for TNBC.

The only people who don't know are the children in my life, including my students (that is they don't know the prognosis, they do know I have cancer and always will). I also do not give parents of my students access to posthope. The population I work with does not have the best discretion when it comes to what they share with their children so I ultimately don't trust them with the information. I even emailed the entire school staff to let them know what day I was walking in without my hair and told them how to act (say hi and pretend nothing happened). The only thing I have some trouble with now is what to do with new people I meet. We moved last year mid-June and in July I got my mets dx. None of our neighbors know because when exactly do I bring it up? Families of my girls' new friends don't know either. When you first meet someone it's a bit much to drop in the first few conversations. Plus it hides so well now.",

I read a lot into your comment about pushing ahead the years as far as we can. Of course, it is what we are all hoping and it sucks to have to hope such things. My onc is very enthusiastic about immunotherapy trials particularly the one in combo with Abraxane which Homehelp mentioned above. It is what I plan to try for next when carboplatin fails me. I've heard results for TNs described as game changing, which isn't to say they offer a cure but that we may at last have something more than chemo to add years to our lives.",

Keep posting! And finally, to Amber. In my case, I know we did chemo first b/c I needed fast results with a liver dangerously burdened by cancer. No time to find and enter a trial. Immunotherapy is what I plan to do next. My onc said that immunotherapy gets best results as first or second line of treatment, though there are also good results for those who have had more chemo. And you should know that is measured by the number of treatments you have had in the metastatic setting...your prior treatments don't count. So, mine would be second line and yours would be considered first if you chose an immunotherapy trial over chemo. Immunotherapy is getting good results for TNBC and I don't think you need to worry that b/c it is in trial it is any less likely to work for you than chemo. If I were you, I think I'd try for the trial. If it doesn't work out, there's always chemo to fall back on.",

I do hope it works and works well. As for me, I have just yelled at my mother-in-law. Something I have never done, very unlike me. We could blame it on some drugs or something but it's been almost 2 weeks so steroids probably aren't at fault. I think cancer and its impending doom may be, though. The issue is actually my husband's health. He recently learned that he has rather high blood pressure, which runs on his mother's side of the family. I encouraged immediate action by following dietary recommendations for those at risk for heart disease, exercising, and losing some weight (something she's chosen not to do). He has done a great job and lost 20 pounds already. She keeps making comments that he's fine just the way he is, this visit and on her last a month ago. First it was that he shouldn't be cutting out so much salt. The body needs salt. Now it's that he looks fine and needs to be careful he doesn't get too thin. All bogus concerns. At comments this evening, I snapped. This is such a touchy issue b/c my children are not going to be orphans!!!!! I only wish my cancer came with a warning sign. My words were fine but my tone was anything but..This is not about how he looks, this is about his health and it would be nice if you could be supportive of his efforts for once because his health happens to be very important to me and our family (read between the lines lady because my 7 year old is behind you and I can't remind you that someday sooner or later he's gonna be all she's got). Steamed I am and my DH just came to let me know that when I stormed out she commented that we can't believe everything we read on the internet. You know that's just someone's opinion. People have been eating sausages for years. It's hard to argue with this nonsense, which is why I usually don't. We''ll just add health to the topics we don't discuss.",

I wanted to offer you some of what I know about Y90 from my consultation about a year ago with an RO and my MOs comments to me when I mentioned trying it recently after carbo failed. I've been meaning to post this for a while as many have been looking into Y90 of late. First, I believe I understand where doctors are coming from when they keep emphasizing systemic, especially for those of us with cancer of the rapidly aggressive variety. In the year since my consult, my MO had multiple patients try Y90 and it did not turn out well for them. She seemed very upset by this and thus, while saying she doesn't mean to practice anecdotal medicine, she just couldn't recommend it for me. In short, in the time they wait for liver inflammation to subside so they can begin systemic treatment again, mets popped up in other locations and they lost control of the disease. Those with slower growing cancers or who have other systemic options available to them besides chemo and can stay on this while Y90 is done, I think have no reason not to try it. For others, I do have some reservations. I haven't completely ruled it out for myself but would like to put it further down the line, if I am blessed with more years, so there perhaps will be more data on what this procedure is doing for breast cancer patients and when it's best to try and when not. The rads immediately after Y90 sounds tough and it surely will be but I think if Y90 is done, you simply cannot ignore other mets in the meantime, especially the brain. Finally, I received different information from my RO consult regarding being around kids and other people. They said there is not reason to be as conservative about this as was once thought. No one should be right up against my liver for hours at a time (no sitting on lap all day or cuddle sleeping all night) but otherwise no restrictions. I was even allowed to teach my 6 and 7 year olds. He also said most do not experience excessive fatigue. Not sure what you do with that but there's a second opinion of sorts from my RO. Prayers to you as you wade these horrible waters.",

That is a great description. I can't get the sig to display my date for starting gem/carbo. As soon as I updated with the carbo only, the date disappeared. I started gem/carbo in Aug. 2015. It worked great but platelets couldn't hack it despite reductions of gemzar and delays. The hunch was carbo was most effective and this seems to be correct as I've stayed on it alone with success for almost another year now. I have only liver mets but loads of them, innumerable small and two big ones, which were first discovered at almost 10cm each and are now about 2-4 cm in size. The most reduction happened right away and now I'm staying stable or a few mm smaller scan after scan. Keep in touch with your treatment plan. I hope stable is in the works for you very, very soon!",

Kaylynne, we are going to New York the weekend before Thanksgiving. Starting to get very excited. I also live with a huge house of Harry Potter fans. We do need to plan to get out there, too. Your progression sounds very similar to mine...about a 2 cm increase along with new leisons, though I had many more leisons. I'm so glad your are quickly finding a new treatment. My experience with gem/carbo was a very good one. It took lots of adjusting to find the right dose that was tolerable...we decreased gemzar a couple times and then dropped it all together. I also needed the help of neulasta and neupogen to help with white counts. All this happened over the course of a year. Then I had an allergic reaction to start the second year, but doing 16 titrations and premeds prevented it and I stayed on another year before progression. I felt very well on it but I know others have had a harder go. I wish the best for you. If you do decide to go with a trial, get it moving as fast as you can and don't be afraid to ask how you can start sooner. I waited for a trial, ended up not getting and in the meantime those tumors just took over my liver. All did work out in the end as eribulin has things back under control but I thought I'd give warning from one tnbc gal to another. Don't delay if you can help it! Next treatment decisions are so difficult. Praying wisdom for you! I do hope to hear from mom soon! Dani is still on everyone's mind, mine too!",

I am glad that we have each other here, however. To Hartrish, boy do I ever know what you mean about having to wait to get into trials and not wanting to. I just made a similar decision after my first line of treatment (gemzar/carbo...same as you, then just carbo) failed to work. I wanted the trial next so badly, but decided I couldn't wait and was about to swallow Xeloda (pill chemo). Then, they were able to see me sooner so I waited for it another week. Then, I was not accepted because platelets were too low. So I ended up being off treatment for 5 weeks. I could have waited longer for platelets but did not feel it wise. Not even sure it was wise to wait period. I can offer lots of hope to you regarding gem/carbo. I was on gem/carbo about a year, and then carbo alone for a year. I tolerated it very well and had 2 years of blissfully normal life, with just a little shadow of cancer. These chemos are hard on blood counts, though. I struggled with them throughout but little adjustments helped me stay on wonderfully effective treatment. I used Neulasta to help with white counts, and when that still did not help we added Neupogen. We reduced the gemzar twice and added an extra week of recovery (2 on 2 off instead of one). Then we dropped the gemzar altogether, but then I developed the carbo allergy. So, we added more premeds and slowed the infusion and then we slowed it even more. All of this kept us one our toes but I am very pleased that my onc worked so hard to make my first line last so long for. I just found out tumors started growing again last month and so have switched treatments. Still waiting to see if it's working or not. Hate waiting! As for trials, I recommend that you be looking now for trials you are interested in and start making phone calls to the research coordinators. It's always good to have the next step in mind to try to save time. That being said I have learned that studies usually require a 3 week washout after your prior treatment, so that will always be a tricky issue. I agree with your decision to start chemo instead. It is best to get disease under control as quickly as possible with extensive liver mets. I have the same. 2 were nearly 10 by 10 cm. Innumerable others. Gem/carbo cut them down to 2-4 cm and held them stable for a long time. I will also add for your information that my doctor would treat when platelets were 75 and more than once she let me go ahead when the were mid 60s. I also got scans every 2-3 months. It seems you might be waiting longer than that. ??? I see you were also stage 1A at initial dx. Oh, the irony of \"early detection is the best protection.\" To, Pearl, I'm gonna get back in a few.",

I am currently perhaps more fearful than I have ever been before.

At no point will I ever be ready, but I will continue to be greedy for more and more time to the very end. I cry loads too generally speaking but this diagnosis does carry with it a sort of numbness. Only a few times in the past 3 years have I really let it all out. Mostly I just leak here and there as a random sad thought breaks in. So my health update is that I postponed treatment today. Scans are inconclusive. No new mets found but they can't be sure there aren't any through all the mess of old tumors. One appeared to measure slightly smaller and one slightly bigger. Enzymes continue to go down but my tm doubled in just a month. 500 to 1000. Decided to get full details from trials this week, check in again on enzymes and tm in a week and either begin the trial and perhaps go back to pembro later or continue with pembro next Friday and save the trial for later. Wish there was a button you could push and see what's really working and not. Oh well...instead we wait. Any word on your tm's yet?",

Horrible discomfort in my big fat pregnant abdomen (full time maternity gear now and constant questions from students when my baby is due, boy or girl, etc.) and then lymphedema making for big fat painful legs. Switched to morphine 2x daily and abdominal discomfort is improved. Added compression stocking and physical therapy and legs are much improved but nothing is perfect.

I do want to live til spring to try IMMU132 as it is my best chance of getting a good reduction in tumor size so I can live in better comfort. Kaylynne, I'm responding here though much of what I read about you and your upcoming decisions is coming from the liver thread. I don't believe at all that you've used all your big guns. I am prone to think you need to try another chemo to get things to settle down before hassling with trials again. Many on the liver thread tout immunotherapy as some great promise for tnbc and it is definitely a must try as it yields long term results when it works. However it works for only 10-15% and that is as lower response rate than standard chemos and it takes longer to see results. I took my chance with Keytruda but I don't think much is going on. It may be keeping me stable but that still is unclear. I would ask your onc about starting eribulin while you seek insurance approval for compassionate use of Keytruda which you can add to the eriibulin in combo later for perhaps a better response. That is what I tried but eribulin stopped working by time we were just one cycle into the Keytruda/eribulin combo. Find something to help until spring. Then we can give IMMU132 a whirl when on the market. If you search for Keytruda/eribulin in tnbc you can read the study results. They are decent. All for now. I fear we have lost Texasrose. Uhhh...so sad. I just hate this whole situation.",

I had to get going somewhere and now need to finish my thoughts to you, Kaylynne (had meant to delete and start all over). Was going to say the eribulin took 3 cm off largest tumors very quickly but that 3 cm quickly grew right back. We had just added pembro at the time of the progression scan so kept on with the eribulin/pembro combination to see if with pembro, eribulin still had something to offer. I think it may have but only managed to keep me stable and stable wasn't feeling so comfortable, plus we weren't completely sure about the stable deal since my scans have been so hard to read and we didn't want to risk a sudden progression because it just might be too much. As for Xeloda, we were again in an edge of crisis place, and after a week and a half on it, I only felt worse, not any better so we moved on. Sometimes I wonder if we moved on too soon but I do totally trust my doctor. She said it should have had some effect by that time and I believe her 100%. So many have valid complaints about their care but I'm living in a practically perfect world here. My doctor is working hard for me and is there for me 24/7. She's incredibly well-respected, knowledge, and her level of empathy and concern for me is out of this world. I share thoughts with her, we weigh options, I ask for her best opinion and do what she says. Have you gotten your Xeloda yet? I don't want you waiting for long. As for F1 and Caris, I've only had F1 and we have done it twice, both at my onc's suggestion and with her help. It turned back very little the first time and absolutely nothing the second. I'm not of the understanding that what it may turn back is necessarily the best option for us. It's just an option. One on my first report was a drug approved only for hormone positive bc. My onc said it may be possible to get approved off-label but really it wasn't a tx she was that excited about. We don't know any data on its effectiveness like we do for other drugs, and just because something about my tumor indicates it may work, doesn't mean it will. Being PD-L1 positive might improve my chance of immunotherapy working but it doesn't mean anything for certain either. It is such a guessing game. Will your onc explain why she isn't interested in F1 if you ask? All onc's should take the time to explain the reasoning behind their decisions. Hartrish, glad to hear you are staying the course and that se's are manageable. As for my dear friend Julie (Texasrose), I have learned that she passed away a few days ago. She is a beautiful soul. I know she lives on. I hate cancer.",

Or maybe you'll just be able to get it when it's approved, before summer 2018 I was told at the trial center. Right now you are not eligible with a tumor dimension over 7 cm. Stay strong with gem/carbo. Hoping it does great for you. I am hearing from multiple oncs that PARPs are not a great choice for TNBC without BRCA mutations. Maybe as a last resort but there are better options still for me (and you Kaylynne) at this point. Take care all!",

Forget the cute youthful pic you see with each post. I'm bald, browless, lash less, ungodly thin. Crepey dry skin covering bones and a belly swelled to at least the final month or two of the 3rd trimester with no expectant joy. Add to that a black eye. This is how I came out of the MRI which definitely diagnosed mets to my spine, focused on three vertebrae with possibility of diffuse mets in marrow. Also vertebrae have collapsed on to the spinal cord a bit but liver mets are stable and all things considered, I do feel pretty well...look awful. I see my onc on Tuesday then hubby and I fly off to St. Thomas. At my lowest point I thought it very possible I don't make it to the summer and I just had to see the sunshine and feel the warm air before I go, not to mention needed some sweet rest and time away with my love. Things improved shortly after booking the trip. Nevertheless, I have no regrets and can't wait to see those beautiful blue skies and waters. Seems we may do some radiation to spine and keep with cisplatin and gemzar as long as we can. Not sure I have much hope for a trial. My counts just take too long to recover to their standard. So it's just a few chemos left. Bluebird, I appreciate you asking about me. All of you mean the world to me. Praying for good news for all of us. So much changing and happening too fast. Hate it.",

Does your center offer the On Body Injector (OBI) for Neulasta? It's new I believe and I love it, though it sounds kind of weird. They put it on you at infusion (I do my belly), then it goes off 27 hours later and administers meds. Shetland, ughhhhhh. I'd feel the same as you, that my fears were legit and symptoms were worrisome. In your shoes, I'd be doing the same and getting in sooner than a month. And, I know my onc would oblige me even if she didn't feel it actually necessary. She has said this many times...\"I don't want to cause you anxiety so if scanning sooner is helpful, I don't mind at all ordering them, but I think it's okay to wait.\" Sometimes I have waited and other times not. Also, I will add that my onc told me that she would not change my treatment right away even if there were some progression. We might tighten the scan schedule but the ultimate goal is to stay on current treatment as long as possible. I do highly respect her opinion on matters. I, too, am at a great cancer center but gained further confidence in my doctor when my local stage IV friend flew to MDAnderson and was told by doctors there that her onc (mine as well) was as good as they get and she should stay home and feel confident there is no better treatment found anywhere else. Still, I'd want to know the plan, And, I'm in complete agreement with Woodylb, this is not your doing. Cancer just does this. Exercise and diet and rest and zen behavior, I think they'll help us feel best but they're not going to stop this. Make sure you get the very best care from your onc. You deserve it. I'm rooting for you and praying for you. Keep us posted, open the floodgates of your worry, then reign it back in. Did you see Bridge of Spies? I'm always thinking of the guy on trial, how Tom Hank's character said to him, \"You don't seem worried.\" And he would reply, \"Would it help?\" I love that guy.

At the time of my dx, when I asked about local treatments, I was told none were possible until I had only a couple smaller tumors. My onc said Tuesday that radioembolization, which can be used on multiple tumors as Shetland well described, is now being used in breast cancer patients with liver mets but it is not considered standard treatment. It'd be great to have long range data that says it extends life for the bc patient but I'm good with hoping for the best so long as the risk is light, as it appears to be. We'll see.",

Rosio - My onc does CT of the abdomen, chest and pelvis every 3 cycles, which is 9 weeks (shorter than the 3 month schedule, maybe b/c my liver mets are large and extensive???). I only have liver mets. Is that the same for you? I don't know if this matters is what kind of scans are best. I did have a bone scan when the liver mets were first found based on my back pain and a brain MRI b/c of migraines but they were clean. Surfdreams - Were you really stage IV triple neg. in 2009? And you are still doing so well?! Either way, I'm adding you to my list of stories of hope. Loving all those years!!!! May you have many, many more!!!! Also, thanks for sharing about the desensitizing. It was just mentioned to me today that after 6 cycles allergic reactions can occur b/c of build up. If this happens with me, I'll be sure to get that literature from you if unknown to my doctor as well. Sugarbaby - We are much alike in the control freak area. Guess you're my phlebitis twink, too. My fourth treatment, 6 pokes, and extra burning and I rushed for my port as well. I would have gladly gotten a port sooner but there was no reason to, known to me anyway. I figured why add more foreign material to my chest before necessary. I am glad to know in 2 months phlebitis may be history. Also, glad to know about calling the National Cancer Institute when needed. Hula hoops...ouch! My purse strap sometimes falls off my shoulder and...Wow! And, you are also a story of hope to me...3 years and many more...rollercoaster or not. Now a few more questions for you Sugarbaby, about your young children. I have 3 aged 12, 9 and 6. When I was stage 1A, I told them about cancer, about treatment I might need, about how things looked very good, how cancer doesn't mean you're going to die, about how I would always be honest with them so they didn't need to worry that I wasn't okay but just not telling them. And now stage 4...they know I have cancer again, they know it is more serious and so I will never stop having treatment. I have not brought up the \"D\" word. I have not gotten bad news from scans yet...only potentially bad news that I privately freak out about. My husband and I had decided we would tell more about how things were going to keep converstaion open after our youngest revealed in a conversation that she didn't think she was supposed to talk about my cancer (ouch!). I started a thread asking others what they tell their children. All posters seemed to keep bad news to themselves. I do get that. I don't want them to feel my worry or worse worry as they are children and not adults but I also don' t want them to feel shut out or wish they were told sooner. So I'm still on the fence. Would love your perspective. What do your kids know? How do you stay honest but not alarming? Have you bridged the topic of death? I worry that they know and fear it but keep fears to themselves because I'm not talking about it. No actual signs of this except perhaps from my youngest. My aunt died last year. Same trip. neg. cancer in a year's time. I honestly cannot remember what they knew about her similarity to me but they know she had breast cancer and died. This occurred before I was stage 4. My oldest asked about her once and I explained about stage differences and how were in different situations. Has she figured out that has changed? I don't know. Heavy I know but...what to do?  ",

I do hope the meds for pain help you, and more so, I hope you find the treatment that works so the pain won't be masked but gone. As far as I understand, your situation is pretty much the same as mine...both triple negative and both with having just one line of treatment (gem/carbo) in the advanced disease setting (if you did chemo with your initial diagnosis assuming you weren't stage 4 out of the gate, that treatment doesn't count). My doctor says we definitely do the trial next because having no more than 1 prior treatment is criteria for some trials and the fewer treatments you have before the trial with pd-1 the more likely you are to respond. I hope that the info from purplegirl helps you to find the trial. I am counting on my doctor to find the trials and have no idea how to do this myself. Where do you live? On the off chance it is near Ohio, there is a trial currently open at OSU where I am treated that I believe you would qualify for, since I do. It is for a combination therapy of abraxane and pd-1. Together these are getting great results and my doctor says it will be the combo trial we go for whether it is at OSU or a national trial (if the OSU trial is full when I need it). Maybe if you start Abraxane and it is part of trial it won't count as 2 lines of treatment??? I think you are going to have to start something while you find and apply for a trial either way. I don't know how long this process takes. Hopefully others can offter their expereince. As for me, I flunked chemotoday b/c of platelets. I'll try again next week and we are reducing the gemzar dose to give me a break. My doctor has a current patient who is on cycle 40 of gem/carbo after similar reductions so I hold hope that even in its less potent dose it will continue to work for me as with her. I feel very relaxed about the whole thing and I know it is b/c of this forum and becoming comfortable with the ins and outs of this disease that I am able to see this as not a setback but an normal part of the journey.",

The fact that you are here and reading through all our posts in effort to understand and to help her, that is very touching. Having the support of friends and family has been the number one blessing throughout this process for me. I have been sent/given flowers, gift cards, meals, books, movies, journals, blankets, lotions, jewelry, lip balm, candy... just about everything you could think of. A couple of people just never let up with the little surprises to brighten my life. It does not annoy me, nor does it matter much to me what the gift...it's the thought and care I know is behind it, the fact I cannot feel alone with all these caring people surrounding me. My advice would be to go ahead and truck a freezable meal to her without her permission and suggest she save it for when she needs it. Then, restock after it's been eaten. Also, send a card every week or so (snail mail is so special these days). If possible, invite her for regular walks. There two things I believe in for fighting fatigue and feeling well...walking and drinking water (though I cannot top your consumption, Texasrose). Even if the exercise doesn't actually help, the conversation is certainly therapeutic. Ask questions and listen. I appreciate questions from close friends. Talking about it with a few special people helps a lot.",

It has been explained to me that while there are foods that help platelets, it really only works if a nutrient deficiency is the cause of the low platelets. Chemo is the cause here so it is breaks from chemo that help them recover. Seems to hold true. I am hoping that despite having to take unstudied breaks from carbo it will continue to be effective for me. If not, we will likely move on to immunotherapy so while it does hint that we're getting closer to that, until scans show progression, we'll keep on keeping on with carbo. How old are your kids?

It was a wonderful time and I've got a bit of post vacation depression having to come back to reality. I'll post a happy pic or two soon. So grateful to be able to go and to feel so completely well and healthy. Great time bonding and making memories with my family. Welcome to all you new ladies, Secondchance, Montanna, and GunaSheela. Keep posting. We all need each other. To Secondchance, I thought I'd mention that I have a local friend who is having the same difficulty as you with lung fluid. She just had a fluid tap installed, PluereX. Her DH mentioned a cool video about it on youtube should you ever want to check it out. GunaSheela, I echo others comments to look into what trials may be available. Donna, I am glad you got your port and that things are working out well with it. I don't know why any nurse would be offended that you got one. It's pretty standard to have one at stage 4 here, though always the patient's choice so long as veins still work. When is your next scan? Low doses can still be effective but I think if you continue to tolerate the lower dose well you could ask to increase and see what happens to your counts. No harm in asking. Effects on counts are cumulative however. I did not have trouble in the beginning but did progressively as time went on, first adding Neulasta and then Neupogen and also giving longer breaks and reducing doses, and dropping one drug in the combo altogether. Rest assured that not having trouble with counts is not a sign that it won't be enough to work. Sherri, I do understand your worry when treatments get delayed. Felt exactly the same but I have learned to relax about it. I've had many delays and reductions but have remained stable for over a year now and still on the first line of treatment. Stable is the name of the game. Can't remember if I shared here or not but someone shared an article with me that being NED does not mean longer survival. Stable is just as good. I'd still leap for joy at being NED b/c doesn't it just sound great? But, since that isn't so likely given the extent of mets in my liver, I really hold on to researched truth that stable is what matters most.  ",

I like it and am surprised that I do. I always said I hated running (bad experience in a college class) but starting very slow and adding a minute at a time really makes the difference. Not sure what I'm going to do in the winter though. First grade is a big year. It always takes the kids a while to adjust to new expectations. And yes, first grade woes I well know.

Just when I think it's the one thing I'd like to know, I second guess it, fearing too much the answer. No point really though. Don't get to choose, knowing or not. What I hear you most agonizing over is when and what to tell people. Of course, each is comfortable with a different approach, but what is yours? That's what you're trying to figure out, yes? My two cents for your consideration, take or leave it, of course: In my searching about what to tell my children I came across a few writings from adults who were still hurting over the loss of a parent as a young adult. They had been left out of the loop. One had returned from school to find her mother on her death bed. No one had even told her she had cancer. Another saw her father thinning and ill but no one explained what was happening and they lived in quiet fear. This does make me so sad. I don't want that for my kids for sure. But my kids are 13 and under. I'm not ready to tell them my prognosis, though, I am in constant debate over when is the right time for my eldest. If things go south before I feel she's of an age to cope (whatever that means) with more reality of my disease, our plan is to tell the kids when my treatment options have been exhausted, hopefully leaving a few weeks or maybe months before my death. For you I see two options. 1) Tell people now that you are growing concerned about the seriousness of your cancer as you haven't yet found a successful treatment. Let them know it is of life-threatening nature, that you hope a treatment will soon be found but are worried and wanted to let me know honestly how things are going. It would allow you time when you are feeling relatively well to deal with the emotional upheaval that this is. It was really, really hard for me to share my diagnosis and I hate doing hard things and thinking about having to do them, so I dealt with it in the same way I do everything I don't want to do. I do it as quickly as possible so I don't have to think about it anyone. I also did so very impersonally, via email, except for my siblings and parents, which I think is weird, but I decided that I'm the one with cancer and I get to choose the how I'm most comfortable to share the news. I could not imagine telling everyone face to face and weeping so many blessed times. I think you should also feel bold in telling people exactly how you'd like for them to respond. \"I wanted to let you know honestly how I'm doing but I need you to respect my privacy. I don't want to talk about it unless I bring it up. I'd prefer to have my husband present for treatment and no one else. I appreciate all of your care and I'll let you how you can help when we need it. No prayer meetings!\" Maybe I'll change my tune, but I'm with you on the last one for sure. I can't bear the thought of being present for a mighty prayer session, though I do appreciate people praying. I think this option might be too early for your style, b/c I haven't given up on your treatment yet, but I wonder if you might not just feel better for getting it out of the way. After a while the shock of telling fades and things do feel more normal. You may just feel more at peace having it out of the way. And, what you suspect may indeed be true that some people already kind of know. 2) Wait til you really are out of options and discontinue treatment. From what I've gathered most still have a few weeks to months after this point, where you could let people know with more certainty the time frame you have that remains. In the meantime, rest easy knowing that's the plan. I have no idea if this is of any help to you but I've typed the long thing so I'll submit. Bottom line is, it's hard. I like to do things by the book, but there' no book on this. I've looked. Not much good googling either. It's so personal and only you can decide. I have to think even those grown adults wishing their parent had just told them sooner recognize the good intentions of those who chose not to tell much at all. And there are probably plenty out there too who knew all and wish they had not. Really we all have no idea and can only do the best we can. Just another unknown to swallow. Always thinking of you, Donna. Oh, do be well!",

For example, I read the phase 1 abstract of the results for a trial I wanted to enter at phase 2. They looked very promising. However, when I talked to the doctor I learned those results included mostly ovarian cancer patients, only 3 of the 26 were tbnc and their results were mixed.

No measurements to give you about the growth. Basically new tumors are growing so close to old ones and to each other, they cannot accurately measure them. Tumor load is estimated to be worse than it was at diagnosis two years ago. Liver function is okay, abnormal and higher still but no immediate threat of failure. However, Dr. Lustberg stated it is very important that this treatment work. Progression is rapid. We have been considering for some time at what point it would be appropriate to tell the girls that these treatments won't keep me alive forever. Today's news helped us to decide along with the counsel of staff at the Spielman. While we still remain hopeful that I may get a durable response out of eribulin, if I do not, and things progress faster than the next treatment can keep up with, the end will be soon. I feel they deserve the opportunity to process this over time and with us, not alone. The conversation went as well as I think it could have. A horrible thing to have to do but I know God will take care of us all, and we believe it was the right thing to do and the right time to do it. Things to hope and pray for: a change in the tumor make up...achieving HER2+ status occurs 30% of the time and gives many more potentially effective treatment options, or anything else that opens doors insurance approval of immunotherapy off label to add to eribulin, increasing chances of its effectiveness and durability a liver that tolerates decline slowly so treatments have a chance to be effective the resiliency of our children...us too",

I also want to get looking at trials again. I still have yours in mind though the commute would be a rough one. Wish we could all have easy access to every available treatment. We are still having trouble getting an immuno approved off label. Not sure if that's going to work out or not so I better get cracking on all trial possibilities again.

I was stage 1A, though my mets were found only 6 months after I finished treatment. Yours being 6 years is unusual but perhaps a good sign that your tnbc is of a less aggressive variety. I'm sure it came as a shock. I at least had it in my mind that if I made it to the 5 year mark, I'd be in the clear. Anyway, I also wanted to let you know that I have recently started Halaven as well. I start my 2nd cycle on Tuesday, doing fairly well with it and it seems to be working.

The first step is to have a biopsy and Foundation One testing if possible to help point to the best treatment options for your mom's particular cancer. Chemo is the only standard care option for TNBC but there are many good chemos for us and TNBC responds better and faster to chemo than other bc types. You should also look into immunotherapy trials as these are showing good results for TNBC. If your mom is brca positive then PARP inhibitors would be great to try. Olaparib is one that was just approved for standard care. The time of diagnosis is really one of the hardest times. It does get easier and life can feel quite normal once an effective treatment is found. Hang in there and continue to ask any questions you have. Does your mom have an appointment coming up soon?",

Long story short, I basically told her that my cancer will not ever go away. She immediately shouted that she knew it, she knew I was going to die. I ended up telling her that the medicine I get keeps the cancer from growing so I don't die. She was then relieved and concluded that I wouldn't die until she was all grown up. I said, \"I certainly hope so\" which she took as a conclusive \"yes.\" After I told her this I updated my older girls with the same info minus the \"not dying til they're grown part\". A year later, they seem to still be good with this amount of info. The youngest most recently in a discussion about sunscreen and why we must wear it even if we don't care it we get burned said, \"Oh, what is the big deal about cancer anyway!\" So I guess she's not worried about much.
