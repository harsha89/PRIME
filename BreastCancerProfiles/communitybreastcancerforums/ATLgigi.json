It FREAKED me out! As soon as I got back home went to see my breast specialist - I have fibrocystic breast changes and have had many, many cysts, etc. Mammogram revealed nothing. Dr. thought perhaps I had injured or bumped my breast while traveling.... I didn't remember anything like that, but it was an isolated incident. Then off and on over the next two years I would occasionally have a tiny discharge which I mostly noticed on my bras at the end of the day. Then, this began to happen more and more frequently until it became a daily little spot. Throughout this time I had regular mammograms and aspirations/biopsies for other cysts/lumps. My doctor reassured me that everything was fine and all the research I did was reassuring, too. But, then the discharge became a daily occurence and became more and more of a bleeding discharge. It was more than I could take. My doctor performed a ductal excision in July, 2008. At the time, he said everything looked good and he didn't see anything that would cause the discharge but that everything would be sent for a pathology report. The pathology report came back as an intraductal papilloma. My nipple is a little bit retroverted now, tiny little scar - no more bloody discharge!",

Since I couldn't find any info about PSH on this site, I did some more research and found that PSH can be associated with progressive breast enlargement associated with engorgement, cyclical breast pain, and burning sensation. I'm thankful for a good report and also an explanation for the deep burning sensation I felt prior to the biopsy. Other than \"fibrocystic breast changes\" I've never been given an explanation for the pain I often have in my breasts. Thought this might be helpful to others. Log in to post a reply",
