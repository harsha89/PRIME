I almost past out during wire localization, I think from no food or water. (And no morning coffee ) Anyway all went well. Compression for 48 hours then I can shower. Percocet and ice. Today probably just ice. Svg, hope your surgery went well and you feel good. Prayers to all past and futuresurgeries.",

Something I've noticed on this site is a lot of members have multiple dx. This sort of implies that treatment plans are not working? idk. totally stressed out. Trying not to freak out my husband. Oh yeah, bs is doing wire localization...ouch! I also pray clear margins so I don't have to go back for more. svgsurvive we have the same date. prayers to you. Good luck and prayers to all of us here on this site. Grandma3x I love how positive you are. ",
