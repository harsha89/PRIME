I thought it was going to be the 'end of the world'.  but guess what...I'm so used to no having them that I very much doubt I'll ever have the reconstruction done, now!  See...amazing what a year will do!  Enough of my rambling...good luck tomorrow...take good care of yourself and keep in touch...let us know how you're doing!",
