I have a history of BC in my family so I know that is probably a big reason I am here. My mammogram and ultrasound came back normal (or so that letter they send to you a few days later, stated) but my DR.. recommended me to see a surgeon anyway... who has recommended a surgical biopsy.. I am wondering why not just do a needle one? He said because it can be hard to find if the lump is small.. (which is the case)  My question is.. should I go with the surgery or the needle? Which is better and less expensive?  Thank you.. Log in to post a reply",
