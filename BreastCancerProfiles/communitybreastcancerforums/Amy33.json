I just recently started SBE and found that when I raise my arm, the left nipple goes a little inside with something like a dimple around it, it come back to normal when I put my hand down, my right nipple is always out (does not change when I lift my arm). ShouldÂ I be concerned or is this normal? I'm not sure if it was always like this. I did breast feed 2 kids and I never had an inverted nipple problem, but not sure while raising the arm. Thanks for your help.",
