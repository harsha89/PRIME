So far the worst has to be the major headache, still fighting that. The day after was super, I was able to go see my Daughter swim at the stat swim meet. Then the shot kicked in late Friday and Saturday. Those days are a blur of sleeping and pain but I made it through by taking my meds and lots of fluids. There is light at the end and today I have more energy just wish the hradache would stop but I have a call in to the MO to see what if anything I can do. I know everyone is different and so will be the SE best of luck to all. One question, I have been told 2 weeks from first treatment hair will really starting coming out.

Now I am sure as I get closer to the actual surgery I will have doubts but I think that is normal but know I have made the right decision for me.  Yesterday I met with 2 plastic surgeons, they both had very different opinions.  But I feel much more confident with one and his experience is so more extensive. This decision was much harder to make. It's one thing to say get this c out of me but another to choose a reconstruction path when there are so many options and hope that you choose the right one. I am going to have the free tram with immediate reconstruction depending on the results may or may not have a small implant as well.  I have always been on the very small side and figure what the heck might as well get something out of this.  I am waiting on the BS, PS and hospital to coordiante their schedules. So once again I am waiting on a phone call, this cylce never gets easier. I hope to know in the next couple of days. I now need to find an oncologist as I hope to meet with them before the surgery so I can feel comfortable with them when I meet with them to discuss my treatment.  Has anyone had the Free tram or know where I should look on the boards to find discussions on it?",
