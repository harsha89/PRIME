I'm also itchy on both arms. Have applied aloe and drinking fluids. This has happened after every rad treatment, but tonight is the worse. I go see my radiation onc. tomorrow as part of my weekly checkups. I thought rads s/e's were supposed to be a cakewalk versus chemo s/e's. Log in to post a reply",
