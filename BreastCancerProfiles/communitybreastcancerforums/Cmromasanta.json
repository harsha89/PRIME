I have very dense breast and I have fibrocystic breast so I have many cyst but I am still concerned with the size of the ones I have near the nipple and how they feel so differently from the rest.",

Now it feel like there is 3 of them there all different sizes yet still hard like frozen peas. They are all right next to each other. Has anyone had any experience like this? Any similar types of lumps that fit this description? I have been a nervous wreck for two weeks now! I have an appt tomorrow for a diagnostic mammogram and an ultrasound. I have no other symptoms just these tiny hard lumps. it's hard to tell if they move. Log in to post a reply",

Call me paranoid but there is one that is really small and hard that just feels different to me.",

These tiny lumps feel different from the cysts i normally feel. Im currently in the waiting area now at the hospital. Just had a 3D mammo waiting to get ultrasound and my mammo results. Were your cysts really small and hard? Did you ever have them behind ypur areola?",
