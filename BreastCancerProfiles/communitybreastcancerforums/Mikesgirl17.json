Had it biopsied and it is cancer again. 5mm triple negative. I need radiation, but in order to do it they have to remove both my implants because one would be in the way. Now I am faced with having the horrible expanders put in after the surgeon removes the tumor. The one that would be in the way of the radiation will not be filled until after radiation. The other would be fully filled before radiation starts. I don't know what to do. My fear is that the radiation will make my skin unable to heal properly. I also can't stand the fact that I will have the expanders in for who knows how long. I already have low self esteem and can't imagine not having breast. If anyone has had expanders in and then radiation, could you please let me know what your outcome was. Thanks.

It's been a while since I posted, but wanted to share some pics with you so you know what to possibly expect a year after your first chemo. It was one year for me on Dec. 5. I had my hair trimmed a couple months ago and went for an actual hair cut last week. Mine did not come in grey. This is my natural color. It did start out white so I assumed it was going to be grey, but it changed after about 1/4 inch. I didn't shave it off like some people do. I too had face fur. It was horrible. it was like pretty long and all over. I used the finishing touch trimmer on it and was so happy I did. It eventually slows down and isn't noticeable. I hope these pics don't come out to big. I don't know how to change the size. Happy Saturday everyone! ",
