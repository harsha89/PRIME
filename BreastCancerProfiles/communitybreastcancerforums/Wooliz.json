Had my Lumpectomy in November and the tumour was much larger than anticipated so now upgraded to Stage 2A. In light of the increase in size the Oncologist recommends chemotherapy even though the lymph nodes were not infected. I don't know what to do. The thought of Chemo scares me so much. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
