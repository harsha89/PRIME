Here is my experience (along with a few friends') for you to consider.... I just finished radiation today, after a lumpectomy in May. Yay! My breasts have never been perfectly symmertical, but the radiated breast did get progressively firmer throughout radiation. It is a bit smaller than the non-radiated breast. There wasn't a large amount of tissue removed via lumpectomy, so some shrinkage is definitely due to the rads. Two women I know who have had similar procedures, one five years and one ten years ago, both said their radiated breast is smaller. Good luck!",
