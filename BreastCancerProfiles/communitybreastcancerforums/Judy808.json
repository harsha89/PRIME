It was only a week ago that i really looked at it. Next to my areola, i noticed that were was a cluster of red itchy rashes. I searched \"itchy rash on breast\" on google, and the first thing that came up was inflammatory breast cancer. The only symptoms i believe i have for IBC are the itchy breasts and rash next to my areola. I am only 21, with a family history of breast cancer. My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer in her mid 50s. I am also on birth control pills. I am terrified and extremely anxious. I have an appointment with my OBGYN tomorrow. Hopefully it isn't anything serious. Log in to post a reply",
