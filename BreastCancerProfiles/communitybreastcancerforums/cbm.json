Sometimes they find polyps, the good kind (completely safe) and the bad kind (the kind that will turn into cancer if left to their own devices).  Last year, I had both kinds (I was still in the Neratinib trial) and this year I had absolutely none at all, for I think the first time ever. Bleeding can be so many things, but most often it's a hemorrhoid, and I know from experience that benign polyps bleed.  Warmly, Cathy ",

I guess the thing that disturbs me the most about DES is the complete absence of accountability on the part of the manufacturer and distributor.  As the result of DES exposure I couldn't have children, so it changed my life in a lot of ways.  Interestingly, my gynecologist was also DES exposed, but prescribed birth control pills during my perimenopause, saying essentially that I had already dodged the bullet and that the only known and proven effect was a very small number of endometrial cancer in very young women.  I believe to this day that a lot of gynecologists get their continuiing education from pharma reps.

And I never felt bad about bothering anybody on the weekend--someone is on call for just this purpose.  So, if I were you I would call the doctor. The timing at least suggests it's a reaction to either the shot or the chemo, and either way you want to tell someone as soon as possible.

Let me congratulate you, though, for persiting even when others said there wasn't anything there.  It takes a strong and brave woman to insist on a biopsy and push back when you know you are right but you don't really want to be.  The size of a tumor is only one of many pieces of info that determines the path, so don't panic on account of that.  I'm so sorry for your loss of your husband, too, what a terrible thing for you and your children. Prayers go with you; try to stay calm--there is a lot of waiting for a while--for details, results, appointments, insurance approvals, more opinions.  Once you know what's what, you kind of settle into a coping place and ti gets a little easier.  The first few days are the hardest, especially with a weekend. Also--this forum is a little quieter on the weekend I think, so I'll try to bump your post up on the Active topics every so often. Maybe some of the other girls will help. Warmest hugs, Cathy",

You can and should get copies of your path report and all of your other records as they become available.  That's just a call to the doctor's office--whoever did the biopsy can give you the pathology report and when the hormone receptor info and the PET report become available you should get those also. Warmest hugs--every day is new information and new terminology, but it all begins to make sense. Cathy",

Chemo kind of has a rhythm to it that you will discern pretty quickly.  Everyone is different and everyone's white cells and red cells act differently from others.  My nadir (the lowest white cell count, when you feel the worst in my opinion) was only about 6 days after infusion, so I planned activities accordingly.  I depended on watermelon, cinnamon pop tarts, V-8 juice, mashed potatoes, and ginger ale as my go-to staples when I didn't feel like eating anything else.  I also avoided the steroids, except in the infusion, because I don't do well with them.  I called my doctors at the slightest possiblity of any infection.  I used a water-pic several times a day and invested heavily in anti-bacterial wipes. I'm sure the TCH women will have more specific thoughts.  When you get to just the Herceptin, there's not much to it, I'm almost at the end of my year and other than some fluid retention there don't seem to be any side effects for me.

I did not want radiation.  Period.  So lumpectomy was off the table from the beginning; I had only one node involved, and did not have to have rads if mastectomy was the route I chose.   If I was going to have one removed, they were both going.  One sneaked up on me, so could the other.  I had a small ILC component, so it was more than just possible; the chances were increased slightly. I wanted to get into chemo as fast as I could.  So my plan was to delay reconstruction until I was all done, all the way through with chemo, Herceptin, everything.  Symmetry--something important to me--would have been impossible with a prosthesis and the other breast. The delayed recon plan also involved a reduction in my chances of infection; I also wanted time to consider all my options for that and whether it was worth it in the long run.   My surgeon did not want to do the bmx at all.  He was very resistant, and my husband finally had to call and tell him I was not going to change my mind or give in to his recommendations for a single mastectomy.  He just did not want to remove healthy tissue, and he felt that it just wasn't necessary.  Surgeons like to be directive and some can be stubborn.  I liked him but would have changed if necessary. He admitted that I had made the best decision, as it turned out.  My tumor was hidden in a fibroadenoma which had grown around it, something that is fairly unusual and which was the reason it was completely undetectable on the mammogram and via palpation.  My lymph node was the signal, and the only one.  My other breast might have similarly concealed evidence in the same manner. My oncologist always says to go with your gut when there are good arguments on both sides.  So I did, and when I met resistance I decided it was most important for me to have what I wanted, if only so that I had control.  I think taking control is important when you are visited by something as serious as cancer.    Good luck with whatever you decide.  I was grade and stage 2, ER/PR+ 90% and Her2+ as well. I also knew I'd be getting the full chemo deal so I was planning my months and years very deliberately. Warmly, Cathy ",

I don't want to be graphic, but cleanliness in ALL things is key, so you want to be particularly finicky with respect to the bathroom.  Urinary tract infection from the catheter is common so you have to be especially vigilant and it isn't easy after surgery, I'm sorry to say.  I don't think I'd go home for a few days.  I think you want to be near the source of immediate medical attention until you know the healing has begun to take place and you are past the worst of the risk.  I was lucky to have a helper stay with me in the hospital (I have that Aflac Cancer Insurance and it is amazing) and to have been placed on a special unit because my bp dropped like a rock in the first minutes of surgery (allergy to muscle relaxant).  So I got an extra day and some other benefits.  However, while there I watched the aide clean up around the bed, pick up bandage debris, and then rearrange my cup, juice glass, and straw using the same gloved hand.  My personal nurse simply discarded them--but I'd have been at risk if that kind of thing hadn't been noticed.  Vigilance is  a constant from now on--you have to be militant about what touches you and what you touch. I emptied my own drains, which I had for ten days.  I used gloves and cleaned my sites with alcohol and used triple antibiotic on them.  (I also had a bilateral mastectomy with left side axillary clearance and no reconstruction to date.)  Once you get into the habit of being germ phobic, it helps with everything and this becomes critical during chemo also, because infection is your enemy and can cause you to miss an infusion. (for me that meant one more week without my eyelashes.  Unacceptable.  ) I would say that you could use a few pillows for travel, definitely request a wheelchair and board as a special assistance passenger, and after seven to ten days, you should be fine, although not normal.  One question I'd have for your nurse or physical therapist is whether or not to bandage your arm where you had nodes removed for the flight. (lymhedema)  Be careful with your pain management if you are mobile, as you might be more likely to stumble and fall.  I was not allowed to use the stairs in my house without help if I was taking pain meds.  DH made me promise. You are one brave lady Clarice.  I admire your courage and determination, and your independence.  Your daughter is getting a heck of a great example of strength and commitment.  Wow. I hope it goes well.  Pain was not much of an issue for me; I was mostly numb (not psych-wise, nerve-ending-wise) which makes it all easier.  Find a pt wherever you are or learn to massage your arms and incision areas so the scar tissue doesn't adhere--you want to keep the fascia supple ( I think I said that right). Warmly Cathy",

Salvage therapy is given in the hope of a cure or at least of some more quality time or a better quality existence. Salvage may, for instance, be chemotherapy (salvage chemotherapy) or radiation (salvage radiotherapy).\" So I take back what I said about your doc being charm-free; it seems like he was just being technical.   Warmly, Cathy   ",

I am a DES daughter and had a bicornate uterus, which supported a decision to do the hysterectomy along with the oopherectomy that my hormone status suggested offered the best offense against recurrence.    In fact, I was told that I had been at high risk for ovarian and endometrial cancers and had not known that.  So I had DaVinci ooph and then internal hysterctomy.  I was already on antihormonals--Arimidex at the time, now Femara, which I prefer.   Both procedures were, for me, a piece of cake--I was driving within a few days and never had pain that had to be controlled, so Advil was it.  I had no bladder or bowel problems, I seem to have almost no scars, not that it matters.  I will say that the dryness and atrophy is very inconvenient to control but if you manage expectations, and go to the necessary trouble, you will benefit. . . I would not do HRT; with ER/PR + you should be going the other direction, unless there's something I'm missing.   Hot flashes are manageable, although they sure aren't fun.  I live in Florida, so summers are, well, hot.  I happen to take Inderal for a cardiac arrhythmia and I believe it cuts down on the worst symptoms of menopause, but that would be a way-off-label use.   I have heard that the anti-depressants can help also, as can vitamins and good diet.  My hot flashes aren't distracting to me anymore.  I hope this helps.  I would not do any of what has been suggested to you without a second opinion and a thorough discussion with an oncologist.  I highly recommend DaVinci but only if done with a surgeon experienced in DaVinci.  The hysterectomy part. . . well, I don't know what the risk reduction is for you.  If it's a lot, it might be worth it.   Warmly, Cathy  ps. . . sorry. . . meant to tell you that DaVinci is something that hospitals that have it tend to advertise.  So you can call the hospital and ask if they have it and who are the surgeons trained to use.  And, I had the \"thickened walls\" and some big fibroid cysts but no cancer.  They did not do the pathology until I was out of surgery; my path report on the ooph/hyst was as complete as my breast surgery report was--they looked through every single piece of tissue that was removed.  My research process consisted of asking my oncologist to direct me to the right surgeon for me, and my asking his p.a. if she agreed, which she did.  The surgeon, a specialist in women's cancers, told me that a.) I needed to have both ooph and hyst, without question, due to my increased risk, and b.) not even a hormone cream on the nearby tissue, no matter how much anyone told me it would not increase my circulating estrogen.   Warmest, Cathy ",

I assume that if she is found to be BRCA or HER2 positive, the news would guide her treatment plan.  If she is offered and chooses chemotherapy, there are different regimens, but Her2 requires Herceptin, and I believe that Herceptin requires infusion with at least Taxol.  Herceptin is given for one year in the most common protocol. It is started in conjunction with one of the twelve to twenty week protocols (ACTH or TCH) and is continued  alone for a total of one year. If she isn't Her2 positive and does not have lymph node involvement, chemo may not be recommended.  If she chooses lumpectomy she would likely have radiation, but if she chooses mastectomies she may not require radiation.   I don't think rare necessarily means more dangerous or more assertive or aggressive disease. I had bilateral mastectomies and chemo, with no rads, had surgery on 7.31.08, was done with all chemo except Herceptin by the following February (09), and finished the year of Herceptin around October 09.  I asked for more treatment after that, but that's a personal choice that not everyone makes.

I have a very dear friend who was stage 3 going on 4 at diagnosis, when they did surgery she had more like 5 cm than the 3 they thought, she was HER2+ when Herceptin was still in trials, and she was ER/PR barely over the +.  That was nine years ago and she is fine.  Still on an aromatase and still vigilant, but no recurrences.  Another in the almost identical circumstances is CA-free at her 5 year mark. You don't know much without the path report and even good surgeons and radiologists get it wrong just eyeballing pictures and cells.  My second surgeon (I refused to return to the first) was not encouraging, until he saw the final pathology report and then congratulated me on my good luck and strong lymph node.  Sea, it's a process and a ballgame with a lot of innings:  You get good news and bad news throughout, just like everything else.  I cried after the first surgeon's insensitive monologue (the day before the long 4th of July weekend last year).  I'd already decided on a bilateral mastectomy and thought I'd have to talk him into it.  He told me I could not have any reconstruction, that I'd need a lot of radiation, that I would lose my hair.  The hair part was true; the rest not so much.  I had surgery and chemo and I plan on reconstruction in the fall.  I think the disadvantage of the way you got everything at once is that you didn't have time to process, but you are lucky to have such a rapid response team.  Buy Susan Love's Breast book (which my oncologist thinks is brutal, I like it for facts and directness) and read some of the chapters, a little at a time.     I found that atavan helped me sleep and that sleep helped me recalibrate and stay steady so that I could figure out what to do.  My DH told the doc:  When it gets dark, she gets dark.  . My doctor, who I adore, told me after describing the big picture--Look, now you know the whole picture.  From here on, just put your head down, focus on the day to day, get out of your head.  Power through it.  I think it was good advice and it got me through the darker days.  Much luck to you; stay calm.",

I finally got a new prescription, got the mammogram, and got a call back that there was a lymph node that didn't look right.  No breast tumor, lesion, or area of concern.  Just a node. The ultrasound showed that the node was big, but only by staying on the adjacent breast tissue for a long long time, was the (very experienced) tech able to finally say, \"there is just something different about the architecture right here\" but she said it looked like normal breast tissue to her. Well, I had a u/s guided biopsy two days later and it turned out to be a mixed mammary carcinoma--IDC, ILC, DCIS, and LCIS--inside an existing fibroadenoma, where it could not be seen in by mammography.  It had been there for a while--maybe through 7 or 8 mammograms. Without the lymph node, I would not have found it.  If I'd had the mammogram on time, I might not have had the node sound the alarm.  I think of myself as incredibly lucky.  Not all cancer produces a lump--lobular cancer is notoriously sneaky and appears in a line or a sheet.  DCIS is quiet for a while, in many cases. You are wise to push the docs.  It is all about finding it early.  You know your body; in my case, I knew something was wrong and had known it for months--I just didn't know what it was. Warmly, with hugs.  I hope it all turns out okay, and congratulations on your twins; I have grandchildren that are amazing and so much to be proactive for. Cathy ",

Apparently, if you crash during DaVinci, the docs are not in the OR with you (who knew?) and they therefore want reliable back up IV in case one fails.  You also need a pressure cuff where there is no IV.  That doesn't leave many limbs.   I was insisting on Right arm, IV, Left leg IV, Right leg pressure cuff, but the nurse was having none of it.   I told her to relay to whatever doctor got to decide, that if the use of my left arm was a condition of the surgery, which I regarded as completely elective though highly desirable, I would be leaving before the procedure.  And making other arrangements. The anesthesiologist came in and completely agreed with my recommendations; he was on board right away.  In fairness, the DaVinci gets you into weird positions and at the time was relatively new in my town, so I imagine I was taking a risk.  The nurse is the one who is physically present in the OR, and she was none too happy or confident.   If you had nodes removed on both sides, I imagine you should not consider a tyoe of surgery requiring a back-up IV (in normal surgery they can simply reach you with a hypodermic needle, I think, but with robotic, apparently they need three limbs).  That is the only time that I can remember since my surgery in 2008 when anyone has ever tried to insist on using my left arm for anything, most everyone has asked \"Which arm?\".

Her HNPCC (also known as Lynch Syndrome) was the form in which the repair gene is missing.  One year later I was diagnosed with breast cancer, a mixed tumor with ILC, IDC, and DCIS all hidden within a fibroadenoma.  There have been some small studies that show that Lynch is a probable culprit in bc, also.  My brother has had kidney cancer.  Dad had prostate.  Mom bc.  Everyone else succumbed to cardiac incidents, or lived to a ridiculous age. Anyway.  I had both ooph and hysterectomy in March and I was postmenopausal and already on Armidex.  I had the DaVinci type surgery and was fine in about 72 hours, but the cumulative effects of the bilat surgery, chemo in 08, then Arimdex and the ooph/hyst made me a little ditzy for a while. I didn't have any symptoms other than increased comfort--they removed a lot of fibroids.  One thing you need to remember with Lynch you are also at risk for other cancers--colon, stomach, bowel, melanoma.  So you have to have more frequent oscopies.  I did not have the gene test becasue my family's varient is a missing gene and my insurance wouldn't pay for the $3K test.  My docs assume the syndrome and we go from there. Our mom took DES also, which was known to cause cervical cancer in young women but we don't know what else in our generation of women.  My belief is that it just fueled an already vulnerable cluster of genetic conditions and that was that.  My sister was told there is no systemic treatment and they removed everything.  One tumor was near the lymph channel and that prompted a more aggressive surgical and radiation course. I hope this helps you.  Warmest regards, Cathy",

There are occult situations where a node is the first presentation and no cancer is found, but those are fairly rare.  A node that isn't related to breast cancer and appears in the axillary region can also be related to some kind of infection (I was hoping for cat scratch fever, myself).  I was told that happens more often than you think.   I hope this helps; remember you can ask for copies of all your reports, your BIRADS score, narrative, everything, if you want it, which I did.   Peace, Cathy ",

The biopsy itself was not bad, for me.  I had little or no pain and bruising; I was large breasted.  It may not be helpful to you, but I similarly had a lot of fibroadenomas, more on one side than the other.  They hurt more than the biopsy did--it was fairly easy, if stressful. When I was in your shoes I was terrified and miserable; when I learned what was going on (IDC, in my case), I was relieved that it had been found and diagnosed, so that treatment could get underway.  I am a hopeless Pollyanna.  At the time, Ativan helped, and I recommend it.  Once you get the biopsy, it will be up to a week or two before you get results from your doc.  I got mine in days because I had no gynecological middleman and the radioologist had to call me himself.  Try to stay calm.  There are many many women in your shoes who went all the way through this and got a B for Benign on the test.   Happens a lot, so it is okay to be hopeful.  We are all hoping for a good result for you.

There is good reason to shrink the tumor before surgery; they can see if and how the chemo is working.  Lots of women have this form of treatment.  You may never know the real stage if you do that; there is no reason to be put off by that.   The length of each chemo session depends on which chemo you get, and whether you get a dose dense form.  Usually you get a lot of tests before chemo, to check you heart function and that sort of thing.  I got an orientation on the day my chemo started.  If you get premeds, you shouldn't plan to drive, and nearly everyone gets premeds, which are given to help you tolerate the drugs and the process.  The premeds given in the U.S. include benadryl, Zantac, decadron, and lots of other things to make the day and night tolerable.  I went to chemo in a sizable clinic and was attended by the nicest most competent nurses on earth; there was always a doctor in the clinic who could check on anything from a slight fever to an ingrown toenail starting to look infected.  They gave me lost of info about nutrition and self-care.  It's critical to stay hydrated and healthy. Regarding stage, I'm a believer that the more treatment the better, so although I was stage 2, I'd have been more than happy to get the treatment equivalent of stage 3.  Even though we root for the lower stage results, stage estimation and treatment calibration are not that precise.   Best wishes for a smooth road ahead, that leads you back to health.  Perhaps some of the women who are starting neoadjuvant  (chemo before surgery) chemo can help with info about their protocols and the reasons for them.   Warmest, Cathy    ",

Warmest; so much information to digest, and so many details.  It gets easier. Good thoughts go with you. Cathy",

Infection and cancer aren't typically interactive, but an infection might cause all of your symptoms, including the lymph node.  The odds are definitely in your favor; if I were you I'd assume mastitis and go all the way through the process your docs recommend in order to rule out cancer.  Waiting and getting yourself through this are not easy, so you might ask the gyn for Ativan or another of the lorazepams. Your surgeon will need all of your records; once you have selected one, you can fax a written request to all of your docs to send info to this surgeon.  Or you can see if it's all been sent to your gynecologist and ask them to send it.  Call the surgeon's office about two days before your appointment to ask if they have it all.  My husband did something different--he had it all sent to us and then he scanned and printed it out in binders--with tabs--and gave one to each of the doctors.  But he's sort of OCD. There is no magic cure for the ups and downs of the waiting and wondering.  Acting normal for the kids is probably the best thing for them and for you. Meanwhile, peace and hugs. Cathy ",

As for your mom, well--I'm of the \"keep everyone briefed\" school of thought.  You probably need a communications strategy overall, with the interview, wedding etc. coming up.  Think about all of that strategically and in light of where you want to end up when all of this settles in and makes itself part of your life for a while.  It doesn't seem so now, the first few days and weeks are very confusing.  It gets much easier when it is a matter of facts and not the fear and uncertainty of the earliest days.  There are lots of helpful books on breast cancer, diagnostics, treatment, and what everything means.  I'm a Susan Love's Breast Book fan, my husband read it before I did, it helped me develop questions for my docs--I  didn't even know what to ask.  Not everyone agrees with me, though, and there are other books. Warmest regards; lots of good thoughts go with you.  Cathy",

Every state is different. Dream jobs keep us going; I hope you work this out to your satisfaction.  You are one brave woman, from what you have written.  I can't imagine how hard it is to navigate all of this in a new country in such a short time.   Warmly, Cathy ",

That meant I was done faster and got my hair back sooner.   8.  I wanted to know going in what I would have coming out of the surgery.  I wasn't convinced there wasn't more lurking in there, so if I went in thinking golfball I knew I could come out minus baseball and I didn't want that uncertainty on top of all the other uncertainty.  9.  I figured if I got through all of it okay, then I would have time and the patience to find the right reconstruction surgery for me.  Before the surgery I was getting all kinds of conservative consults.  More recently I was offered the full range of options.  DIEP would be tempting if I were your age.  It comes with a tummy tuck that I'd rather have than the breasts.   10.  It was easy for me.  It isn't for everyone; before I was diagnosed I had seen and spoken with so many friends and in my mind I was always forming a clear idea of what I'd do if it were me.  When it finally was me, it was just a step forward.  My oncologist was not all that supportive; my surgeon was not thrilled and made me go get a plastics consult.  After the surgery he told me that having seen my tumor in it's little hiding place he had to agree that I'd done the right thing for me. Once I make a decision I don't look back, so I have no regrets.  Even though I'm in the Florida heat all the time, I've been able to dress around my figure, though I'm not a skinny girl, more like a size 12.  My clothes finally fit.   You really do have to do what is right for you, but for me that meant establishing my priorities, my resources, my got-to-haves, and my don't cares.  I had an amazing p.a. who had run a huge breast center and gave me confidence when she said there is no right or wrong on this one.  Do whatever you want.

I think medullary is a specific phenotype; one with a slightly better prognosis than some other forms.  Remember the info that you have is all pretty preliminary, but a Grade 2 in a woman your age would be a very good thing, becasue young women often get more aggressive (Grade 3) forms. Tumor cells have three characteristics that are scored from one to three, that when added up create the Scharf Bloom Richardson score.  \"One\" is the best, the least \"different\" from normal cells, and the \"three\" is the worst, or most different.  The scores represent tubule formation, pleomorphism or degree of change, and mitosis, or speed of reproduction.  The highest SBR score is a 9, the lowest is a 3.  A 3,4,5 means a Grade 1, 6 and 7 mean a Grade 2, and 8 and 9 are an SBR 3. Take the percents with a grain of salt--once you know your estrogen receptors and Her2 status you might well get an even better percent.  Lymph node involvement is another variable.   I know what you mean about deing distracted by the numbers and percents--I was begging to find a way into the nineties.  Deep sigh.  They are just numbers, and you don't have all the info yet. Most chemotherapy does cause you to lose your hair, but some forms when combined with a cold cap can be less damaging.  You won't know what you are going to get for sure until after your final pathology, which is after surgery.  Two centimeters is not huge.  Warmest hugs; be brave.  It sounds like you are in good hands.  You should get a copy of all your reports and start to keep them all together.  And take notes; you always think of stuff later.

Fast forward to the present.  I wish I'd had more of a debate over it.  I had one big lymph node, and those with one to three nodes who elect mx usually didn't used to get rads; lumpectomy with any nodes did.  Now, there is some thought (esp. among rads oncologists) that this hair splitting might be arbitrary. I know you had no nodes, and I don't mean to trigger a suggestion you didn't ask for.  But if it were me, I might ask for a consult just to see what the radiation oncologist might say he or she could do for me, and not do to me, and how, when and why.  You don't have to do anything with the info.  And your oncologist might benefit from the dialogue. You can get a lot of info on PubMed doing a search on mastectomy, radiation, nodes and a few other terms.  Nodes and margins are definitely two different things but I suspect your instincts are to make sure the discussion doesn't get lost.

If I were you I wouldn't start over.  I believe I'd nail the date that's only two weeks away, then get in to see the oncologist and ask him or his p.a. to intervene and make it happen sooner, on the basis that you need to get into chemo.  He will know that the tumor has grown and he can part the waters if need be. Alternatively, and I know you won't like this so I shouldn't even say it, you could just do the mastectomy now and have the reconstruction phase later.  Sorry, I know that is the last thing you want and I agree none of this should have happened.  But it is an option that might speed things up.  I didn't go to a big cancer center either.  The cancer center in my region was slower than my private arrangements that were coordinated by the oncologist.  I was two weeks into chemo by the earliest surgery date they could give me--and I wasn't having any recon or recon prep--just a bilat mx. So sorry this is happening Ann.  You have been a real advocate for yourself and tireless in pursuing your path.  Cathy",
