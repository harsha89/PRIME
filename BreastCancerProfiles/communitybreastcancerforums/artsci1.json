Please feel free to ask more questions, I'll help the best I can, and if I can't help then I'm sure other ladies on here have far more information than I do.  Take care.",

I did learn a whole lot though - you would have thought that I took a radiology class(lol).  A little humor keeps me sane - seriously! I am not sure what is up with your GP not believing in mammos maybe you can suggest ultrasounds or possibly find another GP...?  I do understand about family history of certain types of cancers related to breast cancer because my sister died from uterine/ovarian cancer - I do not know which was the primary cancer.  It was aggressive, and it spread fast...she was only 42  : (  That was 8 years ago.  I am now 44, so when I found those lumps when I was 42, I was worried.  My aunt also had ovarian cancer in her early 50's - she passed away too.  So, I understand your fears. I tell myself all the time that worrying doesn't change anything(I know, easier said than done!), so I just try to stay proactive, smile and laugh as often as I can, pray, and fight the good fight when I need to! If you still need to yell - go ahead - I am here.  We all are!  Keep us posted.",

I still have to get my pelvic ultrasound to check out my ovaries - remember to ask about getting the CA-125 test when you go about the ovarian pain. Take care, and I hope to talk to you soon. Carol",
