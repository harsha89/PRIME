But as you have seen there are amazing woman on this site that will help you through it all. I was diagnosed this past Nov. I also have ILC. It has been 3 months and I have come a long way, with the help of so many people. There is not a day that passes that I don't have another question about cancer. I continue to be positive and take it a day at a time.  It consumed me at first, especially as I waited for surgery. Once I had my surgery, I felt like I had some control. At least I could control my recovery for the most part. Try to rest when your mind will let you. ",

Going into my surgery we knew I had a mass approx 2cm. We learned after surgery that the ILC was actually in all quadrants of that breast. Thankfully, it had not spread to the lymph nodes. I had decided on a mx as soon as my doctor told me it was cancer, it was the right choice for me. Had I chosen a lumpectomy, which is what my surgeon originally talked about, I would have had to return for more surgery. I did have a breast MRI prior to surgery and I guess they didn't see it; honestly, I didn't ask the surgeon if it was on the mri, but I believe she would have mentioned it to me.  Again, I know how scary this is, I am still scared and believe that feeling will never go away. But you will feel better than you do right now. I am a social person, but keep most things to myself or share them with just my husband, but this was different. I shared with everyone (well almost everyone) that asked and I am glad I did. It truly took a village to get me through this. People that I considered friends prior to this, I know think of as part of my family because of their kindness and support. ",

I too heard the 3-5 year survival statistics from two doctors. I believe in my heart with the right treatment/lifestyle changes I can live past that. However, today I am struggling with the odds. I needed your amazing stories today. Thank you all for bringing me back up by sharing and supporting.",
