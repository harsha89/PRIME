Luckily, we had friends who offered to take her to and from school, etc that helped a lot. I also sent an email to her counselor at school to let them know in case anything happened with her at school..the counsler has called her in a few times to check in with her to see how she is doing..

I had such thick heavy hair before chemo I could just wake up and it looked perfect..Now I wake up and I look like I was in a windstorm with a bottle of hairspray.. But as I always say, if I am able to complain about my hair, its a good day..Originally I was buying products to keep it curly..and now I look for things to make it straight..It is amazing how much products you seem to need the shorter your hair is!",
