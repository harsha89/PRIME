I try new approaches every day and they seem to work for a couple of hours and then anxiety sets in again. Had a nice weekend though. Hair came off Saturday morning in the shower, so off we went... they shaved my head in the shop and I put on the whig...not as bad as I thought, just weird and a bit tight. In the evening we went to see Seinfeld live here in Oslo with about 15000 other people. It was a treat, I was so happy I could go even though I am going through chemo, but so far no real SEs. If I could make my head as well as my body feels right now life could be ok. But it is a struggle to get up every morning and face a new day with cancer... being diagnosed two months ago. Before that life just was...what is it now? I don't know. Wish you all the best these months... (on wikipedia it says chemo only has a 1,5% effect in bc - then why are we doing it? And who wrote that wiki?)",

I did it because test showed high Ki67 and St. Gallen consensus conference 2011 recommends chemo for this condition. Only problem is I have lobular cancer which according to same conference does not respond well to chemo. Needed to read a lot because doctors did not want to give me chemo despite the Ki67 test. I found out that I had read too much and it just scares me and I do not want to live just being scared all the time. I have decided to stop reading all about my particular condition and just live. The kids need me and I have been away in my mind for too long. Ordered whig, have bought scarfs and will live! Hugs to all of you!",

Diagnosed in April and after the mx surgery my surgeon said it looks like I do not need more treatment. Live in Norway and here they draw the line for further treatment at exactly 1 cm! So if I had 11mm tumor I would have to have chemo and hormonal treatment. Now I have discussed my case with Norwegian experts and two oncologists and all say that I am a difficult case and that it is up to me to decide whether to do chemo etc or not! I found this an impossible task. My gut feeling is do everything you can to kill possible cancer cells in the blood, but then I don't know whether chemo is really effective in my case (lubolar, estrogen positive). I have asked to do the Ki-67 test on my tumor which is about proliferation. I will know the result in one or two days time. I need to decide by Friday this week whether to do further treatment or not. I feel desperate for a decision and exhausted. Scared of chemo, scared of not doing it. What do you think? Every comment is very welcome! I see there are quite a few of you who do chemo even with 1cm and grade 1. Were you adviced to do it or did you have to decide yourself? Big hugs to you all, Steff66",

But I feel better when I read your posts and see that there are others out there struggling. Had my first FEC 60 chemo Friday before last. No real bad side effects so far. Actually, physically I feel fine. But I am really depressed these days. I have ILC but a really high ki67 (40%) and all I read is that I have a poor prognosis. I wish I would not do this to myself and stop reading, but I feel like an addict. I so much hope that chemo will kill this beast, but ILC does not ususally respond well to chemo. So I feel like I am left with no real hope.... sorry to sound so depressed but that is what I feel right now. Husband wants me to cheer up, especially since chemo is not bad so far. But all I can think about is that my life will be cut short by this. I wish I was 15 years further down the line ... I am full of fear right now.",
