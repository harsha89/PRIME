Its half way in my areola and half on the breast tissue. it's on the left breast at about 5 o'clock. My gyno seemed worried and sent me to a BS. I have my first appointment this coming Friday. history on my maternal side: Grandmother: diagnosed in her 50's, bilateral MX, came back as bone cancer, she passed away in her late 60s Aunt: diagnosed with brain cancer, they found it was secondary to undiagnosed breast cancer, she passed in her late 40s/early 50s aunt: history of ovarian cancer. Then diagnosed with bone cancer, they found it was secondary to breast cancer. She passed in her 50s. Cousin (only female cousin) breast cancer found while she was pregnant with her twins at 29. She had a lumpectomy with clean margins and has been NED for years. (obviously she paid closer attention and was diagnosed much earlier than my other family memebers. My mother: was murdered at 40, she did not get regular health check ups and did not have an autopsy, so theres no way to know if she had/would get cancer. Log in to post a reply",

The center didnt have my films ready (even though they said they would) and I didnt have time to wait so I'll get those tomorrow. My reports read benign findings! Yay! I just had some questions if anyone can help me.. the mammo report reads: Findings: The breast are composed of a mixture of adipose tissue and scattered fibrogladular elements. There is asymmetric density and fibrogladular tissue in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast (thats where my probs are) Benign-appearing microcalcifications are suggested. No dominant malignant appearing mass lesion, developing area of architectural distortion are identified. There is no skin thickening. Small axillary lymph nodes are present. Anything in there you all think I should get checked out? Are \"small axillary lymph nodes\" being present normal?  I don't like the wording of \"benign-apprearing micro cals are suggested... it sounds like they dont know what it is... or maybe thats a normal term.

That's it. My Mammo and US results went to my PCP who had a receptionist call to say \"it looks fine\" and that's it. I like to have all my records in case I need them sometime in the future so I'll be picking up the reports and films today. I think maybe I'll send these films and the ones from 2 years ago to a BS and see what they say. I'm accepting of the result that there's not anything in there to freak out about but SOMETHING is causing this! Jeez! I will be thinking about you! Message me if you want to talk, if not I'll pop in every few days to check on you! This site is so wonderful!",

I also have I guess you would call it thickening in the upper outer region of the left breast. I'm wating for my results as we speak. I've had the pain for 2 years and when it started I had a mammo and ultra sound and they found nothing. My doctor told me to make some diet changes, I cut down from 3 large coffees a day to 1, stopped drinking soda, and started taking evening primrose (all are supposed to help with breast pain or fibrocystic breasts) none of it has helped so my doctor sent me in again. I know that people say \"well if theres pain it's not BC\" but I have heard many women (especially the younger ones it seems) DO have pain. Breast cancer CAN hurt. But that being said, a lot of things can hurt our boobs. So like I said, I haven't been diagnosed but I feel like we're in the same boat so I thought I would let you know that you are not alone! Keep me posted on how your doing!",
