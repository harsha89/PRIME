I didn't need one but I had lost so much of my volume and once I saw one and tried it on I had to have one. So those folks explained that I would need to color my hair to match the topper but told me my hair seemed pretty healthy at this pt.  So less than 3 months Pfc, I have colored, trimmed and have an exquisite hair piece that I only have to use when I feel like it. I COULD NOT BE MORE PLEASED. Can you tell I am happy?",

I will also try the colow wow and will come back to let everyone know how they both fare after the initial applications.

I really think a good deal of my hair loss was from putting caps on that were too cold and doing a horrible job drinking water. I already have lots of growth and besides the dark roots and not being able to style it, there is only one thing that I am really struggling with right now is my hair line on one side completely receded and the area right behind it broke off so I feel the guy from the movie fifth element,... For those who get the reference. It is odd because the area at my hairline where I had so much loss has always had a much different texture than the rest of hair, super-fine and never seemed to grow as long or as fast as all my other hair.  Honestly, the loss of 80% of my eyebrows is bothering more than all the rest right now  Steph",

For the blondes out there, the rootflage is great but I was not impressed with the color wow.  It was too hard to get on and didn't really seem to make that big of impact.  I woul recommend the rootflage and it comes in 3 shades of blonde. I am going to see one the most experienced people in the country when it comes to hair extensions week after next.  I am just looking for a little help filling in the areas that broke off.  I am not planning on going all blonde bomb shell just hoping for some help here and there.  This first appt is just for a consult to see if my hair is even healthu enough and if I can even accomplish what I am hoping for given that so much of the problem area is on the very top not on the underneath side of my hair.  I have a girl friend who is one you can trust to give you the absolute truth and she also happens to be fortunate enough that she runs in some very high-style, affluent circles.  She has always sported this cute little short haircut which she can totally pull off, but she did try hair extensions once (and not on the cheap I am sure).  Yesterday, she was very vocal that she thinks me getting the extensions is a very bad idea and now I am torn.  I really don't want to do anything to further damage my hair but if it would make it look better in the mean time, it might be worth it....  I just don't know.",

Had no idea about toppers but apparently all those tv and movie stars Wear them all the time. Easy to put on and stays put even in my convertible, I am told I could even wear it on a roller coaster. My guy and my long-time hair stylist did an AMAZING job matching the color. Topper actually doesn't start until @4-5 inches from hairline and I think it is almost impossible to see where it starts even IF you know it is there. Best part... I only wear in want to, I can get by just fine without it.  For those in DFW area, send me a private message if you want the guys info... On topper. I actually found him when I was looking into extensions because he is supposed to be awesome at those too. ",

So glad my decisions were able to help someone else here, lord knows I have benefitted from so many others experiences at this pt.  As far as toppers go, they are basically partial wigs but since you still have your own hair too, you blend the topper hair in with your natural hair and you secure it with these snapping combs that attach the bottom of the topper into the crown of your own hair. It is shocking how easy it is.  Apparently this is one of hollywoods little secrets, that is why they all have so much hair and can just clip in new topper with a different style within in minutes....they don't even have to be in same country while you are getting a new hair style.. Not that this last part will ever apply to me. 😃 I was told scarlet Johanson was wearing a topper in every one of her scenes in iron man 3.  Sounds like they might all be doing it.  If I can find a good descriptive site or video on toppers, I will try to post link here.... And as hard as it is to believe. Toppers ARE as easy to put on as the video will likely show. ",
