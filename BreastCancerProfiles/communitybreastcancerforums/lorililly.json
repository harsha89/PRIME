Last year in may I felt a lump went into the doctor and got an mammogram and an ultra sound and they said it was a fibroid tumor but they wanted to do a biopsy, which I did not get done til august.. which I did and it came back as what they thought a fibroid. But now it is 6 months later and it has started getting a burning feeling and a stretching feeling like a rubber band would feel. I could tell it is getting bigger. So i go in for my 6 month check up and they could tell on the mammogram that it has gotten bigger. and after the ultra sound they said it is a phyllodes tumor and wanted to do another biopsy to make sure not cancer which i got the results today and there is not any cancer. but since the tumor is about 5cm-10cm  and taking up most of my breast  they want to remove the entire breast. which is supposed to happen soon.. has anyone had this done what was it like for you ? if you did not lose your breast did it ever turn into cancer and if so how long did it take to turn ?",
