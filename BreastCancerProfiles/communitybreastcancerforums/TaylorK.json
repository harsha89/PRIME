I have not gone to the doctor yet however the lump has not changed in size or shape. There is no pain, it is smooth, round and hard. I feel that it is easily movable. I have had no physical changes to my breast either, no discharge or puckering. My nipple however sometimes turns a dark purple but it has almost always been like that. It is very close to the surface, I do not have to press hard to feel it and I can run my fingers over my skin and feel it. Recently I have come down with a chest cold and 3 days ago woke up with a spot of pain in my ribs under my right breast with the lump. It is not a persistent pain, it only hurts to cough or if I press on my ribs. It almost feels like a bad bruise. I have no history of cancer in my family, however I do occasionally smoke once a week maximum 3 cigarettes which I have stopped, but I understand does increase the risk of cancer. I am wondering if I could have cancer? and if my rib pain could be related to it? Log in to post a reply",
