I think...  It's all just so much to learn & accept all at once!   MsTee, I'm so sorry to hear that you're losing your ovaries before having kids.  That must make all of this so much harder.  Hang in there & good luck with your treatments!",

My CT guided Biopsy (spine) is scheduled for Monday.  Bone scan next Thursday to check my legs just to be sure (PET CT was only to hips) the surgery to remove my ovaries will most likely be in the next week or two & then he mentioned three drugs I'd go on.  Not sure if it's an either/or situation or if I'd really be on all three: Arimidex, Aromasin & Afinitor. TarheelMichelle that was great information and I will certainly bring that up to the OBGYN! Thanks again for all the wonderful replies.  It's comforting to know the surgery should be easy too. ",
