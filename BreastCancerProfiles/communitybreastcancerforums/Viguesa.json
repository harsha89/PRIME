Btw, I used to teach at UHDowntown for two years :) I finished my PhD at UH, you have MD Anderson there! it is a great resource! If you send them your records they will review them for free :)  Study Title: A Phase III Clinical Trial Comparing the Combination of Docetaxel plus Cyclophosphamide to Anthracycline-Based Chemotherapy Regimens for Women with Node-Positive or High-Risk Node-Negative, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer. You have been invited to participate in this research study, which is being conducted by the Colorado Cancer Research Program (CCRP). It has been reviewed and approved by the Colorado Community Institutional Review Board (CCIRB), which acts for CCRP and its consortium hospitals and affiliates. The Principal Investigator of CCRP is Eduardo R. Pajon, M.D. This is an important form. Please read it carefully or you may ask that it be read to you. It tells you what you need to know about this research study. If you agree to take part in this study, you need to sign this form. Your signature means that you have been told about the study and what the risks are. Your signature on this form also means that you want to take part in this study. This is a clinical trial (a type of research study). Clinical trials include only patients who choose to take part. Please take your time to make your decision. Discuss it with your doctor, your friends and your family. You should also inform your study doctor of all prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, herbal products, and dietary supplements you take before you agree to take part in the study, and if you decide to participate you should consult with your study doctor before starting anything new while on study. You are being asked to take part in this study because you have early stage breast cancer that has been removed by surgery. Your doctor has told you that chemotherapy and other therapy after surgery will decrease the chance of your cancer returning. Your breast tumor has already been tested and found to be a type of breast cancer called HER2-negative. This means that the tumor cells do not have extra HER2 protein on their surfaces. This study is only for women with HER2-negative breast cancer. WHO IS CONDUCTING THE STUDY? This study is being conducted by the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP). WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE? This study is being done for the following reasons:  This study is being done to find out if a combination of just two chemotherapy drugs, docetaxel and cyclophosphamide, is as good as using different combinations of the chemotherapy drugs doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, given with either docetaxel or paclitaxel, in treating your type of breast cancer. All of these drugs are used in standard combinations of chemotherapy for breast cancer.The researchers also want to learn about the side effects of the combinations of drugs used in this study. Side effect information will also be studied to see if there are any differences between the two-drug and three-drug chemotherapy combinations. Original 06/14/12 Page 1 of 20B-49 IRB Approval Date: 6/14/12 IRB Expiration Date: 6/13/13  In order to learn more about cancer tumors, this study includes special research tests that will be done on tumor tissue that was removed during your breast cancer surgery. Information about this study requirement will be explained to you in more detail later in this consent form. HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THE STUDY? About 1843 women from different cancer treatment centers will take part in this study. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY? Before you begin the study... You will need to have the following tests and exams to find out if you can be in the study. These tests and exams are part of regular cancer care and may be done even if you do not join the study. If you have had some of them recently, they may not need to be repeated. This will be up to your study doctor.  Medical history  Physical exam  Blood tests: o Tocheckyourbloodcounts o Tocheckhowwellyourkidneysandliverareworking  Chest x-ray or scan of the chest, for example a CT scan, PET scan, or combined PET/CT scan  Mammogram (an MRI is permitted in place of a mammogram before joining the study)  Echocardiogram or MUGA scan (to see how well your heart pumps blood)  Bone scan, PET-CT scan, or PET scan (only if you have bone pain or your blood tests show an increase in a bone-related protein)  MRI, CT scan, PET scan, or PET-CT scan of the liver (only if your blood tests show abnormal liver function)  Blood test, if needed, to confirm if you are premenopausal or postmenopausal  Pregnancy test (if you are a woman of childbearing potential) During the study... If all required tests and exams show that you can be in the study and if you choose to take part, you will be \u201crandomized\u201d to one of the two study arms. Randomization means that you are put into an arm by chance. A computer program will place you in one of the study arms. Neither you nor your doctor can choose the arm you will be in. You will have an equal chance of being placed in either of the two study arms.  If you are in Arm 1, you will receive the combination and schedule of three chemotherapy drugs (Regimen A, B, C, or D) that you and your doctor choose.  If you are in Arm 2, you will receive the combination of the chemotherapy drugs docetaxel and cyclophosphamide.After you have been assigned to one of the two study arms, you will begin your chemotherapy within 2 weeks after you join the study. You will Original 06/14/12 Page 2 of 20 B-49 IRB Approval Date: 6/14/12 IRB Expiration Date: 6/13/13 receive your chemotherapy according to one of the schedules described in the next section. The schedules are repeated either every 14 days or every 21 days. This 14-day or 21-day period is called a cycle. Arm 1 Regimen A Chemotherapy You will receive doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and docetaxel once every 21 days for 6 cycles. Each treatment will take about 11\u20442 \u2013 2 hours. Arm 1 Regimen B Chemotherapy You will receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide once every 21 days for 4 cycles. Each treatment will take about 1 hour. Twenty-one days after your last dose of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, you will receive paclitaxel once every 7 days for about 12 weeks. Each paclitaxel treatment will take about 1 hour. Arm 1 Regimen C Chemotherapy You will receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide once every 14 days for 4 cycles. Each treatment will take about 1 hour. Fourteen to 21 days after your last dose of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, you will receive paclitaxel once every 7 days for about 12 weeks. Each paclitaxel treatment will take about 1 hour. Arm 1 Regimen D Chemotherapy You will receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide once every 14 days for 4 cycles. Each treatment will take about 1 hour. Fourteen days after your last dose of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, you will begin to receive paclitaxel once every 14 days for 4 cycles. Paclitaxel therapy will take about 3 hours at each visit. Arm 2 Chemotherapy You will receive docetaxel and cyclophosphamide once every 21 days for 6 cycles. Each treatment will take about 11\u20442 hours. Supportive therapy for Arms 1 and 2 You must take another drug called dexamethasone before each docetaxel or paclitaxel treatment to help prevent some of the side effects of docetaxel or paclitaxel. Dexamethasone may be given to you by vein just before your treatment, or your doctor may give you tablets to take by mouth the day before and again in the morning on the day you receive docetaxel or paclitaxel. If your doctor gives you tablets, you must follow the schedule and take each dose of dexamethasone at the times your doctor tells you to take them. If you forget to take a dose or do not take it as scheduled, you must tell the doctor or nurse before your docetaxel or paclitaxel treatment. If you are in Arm 1 Regimen A, C, or D, starting the day after you receive your treatment, you will need another drug, either pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) or filgrastim (Neupogen®). These drugs help to prevent low white blood cell counts that may lead to infection. The drug you receive will be given as an injection under your skin. Your doctor or his/her staff may give you this injection or may teach you to give it to yourself, or they can teach a friend or relative to give the injection to you. The injection may be given on 1 or more days, depending on which drug your doctor decides is best for you. Some patients experience bone pain with these drugs. Original 06/14/12 Page 3 of 20 ",

Just a tad about myself in case you would like to establish a one on one. I am 31, live in Denver. I got diagnosed the 31st of Aug 2012, had a double mastectomy the 18th of Sept. with immediate reconstruction - which means the put expanders but not that i have boobs lol  ( i had uterine cancer last year and so saying bye to my boobs didn't seem like an question). i had eight lymphs taken out but one came back positive. I am going to start a study that my doctor recommended once my wounds heal, is anyone else doing the b-49 Phase III study? I just received the consent forms and I am nervous about it. I have also been told I will need radiation and  to take temoxin (sp) for five years after.  Are you guys in this boat too? Any advice? I am a professor and I am considering taking leave for the chemo, but do you know if it will be needed? Thanks so much for all the advice and really, you are all tough amazing women! let's beat this !  Dx 8/31/2012, IDC, 1cm, Stage IB, Grade 1, 1/8 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 9/18/2012 Lymph node removal: Right, Sentinel, Underarm/Axillary; Mastectomy: Left, Right Log in to post a reply",
