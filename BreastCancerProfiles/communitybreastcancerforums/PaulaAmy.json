Stage 4 and just swopped from Arimidex to Tamoxifen cos my TM's are slightly up from 40 to 86, onco taking no chances. How has your journey been? My first cancer was in 1996 so I have travelled a long road. I went off this site for a while cos we were losing so many good people. Best wishes Paula.",

I have been stage 4 for almost 5 years and it\u2019s 22 years since my first diagnosis of stage 1. To think I was scared THEN. What a joke stage 1 was, I was 38 and happy to wave goodbye to my saggy boobs that fed 4 babies! Now I am very nervous as I just finished 8 cycles of Taxol and it did nothing for my liver mets. Today I was swopped to Carboplatin and Gemcitabine, fingers crossed. My lung nodules and bone mets have been stable for that last almost 5 years but the liver story is scary. I am a healthy runner but my poor body is taking a beating and I have pain in my liver, no appetite and I am trying to keep my game face on for my children. So thank you for all your stories.....there is strength in numbers. Warm wishes to you all. Paula.‚ù§Ô∏è ",
