I had a biopsy - that lead to an excision of a milk-duct - that lead to a lumpectomy - that lead to the MRI and bilateral mastectomy. Each step of the way it felt like my life was snowballing out of control. When the path report came back after the lumpectomy and I was told they needed to go back in and there was extensive amounts of pre-cancer all through my right breast, I calmly looked at her (my BS) and told her to take the whole breast and while she was at it take the other one too. I believe I had made this choice a long time before I saw her that day. She sent me for an MRI and did the BMX.  Deciding on the BMX took radiation off the table for me and I am good with that since from what I have learned, reconstruction would have been more difficult with rads. As far as the second primary cancer, it was found by the pathologist and so was the DCIS in the non-cancer left breast. My oncyotype dx for the lumpectomy was a 13 and the oncyotype dx for the mastectomy was a 9. With scores so low and no breast tissue I did not have rads or chemo. No one could have convinced me there was not cancer in my other breast - I made the right choice for me.",

I may wake up warm sometimes - but I must sleep through any other side effects. Remember, just because the SE's are listed, that doesn't mean you will get all of them or any of them. I purposely did not read the side effects because I did not want to expect to get them. What I expected was to be thrown into full blown menopause... that did NOT happen. I am as regular as ever - and at 44 I have to say I am glad to still have my periods.  I am losing some weight (that's a PLUS) and my mood is even better! Some people get irritable but the opposite seems to be happening for me & some people need anti depressants. I am not sure if it's the Tamoxifen or just realizing what isn't important anymore. All that said, you will make the best choice for YOU! It is what you can live with and sleep with. Just being able to sleep at night knowing I am making the right choices for my self is key. If it were keeping me awake stressing over it, I would be making the wrong choice. YES I AM getting excited to get my soft squishy implants on 2/18 it's coming up FAST! I took some picts of the TE's fully expanded a few weeks ago and looked at them today. I think they look even better after a few weeks. I will probably take some the night before surgery and then after the swap. I will take more before the nipples and after nipples and then the same with the tattoos. It's weird because they look different in photos than in the mirror or when I look down directly at them. The photos show what I can't see from my view. I will post them when I have before and after shots to compare. I had 7 fills on top of the 300cc that were there from the placement of the TE's. If you have any questions, just ask... I learned the hard way to tell my PS I needed more drugs! I knew it would be 3 days of pain after a fill and then the massages made all the difference after I was finished expanding. Good luck making your choice and then you can always change your mind later! Kimberly",

I know for ME the best choice was to have a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction. I chose tissue expanders then implants. I was perfectly happy and willing to settle for the radiation & lumpectomy that I had had after they already took out a milk duct and before that - a biopsy. It seemed like my condition was snowballing out of control. I clearly remember going over the lumpectomy pathology report and having the surgeon tell me I had 3 options. What they were I could not tell you if my life depended on it today. I stopped her mid speech and told her to take the whole breast and take the other one while she was at it. I wanted to be as aggressive as possible in my treatment. I have a family history and 3 very close women to me have died from breast cancer - each one only had one breast removed. I could not live in fear of this the rest of my life.  I eliminated the radiation from my treatment by having the BMX and pathology showed that I had two primary cancers in my right breast as well as DCIS in my left. I always knew I would get BC it was just a matter of when for me. I was diagnosed at 43 years old. I am meeting with the genetics counselors in January to talk BRCA1 & BRCA2 testing as I have two daughters and a strong family history. I am on Tamoxifen and will be watched for endometrial cancer since my gynecologist calls me a polyp factory! I am still having my periods and have not noticed any bothersome side effects - I take it after 9 p.m. and must sleep through them? I knew I was making the right choice because I felt a peace wash over me as I said it out loud to my doctors. I know in my heart I had made that choice a long time ago. I am so sorry you are feeling like you don't have choices. I chose to be aggressive and have not looked back once. Let me know if there is anything I can help with. Kimberly",

I am still having my periods too and they are much better! They start and stop vs spotting for days afterward. The wierdest thing is my breasts do not tell me when I am going to start! LOL - I had a BMX and always knew when I was going to start for days because of the premenstrual swelling - not with these new things. The first thing that goes through my head is \"oh no breakthrough bleeding!\" Then I calm down - I am always surprised when I look at the calendar and realize it is right on schedule! Kimberly",

I have a few ladies in my local support group who have had BMX's and they had Inflammatory Breast Cancer come back in their skin... 32 nodes positive from one armpit... all this just 2 years after BMX. It scares me to think of everything I have been through and I am still not out of the woods yet! Metastatic BC is still BC even if its in your lungs or liver or bones. Another woman at my group has it in her brain... Lindagarside - you are so very welcome... anything you want to know, just ask... I was perfectly agreeable to have the lumpectomy then rads, but it was not in the pathology report to stop there. That was my plan and what the oncologist had planned, but thank goodness for the pathologists! They did their jobs and found what was not showing up yet on tests! I will be forever grateful for their obsessive nature of pathology!",
