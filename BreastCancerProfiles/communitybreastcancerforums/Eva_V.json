      "Content": "Eva_V wrote: Hi, everyone. I'm Eva and I have stage 4, ER+ breast cancer with bone Mets. I was diagnosed in November of 2012. I'm having a situation and I'd like to know if anyone else has gone through anything similar. I threw my back out about a week and a half ago. It was so bad that my Pain Management Dr prescribed muscle relaxers and added Motrin to my daily regime of medication: letrozole, dilauded, Lexapro, odansetron, etc. After they were added, my legs from below the knee, ankles and feet have been swollen and painful. But, up until the last few nights, I've been sleeping in a chair, in the living room. The spasms in my back were that bad. I try to elevate my feet if I can, but, the swelling only subsides a little bit. Is this something I should go to the ER about or do you think it will resolve itself? Log in to post a reply",
