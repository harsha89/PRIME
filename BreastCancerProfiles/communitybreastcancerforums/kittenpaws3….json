I mentioend the VNPI to doctors (even my second opinion dr who ended up being the chief of rad at a major cancer hospital) all discredited the VNPI and Dr. Legios bc the tool hasnt been validated according to them. The sited studies that showed women who passed on rads for DCIS and many of them were returning with recurrences.  So, that wasnt very assuring for me.  Although a 7 on the index does recommend radiaiton from what i recall. Not sure of percentage.   I am currently at the two month mark after my lumpectomy. I had my second opinion at 6 weeks and was being told the time frame usually went up to 2 months. So, I had my RO appt yestrday and actually went ahead with mocking and graphing and even got the three little tattoo marks. I am proceeding as if Im doing rads but I was going to use this weekend to mull things over.  Its incredibly difficult bc there are no guarantees.  None of my drs mentioend the Oncotype test . they have put my recurrence risk at 20% unless its higher due to one case of breast cancer onmy fathers side. All the doctors i have seen are not keen on passing on radiation for DCIS even stage 0, 7mm tumor, with a lumpectomy that came back benign.  They dont seem to think that having no other option other mastectomy if it returns is no big deal.  I understand now that passing on rads now doesnt mean a mastectomy is out bc DCIS could return larger or in more spots making lumpectomy not viable.  But what are the chances of that really happening. Ugh. Its frustrating me bc when i was first diagnosed, I was told the breast cant be radiated twice as if that was just how it was and well, nothing could be done. I never thought to question not having radiation at that early point. But once you start realizing all the info and effects of everything, things are no longer so simple.",
