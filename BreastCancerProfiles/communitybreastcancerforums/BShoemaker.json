Best of luck to everyone and keep me posted of your experiences! Bettina",

I hope everyone can find a way to relax & not have such anxiety over this.  I think if we learn to relax a little it may really help the healing process.  I can't promise I won't be back to a loony when I have my surgery, but at least I've got about 12 weeks to go before I jump that hurdle.  I meet with my surgeon for the first time on Monday, June 8 as well as a f/u with my Oncologist to get the PET/CT scan results.  I'm going to see how I do over the weekend and if I'm feeling up to it, will try to go to a hat shop in Long Beach I found.  Will also keep researching the wigs.  I need to get over it & just get it done!

Paulingmom - as far as what I did during my first Chemo....My dad, step-mom and husband came with me.  We talked, talked & talked some more!  It really made the time fly by for me even though we were there for 6 hours!  I sat next to a lady that was very sweet and she talked to me about her experience with Chemo as she had treatments 3x a week!    The nurses were also very sweet and chatted with me quite a bit as well explaining every little thing to me and my family as well.  I had an entire bag filled with magazines, ipod, book etc...and never used any of them!   I'm 39 years old, but was so surprised how comforting it was to have my dad there with me.  I felt so protected and safe with him there....it almost felt as though I was going back in time when you need your parents as a child to comfort you.  I would recommend asking to sit in a particular chair if you see someone that looks like they might be friendly or chatty.  They offered me my pick of seats.  Plus my Chemo is right by the ocean (I live in Southern California) and the windows have a full view of the Pacific so the other gal I spoke with said she is sure to pick her chair to get the best view of the beach!   Hope this helps!  Bettina",

The funny thing is the Chemo doesn't scare me...the surgery scares the crappola out of me!  I don't like getting my blood taken let alone having someone remove my boobs! zuzzeee - After I got home from work I put on a baseball cap and went grocery shopping without the wig.  I found myself staring at everyone to see if they were staring at me.  I then realized yes, people might look, but then they will just go about their business. My husband said most people never even noticed...and he was right.  At the end of the day who cares?  I wore my baseball cap to Chemo today and I saw a lady getting Chemo herself staring at me..that was strange.  I thought for sure that's one place where people would not stare.  But I thought about it and she still had her hair...I wondered if she was looking at me picturing what she would be facing soon herself.  Who knows.  Then a lady came in & sat next to me for her treatment.  She was completely bald...not a hair in site.  She wore a little purple hat, but it had very little coverage.  She was so comfortable with herself and it inspired me even more.  She spoke about her surgery she had and advised me she was single and doing this all on her own.  She was by herself...people drop her off at Chemo & pick her up.  She then invited me to a group therapy she goes to every Tuesday morning.  I may just go to check it out.  I really felt at that moment how lucky I am to have my husband, father, step-mom and friends so supportive during this time in my life.  My dad came with me to chemo...he has been coming to all my major doctor appts & Chemo treatments and he lives about 4 hours away.  He and I are closer than ever.  He got to see his daughter bald for the first time today.  He has been bald for 1/2 of his life so he cracked a joke that at least mine would grow back, unlike his own.  It was funny and so true!  Just so you know....I am now laughing about the wig incident.  I could still give her a good whack on her head, but will restrain myself.  I have decided I will not be wearing the wig to work though...I will go the baseball cap route...I know I need to feel comfortable and my wig is just not making me comfortable.  :(   I will get through this.  It is what it is and I can handle it.  Laura - I knew you would get a good laugh at the wig story!  I am so proud of you for going bald at work!  If I looked as good as you do with a buzz, I would too.  Unfortunately, mine is so patchy and jacked up...I'm going to keep the baseball cap on I think.  I'm glad your co-workers are enlighted.  That certainly helps.  Hugs all, Bettina ",

So I just had Chemo #2 on Thursday, June 25.  I have not experienced any nausea at all.  This time around I used EMEND nausea meds and they worked very well for me.  Insurance charged $60.00 for the 3 pills, but I think it's worth it to not feel sick to my stomach etc...   Just a tip for those with bad nausea.  I'm now a firm believer in EMEND.  On Saturday I was extremely sleepy though...I slept most of the day.  I would rather sleep though than feel sick! Bonnid - try drinking gatorade...that might help with the dehydration. As far as the concentration - I could not focus yesterday at all, but today am feeling much better.  I guess that's the Chemo-brain kicking in??? Hugs to you all, Bettina",

I also think we will get more and more used to being bald as the days go by and we are out in public etc.  I just purchased a couple scarves online as I really don't think the wig thing will work for me.  I just can't get past the thought of it falling off, being cockeyed on my head, slipping etc...that day at work just wrecked it for me.  Now to top it off, my head has broken out with pimples and red spots on it!  When we first shaved it, it looked fine...now it's totally ugly.  I also noticed after looking further in the mirror at the back of my head, I officially have an egg shaped head.  Ok, I am offically done venting...for today that is.  ;) Anyway, just wanted to let you know that your not alone.

I have decided I don't think I can do the wig thing at work.  I am so worried about it all day long feeling as though it's going to slide off etc...  I think I'm going to just keep it for emergencies, but will wear a hat or scarf to work.  Screw this wig business!  By the way.  My head is so tender and is bugging me.  My head feel like I have a bunch of pins or needles in it.  Ok, I'm done venting now.  I feel better.  I might even be able to laugh about the wig incident later...  Tomorrow is Chemo #2.  Hoping everyone is doing well.  Hang in there ladies...maybe at least I provided you with a laugh about my wig today!!!

Best of luck to you both! Bettina",

My next Chemo is Thursday of next week.  For those of you that hate getting pricked with needles, I have been VERY happy with my picc line.  Yes, you have to wrap it up for protection when you shower, but I don't care!  It beats getting pricked over and over again.  They can use it to draw blood as well.  There is no needle prick at all as many of you have mentioned in regards to the Port.  Anyway, it's another option to discuss with your Oncologist. Cherneski, in regards to sleep, I have been taking Tylenol PM and it works like a charm for me. Hope everyone is hanging in there! Bettina",

Best of luck to you all! Bettina",

Bluedasher, today was my first day and I did really well.  No bad reactions and loved my nurse.  I have a Picc Line...THANK GOODNESS!  I love it!  I hate needles so this is such a relief to me and my nurse...she was thrilled too!  I am taking Benedryl, Decadron & Zantac before the Chemo.  I was very alert during the Chemo, but also had my dad, stepmom & hubby with me.  We chatted the entire time and I met a really sweet lady next to me that had Ovarian cancer about 5 years ago and no recurrence, but now has Lymphoma.  She had a great attitude and was full of good advice.  The only mistake I made was not wearing a short sleeve shirt because of the Picc Line...next time I will!  I just wanted to be warm is all.  I will take your advise on the ice chips for next time.  They also provided blankets, pillows, hard candy, crackers etc...  I brought my gatorade. Thanks Lisa as always...great advice!  I think the pad of paper/pen is a great idea as I think of questions...we had quite a few today! Hugs, bettina",
