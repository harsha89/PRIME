      "Content": "HeatherJS wrote: Hi all, I am worried out of my mind and thought I'd turn to the forum for some more information and support. I am nearly 12 weeks pregnant with my first child, and experiencing symptoms that resemble IBC. A few weeks ago, I'd experienced stabbing pains in my left breast only, but they were gone within a couple of hours so I chalked it up to the pregnancy. I've also experienced two different bouts of day-long underarm pain, again only on my left side, but since I couldn't feel any swelling in my lymph nodes and the pain passed quickly, I chalked that up to pregnancy as well. Fast-forward to Wednesday of last week, when I noticed a red, painful spot near the base of my areola on the left side, again on my left breast. I contacted my OB and was seen the same day. He diagnosed me with an infected Montgomery gland and assured me that I didn't have breast cancer when I asked about the possibility. He didn't recommend antibiotics because I didn't show any signs of the infection spreading, so I just used hot compresses for a couple of days, followed by antibiotic ointment on the area. The spot is no longer painful and the color is faded, but it still looks discolored (like the color of my areola but seeping onto what used to be a spot of normal, pale skin, if that makes sense). To me the skin also looks slightly thicker in that area. A few days later, my nipple on the same breast began retracting. It's not always flat, but even when it's stimulated and protrudes more, the very center portion of the nipple stays pinched in on itself, forming a small slit. I'm sometimes experiencing a pinching sensation behind that nipple as well. My OB ordered an ultrasound and the results came back normal. I breathed a sigh of relief at first, but I've read at length about IBC after Googling my symptoms and I know IBC often doesn't show on an ultrasound or mammo. I've also read that a disproportionate number of women with IBC were diagnosed during pregnancy or breastfeeding. My mind is spinning. I keep thinking about the possibility of a cancer diagnosis, how treatment might affect my pregnancy, and possibly not being around to watch my child grow up, or to raise him/her with my husband...just married in June of this year. I'm seeing a breast specialist next week. I'm grateful but also concerned that getting in so quickly could be a sign that it is indeed serious. Should I request a skin punch biopsy even if the specialist doesn't deem it necessary? I know there's a lot of variability to how IBC presents and I don't want anything to get missed. Is there a chance these changes could be due to pregnancy? Thank you to everyone/anyone who takes the time to read this long post. Any thoughts/support would be much appreciated. ~Heather Log in to post a reply",

The breast specialist told me that everything looks normal to her, and that although my left nipple is flat and has a slit in it, she doesn't consider it to be a sign of malignancy in the same way as full blown nipple inversion, as it's not sinking in below the surface of my breast. She also told me that she wouldn't even know which area to biopsy and that IBC is a clinical diagnosis, and she doesn't see any clear signs or symptoms. She's going to check in with me again in a month, for my own peace of mind. Hopefully no more symptoms develop and everything remains OK, as she assured me it is for now.

I now have some swelling in the area adjacent to my incision, although the bruising appears to have disappeared. The area is tender but not red or hot. I'm also menstruating right now, which tends to cause increased lumpiness in my breast, and am wondering if this is causing the misshapen appearance due to stretching in the area of the incision. Should I be worried about a blood clot? Has anyone else experienced this post excisional biopsy and if so, was it normal per your doctor/did your breast eventually revert back to its original shape? Any feedback or input would be much appreciated, as I'm wondering if I need to contact my doctor! Thanks, ~Heather Log in to post a reply",

I now have a patch of brownish redness on the same breast, but NOT immediately adjacent to my core biopsy site, which was two weeks ago this past Friday. The patch popped up overnight on Saturday morning. I noticed it in the shower and at that point it seemed more yellowish, but it's since gotten slightly bigger and is reddish. The area surrounding the red patch now also appears to have a yellowish tint. I'm getting really concerned about the possibility of inflammatory breast cancer at this point. At least before I could tell myself that if the surgical excision of the \"fibroadenoma\" came back positive for cancer, it would likely be in the early stages and very treatable. IBC, on the other hand, is extremely aggressive. Luckily my PCP is seeing me this week. Any thoughts or feedback would be much appreciated, because now I am extremely worried.",

One thing you said jumped out at me, because I was wondering about exactly that--when they removed your fibroadenoma, did they explain why they felt the need to run a pathology on it? Mine is being removed because of the \"irregular borders\", and while I'm trying to tell myself that cancer would've shown in the biopsy, the fact that they would run another pathology does have me a little worried. I am confident that yours will be benign, and hopefully mine too--I just can't help but worry that I'm not totally out of the woods yet! ",
