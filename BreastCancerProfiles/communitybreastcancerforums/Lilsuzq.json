I am looking for percentages from my Oncologists (treating and second opinion) and neither of them have given me those as options - only TCH and then Tamoxifen. Thank you. You are all so brave...if I go forward with chemo I hope I can be just a brave as you all.",

Took 6/22 and 6/23 off work but worked the entire week following. I felt the crappiest Mon-Tues.... But just slid past it. Hair still intact ( probably not for long). A side effect I was not prepared for are pimples! I feel like a teenager with acne. Anyone else had this? My white blood cell count low and I ran a fever yesterday. Picked up antibiotic yesterday and see MO today..... Maybe neulesta for me today. Otherwise doing well. Next chemo is 7/13. Cheers to all of you brave women",

I had second round on 7/13 and so far - no thrush or mouth sores. Who knows? I also rinse with Biotene. Not sure if I will get it again. Love everyone's pictures - all are beautiful - wig or no wig! Love the pets...they are therapy all by themselves. I had my Herceptin today...feeling good today...awaiting round three on 8/3. With round 3 I will be 50% done with chemo. I am counting the days.

I've had a some tingles in my hands and feet (nothing too bad) but I thought it would be nice to get a foot massage at little Day Spa we have here. Well..the foot massage also includes some shoulder, back, head, neck and hands. First I had to tell them not to touch too far down my neck/shoulders with my port, then I don't feel hugely comfortable on my stomach since my surgery...oh and no head massage because my wig would fall/come off...! But - you can massage my feet and hands...but everything else - don't touch me! Lol...this was a fun thing I used to enjoy and now...not so much. The entire time my mind was spinning about the port, if I would turn over - would she just concentrate on my feet because all else is off limits? For round 2 I had headaches...round 1 not so much. The only thing different was the Neulasta injection I received. I am pretty sure that is why I had headaches but who knows? No mouth sores with round 2 - but tongue felt 'burned' and roof of my mouth felt a little raw. Still working full-time and I am praying I can continue to do so until the end of chemo. I have a consultation with an acupuncture clinic tomorrow to see if they can help with certain things...anxiety, fatigue and nausea. I had a bit of queasy after round 2 - nothing too serious but would like it to be even less. Take care of you lovely ladies, Sue",

My general surgeon did the mastectomy and the plastic surgeon put the saline implants in the same day. I was home by 3 pm ...lol...Yes I agree that the flap surgery sounded like a lot - with exposure to infections, multiple surgeries , etc. I do hear, however, that the results can be nice and look very natural. My previous saline implants were filled with 365 cc's and my new ones are 390 cc's (same size but with breast tissue being absent the surgeon explained that the implants would need to be filled more for same size result). I am a small C cup. I did not need radiation as there is no breast tissue to radiate and there was no lymph node activity in the two that were taken out. It is my understanding that the chest wall itself can be radiated if needed. The whole saline implant experience, both times in my life, were positive. Also, I wanted to get back to work ASAP. I was able to do that after the mastectomy and the implants. I hope this helps and let me know if I can help further. It's such a personal decision. If you have any doubts about your doctors - get a second opinion. I did.... Prayers, Sue",

I was fearing the surgery - but my fears were SO MUCH more than what it really was. I struggled with doing just a unilateral - but I just went for it. Turns out the left breast tissue had hyperplasia - which are abnormal cells that have a higher chance at becoming cancerous. Looking back I am glad I made that decision - but it certainly is different for everyone. Congratulations Kim on 'getting it done'! Take care everyone - you are all in my prayers. Sue",

From the start of my dx I was told it was Stage I and there was no lymph node activity found...but...now I let my mind wander to - if something is found on the rib(s) - that makes me Stage IV.

After my head was shaved I commented on how small my head is (I am pretty petite) and my mom said - your head was not that small when I was trying to get you out...lol! Yes missing my Father so much - the world is just not the same without him physically in it...however, I know he is watching over us. I love how you are rocking that gray cap! It's adorable! You are very beautiful! MsLin - love how the scarf looks on you - I am inspired to shop for one this weekend if I am feeling up to it! Kim - you are so beautiful - keep your positive spirit up because it's working for me too. When I saw you on that horse on Day 2 I was inspired to think ...there must be a lot of good days too while going through this! Praying for you today (and always) to get this next treatment done today. Cross another one off the list! Happy Friday and minimal side effects for all! Sue ",

My first treatment I took 2 PTO days (Thursday and Friday) and worked the next week. I go into the office. My MO said most people don't work - but I am with you - my job is very important to me as well and I have not spouse to lean on. I used 4 weeks of FMLA when I did my surgery and was worried about running out if I was unable to work. I did pretty well with treatment 1 and am hoping I will do the same with the remaining. I am a Financial Controller and I am not set up to work from home. My employer is being very accommodating. I am hoping to go in tomorrow for at least 1/2 so I don't have to use another PTO day. I think everyone's situation is different and it will vary case-by-case. I hope the best for you and good luck! Sue",

I am still trying to come to grips with this. Starting on 6/19/17 with 6 cycles of TCHP - taxotere, carboplatin, herceptin with Herceptin to follow for one year. I am glad to read the posts but terrified of all the possible side effects and how I will cope.",

I have been working full-time and even teaching a few fitness classes here and there (my old life as I call it). Oct 5th is my last TC and was seriously doubting that I can do it. However, after two Advil and a good cry I am just going to go for it. What's one more, right? I did surgery before chemo so for me - this will be the end of my journey (so-to-speak). I struggle with returning to 'normal' because there is no normal anymore. I guess there will be a new normal? I was able to find inner strength that I never thought existed. Also - so blessed with so many Angels - angels I never anticipated. Also - a few people I thought would be angels and turned out that they were not able to do that. That is ok. I just want to provide encouragement and prayers to each of you. You are all beautiful and strong. Stay the course. We got this! Sue",

It just feels like a normal feeling to be angry. When you think about it - from diagnosis to treatment - you are pretty much looking at a year of your life being put on hold (sort of). I was dx in early March, had bmx in mid April, chemo 6/22 with Hercptin to follow until next June. I used to have a very active life - working a a great full-time job, teaching fitness classes for fun, Bikram Yoga (which I have had many people tell me no good for cancer as it is tough on the body)...now I can barely do a push-up! It will take a long time to get muscle strength back. However, I have to admit, I have had more good days than bad days and was able to work full-time - did not miss any work. I've been following this board since June and tracking everyone's progress - and you are doing great - almost to the end of chemo. Surgery was pretty easy for me considering. Hang in there. Sending prayers. Peachy - thank you for summing it up and adding the movie story. I used the cancer card one time while my family and I were waiting for a table in a restaurant. It just slipped out (as a joke) and we were seated momentarily! lol I hope you are feeling better today.Hang in there. LTWJ - I have the same treatment plan as you. I can't wait to be where you are - done with chemo. Today is my last chemo. I want the chemo over so I can focus on Herceptin only and getting stronger. My neuropathy comes and goes but does not seem that bad. My muscle twitches have slowed down (in my eyes and all over my body). This next week is all about getting through this last treatment. Good luck with your MRI and let us know how it goes. Off to LAST CHEMO in 2 hours,...wish me luck and I'll take any extra prayers! I'm sending prayers to all and thank you for your continued support!
