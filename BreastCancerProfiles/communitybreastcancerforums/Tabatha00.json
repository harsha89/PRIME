HOWEVER, my urologist DOES require scans every year.  I have to have a CT scan and chest x-ray March 21.  I think to myself.  If I hadn't had that damn kidney cancer I could live in denial forever and not have scanxiety!!!!   I asked my urologist what the chances are that the kidney cancer will come back and he shook his head and said \"not likely at all but anything is possible in medicine\".  I have thought so many times about not having the scan done in March but is that me being irresponsible????   Probably!   DAMN DAMN DAMN!!!!!!   I DON'T WANT TOO!!!!!!   I know I should.  God forbid if the breast cancer ever decided to rear it's ugly head again and I could have caught a recurrence earlier I would never forgive myself.  I just pray pray pray for clear scans on March 21 so I can not worry about tests for another year!!!!!!

Sooooooooo, I had genetic testing and it shows I have a \"variant of unknown significance\" in the BRCA1 gene.  Because of this the genetic counselor said they don't make a recommendation either way on if you should or should not have any particular surgery.  She said because they don't know if the \"variant\" is a cancer causing variant or not.  Yeah, well that's all well and good but my family history SCREAMS cancer so I want to get everything ripped out.  lol They did an ultrasound on my ovaries and found they are fine.  I want to get this surgery out of the way because I just finished up with my breast cancer treatment in May and I don't want to do this again.  EVER!

Honestly, after everything I've been though this surgery has been a piece of cake!!!!   The Dr said everything went great but of course everything has to go through pathology and he said that would be sometime next week.  He's a gyno oncologist so I feel if there was anything to be conerned with he would know by the look of the ovaries and tubes and since they do it laproscopic I'm sure he had a look around before the surgery was over. So, the great news is if you have your ovaries and tubes removed it's alllllllllll good.    lol",
