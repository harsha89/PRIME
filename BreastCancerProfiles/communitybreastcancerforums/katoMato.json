I have been there, lived there, and still visit there! There is a thread on this board (or there was a year or so ago) called \"I want my MOJO back!\" It was filled with personal experiences and ideas to try for various situations we - as survivors - encounter.  It was amusing, and very encouraging. The most important thing that i was able to take away from it was that there exists a product called \"Replens\". It appears that during normal and chemo induced menopause one result of the dropping (dropped?!) estrogen level is vaginal dryness. Add some estrogen blockers or AI's and you have the DESIRED effect of NO estrogen. Desireable for BC if your tumor was ER+, but MISERABLE for sex.  I could give you graphic descriptions, but suffice it to say that KY jelly or other \"external, topical\" agents did not help. AT ALL.  Replens is a \"vaginal moisturizer\" that is inserted deep inside the vaginal canal with a tube much the same as treatment for yeast infections, etc. You can use it right before sex, or it says you can use it up to a day or so prior to that. My GYN suggested that I use it twice a week if for no other reason than it keeps things a little more comfortable down there. I still use it about a half hour prior to making love, and it works. Without it, there would be no sex. I would not be able to, period. (I know, I need to send the inventor roses or something, from the two of us!) So if, because of the specifics of your dx you are not able to use hormone based vaginal products, you can get this little God-send from Walgreens, and most other pharmacys, and I've seen it in more than a few grocery stores. We've been married for 30 years as of next week. The sex isn't quite as \"spontaneous\" as it was back in the day, but  then, neither of us are either! It's just as fun to plan...and at least it's still POSSIBLE.",

We've all (well, most of us) been in the same boat - unexpected diagnosis, fear, depression...so take courage in that you're not alone. First of all, a later side effect of ANY surgery can be depression...so that might be making this whole thing more difficult for you. (Not that it's ever EASY...) Secondly, the improvements in treatments due to research and technology in just the last 10 years has been exponentially better. They know SO MUCH MORE now than they did back, even 10 years ago, on how to treat nausea, and any other SE's you might encounter. Thirdly, I note that you are in Houston...are you receiving treatment at MD Anderson? If not, I would use them for a second opinion. My personal experience is this: ALWAYS GO TO A CANCER RESEARCH HOSPITAL IF POSSIBLE. If you are already there, take comfort in that you are at one of the best facilities in the nation, with the most cutting edge technology and support around.  This board is the place to be...there are women here who have gone through what you've gone through, and they're here still - just to support people like you.There is an amazing wealth of information and support here...better than just one doctor BY FAR. You're in the worst part of this \"journey\" right now - the beginning, when everything is new and scary. It gets better. You'll see. If you do have chemo, my suggestion is to read the chemo threads of others who have gone on before you so that you'll know what to expect, and then find or start one for others to join with you so that you'll be going through it together. I was surprised how \"doable\" it all was. Trust God, select your doctors well, then trust them and post often. We care.",

Very \"doable\".  Keeping in mind that everyone is different, my side effects went through a pattern that I could predict pretty much according to how many days \"out\" I was from treatment. For example, The day before, the day of and the day after I was a little hyper from the Decadron (steriod) I had to take. Difficult to get a good night sleep during that period, but boy was my house clean! Days 3 - 5 were uncomfortable, in that I had cold symptoms, bloating, constipation, and a sometimes a headache. For each of those you can take over the counter things and just be patient because they eventually go away, and then I had two good weeks of normal before I went to go do it all over again....drink LOTS of water. My onc said 3 litres a day. Flush that stuff out of you! It's best to not have it sitting in your bladder. The effects were cumulative, in that #2 seemed a little worse than #1 and so on. Oddly however, #4 seemed the easiest. Can't explain that except that my husband prayed specifically that #4 would be easiest. I never was really nauseated. Taxotere is much easier than Adriamycin in that regard. Do not fear - you'll be fine and you'll be done before you know it. Learn as much as you can - this is the best site ever -, and find or start a Chemo-sister group here that you can go through this with. I did (\"Anyone starting chemo in August 07?\") after reading the threads of women who did that before me - going back to 2005! It was a life/sanity saver. I've probably given you too much information - sorry. You'll do fine. I'll be watching for you! ",

After my first tx on days 3 & 4 I felt in the same areas as though someone was holding a sparkler inside me, (kind of like those \"pop rocks\" candy that kids eat) at that point, then it went away after a day or two. When I mentioned it to my onc, she said she thought it was indigestion or heartburn from the steriod (no.) and to wait and see what the 2nd tx did.  I noticed the same \"pop rocks\" feeling, in the same area, but much less pronounced with the 2nd tx, and then nothing at all for tx 3 and 4.  It completely disappeared until after rads was over (Dec 14, 07) and now I'm feeling the first feeling again. Not the \"pop rocks\", just tingly, sharp, tiny pricks, except now it's around my collar bone.  I realize I sound like a nut case, (no. I am a nut case.) but I can't help being suspicious. I think if someone had mets to that area they would be able to say; yes, I felt that too. Or, nope. I never felt anything. Arrgh.  Thanks for the response. I HOPE it's temporary esophogitis. (I had thrush after tx #4, but I think it's completely gone away.) I have an appt. at the end of this month to see my onc, so I think I'll ask her then. You are wonderful! Thanks! ",

In this world we will have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world. And other writers have said about him: Not by works of righteousness that we have done, but according to His Mercy, He saved us. He shall feed his flock like a shepherd. He shall gather the lambs in his arm and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.   He loves you, and he wants you to love him too.",

No one mentioned it to me, i developed it just PRIOR to rads - but the rads definately exacerbated it. The Rad onc and techs insisted that rads weren't to blame, and maybe it is a coincidence, but it existed nonetheless. The GOOD NEWS is that it IS going away (slowly). I'm a week post last rad and don't cough nearly as much anymore. It's definately going away. Did a little research and found that Taxotere can have a cough as a cumulative effect. So we may never know. Have a good Christmas! ",
