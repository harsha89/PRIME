Wanted to let you know about a trick I use with my seatbelt so it doesn't rub on my port (which is on my left side). I use a black binder clip and clip it at the top of the seatbelt so it holds back the tension that would otherwise pull tight against my shoulder. If I ever get stopped by the cops, I'm pretty sure a flash of my bald head, or the port itself would get me off with a warning.",

The thing I had to really get my mind around was the fact that the standard is NOT to do mastectomy once the cancer has already spread. It creeps me out that this stuff will be hanging out in my breast without cutting it off. I suppose hormone treatments, etc. are supposed to keep it at bay but I'm still feeling quite new to it all so I don't know for sure.",

Feeling ok except for the insomnia from the Dexamethasone. Once my last treatment is done on Sept. 3, the oncologist says it will be 4 weeks before all the follow up tests will have results back for us to make a decision going forward. Had to have a lung scan due to shortness of breath, and while they weren't officially looking there, I got some good news that they could see my breast tumours are shrinking and there is no longer signs of cancer in my lymph nodes. Crossing my fings that the mets in my spine are reacting the same way :) This discussion board has been a Godsend, as Googling Stage 4 breast cancer is a recipe in futility. Thanks again all!",

Grim, I know, but I needed to know it wasn't an immediate end of the line for me. I truly appreciate your willingness to share - this has been so good for me. It is going to be hard waiting for the last chemo (sept. 5) and then the four weeks that it will take for follow up tests etc. to determine next steps. I don't really know what my options may include at this point. What if there is still Ned in the nodes (since last week's scan) but some cancer remaining in the breast and vertebrae? I guess time will tell. Thanks again so much everyone :)",
