I had excisional biopsy in 2010 that confirmed ADH and ALH. My oncologist suggested Tamoxifen but gave me the option. Being 42 at the time I decided against because I didn't want the menopausal symptoms and risk of side effects and I just knew this was a one time event. We did not discuss MX and I probably would 't have considered it anyway. Last year I had more calcifications, DCIS this time and I went ahead with bilateral MX and implant reconstruction and haven't looked back. I had already decided that even if it was \"just\" more ADH, I was done and couldn't handle the worry and endless biopsies from here on. My oncologist said he doesn't know if the Tamoxifen would have made a difference or not since it was only a year out. Hopefully none of you wonderful women will ever have a recurrence and will be fine from now on, and I am not trying to scare anyone with my story. I guess my point is that even though ADH is not considered cancer, it certainly doesn't diminish the worry and there are probably a lot of us further down the line that understand what you are having to handle. DCIS is not considered cancer by some because it is not invasive. I don't care what you call any of these \"precancers,\"anything that involves surgery and constant monitoring is life changing in itself and being concerned is always understandable.",
