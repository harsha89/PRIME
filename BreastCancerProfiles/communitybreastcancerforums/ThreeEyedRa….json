Although it bumped me from stage 2a to stage 3a, I don't actually think it is going to change my treatment plan. I'm still a a bit freaked out, but I did the surgery first so that I would have more information. Does your pathology report change what you were going to do treatment wise? Good luck with whatever you end up doing!!",
