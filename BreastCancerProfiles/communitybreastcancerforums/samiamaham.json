I had a BIRAD cat 5 8/15 and a biopsy yesterday, 8/19. I was still feeling hopeful but the radiologist said she would be suspect if if came back negative, saying \"in fact, I'd demand another\".  She showed me the doppler, the blood supply and irregularities compared to my cyst. My mother and her mother died before 50 of ovarian and breast cancer. I had a hysterectomy at 39 when they suspected cancer, I guess that's why i'm hopeful, turns out it was just really bad endometriosis. I'm so scared i'm almost numb and needed to vent. My partner isn't the most comforting person, great for a head cold- but unable to handle something that has my feelings attached to it. I don't know who will explode first, me or he elephant in the room.  I look forward to hearing what your onco says LeeLee.  Does anyone know how to post something new on this site?  I want to know more about all the HER, ER+/= stuff I am reading on this site.  Do I talk to my primary about genetic testing?  ",
