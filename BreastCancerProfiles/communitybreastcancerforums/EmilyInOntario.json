Or those of you who also have just started chemo..how are you feeling? I didn't expect to feel so drained and tired.( on FEC) The anti nausea meds seem to be helping but no real appetite now. I am finding eating small amounts frequently really helps ie, a little soup here, a few nachos or crackers there, a bit of applesauce or pudding etc.Sipping ice water frequently. So glad coffee still tastes good. Some things don't taste the same now. I was told FEC would likely cause diarrhea..think I'm heading the opposite direction...
