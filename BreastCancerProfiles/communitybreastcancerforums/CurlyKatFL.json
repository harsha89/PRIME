I will keep that in mind though. Sandy I figure when I get to ther doctors office after the holiday it will be about 2 weeks. I have noticed that heat and streching does provide some releif. But sleeping is still an issue without some kind of pain med. Thanks for all the input ladies Kathy",

I have had some pain in my hip (actually is feels like my butt) for a few days. It is intermittent but sometimes it is painful to walk and last night the pain actually woke me up. Motrin does take the edge off. I don't remember doing anything that would have caused an injury or strain. So of course in the back of my mind I am thinking could it be mets to the bones. I don't want to seem like a paranoid whiner but of course I am worried. SO do I wait a little while and see if I just hurt my hip somehow and that it will heal? Do I call the doctor and ask for a scan? And which doctor do I call my primary care or my onc? Thanks Kathy PS I missed you guys :) Dx 4/23/2004, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIIB, Grade 3, 1/13 nodes, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",

About 3 years ago when I was going through treatment a very gossipy person from my office tracked me here and proceeded to tell everyone in the office who would listen about all my medical problems during treatment. I remember how completely violated I felt. I changed my screen name and that stopped it. Some people just seem to need to hurt other people. I just don't get it. Don't let her chase you away. You deserve to feel comfortable and share with us Hugs Kat",
