I was dx with DCIS in left breast in Jan. It was terrible timing (is it ever good?) and I felt like it stopped me in my tracks. All the positive things I had put in motion abruptly stopped as I initially resisted and eventually accepted the dx. I was told repeatedly that DCIS is the \"best of breast cancers\" and some even questioned whether it was truly cancer, which created a tornado in my head. Drs recommended lumpectomy with radiation. I opted for a bmx with diep flap for various reasons. I'm 3 weeks post surgery. I definitely experienced some anxiety in the days and hours leading up to surgery. I'm glad I went with a mx as path report indicated DCIS had been much larger than picked up on imaging. Unfortunately I was informed last week a small amt of DCIS remains. UGH. I'm trying to get back to living as my life has been consumed by cancer for the last 5 mos. I'm grateful to be a part of this community as it's been invaluable to me during this journey.",

I don't remember anything about the surgery and woke up groggy but feeling OK due to morphine drip. I was on a morphine drip for several days. Once I returned home I took a lot of tylenol. In my experience the pain was tolerable and was considerably less each day. The surgery went smooth and I am happy to be progressing quickly. Ladies, you will get through this. I woke up the night of the surgery in shock and relieved that surgery was over. It feels so good to be on the other side of surgery. Good luck to all of you.",
