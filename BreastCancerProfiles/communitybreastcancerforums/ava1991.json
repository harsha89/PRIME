My physician ordered me a mammogram but was told that they don't do a mammogram for women my age and instead did a ultrasound and the doctor showed me the image of a black mass and the doctor told me that she wasn't happy that the upper half of the mass looked round/angular but the bottom half wasn't well defined and ordered a biopsy and I have it scheduled for next Tuesday and I am worried sick. I know I probably shouldn't be googling every single article out there but most of them suggest that I could have cancer. I have no family history, I spend hours at the gym everyday, eat healthy food and don't drink/ smoke and I hate the fact that I could be diagnosed with cancer. Seems so unreal. I haven't told any friends or family about this and posting here if anyone's listening and has something to say to me. :) Log in to post a reply",
