I then took another cycle and the blood counts were fine too (in fact blood counts done on day 21 of cycle as consultant away the following week and they were still at 1.8). So seems with me (and drs!) that the Zolof/Sertraline affected my neutrophils. ",

I think one of the general side effects of Zoloft can be low neutrophils and I guess combined with another drug that can also have that effect then it's not good! The dr said it is unusual for neutrophils to suddenly change after being steady (and fine) as they have been so was very much thinking it was the Zoloft. I hope so! I'm now quite scared as going on holiday with my 2 teenagers but with the very low counts I'm going to be a bit paranoid. Does anyone have experience of how long they take to recover to normal levels?  I will keep you updated when I get future blood test results as I guess if they are normal that would seem to say it was the Zoloft...",

Thanks for the info on how long it stays in the blood, reassures me that it is ok to just take when best for me, as you said. It is tricky when also taking other tablets, I have calcium/vit D ones too and dr now suggesting anti-depressant for my anxiety.",
