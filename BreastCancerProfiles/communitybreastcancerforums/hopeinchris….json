And when I ask friends how they are they say something like, \"whatever is going on with me is nothing compared to what you're dealing with, I want to hear how you're really doing\". I want to say... No really, let's talk about your regular, every day problems for a while because I'm sick of talking about the latest in my cancer saga when nobody really understands anyway. I've been experiencing double vision with my eyes. It makes it really hard to do much of anything a lot of the time.",

My onc wants to start me on intraventricular chemo with Cytarabine, methotrexate, and thiotepa. I've been told the side effects for this are minimal. I'm hopeful this is something that can be treated and controlled, but having only been diagnosed with cancer in October 2018, things have been a whirlwind since then. Everything I read about leptomeningeal seems so negative and I also want to focus on my quality of life. It all seems so overwhelming and my life has changed drastically in a period of months. To comment on what you ladies were talking about in regards to what to do to pass the time, I've also found painting to be very therapeutic, but I've been experiencing problems with my vision as well so I have to do it only for short periods of time. Anyway, I'm happy to know at least there are other people dealing with similar diagnoses and still trying to live life. I often find myself unable to connect with family and friends because people don't know what to say and I'm not able to accurately explain my feelings to them either.",

I do not have any kids in actually only 33 and single. I'm sure it's hard for your children. It's been hard for my sister, who's just 3 years older than me and hard on my closest friends. I don't know about you, but the only thing worse than getting that kind of bad news myself is having to tell the people closest to me. I'm sure it's even harder when you have children you're having to give that sort of news to, I can't imagine. Yes, my double vision started from the beginning and I also started having neuropathy in my hands and feet. I also have seizures now, but they put me on medicine that has helped that. Again, so sorry that you're also dealing with this, but it is nice to hear from someone who understands.",
