I'm still putting out more than 30 cc per 24 hour period, so they stay in a few more days. I reached last night over myself to get a pillow and it made me 'shreik' in pain from the left side from a sharp pulling sensation. I *sure* hope this gets better soon!",

Just a quick update: I finally went to work on 5/21 (as opposed to working on the laptop from home, which I'd been doing from 10 days after surgery) for 2 days, then came down with what I thought was a virus. It turned into a tubal-ovarian abscess? I had to go to 3 ER's to finally get admitted. It developed into a 102-103 fever, abdominal pain 10/10. Got a blood transfusion, put on various IV antibiotics and released after 6 days. I've been in bed ever since. I was told this had nothing to do with my BMX. I'm left wondering \"how did this happen??\" It's been 1 month and a day since my surgery. What a whirlwind since.",

The not-so-good: the drains still being in, where the drain heads seem to be located (in my underarm areas), the amount of gyrations it takes to find a comfortable spot on my side to sleep, the number of days I've been in bed, only pain meds I have 'snocker' me for too long to deal with the discomfort. I was told on my 1 week post-op to hold off on removing the drains, because I was still putting out more than 30 cc per side, and I agreed with this as I do NOT want fluid build-up and a complication or replacing drains. That was on Thursday. I was told that I can return ANY day and one of the MA's can remove my drains, so I don't even need an appointment, I can come in whenever the output is low. So, as you might expect, the output was low on Friday, but they only had a half-day, so I've had to deal with them all weekend, and I KNOW I am sore because of where the drains are lying inside my underarms. Sorry if it seems like I'm whining. Yesterday was my first day I actually felt 'sorry for myself' - and it's so not becoming. I know I'm incredibly lucky to have a relatively good prognosis and situation - but I'm ready to move on, and feel like I can't while my underarms are still sore, I can't put my arms down against me without tenderness and pain and I know if I could get these dang drains out, I'd be a lot more comfortable.  Well, you can all guess where I will be tomorrow morning - like camping out for concert tickets, I will be stalking the Dr's office to get someone to yank these drains. And then I'm going back to work! (hopefully) It's the first day of the summer semester, and I don't want to miss anything important.",

The walking around and being upright really wore me out. The swelling/numbness under my arms is also annoying. I don't mind being numb, but the full/pressury feeling and not being comfortable with my arms down is just about driving me crazy.  I have used ice packs, tried stretching, worn my binder at night, taken Aleve - but so far, I'm not overly impressed with how it's progressing.  Anyone else dealing with this?

I was afraid it would hurt, since they had been in for 12 days, but they didn't hurt coming out - it was psychologically relieving. The stitch on the skin holding it in was the only discomfort while it was being snipped - it was close to the skin, so the doc had to tug at it a bit to cut it. The doc described what I'd feel as it was being removed - which was quite comforting to me. For those of you who will get yours out - there's a bit of a \"pop\" feeling as the drain inside separates from the fibrin that it's clinging to - but there are no nerves in the fibrin, so you won't feel pain at this. Then, it slides out, easy peasy.  I also tried going back to work - planned on being there for a 1/2 day - found out I was there \"illegally\" since I hadn't gotten my 'clearance to return - FMLA\" form filled out. Ooops! So I'm continuing to work from home in bed on the laptop. Being there live, walking with others to lunch was EXHAUSTING - man,I guess ya gotta pace yourself! nibbana - I *love* your description - it's so what I've been feeling too - esp under my SNB side.   Hope all went well for you, sflgm, today!  Good luck to Butterflylady2012 & Fearlessfoot & PixieNel for tomorrow - let your surgeries be 'boring' for the team and peaceful for you! Good vibes out to the others on this week: dobie, Stormynyte, invisible2, Browneyes48 Fearless - try not to feel bad about the photos. All I have are phone photos of my \"girls\" - no chance to have artistic photos. I don't think I'd want to have 'nice' images of me before as it might make me sad. I'm looking forward to finding peace with how I look now (or will look once healing is done). We are so much more than two orbs of flesh, right? Hugs to all - have a good evening/night!",

The vicodin doesn't make me nauseated at all. I second the comment about the BIG button-all-the-way-down shirts. They sent me home in a 'tube-top' chest binder that velcro'd down the front (that two people have to put me into to pull it snugly enough). This was okay to wear, but it doesn't cover much other than the chest. I fortunately found a couple 1X Just My Size soft cotton blouses at Wal-Mart the night before my surgery, and I've been wearing one of those so far. It's got 1/2 sleeves, metal buttons and a pretty pattern. I took the binder off yesterday after my first shower, and have just been wearing the long shirt. I have only 2 drains, and I've been hooking them onto my cotton pull-up pants and sticking the bulbs into the two pockets on the pants. Of course, I have to hold them when I go to the bathroom, but otherwise, they are behaving being attached to the waistband. It helps that my drains are entering my body below where my breasts were in a downward orientation - so I have a lot of slack.",

Flamom - yes, I had my SNB at the same time as my BMX - they accessed my nodes through the incision they made for the BMX, so I don't have separate 'incisions' - and the swelling/pain is at least 2 inches above the incision line - right in the crook of my armpit. It's so freakin' annoying that I'm tempted to take a Vicodin (which I've been off since last Saturday).  Maybe I will get some info tomorrow on how to deal with this - hopefully! My other update - I've been showering since the 1st day post-op due to a large tegaderm dressing (big clear tape sheet across whole chest). At the end of my shower today, I pressed the towel to my chest and had grey/green fluid spirt out from the top of my dressing. Apparently, the dressing puckered open and filled with shower water. Oops! Called the doc's ofc and got the ok to remove the dressing (a day early). My incisions look okay, but are the slightest bit 'weepy'. My drains are still in place and they are still securely covered. Just hope this doesn't turn into anything infectious.",

Not exactly the 'send off' for the 'girls' I was envisioning, but I'm glad I don't have a hangover this morning, either. It's strange - with all the well-wishes and \"can I do anything\" offers I've gotten, and I didn't get any of those folks to come out and have fun with me - I was left a little disappointed. Which leads me to my next thought - other than my BFF and my parents - I don't really think any of the other offers to help are anything other than folks to have something to say to someone who's delivering disturbing news. I don't blame them or hold anything against them whatsoever - but it's just an observation. I share this with all of you so that in case you have a flood of \"let me know what I can do's\" or offers of help - don't be too surprised if they just well-intended words without follow-through. I *do* think if I did really need something and could say a concrete task to any one of a dozen folks in my outer circle, I'm sure I'd get it, no problem.

Here's my run-down: The day was long yesterday - got to the surgery center at 10am - the nurse took me back to pre-op, gave me the scoop, and I waited to go to Nuclear Med. Was supposed to go at 11 - but the tech was backed up - so I didn't go until 12ish. That smarted a bit on the prophy side - the naughty side took it like a champ. Got my IV, then got some pepcid, zofran and decadron - the decadron made my 'bottom' burn a bit - weird sensation - but it subsided quickly. Got the low-down from the Anesthesiologist about the paravertebral block - wasn't too keen to hear one of the potential complications, but I still wanted it as it was going to help me with my pain over the next 24-48 hours. Then got the news that my doc was held up at the other hospital because they added a 2nd case onto him which backed us all up. There was another patient there at the surgery center before me - I understand her procedure was going to be quick (not sure what it was tho) but even still - he should have been there by 1:30 and didn't get there until 3:30. My case time was to start at 2:15, so needless to say the wait was looong - thank God I brought my tablet and could watch Netflix! Once the doc got there, anesthesia could start - they gave me some versed, I remember tucking my head down onto the chest/belly of the nurse in front of me, and my next recollection was being told to open my eyes in recovery! It was 6ish at that point. I was the last case, so I could sense the slight impatience on the part of the recovery nurses. I had to be assertive in reporting my pain which was creeping up - and got some dilaudid (thank goodness!). My parents and BFF were allowed back with me then - and the doc came to look and talk to us.I lost a bit more blood than typical - about 500cc - but I'm okay. The only nausea I got was getting into the car, but nothing came up - just a little queasy. Walking and standing upright just made me feel a bit tight, but pain at bay due to the meds at this point. Slept pretty well in my bed - a little tossing and turning - a lot of pillows, but not bad - just sore. I went in first thing to see my doc for a post-op inspection - got reminded to milk the drain tubes and was told the swelling under my arms should go down. I have a water-proof dressing on, so I am free to shower when I feel like it, and I got the go ahead to eat whatever I wanted. My one \"hiccup\" in my opinion - I have felt this really SHARP transient pain under my Right arm (the CA side) - wasn't sure the cause - but I felt it a few times when using that arm. After coming home from the Doc's office - I diligently milked the drain tube, and it caused a LONGER version of this pain - OMG! Made me curse and grab my friend's arm too tight before I realised it. So, now I know it's associated with the positioning of the drain tube inside.  So glad yesterday is behind me - and hoping everyone else who had surgery yesterday is feeling little to no pain! Here's to healing! -Val",

Plus, it is better to have the bulbs attached to your top and not your pants, esp if you have to run(ok, walk or crawl) to the bathroom. Smart thinking on that trick! Pain meds - for those who've had surgery so far, how are you doing with pain meds? I'm tempted to try to stop the Vicodin today - I'd love to be off of them if I can, or at least stretch them out. Yesterday, my Post-op day #2 I took 1 Vicodin every 4-6 hours. I even woke up @ 1130pm after having fallen asleep at 930pm NEEDING to take one due to some moderately high pain. Now I'm up this morning, last dose was 1130pm last night, and I'm not feeling like I think I need one. I would also like to be able to poop again soon :) ",

I can relate to your feelings of wanting to be in charge, organized and be in control but knowing that I'm going to have to hand some of that over to others. I want to start cooking and freezing food, buy supplies and make a calendar to sign friends up who are offering to help - and I don't even know when or what is going to happen in my treatment yet! Trying not to be crazy about it is hard. Wishing none of us needed this place, but so glad it's here!",
