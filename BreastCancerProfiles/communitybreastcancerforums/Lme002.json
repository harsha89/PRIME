I hear DCIS being thrown around from time to time in my appointments, but a lot of times what I am reading is that most cancers are found before they get to the point I'm at.

What I was trying to say is that on my core biopsy I believe all of the samples (8) came back benign and from the little that I have read on here and other places it seems that most of the time anything that was cancerous was diagnosed on the needle core biopsy. This puts me a great deal at ease that they WILL NOT find anything serious when they do the excision, and I was just wondering if anyone had an experience that contradicts my line of thought on that? I think I'm just getting a little nervous about it all and am looking to reassure myself as much as I can and try to keep as positive as I have been...... Thanks again for your info.

Hurts a bit of course and they took out more than I thought they were going to. When I went to radiology for the wire insertion, the radiologist said something about the imaging center seeing some distortion on the initial mammogram (?) and they wanted to make sure they got that area as well as the area where the clip was placed during the core biopsy. I thought it was the same but the surgeon showed me the film and it looked like two seperate areas to me. Either way they told my family that it all went well and that pathology said they have what they need. My BS is going out of the country next week but he me told I could call about next Thursday and if they have any results that I could get them from his Nurse Practitioner. Interesting thing is that all my stitches are on the inside and I have no bandages; not even steri strips They closed the outside with surgical glue? I'm hoping that means less of a scar because from what I can see (haven't taken my sports bra off yet) the incision looks kinda long. Anyway thanks for all your well wishes everyone! Ma.....I will call or pm you when I have more info. Simplify...how are you doing? cweedgirl...good luck next week! Booksrule...thanks for all your well wishes!

I did get a copy of the radiology report from my doctor and it reads as follows: Pathology and imaging have been reviewed. Pathology demonstrates features consistent with radiologic impression of complex sclerosing lesion with marked proliferative activity. Microcalcifications are noted. PATHOLOGIC COMMENT: Biopsy showed marked proliferative activity with fibrocystic change, focal columnar cell change and extensive duct hyperplasia with a few areas borderline on atypical duct hyperplasia and one small focus of atypical lobular hyperplasia. Focal stromal sclerosis with irregular small ducts are noted. BI-RADS ASSESSMENT: 4 - SUSPICIOUS ABNORMALITY Whatever all that means!!!! Oh and it says they used a 9 gauge hologic vacuum-assisted device and 8 samples were obtained from a lateral approach?? They also placed a clip in there at the time they did the biopsy.",

Anyway the surgeon doesn't seem OVERLY concerned so I will choose to remain calm, relaxed and zen like until somebody tells me I have something to worry about!",

      "Content": "Lme002 wrote: Hi everyone, I am kinda new here and not really sure what to think right now. But here's what I've been dealing with: Back in July I went for my Mammo (it had been six years). I have been getting them since I was 30 and my Dr. found a lump during a checkup (was nothing) and I am 44 now. Anyway, a few days later I got a note in the mail from my Dr. along with a script for a diagnostic mammo as they saw something abnormal. I went for the diagnostic and they saw the same thing again on mammo but nothing on ultrasound which led to LOTS and LOTS more mammo pics that day in all kinds of positions. It was then decided that I needed to have an MRI. They saw the same weird area on the MRI so I was scheduled for an MRI guided biopsy which went pretty smoothly. The next day the radiologist called me and said that I had a 'Complex Sclerosing Lesion' and that it needed to come out. She recommended a breast surgeon that I now have an appt. with on Tuesday. I guess my question is... is this something I should really be overly concerned about?? And what should I expect to come from this surgery? Is surgery really necessary? Any and all info/opinions/etc.. are greatly appreciated!   Lisa Log in to post a reply",

I did get a call from the surgery coordinator yesterday at work because they wanted to make my follow-up appt a half hour later than it's originally schedule for so I took the opportunity to ask her a couple of questions: 1. Will the surgeon be able to tell me ANYTHING tomorrow after he removes it? Answer-no unless he sees something drastic that also needs to come out, they will have to wait for the pathogy. 2 - Will someone call me if they get results prior to my follow-up? Answer - Yes we can call you if you would like us to. WTF???? OF COURSE I WANT YOU TO!!! 3 - Can I call you 3 or 4 days from now to see if you have any results? Answer - Yes but I will only be able to tell you that we have them. I won't be able to discuss them with you. You would have to wait to speak to the surgeon or his nurse and sometimes we don't even get the results until the day prior to your follow-up. Ugh.......more waiting. My follow-up isn't until Nov. 1st. And guess what? The surgeon goes on vacation Monday for 2 weeks.",

I did not find the procedure itself painful at all. The radiologist (female by the way) was acutely aware that I was fearful of the procedure and she took her time to make sure I was comfortable throughout the entire thing, even when she was numbing me up she would't go any further until she was sure I didn't feel anything. I felt absolutely nothing after I got the lidacaine. I too experienced some pretty severe bruising afterward and would suggest that you ice it as they tell you to (I did not) and try to wear a very supportive bra for the first day or so. So good luck!! And know I am wishing you good results!! Keep us posted. ",
