A lump has since been found with what may be a second lump next to it so I am now having the lumpectomy... approximately an old film cannister size was to be removed, so now its that plus a lump or two. Though I am no stranger to surgery, this will be my first breast procedure.... It is starting to get scary!",

I just know it is not, I was sure it was just a cyst but my surgeon assures me it can not be a cyst. So im sure its just a papillona. I am standing tall (funny since im only 5\"2) and saying \"it won't happen to me!\" I know that its usually those that say it wont happen that it does happen to but its exactly like you say, I just know! My dr told me that I need to be open yo the possibility that it is something malignant but when I tried to rationalise that it might be cancerous, I feel like a fraud, like its a dramatic over-reaction and I sound like a hypochondriac! I just know.... well I will soon!",
