I had 48 hours of wondering how many more holidays would I have with girls!  And crying because the baby just turned 1 ten days ago. Today was my dad's birthday and I got the greatest news of my life!  A chance- no not a chance !  A first class ticket to kicking cancer ass and after that 48 hours of hell I am ready! I started chemo Wednesday and it went very well!  My plan is 12 weekly taxol and then 4 FAC every 3 weeks then radiation under arm and chest were nodes all were. I only had an upset tummy at 5 a.m. Basically 12 hours after my treatment.  But as life would have if I started my cycle once I got back to my hotel room lol! Remember I started the day before my Dmx lol!! Really?  It is just comically!  So, I had 3 scoops of chocolate ice cream when in I got back too.  The ice cream might have no been smart since they warned about cramps and diarrhea.  Oh well- next time live and learn!  I will be checking in often here! pipers best of luck!  Don't google anything;). ",

This week will tell. Monday, my oldest, Emery and I went to go get our hair cut.  I had very long hair.  It stopped right under where bra strap meets on your back.  Emery's was longer. I cut 14 inches to have a boy hair do;) Emery had a above shoulder bob and cut 12 inches.  Sending the hair off the Pantene to make wigs for some other people facing this monster!  I figured that my days were numbered before it started to fall out. What a Waste when someone could use that hair!  All it would do for me is cause me emotional pain when it came out.  I hate my hair cut so I'll be ready for it to fall out.  Already got a cute Jon renau wig and order another longer one.  Ordering cotton caps and sleep caps whatever!   I  bad about checking in and then I type forever sorry!  But to answer the question- Eloise (LuLu) is a lot better now!  I just left them with my sister for the next two nights while we head to Houston.  Right now she is getting more teeth:(. Since my surgery 11/20 the baby has gotten 6 teeth!! She has 4 back teeth and 4 top and 2 bottom.  The side bottoms got to be coming.  Boobs and teeth are the family focus right now lol! Everyone have a great holiday!  Stay warm;). Glad to see this year go.  And ready for New Year's resolutions and 2014 which is going to be a miraculous year for us all!",

It was very red because I didn't notice when I was rubbing it on things.   I am home for two days then have to drive 6 hours again, spend the night, chemo in morning and then drive 6 hours home.  My DH is calling tomorrow morning to see if MD Anderson will let us have the chemo closer to home and come in for the dr visits.  Although, if they get weird about it, it's just 14 weeks.  Sucks but I like looking at it that way.  14 weeks- countdown.  ",

Flax!  I am a bad eater.  I know this has to change.  I have been doing better!  I bought Kashi bars, cookies and cereal to start.  Baby steps:). When you know every fast food menu by heart it is baby steps!  Flax is one of the main ingredients in the cookies.  I eat one a day:).  Soy- verdict still out on this one.  Some say yes and some say no:(. I had just become a big edamame fan the last 5 years.  Oh well!  I thought that was fine, but I guess eating them as my meal was not.  Moderation is not my friend.  You should see me around chocolate! Alcohol- here is one that I have given up.  Well, until football season most likely. Dr says one drink for women.  I haven't had one since this started- miracle considering the stress.  And, to be completely honest I was a smoker too.  So, the two went hand and hand.  If one went, the other had to go too.  I had no problems with it though!  That was a blessing.   I have finished my Taxol chemos (12).  Did great!  Not big SE's except a little tired  Sometimes, hair loss, and weight gain.  The weight I believe is a combo of the steroids and not working.  I weighed 92 before, so not 102 which sounds like a better fighting weight.  Remember I am almost 5 feet so don't panic on me about that weight.  Lol! I get an ultrasound Wednesday that will tell me if taxol helped that internal lymph node.  please!!  I am getting into the big bad chemo this week!  FAC. But, only 4 more to go.  Rads- yep and probably 6 weeks.  My cancer was quite mean.  But I am here!! I went to the nutritionist at MDA and she was no help!  Basically told me everything I knew.  I wanted her to say eat this and not that, but they just don 't know.  Annoying!  One thing she did say was no deli meat unless Boar's Head or this new Hormel that has no additives and preservatives in it.  MDA only serves Boar's Head because of that.  No wonder it was always so good and cost more!   So happy to catch up and sorry my main menu didn't mark this page!!  So annoyed that I missed out on weeks:(. Glad everyone is doing well.  ",

Then she asked why I did both. Um really then said it didn't help that still had a 40% chance cancer returning. She was just not a happy camper. Later that Wed met surgeon who also questioned surgery. That I expected coming from a surgeon! Then the surgical nurse. Came in and she rocked! Agreed with getting them off said she had no idea where the oncologist got that 40% from and she made me feel better. Surgeon came back in and wanted to look at morelymph node and make sure they got them. So- Wednesday was a bust, Emotional wreck came back to room and cried.",

I have looked at her credentials they are phenomenal and I had decided that she is basically a unsociable geek. If anyone watches big bang theory I am dealing with Shelton. Shelton is a pain but Shelton is brilliant so sometimes you have to listen to him. So that's basically my new nickname for my oncologist although she's a girl but I'm basically calling her Shelton and makes me understand that the geek in her wants to find out all the research answers and she is very robotic and doesn't know how to relate personally. As for my surgeon which I did not know this until I googled which maybe I shouldn't have but at least now I know. She is an advocate against surgery before chemo and even have an opinion on Angelina Jolie's double vasectomy she said that her case was genetic and she understood it however it would calls for an overkill in the community. Yeah that's just great because that was published in like the New York something newspaper and I was like great because that's my surgeon who was also mad that I had surgery before seen her now that makes sense. Again I just see them as geeks and they are brilliant at what they do and they just want the best and to be the best so I will ignore it I'm going back Wednesday and that will be the results of everything and I am terrified. Pipers- stay the course bc according to MDA they like chemo first then surgery! I think it all depends on what stage in grade and all that you might be. For me I'm not comfortable with having to wait at this point before any scans come back I was already stage III A seven out of nine nodes and they found another one while ithere and I know it's cancer I'm not to be silly and pretend that it's not. Grade 3/3 as well and my Ki67 was 68% which means aggressive cancer. I just have faith that God made everything happened so fast because like June said it is crazy and everything happened so fast but it happen for reason and there is a reason it happened to have to faith! So I leave you with my cancer saying it's been my motto and people have already given me a bracelet and necklace with my saying that motivates me! Maybe it will motivate you too!! \"just keep swimming\"",

The only cancer I \"have\" in my body now is a lymph node mid chest they found at MDA.  That node under my arm that always swelled with pregnancies was over 4cm!!  One node!  I hated that node my whole adult life, but I think it saved mine!! It held on to a lot and didn't let it spread as much as it could! Stages don't really matter under 4.  I mean you can be stage 0 or 1 in situ and need no chemo and be done after surgery.  That was my original dream;)  Then last week my dream was for the femur to be negative so I wouldn't be stage 4 bone mets!  I'll take my second dream answered and be thrilled.  What a relief that was last Friday to hear that news. I just finished second dose of taxol.  Tummy ache hit me after we are dinner.  It usually is one potty issue and that is all. Just be honest in case if anyone else gets on taxol.  Day 2 is usually fine. Day 3 the aches come and I was in bed Day 4.  Day 5 up and fine.  I'll track this week and see if it follows the same pattern.  2 down 10 more to go:(   Then, the big 4 FAC treatments.  Get it all!!  ",

I think some people might benefit from my experience so far in what I have heard or overheard people TRYING to help say:). I am trying to be blunt, but you know me- you will probably laugh at these because you will hear my voice saying it:). My personal top ten in no order just random thoughts in my brain. 1. Do not bring up the fact that we could all go at anytime. Yes, technically that is true, but are you waking up everyday with the Grimm shadow over your shoulder? No, if you went, you would be blissfully unaware. Unfortunately, this is not the same. Don't say it. It only makes us see red. 2. Do not reference your great flu of 2008 and how you overcame it. It is not the same even if you were hospitalized for dehydration. 3. Do not bring up anything you read or saw on the internet, Dr. Oz, or the Doctors type shows. These things are either not true or they are paid to say them. Seriously, people in my situation have a specialist team of doctors already who are not on tv. 4. Do not ignore or down play what is happening. The \"aw they'll be alright\". As I believe this for myself, trust me I see people everyday at MDA who are not \"alright\" however their friend sitting next to them is acting like this is a trip to a mall. Warning- I could also have a bad day lol. So I guess it is safe never to say this quote directly to me lol. I might go all kaboom if it was a frustrating day! 5. PRAY. Tell them you are praying and do it. This is the most inspirational thing you can do at all. We feel it- Trust me! That should have been first but I was thinking of what not to do lol;) 6. If and only if you have personally faced the Mortality Mountain, share your story with your friend. I said you. Not your great aunt twice removed on your father's side. If you were in a situation where the odds were not in your favor of being on the Earth much longer- share it. That is very uplifting. I look at my dad who has faced this mountain too many times to count and has spike a victory flag on top of it each time. I have his blood. But, free climbing this kind of mountain is scary and dangerous- Only professional advice needed apply. 7. Watch over their loved ones, especially if they have children. Make sure not to have any conversations that those little ears can over hear that might frighten them. They know what is happening. They don't need more anxiety accidental overhearing something that Oprah said about what their parent is going through. be upbeat a distraction. Do not ask how their parent is. If they want to talk about them, listen. I mean really listen. Stop what you are doing and listen because for a child to start to talk about parent in a situation is big. You are having a moment with them. And they trust you so listen. 8. I guess you should check on the spouse. Probably. Lol! They won't talk like the kids (if they are male), but listen if they do. If Spouse if female, Be there because she is gonna want to talk a lot about what is happening all the way around;) 9. Do not expect personalized thank you notes. I wish I could sit down and write them. First, medication does not allow me to remember many that came and helped the first few weeks. Second, there is just so many at any given time to thank. Know in your heart that it is appreciated whatever was done, and it made a difference that day for that family. These situations all southern grace is thrown out the window. We are in survival Mode. Do accept a wide thank you that is sent out by family, email, or a FB post. Side note- personally I wish I could do this, but someone would get forgotten and we all know what would happen if one got a card and one did not in Monroe, LA lol! Just know you all are loved and appreciated dearly. 10. Specifically for women in head trauma or cancer: HAIR. Do not ask when it will come back, how it will come back or \"are you going to lose your hair?\". We are fighting for our life people. It is just hair. That is what hats and wigs are for- let it be. Sidenote- personally, you know I will rock any wig any color anytime. However, I overheard this conversation on the chemo floor and it bugged me. A wife of a patient was bothering a female patient about her hair. Did it come back the same color, Texture etc. The patient was annoyed but politely answered. Then the lady goes on to talk about her niece who had breast cancer. And how her hair came back etc. It was at that moment I knew I needed to write this post. I needed at least my friends and family to not be the idiot in a hospital heckling other patients or their loved one lol. I hope this helped. I hope you weren't offended and if you were: you are guilty of something on my top ten! Insomnia has given me the time to finally write this out. Round four today: hoping not to overhear more! If I do, I'll let you know. I should start a list of dumb things said at MDA:). Happy hump day! Just Keep Swimming!!",

I have an internal lymph node that is positive (close to my lung). It will require some specialist to operate the radiation procedure.  I met that doctor and love him!  He was the first one to say I was going to beat this and was confused why I asked.  I explained about the bone scan and he said that he read about that.  I also asked if they would continue to scan to make sure it hasn't spread.  Again he said yes.  I like him more than my oncologist:).   This means I will be in Houston 5 days a week for radiation:(. We were hoping that part could be done at home.  Of course I have to be special lol!  He did say that I was smart for coming there.  That they knew what and where to look and that this is hardly found elsewhere.  Which means- it would have spread and come back tragically.  So scary but so happy I followed my gut and did everything so fast.  What I had In me needed to come out!  And blessed they found the node!  Remember though most cases do not require fast action.  Mine did.   K- I am sorry about your dx:(. We will try to help you out in anyway possible.  We are all going through this, but different paths which makes it so interesting!   Red- so jealous!  I will have a three weeks off between FAC and radiation.  I plan on seeing some waves then.  We are also planning a Disneyworld trip for next May.  We are huge didn't people and it has been 3 years since we went last.  I mean my daughters and I are Disney!  DH just trails along:). But now we will have a new princess to take.  All three girls will have had there first Disney trip at 2 1/2 years old.  And my middle one, Ellison, will be graduating kindergarten on her birthday that May.  We will skip the last week of school (the older daughter, Emery, and me that is) and beat the summer crowd before Memorial Day:). Something to look forward too! June- thinking of you too!  I just keep thinking every week is one week closer to this being over:) Pipers-  sending positive thoughts for a peaceful recovery!

It transitions between all the pics and all. Then, you can add your own music to play during the slideshow movie you made. I LOVE IT! I have been playing on it all day working on a slideshow for my FB and blog page after my last chemo. Y'all- talk about cool and very emotional! When I put all the pics in with the music even my husband was like that was so good and emotional. It is not finished because my last chemo is the 14th, but what a tribute to what I have been through since late October. Really check it out, you won't be disappointed with what you can make! Second- last night I was up from 1-5 am worrying about stuff none of us can control you know! I got a message at 3 am from parent who I have known for 13 years. Taught her youngest kindergarten, then coached her in cheerleading. She is loaded first off! So, she tells me how she won this trip to Cabo at this resort Espap something which is so so fancy. Well, she can't go and her husband and her want my DH and I to take it! They said they would even pay for our flight. She said everything was included and the room could have up to 8 guests but no kids because they are not allowed. We invited our best friends (wife and DH set). The wife has driven my girls to school everyday since I got sick. They have helped us more than anyone even family. This was an awesome way to thank them. So- I am going to Cabo the last week in August which is one month after rads. So blessed!! I have never been out if the country!! Can you believe?! What a gift!",

Has a BDM Nov 20 and the surgeon said go to MDA ASAP when the drains came out. They came out Monday I went MDA Wednesday. First day I cried my heart out because the oncologist and surgeon both made me feel like an idiot for have surgery although that was the immediate recommendation of MJ breast center. I have never felt so down in my life! I have a 9, 4 and 1(just turned 12-10-12) daughters. I just want to live! And they made me feel horrible for it following their rules of chemo first then surgery. Questioned why I did both since left had no signs. Again- I was in survival mod and what does it matter now? They did bone scan , X-ray, ct, and ultrasound on my arm to make sure the surgeon of the lymph nodes. Then they checked around my neck and saw nothing suspicious. But, right under collar bone on the right there was one. Fine needle came back suspicious cells. That was my last 10 minutes at MDA after all 3 days last 10 minutes basically said you still have it. Just praying no mets. Every news has been bad. I don't think I can take anymore bad news. I am going to contact the counseling services at MDA immediately when we arrive next week no matter what the outcome may be. So yesterday we drove 7 hours home and climbed in bed with my 9 and 5 year old and held them and cried and cried. They were asleep. My baby is at my sister's 4 hours away with RSV so I can't get her!! Hopefully we will be done Thursday and I can go get my baby and then go home with any just any kind of good news. So- Tang! Sorry for the long vent! I understand completely! I am losing my mind as well;)",

Even though she was my mom's age, and she would treat us that way, she was my friend.  It wasn't breast cancer and it happened so fast. She was dx 3 weeks after me a reoccurance and it was just one lymph node in her neck -Hodgskins. Chemo wasn't a friend and it grew to the size of a golf ball. Radiation. Caused more SE's feeding tubes.  And then she went I to the hospital a few weeks back and got a stint in her kidney.  Did better, started eating.  But never came out.  Yesterday, my DH called at 8 am as I was getting dressed in my hotel room for dr and chemo. He told me the news.  Stunned.  Now I can't go to the service because I can't be in a group until after day 12.  I am so sad for her family and our community.  This is so hard! Losing people while you are fighting.  It is like a knife to the heart.  This was the fifth person I knew or knew family of since I was dx:(. Sorry to be a downer.  Just expressing it all here.  Good news- I only have two chemos left!!!  14 down and 2 to go!  Can you believe I have had 14 chemos!  That is crazy!  Still doing well.  Dr said if I get mouth sores that bad again they will lower my dose.  I said no. She said she understood why I said that, but hey had to keep me safe.  Mouth sores can lead to infections and put me in the hospital-  I did not take it that serious. I am going to pray and eat as little as salt as I can.  I had movie popcorn and the first sore came the next day- hmmm right.   Red and Pipers- Love and Light and super HuGS!!  ",

However, I teach every child in the school. I also coach 3 cheer teams. I had to resign last Friday from my oldest team. That was so hard:(. I just need the kids to see me ok. When a 5th grade boy came up to me after Mass, he hugged me and choked out I'm sorry. That killed me! No! I will bounce back and these kids will see how cancer is not going to bring me or their prayers down. So, using all my little minions as inspiration. My three girls first and then all the rest of them. I am scared of the chemo, getting sick and losing weight. Those fears are constant. Hoping to find some good advice on how to stay as healthy as possible during chemo. Diet, exercise whatever. I know I am the one who is sick, but it is not just about me. It's so much about my family. It's after 2 am, I have been doing this for over a week now. Waking up 2-4 am. Fun. Reminds me of when I was pg with my first. Anxiety I guess. Sorry for the long post.

I opted for double mastectomy and these reports come after. Cancer only in right side but heck take left too. Relieved I did since it was aggressive. However, looking on the boards here has got me freaked. Most high ki 67!opted for immediate chemo and did surgery months after. I just have to have faith that I was right that everything happens for a reason! 1.11-11 Day one was only suppose to be ultrasound on lump and ended up being mammogram the a biopsy cancelled and Dr. Said let's do this now! Alone and clueless did a triple core needle biopsy with no one with me. 16 shots later I drove to a sonic had a route 44, put an ice pack on my Tara and cried. 2. 3 days later 11-14 the news 3. 11/18 surgeon and plastic surgeon meetings WHAT! Both that fast - prayers I swear y'all 4. 11/20 day after my bday bilateral masetotomy and reconstruction with expanders. I call the ziplock bags lol! Ok! So how in the world did my surgeon and plastic surgeon both had openings two days later?? They are the BEST IN TOWN! Both men said if not then it would have. Even like this week or mid to late December. 9 days after biopsy I am having surgery and he removed all lymph nodes. Heading to MD Anderson Wednesday the 11th exactly a month from the biopsy! Praying for clear scans and great team to line up a kick ass killing cancer chemo. I will have chemo even if it is all gone with surgery bc those tiny cells could be hiding somewhere! I hope we did the right course but it seemed to fall into place so easy it must be a plan! Drains will come out Monday! And maybe stitches. Dr did a great job! I was surprised! Itbhas been painful. Right arm where nodes are gone has limited movement . Get better but feels like imam doing leg splits when I reach for something with that arm. Kids are adjusting but leaving them this week will be rough. MD says you can be there for five to seven days. Great!! Kind of vague she you have kids. But this is a first visit thing since they don't know what test they will run and all! I hope y'all are doing well! I have gotten better and probably only cry 2-3 Times a day quietly and then return to my day. I do fear I am still in denial and it won't hit me that I have Cancer until we get to MD on Wednesday. Anyone else like that? Sure take mt tatas I have drains and stitches but not cancer! Not until I am in that hospital and they say you are Stage 3a(at least that is what I am no:( if no mets) and you need chemo and yada yada! Until then, my brain says I just had the worse boob job that hurts like a :;$(&@!! And I didn't get new boobs but ziplocks lol!! Stay in good spirits! Cry when you need too, but get pissed! Who is this cancer and who does she think she is coming all in my life and take my health, time away from my family and MY HAIR! What a bitch! We gotta take her down girls!!

All my girls are doing great!  My oldest said the funniest thing today.  On Nov 14, she missed school bc she had strep and got a shot.  When you get a shot- you get a prize so that it isn't that bad.  Well we received the cancer news that afternoon and she never got her prize.  Today I heard her telling her cousin,\" I was gonna get that as my prize but then cancer happens so oh well no big deal!\"  I Laughed and said what did you say?  Then cancer came?  It was so funny and no big deal to her which means they are not scared!  I looked at my husband and said take her to the store for that prize!  I completely forgot;).   Just funny how kids see things.  Hoping we can all look back on this time and and say in a no big deal way and \"then cancer came\" AND WENT!!  ;)",

This year wasn't terrible until October.  This year I watched my newborn  go from rolling, crawling and walking.  I am blessed just pissed lol!  When I think about cancer, I see a mean woman.  I mean I see a bitch.  I really do visualize it that way.  And it makes me angry that anyone is trying to take me away from my girls!  I mean the baby just turned one.  Who in the hell??!? I see red.  I haven't lost my faith.  I haven't gotten angry at God- just cancer.  Every time I go to MD Anderson, I see all these people just like me or far worse.  There is just SO many people with cancer.  In my middle daughter's grade, there are 3 of us:(. Two dads and me all have a form of cancer. All of us have a 5 year old at the same school that only had 50 kindergartners!  One has chronic leukemia, one has lung which has spread to brain (non smoker who ran and was in excellent shape- some genetic I think) and me.  Crazy!  Then- after my dx on 11-14: one of my older neighbors had a lymph node in her neck, one of my sorority sisters has it on her tongue (non tobacco user) and our housekeeper the day before I found out that there was nothing on the bone X-ray, called us and said she had stage 4 liver and pancreas cancer and had 2-3 months to live.  Too much!   Good bye 2013!  You didn't do anything until the ending but you made up for the whole year. No one will miss you in my house. I can't wait to wake up tomorrow!  A fresh start!  A new year to conquer.  This year got me.  It took me by surprise.  I will not be fooled again.  I am making my own happiness and kicking cancer's butt on the way there! The end 2013-  you are over!",

They suspect the estrogen surge from being pregnant was the last push.  It was gonna happen.  The cells were there just waiting for the last price of the puzzle.  That is how I think about it.  There was nothing we could do.  The cancer was always there in a dormant state or not complete. Some never get that last item and we did. My Dr said it is called triggers and that I wasn't far off on how it happens.  She said it usually is 5 triggers.  But you can be born with 3 and gradually add the others. That is their theory.  Interesting!   I am very grateful for time.  I read a post online saying after you get cancer, you can decide who you will be: More on and forget the past- these people will pick up where they left off.  They will treat that part of their life like a bad dream.  Not talk about and move on.  She said they often get new jobs where people don't know they even had cancer.  They do not want to be known as the cancer girl. Inspirational- talk about their journey and try to help others.   Red- i completely get your open book thing.   I feel that way.  You want to know how it is going?  Sure, I'll tell you people but you ask lol.  That is how I feel too! Had 3rd taxol today.  Drove 6 hours to Houston, slept, blood at 7:30 and chemo at 9.  Drove immediately back 6 hours and made home for 5:30.  I did very well.  My tummy has not attacked yet like it does.  This is the round that people say the hair will go. I already cut my hair, but still have some.  I call Justin Beiber hair lol!!!  I will let you know when it goes;). I got my hat with hair ball cap.  It velcros to the inside and looks JUST like my hair I had.  It was long and I always wore it in a ponytail low that hung over my shoulder.   I type too much lol!   Pipers how are you doing?",

Round four down!  I am one third done with taxol at this point.  Hair still hanging on.  I kept telling myself that it will be this week. We will see! Today I wrote the most profound thing on my FB page.  My top ten things to not say to someone facing a critical illness, trauma, anything  that you could leave this Earth.  The response has been insane.  People are saying thank you for saying it. I have two friend with chronic ailments who basically admitted their illness and thanked me for my honesty.  It gave them courage to be honest as well.  I am going to put them on here for y'all.  Getting late now, but next time-  My top ten annoying traits and comments.  Maybe it will put a sweet smile on your faces:)",

My scans are Oct 7-8.  I am scared as hell about them.  I just had so much in me, but I gave it everything too.  Just need to breathe lol!  A vacation would be nice lol!  Someday!!",

My oldest DD had it too, and the two litt ones got the stomach bug. So glad that is over. I still don't think anything could put me in a bad mood at this point. I am just so happy to be celebrating this season off pain meds and drains lol! Especially off chemo and no cancer makes it wonderful. Looking back is harder than facing tomorrow for me. Tomorrow isn't scary like the last year. Blessed. June- hope you had a good trip! Red- do you have any trip plans coming up? Could not remember if you said you were planning something. One more week of school and then Christmas break!! Can't wait, but the kids are so wild right now at school- go figure right!",
