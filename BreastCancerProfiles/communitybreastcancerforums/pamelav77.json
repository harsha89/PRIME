I am also at the beginning. Jan 3, 2019 I learned I have Invasive BC and I am E+/P+,HER-2 Negative. The mass is 1 cm. Surgery in February. I have met with a few Drs in NYC and have to decide who to go with. Consults are all consistent so far - All have suggested a) lumpectomy, b) radiation and c) AIs or Tamoxifen. The direction of treatment may change if lymph nodes are involved and depending on oncotype. But radiation is in the plan. I saw a oncology radiologist who said there may be some retraction of the implant which may alter the size of the radiated breast and implant. He suggested it would likely be after a few months post radiation when fully healed of all surgery then I would see the difference if there will be one. He said there would likely be some change to the implant but minimized it. So I am seeing a few plastic/reconstructive surgeons next week to learn more about my options. Anyone else out there with implants pre diagnosis? - would love to hear your experience and suggestions regarding radiation and how you managed the implant decisions. Thanks. pamelav77",
