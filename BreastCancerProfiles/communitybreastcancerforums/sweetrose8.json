During chemotherapy my oncologist said that there are chances of nails developing black lines on the nails.  I thought that as my chemo ends the nails will quickly recover and get my beautiful clear nails back.. but unfortunately i haven't!! Sometimes it's more than difficult to stay patient!  Slowly the blackness is fading away of the fingernails and from the bottom going to the top as the nail keeps on growing- though slow growth.. But my toenails... no positive change, still black. I had first four drips of Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide. Then other four drips of Taxol (Paclitaxel). The first two in my guess was the cause of blackening nails. PLEASE! The ones who are reading, can you please suggest some care tips which has worked wonders for you in this situation? I've heard some supplements for nails, skin + hair are available to improve the condition but don't know how much true and beneficial it is? and is this blackening a permanent side-effect? (hope not!) Would be nice if some light is shed on this! Thanks ",

What did your oncologist/podiatrist say about your condition and did they help in anyway? That is NO WAY a common side-effect. Once again I wish your nail problems go away and you get beautiful nails ~Amen. Hmm yeah, will wait and see! Thank you!",

I don't feel friends with taxotere'' lol  So instead I got Taxol which in the case wasn't good for me as I was diabetic, but I tolerated it well, just had some allergic reaction but not very bad.  Yep you're right, wish you a radiant health~ <3",

I take 1) Nexium (for peptic ulcer) 2) Euthyroxine (for thyroid problem) 3) Diamicron MR + Trajenta (for diabetes) 4) Crestor (for high cholesterol due to arimidex) 5) Arimidex  6) Osteocare 7) Fybogel 8) Vitamin D 9) Vitamin B12 injections ..and during all these have changed many medication from one to other, have stopped some. Now, there would be a new addition  that is: Cipralex. It is an antidepressant recommended by my endocrinologist, just because that my heart rate has stayed quite high for many months after the end of chemotherapy and start of hormonal medicine Arimidex. He doubts it to be anxiety causing the high pulse rate. I AM A HIGHLY SENSITIVE PERSON, lol what else could be expected   But I don't feel like having it after having so many medications... and i'm scared of the antidepressant, it had so many scary side-effects listed. I don't know what would be better, to take or not to take? Please help, If someone's taking or has any idea do share. Thanks! ",
