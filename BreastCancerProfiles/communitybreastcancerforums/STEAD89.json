After having her showing me the location of the lump I examed her breast myself. It was as small, about the size of a pea, at that time also I notice that the nipple was also inverted. I thought maybe that could be causing the lump. She started her cycle when she was nine, so I didn't think it has anything to do with puberty. She also was not in any pain. We were able to get her into to see the Dr. on Wednesday the next day. The Dr. said that they felt the pea-sized lump and scheduled her for an ultrasound for Friday. We went to the ultrasound appointment, and after the tech had finished, she had the radiology Dr. to come in and talk to us. He stated that at her age he thinks it nothing more than a fibroid, however, he recommends we go back to our primary Dr. and request to see a Breast Specialist. So now we are waiting for the appointment to see the specialist. Everyone is telling me that we should seek an MRI which will show us if it is cancerous. My coworker stated she noticed a lump in her breast and she went to the Dr., and they said it was a fibroid and nothing to worry about. But the lump did not go away, so she persisted, and they accomplished a biopsy, and it came back negative. She said that the lump got bigger and so she heard that an MRI would give a 100 percent confirmation that it was not cancerous. She had the MRI, and the area lit up like the Fourth of July. So she is encouraging me to have an MRI accomplished. I would like to have the lump removed completed just to be sure. Would like to hear any similar situations regarding her age if possible.
