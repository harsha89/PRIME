      "Content": "Katie2811 wrote: About 2/3 weeks ago during my period I found a lump in my left breast. It's about the size of a quarter (or smaller it's hard to tell) and quite firm and feels a bit like an eraser. It moves around very easily and changes places slightly depending on the position I'm in but mostly stays on the left side of my breast unless i touch it. I found it while experiencing breast pain during my period, which is the same type of pain i have always had every month since i first got my period (a bit like a burning/stabbing sensation). This made me believe it could be a cyst which is why i waited for my period to end before seeing a doctor. Although the pain has gone away, the lump hasn't and I'm worried. As I'm currently in the process of joining the military I'm waiting until my physical exam next week to hear what the doctor has to say before I make a personal appointment. I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience or has any ideas of the cause/what it could be. I'm only 18 and my family has no history of cancer so I understand my chances are very slim. Here are some other detials which may help I guess: 1. The lump is smooth but feels as though it's beneath tissue as its size appears slightly different depending on whether i'm laying down or leaning forward. The surface also feels slightly like my other breast tissue. 2. Around the time i noticed the lump i have also had occasional pains in my left arm/shoulder. However since I lift quite heavy weights 4/5 times a week it seems more likely to be an injury as i also had tendonitis in that arm previously. 3. I have had no visible/other physical changes in my breast, and the lump hasn't changed in size. I would really appreciate if anyone has any help or advice while I anxiously wait to see a doctor. I don't think I have ever been this afraid in my life and this has been on my mind every second since discovering it. Log in to post a reply",

Since yesterday the pain/tenderness has returned in both breasts but it's definitely worse in the lump in my left. I'm taking comfort in this since it's also 3 days until my next period, so the pain is definitely linked with my cycle and I heard that this is not usually the case with BC. Hopefully I will know what it is soon",

I'm completely over the moon right now. Thank you for everyone's kind words. I send my love to the brave women battling this disease. How strong you all are. I do wish you all the best.",
