I had this terribly through my chemo treatments. I can remember thinking it would never get better but as time went on and my body healed from all the trauma, my sleep got better. I still drink magnesium/calcium at night like a tea before bed to help. I hope you get relief soon. Hang in there. Remember our bodies have gone through hell and our hormones are stripped to nothing and it all affects our sleep. :( Gentle hugs pink sis. You got this.",

I was diagnosed in my third trimester in 2014. We induced at 38 weeks, we started chemo the day my baby came home from the nicu (he was in there 2 weeks). We did dose dense AC x4 and then Taxol x3. Double mastectomy after that. I\u2019m writing to give you hope that we are both doing great 3 years later. Hugs ladies. I\u2019m here for any questions you might have. Xox",

For the group I had a few questions: I've been in the hospital since Monday with an infection they think cellulitis from my tissue expander. I've been on vacomicyn and zosyn trying to save the expander. My skin is slowly healing (began bright red and hot to the touch) and a culture was done which showed no organisms isolated. Dr wants to schedule surgery to remove expander Monday if skin isn't a lot better. Anyone have this experience and should I keep fighting to save it or let it go and be flat on that side for a few months? Thank you. :-)",

My BS came by yesterday to look as well and agreed that it is a tough call and can see why the PS has been trying to give it time. PS said he wouldnt put anything back in or leave anything in if I have surgery. He wants to clear it all out and then in 3 months explore my options. Sandra- How do you take care of your new wound and skin when it's just hanging there with no support? Also do you use a false boob for your bra? Thank you. :-)",

When we got the path report back it showed a complete pathological response nothing was left. Now I have the left tissue expander in and nothing on the right after removal for infection. This journey has really opened my eyes to so much for Breast cancer. I lived through watching my mother suffer through ovarian cancer when I was a child and to now live through Breast Cancer myself while raising my family brings the word survivor even nearer and dearer to my heart. To all of the ladies out there with breast cancer may you be strengthened in the moments you need it the most. My prayers are with you. Hugs",

Because infection was so bad he opted not to place anything in there to let me heal. He said we can try again in a few months. Thank you for your prayers and well wishes. Hugs",
