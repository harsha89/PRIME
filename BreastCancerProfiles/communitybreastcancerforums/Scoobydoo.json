Just popping in from the September 2009 and October 2009 threads to give you a word of encouragement as you begin this chemo journey.  While not fun, you CAN DO this!!! I have been through many SEs but thankfully there are over the counter meds than can help you get through each one.  Make sure you cherish your good days.  My good days normally come after day 7.  I am on a dose dense tx of 4 AC every two weeks and 4 T every two weeks.  I have just completed my last AC tx yesterday.  If there is anyone going on AC...make sure you ask your RN to slow down the cyotoxan to one hour instead of 45 minutes and take either 1000 mg of tylenol or sudafed PE and one 500 mg of tylenol to help combat headache and sinus pressure from the cytoxan. You can bring it with you and ask your nurse if it is okay that you can take it.  I normally take it 30 minutes prior to getting cytoxan. I am the biggest chicken in the world and if I can make it through, then I know you ladies can make it through.  The wait and fear of the unkown is worse than the actual chemo. If you have any questions feel free to pm me if I can help. I will be praying for you. Anita",

Regarding Neupogen.  I start my shots tomorrow.  My hubby will be giving me the shots and I am terrified.  I sure hope it doesnt hurt too bad.  I have to take them for seven days due to the fact that I still have an open wound.  Torona - Try some ginger tea.  Worked for me.  i am so sorry you are having a rough day today.  I pray that tomorrow you will feel better.  Hang in there! Okay yesterday went um not as good.  Had to have IVs twice.  First vein didnt work.  Get my port put in next week on the 29th.  Had extreme headache and sinus pressure with the cyotoxin.  When I got home the nausea and headache kicked in.  Ugh.  I tried the yellow pills (cant remember the name) for nausea and it didnt help.  My husband and mom ran out and purchased ginger tea and whala.  Nausea went away.  BTW I tried ginger ale first to no avail.  Then the dr. told me to take percoset for my headache (had some left over from last surgery) and it worked like a charm.  I felt like a new woman.  I had fatigue in both arms below the elbow.  That was weird. Today was a pretty .good.  The fatigue left my arms.  No headaches.  I did get a little nauseaus midday.  I drank more tea and had crackers.  My mom made a great meal to help with nauseausness.  She made butternut squash and ginger soup and a corn, potato and cheese frittata.  It was fabulous.  My eating has drastically changed.  I crave healthy foods.  So on one hand this has been good for me since I have a lot of weight to lose.  My appetite has gone down.  I know some say they have had an increase in appetite.  For me its been the opposite. Thinking of all of you women and thanks to everyone that was praying and thinking about me. Anita ",

In terms of my job I am basically working from home the entire time.  Because I work for the federal govt I have been entered into a voluntary leave transfer program.  Its where other fed employees can donate leave.  So far approx 10 weeks of leave has been donated to me.  So basically I take off 3-5 days after every treatment.  I do really miss going into work.  But with lack of mobility with foot I have not been able to go in. Well tomorrow is my 3rd treatment.  I really do hate chemo. Oh my onc decided to give me the regular flu shot the day of my first TX.  No probs from it...I think. Anita ",

Please keep us updated on how you are doing.  We are all in this together. Anita",

Sanaisa-  how in the world did our chemos match up?  My #4 is also on 10/29.  Last AC yay!!!!  My onc thinks the Taxatore will be easier on me.  It has been suggested for me to BRCA testing done.  I will talk to ONC to get this scheduled.  I want to know for myself and for my daughter.  I am adopted so I have no family history information.  BTW - I love your idea of dressing up as a nurse.  Oh and my foot.  I have a stress fracture and am now wearing a boot.  Did I say that already.

Onty - When is your first tasol/taxatore tx?  Are you feeling better from last tx of AC?  To me that was the hardest tx.  It is definitely cumulative. HopBird - I hope you are right and those cancer cells are being tricked.  Sorry to hear that you were first dx with node negative and then they found something later.  You seem to have taken that in stride and are focusing on beating this thing.  We will all beat this cancer beast!!! Sanaisa - where are you?  How are you doing?    Just thinking about you. Yesterday was my best day yet and I will hold on to this memory when I am going through my next tx.  I went to the movies to see Blindsided....excellent movie!  I really enjoyed spending the day with my family.  I took daughter to get her eyebrows waxed at the Red Door spa.  I just enjoyed my day.  I almost felt like I am not going through chemo.  I know on Friday I am back in the saddle again.  I also know that starting on Sunday I will be on percocet to stop that bone and joint pain.  But I also know that good days will be here again.  That is what will sustain me.  Anita",

But despite that she was a lovely lady who loved the Lord.  She would tell my mom how she was praying for me and my breast cancer.  I dont know about you ladies but if I live to 70 that would be awesome.  I have to change my life and the way I take care of myself.  I pray that this cancer never returns and there are no guarantees that it wont.  But for me not to do everything I can healthwise is being just plain foolish.  My DH is out of town on business and will return tonight.  We are expecting snow later today so I am off to walk my dogs and maybe make a quick run to the store before the crowd gets there.",

Not hungry.  But if you do not want or like to cook then this program is not for you.  I have to prepare each meal.  Have you thought about WW or something like that? I considered WW, but decided to try this instead. The tech was commenting on my wig.  She thought it was my hair.  It actually looks a lot like my own hair.  Onty- we seem to be getting our hair back around the same time.  China - you will soon see that hair appear. I didnt fully lose all of my eyebrows or eyelashes.  But I still have to use the eyebrow pencil. Jayne  - the numbness in my fingers went away weeks after I stopped taxol.  My feet...I still have some numbness but it is getting better all the time.  I still have some pain in legs.  Not everyday nor nearly as severe as with chemo.  Hair started back patchy, now the hair is coming in all over.  Give it some time.  I stopped chemo on 1/4. Today was a wonderful day.  I am feeling really good.  Went outside to do a little walking while my DD worked with DH with track. I wish you ladies a fabulous weekend! Anita",

Virginia - I have been googling honey dressings.  Sounds very interesting.  It is a bummer that I am starting chemo with an open wound.  I will ask onc and surgeon about the availability of honey dressings.  The hole in my breast seems to be getting smaller every day.  I am getting mentally ready to fight this thing.  My only concern right now is getting the flu, particularly swine flu.  I am on a pretty aggressive schedule and will be giving myself neupogen shots to up my WBC.  Is anyone else concerned about the whole swine flu thing? I have already gotten fitted for my wig, so I am pretty ready for that.  The lady who is doing my wig is a BC survivor.  It is a lace front wig, which is pretty expensive.  My insurance is covering half the cost.  However, this wig is glued on and is supposed to look realistic.  She will also shave my head bald before putting on the wig.  The chemo TX is supposed ot take out all of my hair around day 14.

However, I am starting to ice my feet and hands as they can help to prevent a recurrence.  One of the lesser-known side effects from chemotherapy is a skin reaction known as hand-foot syndrome, in which the palms of the hands and soles of the feet become red and painful, and the skin may peel, blister, or develop sores. The official name of this condition is palmar-plantar toxicity, though doctors may also call it erythrodysesthesia or erythema. It's much easier to call it by its common name, hand-food syndrome, which is sometimes abbreviated HFS. This condition isn't the same as neuropathy, which is nerve damage (also caused by chemo) and causes tingling, numbness, and a pins-and-needles type of pain. Hand-foot syndrome happens as a reaction to certain chemotherapy drugs. Chemo agents known to cause hand-foot syndrome include: Doctors don't know exactly what causes hand-foot syndrome, but it seems to occur when small blood vessels in the hands and feet break due to pressure or high temperature, allowing chemo drugs to leak into the tissues of the hands and feet. This leads to irritation and inflammation of the tissues.",

Hopbird - you are so right, while we all may get thrown back at frist when we receive bad news, we find a way to cope and face the challenge.  In your case, you are right, it was good that they found that node so that they could more effectively treat you with chemo.  We must all remain vigilant when it comes to sanitizing our hands and keeping them off our faces.  We are still suceptible of catching so many crazy illnesses or infections. Enjoying the temainder of my Sunday, although my skins just lost to Dallas.  Ugh I hate Dallas. ",

Onty- hmmmm.  I also wonder what that means.  Is there someone else you can ask?  I want a full heart eval when I am done with chemo and radiation.  Who knows what this is going to do to my heart.  I sure pray to the Lord that all will be well in the end. I have to finish up minor thanksgiving shopping and tonight and tomorrow I will be cooking along with help from hubby, daughter, niece and my sister in law.  Everyone is helping this time.  Normally its just me in the kitchen.  I am making a huge thanksgiving meal and real excited about it.  I feel good...I mean really good.  My tx is on Friday so I am going to cherish every good day.  I have my bloodwork done today to see how my WBC are doing.  I sure hope they are high enough to keep me from having to give myself neupogen shots.  It was sure nice to have a break from that these two weeks.  But if I have to do it then I have to.  No more complaining.

So I guess we can celebrate me finishing chemo next week.  For the ladies who are finishing in Feb/March time frame....time will fly by.  I know it did for me.  I can not believe I am almost finished.  Hang in there and we will be there for you to cheer you on across the finish line. Krcll- yes taxol can be cumulative.  Ask you onc if you can be put on neurotin (sp?).  It is a drug that reduced the neuropathy affects.  Since I have been taking it my fingers and toes have gotten a lot better.  I wish my onc started me on this med from the beginning.  It can drastically reduce symptons of neuropathy. Jayne - like I said time will fly by.  It is good you are getting taxol over a longer period with lesser doses.  I heard this helps reduce affects of neuropathy and other SEs like bone and joint pain.  I am having dose dense and it is hard on my body. Veronica- sorry to hear you are having a hard time on your med combo.  Two more to go....there is a light at the end of your tunnel.  Hang in there...Feb is just around the corner and you will be done with chemo!!!!!  Yay. Onty- so glad you are working from home.  I could not imagine it any other way.  I am glad to hear you had a wonderful Christmas. Anita",

Yes it will be a gradual change in our thinking.  My rad onc does not want me to lose weight during rads.  So I will maintain during the 7 weeks.  Going to see PT today to hopefully give me stretches and massages to help me prevent future cording and lymphedema.  I am ready to start rads on Tuesday.  Anita",

I had a wonderful Thanksgiving!  For a couple of days I was totally on a rush from decadron.  Had my 2nd taxol tx on Friday.  Starting to feel some bone and joint pain, but I am ready to start my percocet regime for a few days then slowly go to motrin.  No need to be in that kind of pain.  A little tingling in my fingers, but that went away last time after several days.  I am still taking B6 and L glutamine.   Onty- I am glad you are feeling better.  Does KRCLL still visit this page?  I havent seen a post from her in a really long time.  That is awesome you have a hubby that will do all that research.  My DH normally researching cancer fighting foods and SEs from txs to help me.  He is so wonderful and it sounds like your hubby is too. That is also really good news about your heart.  I am scared to have mine tested but I will because I want to start an exercise regime after chemo to lose this weight. Lisa- How are things going for you?  Did you have a nice Thanksgiving? Have a wonderful Sunday ladies! ",

Krcll - That is a good sign that you have no symptons of neuropathy.  I started getting symptoms after first tx.  So maybe you wont get neuropathy.at all.  Also glad to hear taxol has not been too bad on you.  It will be awhile until my life gets back to normal.  I do not even remember what normal was. Mrsb45- Thank you the encouraging information about your experience with rads.  That helps.  Also I had to postpone one of my txs due to low WBC.  It happens but I was able to get a couple of txs with low WBCs also.  You definitely will be out of that tunnel soon.  You are almost across that finish line for chemo.  You can do it! Lisa- I take it rads are treating you well.  You sound positively chipper. Janye - glad your first taxol went well.  Seems like a long way but believe me it goes really fast. Ladies. I pray my arm feels better and that the pain from this last taxol tx goes away soon. Anita",
