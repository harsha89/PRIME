I have the BRCA gene and had cancer in both my breasts with the left side being invasive with 8 lymph nodes involved. I was planning on having a preventative double mastectomy at age 35 as is recommended, however, here I am at 32 with breast cancer. I return to work in a work and hope to be able to work through chemo which I will start in about 2 weeks. Any suggestions on how to managing working full-time, being a full-time mom, and undergoing chemotherapy? ",
