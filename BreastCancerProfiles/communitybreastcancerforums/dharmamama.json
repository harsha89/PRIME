Both received additional radiation, surgery and chemo after their met diagnosis, and both have been NED for greater than 10 years. They never had long term treatment, but it seems like most stage 4 breast ca survivors remain on treatment even though they are NED.  A bit about me- I had stage 3 breast ca last year, and was diagnosed with a single brain met this year which was removed and the tumor bed zapped with cyberknife.
