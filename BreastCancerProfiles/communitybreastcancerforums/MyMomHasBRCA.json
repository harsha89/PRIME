Lump was very small, the size of an m&m..and margins were clean after lumpectomy.. She was to have 6 chemo Tx of TC..but only received 5..she became really ill after 4 and 5 and the dr felt that because of her response to the Tx...that 5 was enough and did not want her to have #6...Her post chemo physical exam and tests show no active cancer cells in her body..(again yeahhh)... She is being told that now she is to go on to 6 weeks of Radiation..5 days per week... We would like to know how many of you have not gone through with the Rads..
