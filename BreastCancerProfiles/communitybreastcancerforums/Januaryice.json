You could tell it was me as I was the only one in the chair with a big Smile on my face. As Onvacation stated (we were mostly on the same schedule) it is amazing how fast that time has gone by. Needless to say it was a rough couple of months. My OC decided to give me a reduced dose of Taxol this last time as I still had numbness in my feet. She was afraid of a long lasting problem and did not feel the reduction in dose would change reoccur rate. Just hope I made the right decision. Still on steriod high as you can see I'm up since three this morning but will crush later to day. Dreading the bad days 3 to ......... guess. BUT IT'S THE LAST ONE!!!!!!!!!! When did you ll get your ports out and did the RO want to wait for that to heal. I have my apt with him on the 17th and have lots of questions. Before then I'll do research and you all are my go to group. I must quote something I read on these boards at least once a day. Best wishes to all and hope each and everyone is having a great day!!",

I'm trying to come up with a list of questions for him. Anything special you're going to ask him? Open for suggestions. I also agree I have a lot of confidence in my ONC and just hope I feel the same about my RO. I only met him once when this journey started in February. All my other doctors have been female so I hope that would make a difference. There were only three male RO on the team and no females. Does anyone have a female RO? Hope everyone is enjoying their weekend!!!!",

Surgery and chemo behind me so I will also make it though this. I went on Thurs for my set up and it really was no bad at all. I was out of there in less then an hour. Monday will be a little longer then a normal apt as they do extra set up. I have 3 tattoos right now and will get an additional 4 on Monday. How funny that all these doctors are so different as I was told not to do any lotion at all until they tell me. My schedule is set for each week day and see RO every Monday. Option to see a nurse every other Thursday. How does this compare???? I also just got my letter from surgeon for my 6 month check up from lumpectomy in Feb. was told I needed to get MRI on both sides just to be safe. HOW SCARY IS THAT!!!! I haven't even started my Arimidex yet. That's set to start after finishing rad schedule. Hope everyone is having a great weekend!!!!!",

I've been in chemo since March and most of the time was following the March 2012 Chemo thread but also would try to keep up to date with your April/May 2012 thread. Lol I feel I know some of you ladies just by reading the posts. The support and love on these threads have made this journey much more bearable for me. Thank you!! I finish my last Taxol on July 5th and am scheduled to see RO on the 17th. I m sure he will start rads in July! I also believe I will have 33 treatments. Looking forward to helping each other get though this new phase of our journey back to normal life!!!",

Starting to feel more comfortable with what's going on. The unknown is always the hardest to deal with. One girl at rads that has actually gone though it, said to try to avoid wearing a bra if it rubs under your breasts. Mine did so the last couple of days have been bra less. Now I'm trying to find tops to go over my cami and try to also match my scarf. Can't wait to be somewhat normal again. I'm already set to get my 6 month MRI ... Please wish me luck. Needless to say always worried that something new will show. Wouldn't that be a bite in the ass!!!!!",
