Anyways many of you know me as I have been around since 2005 but then left for a very long time.  I was originally diagnosed stage 2, one node positive, er/pr negative, her2+.  Had bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction and my ovaries removed.  I was 55 y/o at the time of my diagnosis. Went through the whole 10 yards with dose dense chemo 4 rounds of A/C and 4 round of Taxotere.  3 months on Herceptin and had to stop because of heart problems. I actaully was doing pretty well and ready to celebrate my 4 years anniversary of NED.  Went for my usual 6 month oncology check up.  Even told the my ONC that I really thought I finally beat this thing.  I love pens from pharmaceutical companies and I remember that day I stole a Xeloda pen - just liked it cause it was big and easy to hold. 2 days later I get the call.  My tumor markers were up and that began my stage 4 journey.  Pet scans, MRI's.  My world all of a sudden became unside down.  I was told I have mets the day before my 59th birthday.  They made it sound so simple.  A small spot in your left hip and one intramammary node lit up. I had this terrible cough and pain on my side, thought is was a cold or a broken rib.  Chest x-ray showed pleural effusion.  Had a thoracentesis and they tool out over 600 cc of fluid.  It came back er/pr negative breast cancer mets.  So now I have pleural mets. My ONC started me on Xeloda (could kick myself for stealing that pen) and Tykerb.  All in all I have done well on it with very little side effects, well side effects are managed by Darvocet, but thats ok.  Each month my tumor markers went up especially the CEA and each month they increased my Xeloda.  I'm on 4,000 mg/day. I had a CT scan this past Saturday of the chest, the abdomen, and the pelvis.  My pleural effusion is back only it's bigger.  The mets are still there in my left femur.  But my relief was that the cancer had not spread to anymore places at least for now.  My ONC took more tumor markers and if they went up I was facing IV chemo once again. So today I got the results.  My CA15-3 went up a little and the CEA went up a little, but I got a little reprieve.  He said stay on the Xeloda for another month. I know so many of you and you can pm me if you haven't figured out who I am.  My heart was broken just like so many when you first hear you have mets.  I realized today I am getting used to this and it will be part of my life.  I'm a fighter, always have been and even though some days I get discouraged, I try to look at things different because well things are different now. I am not a troll, this is real life and it's hard.  I used dots all the time and I don't review my posts so I'm sure there are always words not spelled correctly.  I usually blame that on me being left handed.... I need to come here and be with others who are stage 4.  I have so many good friends, but it's just hard if you know what I mean.  While they are on diets to lose weight to be healthy, I keep eating cheese cake and chocolate because...well I can. Just taking sometime to say hello to you and talk a little. Me  Log in to post a reply",

If I have had a difficult month I fear my tumor markers will go up.  Yet if I have had a good month my tumor markers will go down.  Silliness, I know.  I stopped laughing the day I was diagnosed with mets, doom and gloom has surrounded me for 7 months now.  As I watched the video of that baby laughing, I found myself laughing out loud - it felt good. I really don't have any comments on the laughing yoga talk, but I know that I want to take my head from under the covers and laugh a little.  Not for a cure, but to make that day, that moment a little easier to cope with. So Blue, thanks for that video and to all of you who are going through this horrific stage 4 journey I send love and thanks, because although I don't post much you have given me much support while I am trying to figure out who I am now.

It's one of those days where it's raining and would feel great just to crawl back into bed.  I hate when it rains like this as my job involves me driving around and walking outside lot from place to place.  And I can't even say I am thankful for the rain so it will bring flowers.  I have to remind myself it is Fall and Winter will be here soon. I mentioned my husband and others acting differently.  I think what is the hardest for me is my husband because he is going through a serious depression through this whole thing that I am dealing with.  People keep telling me this is about you, but it's hard to watch someone you love having difficulty coping and for the life of me I have such a hard time trying to help him get through this.  Heck, I am having a hard enough time helping myself. The wine yesterday was wonderful.  I had a glass while I was here and another with dinner which was perfect because DH made an Italian dish and the Merlot went perfect with it.  I was thinking that my ONC is pretty smart giving me a month reprieve from the IV chemo.  He knows me well enough that I wouldn't handle that easy...more like kicking and shouting the whole way.  So do you all have ports?  I'm not looking forward to getting one again, but I was glad I had a port during my last chemo. Also wondering what kinds of things do you like to do?  I have become isolated as my home feels so safe.  So basically I go to work and stay at home.  Being with groups of people makes me very nervous.  I love to take walks and just look around to appreciate mother nature.  And as I am walking I think of so many things, talk to the animals and love to tell stories. Kathy:  My gosh being a preschool teacher sounds hard, but on the other hand lots of fun.  Nothing more precious than being around the innocence of a child.  Good that you have 2 days that you can recup and regenerate.  My job is flexible in that I can leave early if I need to.  I have so much paperwork and can do that at home.  So that does help lots.  It's fast paced which I have always enjoyed, I evaluated 20 people yesterday and 5 diferent hospitals.  My biggest fear now is being exposed to all these infections that are going around.  If I catch a cold it tends to go to pneumonia now, so I am very careful.  I did get the regular old flu shot yesterday but I don't know if I like this swine flu shot.  Haven't made up my mind if I will get it or not. mthomp:  Glad the Navelbane is being kind to you.  Do you get hair loss with it?  I didn't wear a wig last time and if I go on this IV chemo I won't wear a wig this time either.  Going to go out and buy lots of hats and earrings, but gosh darn my it took 4 years for my hair to get it's thickness back.  I have been known to open a bottle of wine and before I know it somehow it's empty.  The good old days.  I love Martini's, my favorite being a dirty Martini with a little olive juice and two olives in the glass.  Of course if I drank one now it would knock me on my butt.  You are right as I am not a good support group person.  I find coming here is much more therapeutic for me. Last night I had some chocolate covered almonds from a gourmet shop.  A treat indeed, but I ate way too many.  No wonder I can't lose weight.  Someone mentioned living in Chicago and I think my eyes are stlll sleepy because I can't find that post.  I too live in the Chicago area. Live in one of the Western suburbs and my job is to drive around Chi town all day.  Hope you all have a wonderful Friday and that some sunshine fills your heart with warmth. Me    ",

I woke up today in good spirits.  I start my 14 day Xeloda cycle today and can't believe I am actually looking forward to taking it.  All of a sudden it doesn't seem so bad after coming inches away from IV chemo.  I always say this is my time, the early morning hours.  House is quiet, no interruptions and I can enjoy my morning coffee. Diane I was so happy to see a post from you.  I have been lurking for along time and wondered where you were.  Then wonder turned to worry.  It's nice talking to you again.  We certainly did have our conversations and if I remember correctly we were able to laugh lots despite what we were going through.  Angel thanks for the hugs.  I feel it is I who should be sending out hugs to all of you.  As I read your stories you all will never know how motivating you have been to me.  I didn't take the news well in the beginning and someone here always made be feeel better. Livestrong:  Yep despite the nuns trying to change me, I am left handed. I was a fighter then too lol.  I'm feeling happy today a good way to start the day.  Hope all goes well with your husband next week.  Hate all those darn tests and the fear that goes along wit hit. Lisa:  Hope I didn't make a mystery out of myself.  I know the gals that have been on here from way back when and I am starting to get to know the newer gals.  Yep, I think this part of the journey stinks but I also am finding something good in each day and thats how I get by. Kelly I wish I could send back hugs to everyone of you.  Some of you are further in this stage 4 journey than I am and I want to reach out and say everything will be ok. Hattie:  The thing that brought me back is that I see what you mean.  We are all in this together.  When I am having a crappy panic day, I need to tell someone.  Yet on the otherhand when things are going well I want to share it.  Kathy:  I started a caringbridge too.  And I am amazed at the amount of people who come there everyday to lend me support and a helping hand.  But there I am quite self centered and only talk about myself.  Being here I get to talk to others and friendships build as we go along.  I think the one thing that was really hard for me was that all of a sudden I felt like I was in a postion where I coulnd't help people anymore.  But I know being here I can help others just like I need help.  When I first started Xeloda I was so scared because I read how many had terrible side effects.  It has worked out very well for me.  It's almost like a baby blanket that I don't want to give up. Jeannie:  The constant up's and down's are so amazing to me and I never know when I will be up or down.  I was in a big meeting with the owners of where I work and got the phone call while I was presenting my report.  And the dang phone rang loudly playing girls just want to have fun.  I look at all the managers and the owner and said I HAVE to take this call.  Then afterwards had to clear my head and go back into the meeting looking professional.  Pftttt on that.  I never thougth in a million years I would be looking forward to taking chemo, yet this morning I can't wait to have breakfast so I can start my Xeloda again. Elizabeth, yes I am who you think I am and I have missed you lots.  I have been coming here to read everyday just to see what is going on and glad I finally had the nerve to come back.  I am into pies now.  Pumpkin pie is sounding really good right about now. Thanks for all your replies, it going to be nice to get to know all of you again.  Hoping you all have a wonderful day and that at least something touches your heart that makes you smile. Me   ",

I don't believe any of us know how much time we have left, but I read here and see many women surviving and living their lives with multiple mets.  And living longer than I would have ever imagined.  Coming here has giving me so much hope when my darkest thoughts tell my I have a poor prognosis.  Has your onc put you on a new treatment plan?  I think when it comes to adoption, taking care of a baby is a full time job and I wonder with treatment will you be able to do both.  Be a mother and heal yourself.  Sometimes it seems like this cancer likes to knock us down right when we are feeling positive and ready to enjoy life, and I hate that this has happened to you. It's hard enough struggling with the news but to have to make a decision regarding adoption seems mind boggling to me.  Know that there are many of us here who will try and help you through this very hard time. ",

I don't have much china but a friend gave me some really pretty wine glasses so I pulled one out. Since we were talking about food, chocolate especially I gave in on my way to work and got a chocolate bagel with chocolate cream cheese.  Whew the calories, but it sure tasted good.  I have to say I had a really good day, I am lucky that my work is flexible and everyone was so concerned about the IV chemo thing.  ONC didn't want to increase my Xeloda he was afraid it would become too toxic so I'm hoping this stuff kicks in.  As usual we can only hope. So I was wondering, since you have been diagnosed stage 4 are you finding people are treating you different?  My hsuband has definitely changed his attitude.  Seems to be pulling away like he is getting ready to lose me or something - heck I plan on being around for along time. River:  Hit to you, I'm not a legend...just got to know lots of people here.  In my early days I was sort of a person who had her big panties on and they still were too tight.  Always was invovled in some controversial thread and thought I knew everything and was right about everything.  I have certainly be humbled since then. I think I learned my stubborness from being a nurse and working in ICU.  Always had to hold my fist up to some of those doctors.  I am very gald to meet you and hope to get to know you better. MomoB:  Thanks for your kind words.  One year ago I never thought I would be here, but as time goes by I am getting used to it.  And of course the glass of Merlot is a perfect way to end my day. Janis:  Interesting combination Herceptin and Zometa.  If I go on IV chemo it will be Abraxane, Zometa and Carboplatin.  Not sure if Tykerb fits in the picture but I sure hope it does, otherwise I'm thinking herceptin again too.  I'm also wondering about Avastin.  My biggest problem is I know too much and do too much research.  I can't imagine you working full time and taking care of your young children.  That has to be hard. Me, I come home and take care of myself - well except for my dog and cat. Hope you all have a good evening,  It's raining here and the temperatures dropped.  A typical fall day in the Midwest. Me ",
