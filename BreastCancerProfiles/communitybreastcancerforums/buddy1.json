My right breast was swollen red.  They were not paying attention to it.  Finally got my plastic surgeon on the phone  to tell him  what was going on   It was bad. The infection was spreading and thick and cloudy. He took it out last night.   While here they found a cyst or mass on or around or near my ovaries,  They want it out , and hopefully its not cancer.  My chemo is being pushed back a week while I heal from the infection,They are trying to get the ovaries out during this time too.  As of right now surgery is wed. They will start it lapryscopy and send it to path.  If its positive they will open me up and take lymphnodes and appendix.  If negative, I will be home that night.  I am so far behind on posts.  I cant even try to catch up. I hope you are all well, and I hope I have not missed too much.  I think I get to go home tomorrow.  Depending on infection..
