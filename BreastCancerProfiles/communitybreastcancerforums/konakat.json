I have been warned that the cancer can sneak up on you and take you fast.  There's no hard and fast rule. What does your friend want to do?  The best thing would be that everyone supports her choice, even if it's not what anyone else thinks is the best choice for her.  Her onc and even better a social worker at the hospital should have a good heart-to-heart with her and her husband.  If there really isn't much they can do perhaps the best thing would be for your friend talk to a hospice.  I have never heard a negative thing about hospice care.  A few of the women here are in hospice care and cannot say enough good things about the nurses, etc. I know my post is all wishy-washy but every patient has a different experience.  The only thing I can say for certainty is that whatever your friend decides, give her 100% of your support, which I know you will do.  Again, I am so sorry that your friend, her family and you are having to go through this.  It is so sad.  You are a good friend.  Lots of hugs, Elizabeth",

I'll be decapitating chocolate bunnies all that weekend! Oooh, I had a new low level from my labs today.  First, the usual suspects continue to be high or low.  Platelets were very low but I was approved for chemo anyway (68 when should be should be 150-450, at least 100 for chemo -- but I guess my skulls bandana makes me look like an ass-kicker that can handle it!  ).  ALP still high (320, which is good for me, but should be 50-136) and creeping up but still not 1200 like last summer!  So a big yawnarama there too. The weird new one was magnesium!!  I got an Mg IV infusion and will get one again with the next chemo.  I found out that Mg is important for absorbing calcium and preventing osteoporosis (good grief, I drink milk like a calf and take calcium and Vit D - I hope I`m not peeing it all out!!).  Elevated ALP can be caused by both liver mets and sometimes extensive bone mets.  Huh and Hmmmmm.  And my bones have been extra achy.  Hmmmm again.  At my crappy level an IV infusion is needed but my nurse mentioned that high fiber cereals and chocolate are rich in Mg!!!  Coffee too!!!!!  OK, can we say chocolate milk on my cereal tomorrow!  Assuming my brain boogers are gone, things are looking good for today.  Yah, all things in perspective.  Still worried about CT next week but I`ll deal with it then.

It was wonderful seeing McDreamy.  He said if my throat is better by the weekend we'll go ahead with chemo on Tuesday.  If not, postpone it a week.  It will be the same ol' chemo -- Navelbine, Carboplatin, and Zometa.  Since it has been working, except for the brain boogers, we might as well stick with it.  I'm also getting a CT to see if my liver, etc. has run amok the past month or so.  And an echocardiogram to see how my heart's doing too. I also saw Dr. Delish and he gave me a prescription for this goop that will coat my throat and take away the pain.  It works!  Yay!! So, the drama is over, for now.  I can't wait until June to see if the rads worked.  If it didn't get all the lesions I'm pretty well toast -- they're too small to cyberknife.  But that's OK.  I've assumed I've been toast for quite a while and am sort of used to the idea.

I clipped what was left of my hair.  Now I only need to find my lint roller.  Lint roller?  Yes, indeedie -- the one of the best tips I ever got here.  When the clipped itty bitty hairs fall out it's easy to lint roll them right off your head instead of letting them fall where ever and be itchy.  Brush your teeth, lint roll your head and you're ready to face the day!",

I talk to Mom and Sharon every day.  And I have a nice collection of opiates at my disposal.  So far the Ibuprofen I take for my achy bones takes care of everything.  The nurse said the Ibuprofen wouldn't help if something serious was happening.  I'm just my usual dizzy lizzy, that's all. And sleeping a lot - about 15 hours a day. I see Dr. Delish on Thursday and will mention the little headaches.  He said I'll probably just get a sore throat since he's zapping my first 2 vertebra too since the mets is in their marrow.  And fatigue.  Back to bed -- I sure hope both Denzel and Richard show up!  Tomorrow's zap is at 4:15 so I can really sleep in!!",

Now this is creepy dream stuff.  Creepy, erotic, strange.  Be forewarned!!  It's a long post but you might find it interesting.  Or not. What's weird is that I've always has big epic dreams, many part of a repertoire that replay once and a while.  Big sci-fi or fantasy productions that make Hollywood blockbusters seem like documentary shorts.  When I was little I'd call them movies in my head.  I'm always the leader, going against adversaries like monsters, aliens, and bad people.  I always get away, lead my followers to beautiful pastures, the hero, win.  In one dream I often have I have this cool pod I can fly in.  Zoom! Anyway...lately I'm not the leader, or am crappy at it.  Yesterday I dreamed I was part of a group to be culled by the invaders but had a chance to get away by demonstrating my value.  I had to go pee and missed out on my chance.  The invadors were impressed by my ability to pee though.  But not impressed enough to give me a chance and let me try to impress in some other way.  We were all made of clay and tornados were coming -- freaky eh? Anyway, I crawled into bed earlier today and to hopefully avoid these dreams I fantasized about being on a big foam mattress, floating off a beach.  There was a gorgeous man in white linen pants and shirt, long black dreadlocks, floating near me in a kayak who would slowly pull me closer to shore if I drifted out too far.  He'd spray on sunscreen or give me a sip of water when I needed it.  He was so quiet, he just knew when and what he was to do.  I seldom completely woke from my dozing.  I was safe, comforted, and content.  Sometimes I'd feel him lying beside me, holding my hand, sometimes dozing with his hand resting on my bare belly (yes, I'm nude, with all my flaws exposed).  He smelled so crisp and clean, like linen and salt air. We never spoke. Towards the end of the day we headed back to our one-room cottage.  White cotton drapes billowing into the room, palm leaf fan on the ceiling keeping us cool as we dozed on this so soft bed.  I woke and it was night time but daylight was out.  Strange.  Then my cats Chloe and Ursula (they're not alive anymore) came padding into the room.  They beckoned towards me, that look of \"are you going to fill the catfood dish, come on!\"  They looked at me and started towards the big window.  My beautiful cats.  I rose to start following them, after one or two steps I disappeared with them. Dream over.  At some point I must have been asleep since it felt like I woke up when I left with Chloe and Ursula.  I was so very happy to be with my cats but so sad that I was with this guy when I died instead of my Mom. ",

Yes, it is very overwhelming.  I made a list of questions for my doc -- took a few days writing them.  He/she is obliged to answer them, and very happy to explain things if he/she is a decent doc and caring person. What I found that helped get over the feeling helpless and out of control was to finally get my treatment nailed down and the schedule set.  Having that action plan to beat this cancer really helped.  You will feel in control and feel ha -- I'm gonna defeat this thing.  You are the general leading the war -- it makes you feel strong.  Yes, there are side effects but drugs to help.  And a bonus, when your hair starts growing in it is so soft!!  I sit watching TV rubbing my head -- it feels soooo good!!

I do hope you find some solutions soon.  Hugs, Elizabeth",

For me, the worst is the emotional ups and downs.  I occasionally have big \"why me\" pity parties.  But I get through them.  It's very hard when you get a scan showing progression and that the chemo's stopped working.  Again, I get through the shock and sadness and go on to the next chemo and kick the cancer back. You can live a very normal life.  Some have a terrible time, others not.  What I try to do is acknowledge that cancer has screwed up part of my life but not let it screw up all of my life.  If you do, it wins.  Like Fitz says, you try not to live in cancer land.  It doesn't define who you are. In other words, you are not Connie with cancer, you are Connie.  And, I probably would be a basket case if it weren't for the support of the women here.  They're the best.  Hugs, Elizabeth xoxoxoooo",

I started this thread/question because I have come to a few realizations and was worried that I was being too harsh, or expecting too much.  Here's what's up: I've been traipsing along, la-dee-la-la-la-la, OK chemo will get this under control, I'll be one out of the 4 or 5 who makes it to 5 years, maybe not 10, 8 years sounds like a good number.  You can get a lot done in 8 years! OK, I'm mixing metaphors, but while traipsing along, I've had my head in the sand, butt straight up in the air with regards to Stage IV.  Each time one of our dear sisters takes a turn for the worse, I think that can't be right, she must be well. Or if someone dies, no, I want her back right now!  This is wrong and not happening. Good stuff does happen, but so does bad stuff, all too often. With each test I have, I lie to myself that I expect the worst to lessen the blow of a bad scan, but secretly I hope for and expect the best, only to be disappointed.  My onc and I are no longer talking NED.  OK, so what do I need to do to catch the eye of the d*mn stable boy?  Hey!  I'll put out, forget the dinner and dance, I'll go right for a roll in the hay if that will work. (On another thread we were discussing depression and humour -- this is an attempt at humour as a coping mechanism -- sorry for the side bar here...). So, haven't I been stupid.  In denial (on the most beautiful barge....).  I've started to realize these past few months that holy crap, this Stage IV is some serious sh*t!  I've always known it was serious, but now I know.   This is so scary, my mind is spinning.  It's like the taxi cab is at the door and I haven't started packing yet!  I need more time!!  Whew!  Sorry about that!  Yes, I can live a good life, have fun, have hope, feel joy (for example, next week I'm going to the ocean and plan on splashing around in the water like a total idiot and not care if I look silly).  But my long winded point is, regardless of how good, fair, or bad we're doing, this Stage IV is some very serious sh*t.  It can be hard to get your mind wrapped around it, even for a metster. So tread with care, I usually meow, sometimes I might growl (but with a smile, and I really do care about you, even if I do growl!) Off to bed (I can't believe it took me 1.5 hours to write this!!).  Thanks to anyone that took the time to read this. ",

Pitanga has made a good point about when you are \"just diagnosed\" and when you are past that.  My thoughts are that the \"just diagnosed\" is that horrible time when there is the flurry of thoughts and emotions that need to be expressed when first diagnosed with mets. Once you've lived through that phase, it is hard to re-live it over and over through others in that phase.  I'm sorry if that sounds harsh new mets sisters, but I hope you'll understand.  The Stage IV \"just diagnosed\" forum serves a good purpose, just like the non-staged \"just diagnosed\" forum.  I see the Stage IV forum as the time when we say \"OK, I've got mets, now let's deal with it.\"  That is what bonds all mets sisters together, each in our different boat but heading the same way.  As a little side note to Pitanga -- I can empathize -- I'm away from my family and country -- but, not as far as you are.  And I too am struggling with finding a job, having little money, and getting chemo at the same time.  It is a nightmare.  It's a lot to shoulder at one time. Edit to tweak grammar and to add:  When it comes to the Palliative forum -- I do believe that is \"sacred ground\".  And that is the intent of the Moderators.",

So many times I see someone on the Just Diagnosed thread that is scared and I want to reach out to her but don't -- the last thing I think she wants to see is a Stage IV person.  Re. thoughtless people -- I have a girlfriend who had a cancer scare -- it was benign.  But she still refers to the both of us as survivors.  Ahem....  I take it as an insult to every woman, Stage 0 - IV for her to call herself a survivor!  And I'm not really a survivor, I'm living with it.  Heather -- It's rum cake.  I don't really like it but it was some else's birthday.  I like the good old fashioned vanilla cakes with the huge icing roses that you get at the grocery store.  But then, if something has icing on it I will stick a fork in it eat it! Re. breast cancer awareness booths.  Whenever I'm asked for a donation and I just say I've already offered my body for clinical trials. That's my donation.  I was very lucky, I found this site just a few weeks after dx.  It's been a life saver.  I have my snits once in a while, jaw-dropping experiences with some posts, but overall, I'm so grateful to have this site.  Other women who understand and listen. I'm amazed and delighted by the positive feedback on this thread!  At first I winced before clicking it in my favourites.  No one has said I'm bitchy yet but I'm sure some think I am.  BTW -- frequent edits bec I keep thinking of something else as soon as I click submit.  Like this one:  It's so cool to see some women posting here that I haven't seen around for a while!  Very nice to see you again!!",

Perhaps you can ask your onc about trying another chemo which might work better for you -- easier on your general health and kick cancer butt.  And a second opinion is always a good thing.

If you are within a driveable distance to Boston, park at the Alewife subway station for example, (Arlington, $7/day) and you can easily take the train in.  Here's a link to the subway info: http://www.mbta.com/ .

And you just may feel normal for a long time, just a slightly different normal.  I often tell my doc how weird it is that I feel physically OK-ish when I have all this BC inside me.  It's very strange. I know that you're a very sweet, kind person -- your thread about etiquette and worries about your friend shows me this.  I wish you didn't have this stupid disease.  But we're all here together and look out for each other.  I'm blathering on (yet again) but I just want you to know that all your feelings are valid and we're here for you, always.",

A GF has suggested a bunch of us get together in the Caribbean to hang out like old times.  Might be a fun, just in time for hurricane season! The worst is still Mom.  Hearing the shake in her voice when I told her.  I look into the homecare stuff - I have their info around somewhere.  Maybe ParaTranspo if I'm eligible.  I'm paying $40 each way for a taxi to and from the hospital.  I know there are volunteer drivers but I don't want to have to be friendly and also count on them being on time.",

If it's not a tumah, I can hop right onto the trial I was supposed to go on.  If it is we just have to treat the tumor and then in 2 months try again for the trial.  So I'm optimistic either way.  But then, what's with the big honkin' blood vessel in my head -- that I'm trying not to think about (i.e., kaboom and splat!)!!  I get to see McDreamy again next week so hey, I'm having fun.  Thanks for all the well wishes -- your kindnesses just bowl me over.

Now I'm reading up on necrosis -- the zap gives a 10% chance of this.  The bugger is that it can be a delayed SE -- maybe up to a year away!  Talk about dramatic tension for a year.  My tumah was right beside a blood vessel too.  I sure hope cute physicist got his numbers right.  3katz -- did you know sugar, which comes from sugarcane, a plant that kinda looks like celery, can be substituted for celery?  Yah...that comes from my rules of oink-out rationalization.

Renee -- Hope the trial is going well and your side doesn't hurt anymore.  I was scared the first time I gave Chloe fluids so I just grabbed her scruff and jabbed.  I either do it or I have a sick cat on my hands.  Edit:  Just saw your new thread -- I'll catch up there. Barbe -- Chloe doesn't act old -- still playful and loves rolling around and getting her tummy tickled.  She does have a bit of arthritis in her hind legs though.  She looks pretty good for an old lady -- 89 in human years.  I'm usually hunched over her on the floor kissing her ears and head so she can't get away.  It wasn't easy getting the pics!",

The brain scan won't entail the horrid mask -- just a generic thingy to hold my head stable.  No biggie.  Except for having to be there at 9AM!!!  That will be torture. I want to pick up the scan results before I see Dr. McDuffus so I won't be side-tracked by the results (and his velvety voice).  I want to be sure to tell him that I was not amused by being blind-sided by the 6 week wait to see him, only a brain scan, his witchy nurse (no offense to witches) blah, blah.  I cannot wait until next Tuesday!!!! Shiny -- it's all one doc -- his name changes depending on how I feel about him at the time.  Maybe I could draw cartoons based on what I think of him to match the labels.",

I only have my dear cat to keep me going some days.  What helps is my curiosity about what could be different, what's around the corner for me -- I don't want to miss out on anything that could be good.  Perhaps think of one thing that you'd like to change, something that is attainable, and focus on that.  It can be a quick change or something that will take a lot of time.  Also embrace what you want to stay the same.  Now is the time to be selfish -- it's all about you.  Take care of you.  Weed out what you don't need/want and hang on to what you do.  This is what I try to do, sometime with success, sometimes not, but it's OK no matter what.  Hugs, Elizabeth",

Re. the scans -- if the spots were small they could have been missed in the first scan and were always there.  I've had scans where a previous one was reviewed and in hindsight they could just see a spot that was missed the first time around.  Maybe that happened in your case? It will be interesting to see what Dr. Minton thinks.  If her practice does clinical trials I can't see it being a problem transferring it to her.  Also, if you were taken off TCH too soon you can always keep it in your back pocket if you ever get a recurrence.  I hope it goes much better with your new onc. Elizabeth Edit:  Duh. I just read Cathy's response -- yes! You will be able to continue on Xeloda/Tykerb without being in a trial!  Good stuff!",

I did a quick search here and here's part of a post from 2007 - I don't know if it is similar to what you have, but it has some good info.  And good luck on Tuesday, let us know how it went. \"Inflammed ducts\", breast ducts enlarged and filled with inflammatory cells (the kinds associated with infections) do indeed occur even unassociated to pregnancies. Many may be without symptoms, and if symptoms occur, they may be some localized breast pain, nipple discharge, and even an abscess or pus pocket which might drain to the skin. The inflammatory cells can obstruct secretions within the duct and the duct enlarges, and is more susceptible to infection. This can happen even unrelated to pregnancy and breast feeding, where breast infections are more commonly seen. Perhaps your doctor will recommend a sonogram of the biopsied area to visualize the duct involved, and recommend the duct be excised. This may minimize any likelihood of further inflammation, infection, abscess and/or tracks from the duct to the skin (called fistulas). Though it sounds somewhat scary, breast surgeons deal with breast ducts all the time in breast practices.",

I think you should call him up and get some clarification -- what exactly is the next step with him?

I'm feeling better -- only 2 more weeks until I see Dr. McDoodoo.  If I limit myself to 2 outings a week I'm not so tired.  I also just got my first disability cheque -- with 1 year back-pay!  That's put me in a very good mood. Took my kitty to the vet for some bloodwork and she was so snarly they had to sedate her. I'm kinda proud since she's 19 years old. She's wandering around like a drunk right now, trying to shake it off.  I've been giving her subcutaneous fluids for over 2 years for kidney failure and need to keep an eye on things.  Two quick sessions a week with a big honkin' needle -- worse that what I got on chemo. This weekend for sure going to Boston.  Got my US tax refund in the mail and I want to cash it!  And see my guy.",

My brain scan came back clean!  Yippee!  Of course I still have a dirty mind. The lumpy-bump is probably a cyst but he's ordering a mammo anyway. In the next 2-3 weeks I will get a bone scan (re. aches), chest and abdomen CT (re. liver still swollen, as usual), brain MRI, echo, etc in prep for the clinical trial and to get a good idea what's up.  We'll discuss options in 3 weeks.  He did say if Femara is working I should stay with it and not X-off my options by going on the trial too soon.  I told him that Femara seemed to work at first (less pain) but the pains are coming back so even if the scans are better than they were in January I could still be getting worse again.  I guess we'll see in a couple of weeks. He also mentioned that for HER2+ there's another drug in Phase 1 trials (not TDM1 but something new) and there's lots coming down the pipeline.  This is good! I feel a lot better!!!!  And, I can now get my hair done without worrying about wasting the money.  And relax a bit.  I can't wait until the scans -- I love getting scans.  But for the next couple of weeks I'll probably be boring re. posts.  :-) Thanks for all the well wishes!!",

So tumah is there and only one of them -- they didn't find any more with the MRI. And in about 3 months time I can be on the trial again...assuming Femara keeps me from dropping dead in the meantime!  Ho-hum... No cake, but I see pizza in the near future...",

Dreamweaver, it worries me that you are becoming fearful.  I know it is so very easy to say, but you should do some soul searching, think about leaving this man.  Yes, coming from me it's kind hypocritical, but I know it's the right thing to do.  I hope we both have the strength to do what is ultimately the best for us, no matter how scary and painful it is in the short term.

I asked about TDM getting through the BBB -- they don't know.  He also said we don't know how well Xeloda and Tykerb get through either -- WTF?  In my grumpiness I blurted out \"So I'm f*cked no matter what?\"  Not necessarily (yet, anyway) -- my liver is the biggest concern and going on the trial or starting on the meds immediately will be a good thing. Oh, okaaaaay.  I didn't ask about my labs -- I wonder if my liver is worse...I don't want to know.  It doesn't hurt as much but you never know...he looked concerned...could be my imagination...I hope my brain doesn't explode, my neck break, turn yellow (I do like the colour though).  I'm grumpy.

Funny story -- A few years ago I said hi to a groundhog along the highway (I always do that) and the next day he was still in the same place so I was sad that he was probably dead.  Later in the week I went by the same place and saw that it wasn't a groundhog but a rock.  Cheered me up, but felt silly thinking it was a groundhog. I think I will be in a better frame of mind once my treatment is set in May -- no longer in limbo land.  And maybe get a boost in my Effexor.  Edit to add:  Linda you didn't bum me out.  It's been on my mind a lot. ",

Also, the first med I was given for nausea wasn't good enough.  I called my onc on the Monday and they had me come back in for some fluids and a new prescription.  So, be vocal and they will help you deal with side effects. I didn't address hairloss - yes, it sucks big ones, but it all comes down to weighing the alternative.  With extensions and wigs so much in style you'll find a good one if that's what you want to do.  Get a couple.  I got one in hot pink from wigs.com. And, when your hair grows back it, it is so soft and curly.  My hair never looked better -- that was one consolation prize for the chemo. There are these ice caps/hats that you can wear that are supposed to stop hairloss, but I have yet to see anyone that says they worked.  Apparently it just slows down the loss, but it eventually all comes out.  As you go on this journey, we will try to help by sharing our experiences, and listening to yours.",

(can you see where this is going...) The lesions have mostly doubled in size since my Dec 15 scans.   Yikes.  OK, I say, let's blast them with the clinical trial drugs. Just got off the phone with Dr. McDreamy (my onc).  I'm out of the trial.  A tiny lesion was found in my brain.  F*ck (repeat several times with increasing intensity).  So, I get the cyber knife on March 10.  I stay on Aredia.  No chemo -- we're going to give Femara a try for a few weeks and see if I respond in my liver and bones.  If not, we'll give tykerb and I think xeloda a try.  I was zoning out in the conversation by then.  I'm finally freaking out.  I didn't cry when I got my progression news in January, which was weird.  I did this time, after I hung up the phone with Dreamykins.  Bawled to my b/f.  I'm still heading to Boston for the weekend, that will cheer me up.  F*ck.  I guess I will have to tell Mom about the progression sometime next week...joy oh joy...that's going to be the worst. So, I'm going to stuff my face, have a glass of wine, do a bit of cyberknife research here, then crawl into bed with Chloe (cat) so I'll be rested for tomorrow's trip.  I'll be on DeNile for a while too...it's nice there.

I'm sorry I don't have any good advice on to stent or not to stent, just a few ideas that may help you decide. Take care, Elizabeth",

She consulted with the rad onc and the pharmacist and they said don't worry. So I didn't.  :-) The fatigue took a few months to go away I'm sorry to say.  I think it was a combo of all the chemo, rads, and emotional drain.  Hit me like a brick wall during rads towards the end, but it was nice to be at the end.  Some breeze through treatment, some don't, and everything in between is experienced.  But don't worry if you start to feel tired.  I managed to work through the whole thing so it's doable.  Just remember to get the energy to celebrate like h*ell when it's all over!!!! Oh yeah, Aquaphor is a bit greasy so don't wear your best bra/camisole/whatever.  Oh yeah (again) my boob swelled a bit too, not really noticable.",

I originally freaked at the stats for liver mets but my onc says she doesn't see why I won't be around for 5 years, possible longer.  And, there are quite a few women here who have been living with liver and bone mets for quite a while -- gives me a lot of hope!!  It doesn't sound like long, 5 years, but when you think of everything that can get packed into that amount of time I'm OK with it.  I'm sorry your trip had to be cancelled.  But once you get the mets under control and your spine strengthened maybe in the spring?  I hope so!!  This has been such a terrible shock to you, I know.  Once you get your treatment plan set up and get on it you will feel more in control, feel that you're on the mend.  With love, Elizabeth",

Take care Linda -- get that 2nd opinion and you beat the lung mets -- take on the bone marrow mets.  I don't know what it will involve or know of any docs in Cincinnati, I hope you hear from someone on this.  Big hugs coming your way!

So here's the problem.  If I get on the super herceptin side of the trial I might be wasting valuable months in treatment that doesn't work and the mets gets really bad.  But then, it could work for me.  I see my onc on the 26th and will ask him then. I thought I'd mention this conundrum and see if anyone has experience with this, thoughts, opinions...

I always remember her saying she would drop dead if anything happened to one of her kids -- hence me not telling her.  My sister, an MD, at first said I should tell her but then agreed that it is better that I don't give my Mom that sadness and grief.  Even though I'm 45 years old, there are days I would just love to crawl into her arms and cry.  My hair is slowly growing -- and am finally visiting her the first weekend of Feb.  The story is that my goofy short hair is all the style and I just got a bad haircut. Has anyone been in this situation of trying to hide their cancer?  It's awful -- wanting to see my Mom but not being able to. Sorry for the long-winded posting -- wish I found you all earlier...",

It is wonderful that Herceptin is working so well for you!  I do hope it continues for a long time.  But more often than not, the cancer will spread.  However (again), every woman is different, there isn't a hard and fast rule.  Always go on the assumption that you will keep living until you are told otherwise.  Best wishes, Elizabeth",

I guess it's a moot point that I don't get Gemzar anymore...  The exciting thing is that I am being considered for a trial.  Comparison of Trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 (super duper Herceptin) versus Capecitabine (Xeloda) + Lapatinib (Tykerb).  At least I can still use my nifty new port for Aredia (the trial drugs are all oral).  What sucks is that it may take 1-2 months to get my tissue samples from Boston.  But my onc there can move mountains so if required, I'll give her a call.  I'm worried about how much more cancer can pop up while I wait for the trial.  If so much showed up in 1 month...how much in another couple of months? I think I've been spending too much time in DeNile.  My onc said that Taxol and Gemzar bought me a year, the trial will hopefully buy me another.  Huh.  I really wasn't thinking in year blocks of time yet.  This puts a whole new spin on things.  Maybe I should go on disability and move into some crap apartment.  But then, work can be fun.  I need to think about this.  But first a nap and then sulking.  Can I have a hug?  Anyone?

I have my PMs set up so I get an email notice when I receive one.  Maybe she's set up like that too and will respond.  Give it a few days and if she doesn't respond maybe start a thread?  Last year when I was really sick I didn't go on the boards for ages.  The only way anyone knew I was still around was Sharon50 posting updates.  So if she doesn't respond, don't assume the worst. Another thing you can do is go to her profile page -- it will show if she's logged in and when the last time she did.  Maybe she just isn't posting much. Hope this helps. Elizabeth",

I hope someone in our predicament posts.  Thanks for starting this thread Robin. Elizabeth xox",

Here's my trip report: It was 85 and sunny every day.  I lazed on the beach, drank, swam, and snorkled.  Every single day.  Each evening I hung out at the beach bar for more drinks and dinner.  I thought of doing some excursions but was too lazy. I only read one book -- spent the rest of the time observing people.  My first observation was that there were no decent cabana boys!  Yikes!!  I did not get laid!!!  I was so worried about disappointing you all!  The most excitement was gettting a pat down when I left the Caymans.  She did these gentle caresses, I got kinda turned on...  Huh. The beach was full of couples, some families, and dreaded honeymooners.  I positioned my lounger away from the masses so I wouldn't have to talk to anyone.  Most of the men were funny looking in their swimming trunks with the waistband down near their willy wonkas.  It was really weird that most of the women were thin, I could count vertebra and ribs.  Yikes!!  Some of them wore make-up and jewelry to the beach, hair sprayed to great big helmets. The funniest moment was when a bunch of people were on a banana boat ride and the back two fell off!!!  They were spotted and the boat pulling the banana turned around to get them.  Then another great guffaw watching them trying to get back on.  I'm so mean. This does sound like a really boring trip but all I really wanted and needed was to lounge on a beach and swim.  I did both everyday so it was great.  My camera died on me so I had to use my cell for photos.  Here's three: Me lounging on the beach (BTW it's a polynesian turtle tattoo on my ankle).  Beach without my legs:  View of resort's courtyard from my room's balcony. ",

Epogen, Procrit, and Aranasp are used to treat anemia/low red blood cells.  Pretty well it's time that eventually gets platelet numbers back up.  A transfusion of whole blood or platelets aren't really effective. Ask your oncs when they expect your platelets to rise up to suitable levels.  Could a lower dose of Abraxane help?  A change in chemo once your platelets are better?  Ask about getting rads for your back and other painful areas -- really helps.

And I was thinking about what I would want from my Mom and I love all the ideas about writing your motherly advice in a journal.  Kids are so tactile, how about a scrapbook for each child, doesn't have to be fancy, photos, drawings you've done together, maybe a clipping of your hair so they can always touch it.  Your hand print so they can press their hand on it, and feel your presence.  And of course notes about your love, wishes, advice.  This I would cherish forever from my Mom, something your kids might cherish forever too.

For swimming I just used a head scarf and when it got wet it stayed snug on my head.  Wet knots are hard to come undone and when the material's wet it sticks to your head.  You can make it your vacation style statement by having a selection of scarves.  If it's humid be sure to take your sleeve.  Even before lymphedema my arms used to swell in the head and humidity.  I didn't wear it to the beach because I was to vain, so I did exercises each evening to get the lymph flowing and then wore my sleeve.  But being on the water and cruise you probably won't have too much of a problem -- the cooling effect of the ocean. Have a wonderful vacation! Elizabeth",

With the Cytoxan and Adriamycin (often shortened as AC in the posts here) there is nausea, but you will be given meds for that.  If what they give you doesn't work well enough, be sure to tell them and they will give you something else. And drink lots of water. Yes, it's really overwhelming -- sort of like being in a bad dream.  But you get in a rhythm and you get through it.  The key is to always tell the nurse how you feel.  It took a bit of time for me to get over the feeling of complaining, but be vocal.  They want to know how you feel and will help you.  A good place to read up about the drugs is: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginformation.html There are some short forms used in the posts here -- now that you know about the AC one you should be able to browse the posts for some more info.  Sometimes you'll see TAC -- that's AC and a drug Taxol or Taxotere that often follows AC.  Yeah, this sucks.  This website and community is very helpful -- ask questions anytime.  I wish you all the best as you get through your chemo.

Yikes! I've been on navelbine and carboplatin for about 2 months now -- liver numbers close to normal or double, GGT still 1500 but I guess that is just reflecting how damaged my liver is.  BTW -- navelbine didn't help much, it was the addition of carboplatin that I finally started to get some good results.  So, even if your Mom's numbers are really high now, hitting on the right treatment can really help.  I hope carbo is the one that helps your Mom.",

My family isn't religious but still has Christmas Day celebrations.  I haven't gone for the family dinner for over 20 years.  It's the bickering and tension that made me drop out.  And I can easily snag a few washers and dryers in the laundry room and get a ton of laundry done instead.  :-)  I also get very sad for those that are suffering, the homeless, the poor.  All the commercialism seems to me to just be a slap in the face for them. The only day around Christmas that I do celebrate is the first day of winter -- the sun is finally starting come back north!  There's hope of spring and summer again.",

Here's what I found that may be useful to you: Here's a link to Cornell University http://envirocancer.cornell.edu/FactSheet/Diet/fs44.survival.cfm to a fact sheet titled \"Diet and Lifestyle and Survival from Breast Cancer\".  I thought it might be of interest because it includes diet and enviornmental info.  Here's the first paragraph: The current five-year survival rate for women with breast cancer is 86%. (The survival rate is the percentage of women who are still living a period of time after they are diagnosed with breast cancer.) The current ten-year survival rate is 76%. These rates include women at all stages or levels of severity of breast cancer. Women with cancer that has not metastasized - that is, the cancer has not moved to the lymph system or other parts of the body - have a five-year survival rate of 96%. Women whose breast cancer has metastasized to other parts of the body have a five-year survival rate of 21%. From the American Cancer Society http://www.cancer.org/docroot/stt/stt_0.asp?from=fast -- scroll down and on the bottom right you'll find a link to Breast Cancer stats.  They also have a section on Complementary and Alternative Methods http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_4_4X_Complementary_and_Alternative_Methods_5.asp?rnav=cri -- towards the bottom there is a list of questions to consider to evaluate alternative sites.  Here's that UK website I mentioned earlier:  http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/types/breast/.  It also has a section on understanding stats http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=155&order=57 Medscape has a resource center with info from scientific journals.  You do have to create an account but it's free.  http://www.medscape.com/resource/breastcancer I think you will find much more accurate and encouraging information from these sites.  Take care.

There's a thread called \"Anyone on Gemzar\"  -- you can find it near the top on page 3 in the stage IV forum. It's not too long and you'll get an idea of what it's like. Good luck tomorrow Marsha!

Elizabeth Just thought of this:  A book that was recommended by my hospital's social worker and many women here is Anti-Cancer, A New Way Of Life by David Servan-Schreiber. ",

You or your Mom should ask for her oncologist about the choice in treatment to put your mind at ease.  After a few months on treatment her oncologist will order more tests to see how the treatment is working. Still, ask questions on what your Mom's treatment choices were based on. Your Mom probably will be given Zometa too  -- an IV drug that is used to strengthen her bones in addition to the hormonal treatment.  I do not think this is something that you should worry about, it sounds like she is getting a standard treatment for her bone mets.  Still, I would ask the doctor about the surgery.  I'm sure some more bone mets sisters will chime in with their treatments and advice too.  Take care, and please ask any questions that you may have.

Also, so I wouldn't get crappy numbers, I never had a glass of wine (or whatever) within 2 days of my labs.  And try avoid tylenol products if you can -- tylenol is very hard on the liver.  And drink lots of water to flush your system. I hope some of this helps -- and that your liver gets with the program and settles down!",

And a platelet lifespan is about a week so even if I got the infusion and chemo I'd still end up with crap platelets. I'd never get ahead of the game. And, platelets look like thick pee in a bag, gross -- who wants that!! When I was off chemo for the brain rads my platelets did rise so I did get one chemo session last month. Good thing my latest scans were not horrible and I should be able to get by without chemo for a couple of months.

So, if I were you, the first thing I'd do is get that Effexor dose increased, doubled!  75mg isn't very much.  I've been on anti-depressants for many years, including Effexor.  My Effexor was at 300mg but is now at 150mg.  Address the chemical stuff behind depression first -- it's a quick (sort of) fix.  Then if there are situational things (i.e., liver mets, (yeah, no kidding), or whatever else is going on with your life) work on those with your therapist.  You can come back from depression Carla.  It can be a take 2 steps forward, 1 step back kind of thing, but you can do it.  Once you get some relief with Effexor, you can then work on the other stuff.  The Effexor will give you that little boost to make all the other stuff more manageable. And promise me, if you do think you are going to take your life, please get to a hospital.  Please.  You can get through this.  You really can.  With hugs and understanding, Elizabeth xox",

Was I pissed off when I went to pick up my scan results.  First, the chest CT wasn't written up yet.  Second, the abdominal/pelvic one was but it was the sh*ttiest report I've ever seen!!  WTF!!!!  I could have written a more detailed one without even seeing the scan!  For example: Boney disease is noted - no sh*t Sherlock!!!  Details please!!!  So I ranted and raged to my nurse and McDreamy about the incompetence of the radiologist. Now for the oops: While I'm hissing and spitting, McDreamy points out that the scan says I've improved!  Huh?!? What?  Ooooooh.  Seems like I missed out on some stuff while ranting.  The scan impression said that \"it was somewhat difficult to assess measurable disease in this particular case.  In comparison with the previous examination of Dec 2010, there is considered further improvement.\"  Only 2 lesions are visible, having shrunk from 6.3 to 3.7 and 4.8 to 4.2 cm since December.  Still have some ascites though. This explains why there wasn't as much to report - I'm getting a bit better. Silly me. Still, no bone info.  I'll get an x-ray to see if anything jumps out since my bones really hurt.  Maybe there will be more in the chest scan -- my ribs are killing me. McDreamy said he looked at the chest CT and didn't see any lesions in my lungs.  Ooooooh.  That's good.

It`s hard to predict what will happen. The cancer could respond and your sister end up cancer-free for years.  Or it may come back quickly.  It`s all a guessing game.  It can also take a few tries of different chemos to find one that works and works for a long time. It seems that responses to chemo are as individual as we each are.  Yah, sucks, but what can we do. You`re a good sister.  And please let us know how it goes.  Hugs, Elizabeth",

      "Content": "May 20, 2011 08:02PM - edited May 20, 2011 08:06PM by konakat Hi! My pain is getting more manageable -- still need to tweak the dose so I'm not zoned out or in excruciating pain if I don't take the break-through meds soon enough.  We'll get it right soon. I get my transfusion on Sunday -- 2 bags and over 4 hours.  I've never had one before and it kinda freaks me out -- some stranger's icky goo in my veins.  I know it's safe, just icky.  This weekend in Canada is a long weekend (Victoria Day) and the unofficial kick-off for summer and gardening.  For a fun snack and to celebrate I'm thinking of bringing in tomato juice with celery sticks and little umbrellas and tell the other patients I'm getting the expedited version of the infusion.  I never drink clamato juice -- I feel sorry for the clams. My brain scan on Wed was very bizarre.  When I got up to walk to the table I got dizzy (like that's never happened before!) and hit the floor, in sweetie tech's arms. He said I had a seizure -- only lasted a few moments though.  I told him I didn't think so, I just passed out.  He countered by saying I was twitchy.  I replied that sometimes I twitch from dizziness.   I did crack him up when I said I was relieved that I had undies on with the way I was splayed out -- he doesn't get a peek without at least a drink first! What was weird was that everything went white around me just before it happened. When I woke up it felt like I had a long dream -- frolicking in the Caribbean.  My tech's from the Caribbean so that makes sense.  But it felt so long I was surprised that I was only out of it for a short while. It will be an interesting next few days.   I hope this \"siezure\" isn't a sign for what my scan results will be like.  Thanks for all of your support. Hugs, Elizabeth",

A girlfriend with metastatic colon cancer was doing pretty well until she had a tooth abscess, went septic and died within 3 days.  Still pisses me off that this happened -- she never took enough care of her teeth.  But once an infection gets a grip it's hard to combat it with a crapped out immune system. ",

Now is the time to really take care of ourselves, both physically and emotionally.  If the docs do suggest chemo, tell them you don't want to do taxol, there are some that are much more gentle -- Gemzar is one of them.  You keep your hair, no aches, no nausea -- I wish they all were like this! Think about giving your PCP a call on Friday or Monday to talk about this and get some anti-depressants to help take the edge off all you are going through.  Please take care of yourself.

Navelbine (didn't work, June 2010) Navelbine + Carboplatin (Aug 2010 -- working great!!) Wishing all the best for you and your sister. Elizabeth",

I'm loving all these posts sweet friends.  You always cheer me up!! I think I'll eat cake this weekend, and since I'm already miserable, try on my bathing suit to see how it fits.  Maybe put on my snorkel gear too to get the whole picture.  Maybe buy another suit.  Might as well go whole hog (pun intended).  And I'm not going to stress about losing those 25 pounds.  If you're over-weight don't you love those looks and people wondering, you're fat and you have cancer?

I do nothing much, hang out on the boards, watch TV, read.  Now I have the excitement of packing and painting the gawd-awful black and red walls we did in the basement.  Oh wait, I had to get my cat to pee in a cup the other day -- she wouldn't give up any pee at the vet's so it was up to me.  She was taunting me -- walking to the litter box, pausing, walking away, getting in, getting out...  Exciting life, eh?  Although I'll miss my b/f I'm excited about going home.

Just be cautious on what you read, who you listen too.  Make sure they're reputable.  And then you can do what's best for you.  As I said on another thread, check the Stage IV thread and see a lot of women that are surviving, and living well. Best of luck Monday -- I hope you are well. ELizabeth",

Soooooo, here's scoop.  I learnt a new word today -- sulcus.  This is the valley of the brain's wiggly shapes.  The hill is called the gryus.  I have a bunch of lesions in my sulci (that sounds rude, or like an STD) in the right frontal region, left occipital region, and right frontal sulci.  The right frontal ones are larger than seen in Jan.  There are fewer lesions than what showed in the Jan MRI but they write this off as that it used a different MRI technique (it was dust on the lens!!  Hahahaaa).  But there's more!!  All of my spine has lesions (no surprise there).  And, the marrow between C2 and C3 has mets too.  This is new.  In summary:  There are multiple enhancing lesions involving the leptomeniges of the cerebral hemisphere in keeping with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.  Extensive bony mets to spine. I'm quite calm about this -- it'll probably sink in when I see McDreamykins. I guess a lumbar punch is in the cards.  Once I know everything I'll tell Mum.  Now that will be a treat.  Poor Mum, I hate making her sad. And thank-you for all the warm thoughts and wishes -- it really helps knowing that you are here.  Love, Elizabeth",

I'll still have fun on my vacation last week of Jan -- and I won't worry about spending, drinking, eating, or cavorting too much.  Well, not much energy for cavorting but I'm always game for some help with the sunscreen from a sweet cabana boy...  Cripes -- do I have a spinal tap to look forward to when I get back?  Gotta get some old heavy metal to listen to.  I am going to have fun before we start a new treatment, whatever that will be.  I don't see McDreamy (onc) until Feb 1 and I hope he doesn't think to call me in earlier -- I will wait until Feb 1. So, that's the latest scoop of poop.  Blech! Elizabeth's Mantra: When in doubt, eat cake. When you haven't a clue, add ice cream. Elizabeth's Mets: Liver, bones, brain (yuck), and lungs (more yuck).

I've also heard of a great support group/organization on Toronto -- Willow -- http:///www.willow.org  In the subject of support -- the GTA ladies had just had a get-together last month and are planning one late summer in Niagra-on-the-lake.  I hope to get down to the Toronto area to meet these women -- they've been wonderful.  I'll bump up the Canadian healthcare thread to the top of the forum for you.

I don't have to get a lumbar puncture since the MRI confirms the leptomenigeal mets.  I will get 10 WBR zaps starting in 1-2 weeks.  I managed to keep a straight face and told him I wanted him to do me as soon as possible.    Gawd, I just wanted to throw him on the examination table and have my way with him.  OK, back to serious stuff...  He says it's too risky to zap my spinal column since I've had so much chemo and my bone marrow is already crap (i.e., low platelets, etc.).  The WBR will take care of everything. SEs include hair falling out (may or may not grow back in), loss of some memory, loss of some cognition, maybe a stumbling gait (I can join Monty Python's Ministry of Silly Walks!).  These SEs will develop slowly, even after the rads is complete.  I may not be able to drive again (F*CK!!!!!!!!!!!).  I asked Dr Delish if he'd buy my car and he said no.  Dr. McDreamykins was on holiday so I saw another doc.  It was just chit-chat -- cancel my chemo and zometa until after the rads.  Schedule my port flush instead.  See him in 4 weeks. I told Mom -- she handled it well but does wonder how I'll get out to visit her -- I'll figure that out later.  When I was being told about the SEs all I could think was that I will become Mom.  Mom and I joked that we will sit around the kitchen table, both asking the same question or telling the same story over and over again.  I was too chicken and kinda forgot to ask about my prognosis.  I know it's grim but I want to know what they think.  Who knows, maybe I'll fool them like I did last summer and stick around for a while. I'm not really upset, maybe in shock?  But I'm counting on cracking myself up as I become goofy.  I should start a new thread when I start the rads to observe my slow decline.  Aren't I morbid?  So, that's it. Thank-you again for sticking by my side.  It means so very much to me.",

Mom gave me cab fare for the 2 weeks.  I hope I don't have to give up driving for very long.  Mom lives out in the country so it will be cab, bus, cab to get to her place. This is a major pain in the patoutie, but the alternative (no rads) is a wee bit worse.  Still looking forward to getting goofy.  Hours of laughs for all!  But then, maybe I won't since my lesions are teeny and haven't taken over masses of my noggin. ",

I remember snorkling in the Great Barrier Reef.  The first time I saw a shark dozing on the bottom I freaked.  The next times someone yelled shark I went to see.  One evening (we spent 4 nights there over New Years!) the captain tossed some fish food pellets into the water and there was a feeding frenzy of sharks.  The next night was a night dive and you couldn't pay me enough to get in the water! I'll stick to the daytime thank-you.  I'm scared of mackos and tiger sharks.  Apparently Great Whites just take a taste and usually spit you out. I was amazed that the past couple of years about 5 great whites were tagged near Cape Cod.  Still went swimming -- I was hoping they'd be more attracted to the splashing kids.  That's my dream -- a cage dive with great whites.  I probably have so many chemicals seeping through my pores that it's a shark deterrent.",

We have our hopes pinned on each chemo we try. There are more chemos that you can try if you get bad news.  Also, since you're in Kingston (and close to Ottawa, Toronto) you are close to quite a few research hospitals.  Ask your onc about clinical trials. You've had a lot of sadness in your life lately.  It's no surprise that it's taking longer than usual to pick yourself up again.  You will when the time is right.  And you and your onc will come up with a new plan to kick BC's butt. Edit:  Oooh, just re-read my post -- I'm not saying that you have more BC, but if it is, it probably won't be a new primary.  Let's hope for some good news!! Gentle hugs, Elizabeth",

Lisa -- I'll check out those websites and look for the person you mentioned. Yan -- my rad onc says he does either 5 day or 10 day zaps but prefers 10 day zaps (maybe we're all weenies here in Ottawa).  He wants to use a lower dose for a longer time to be gentler. Hmmm.  Olga's onc must think she has a strong consitution and will best be served with the 5 days.  Maybe my deer-caught-in-the-headlights expression made him want to play it safe! I'm also going to ask him about driving.  I remember our dear LisaSDCA could drive after a few months time too.  I stopped for a few weeks last year to play it safe.  I don't want to drive if I shouldn't/can't.  Athena, etc -- I like to know my prognosis, especially if it's awful.  Then I feel so good when I beat it.  If it comes true it won't be such a shock.  If it doesn't I can wear a smirk around the hospital, feeling all special.  It doesn't make me give up or anything, it gets me competitive!  Sort of like, oh yeah?  You think I'm gonna kick the bucket?  Just watch and see... It is just so strange that I don't feel sick!  Since I'm curious like a cat I'm actually looking forward to the WBR to see what it's like.  Unfortunately if I don't like it tough beans for me! Off to surf around the boards.  I'll try not to create a ruckus for a while.  But if my brain goes wonky this month, well....  Love you all, Elizabeth Edit:  I'm gonna tell him about driving, not ask!  Really, if I'm OK...we'll see...but I won't if I can't.",

Your liver lesions could be benign since you haven't seen any shrinkage -- maybe you can get a biopsy on them?

(thinking about my hair loss, feeling ill).  Yes, it is traumatic -- but your hair feels soooooo good coming in all soft and new.  Mine started growing when I took the break for the 2nd surgery and keeps on growing during my Taxol.  Thank god skipping chemo was a passing thought -- go for the chemo!  Go for anything they offer.  It's your arsenal to beat the disease!!  Once your treatment is scheduled you will feel more in control and empowered. If you want to work through the treatments, which I have done, I have 2 suggestions.  I got chemo on Friday, rested on the weekend and took the Monday off -- the worst side effects seem to happen on days 3-4.  I felt a bit queasy on the Tues and Wed, but by Thursday I was back to normal.  Another idea, which I wish I had done -- and is good if you want to take the minimum of days off.  Have chemo on the Wed and the worst days you can handle over the weekend. AND, make sure your oncologist and nurses know exactly how you are feeling -- there are excellent drugs to combat the side effects.  Don't be shy -- they want to know and help you get through this!! When your treatment first starts it seems soooo long -- but once you start x-ing off the days it goes pretty fast.  To help pass the time getting the chemo I sit in the non-TV room -- it's nice to chat with the others there.  Also, these breastcancer.org groups are great -- keep coming back -- the women here have really helped me. Also, see about doing the American Cancer Society's Look Good Feel Better course -- your oncologist or nurse can tell you how to do this.  The evening is a blast -- very fun and you get tons of excellent makeup to take home!! I wish every new patient and soon-to-be-cancer-suvivor all the best.  This is all about you -- take every opportunity to do things for yourself -- take every offer of help -- once you are feeling better you can give your thanks in turn.   I've never been a joiner of support groups, I've only looked at these boards and have drawn a lot of strength and encouragement. Best wishes Elizabeth",

I've seen quite a few women here who are stable with liver mets, and have been so for many years -- so it's not all doom and gloom.  I never did get my liver biopsied -- since I was Stage IV from the get-go it was assumed that it was the same as my breast tumor.  Also, the tumor was in a very inaccessible place so we skipped it. So hang in there -- the treatments are do-able and not all of them cause you to lose your hair.  :-)  Let us know how the biopsy goes, and what your treatment will be.  We're here to cheer you on!!
