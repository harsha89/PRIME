Something has just felt off for the past six months. I've gone to the doctors multiple times for just being tired all the time but it's like they don't take me seriously. And now I have I'm lump. I guess the doctor from the ultrasound freaked me out. ",

I went ahead and got the ultrasound report and after reading it and reading what all you have wrote I have decided to get the lump taken out completely and biopsied. The report said that there are ill defined margins and internal vascular flow is detected and that cancer should not be ruled out. The ultrasound doctor and the breast specialist obviously have different opinions so I need to look into it further. And if it is nothing at least I can finally put my mind at ease. Thank you all again for the help.",

The doctor there said it did not look normal and wanted me to get a biopsy done to rule out cancer. The results were sent to my general practitioner who referred me to a specialist. He looked at the ultrasound and examined my breast and said it is a fibroadenoma and just to monitor it. I am only 23 but bc does run in my family. Why would one doctor be worried and the other one blow it off? Should I demand a biopsy? Log in to post a reply",
