I wasn't too crazy about his bedside manner at first, but he is very knowledgeable and I have to say, he did a great job on my surgery. He was able to get clear margins and my scars healed great. I really liked Janet, his office manager. She always returned my calls and walked me through all of the insurance and authorization procedures. I am now moving on to reconstruction after radiation and chemo. I know there is not a lot of info for Vegas doctors on here, so if you have any questions, please PM me! :)",

Are they any girls out there that have done taxotere ans didn't physically fall apart?????",

I got stage 4 diagnosis this year and all I can think about is that I may not be able to see my baby girl grow up. I cry myself to sleep many nights worrying about that and I come to the boards hoping to find stories like yours. They give me hope. May God bless you with many many more years!! Please keep checking back with us!",
