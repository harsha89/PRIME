      "Content": "admomma8 wrote: Hey all, I am new to this site but needed some place to put out my emotions and feelings as I don't think I\"ve slept since this whole testing process started. Little infor: 29yoF with 2 kids! I went into my Primary Care (we're military so PCM), with a rash in my cleavage (more like a big red mark), and my left breast caving inwards (with retracting nipple). The best way to describe it is, my left boob looks like I have a popped breast implant (I don't have implants!). My PCM put a referral in to the Breast Cancer Clinic, and a mammogram and US appt. In the military, we then call radiology and schedule (I scheduled for 2/16), and then wait 3 days for referrals and call to schedule. WELL the very next day the breast cancer clinic calls and said, \"Based on your referral, we'd like to see you as soon as possible, can you come tomorrow?\" EEK, immediately I'm on edge. At the clinic, the doctor looked at my chest, she sent me to dermatology for the red mark (it's gone away with steroid cream! One symptom down!). I first was sent back for mammogram, they did both breasts, went and waited. Mammogram wanted MORE just of my left breast (the sinking one!). Went back there again. Then Ultrasound wanted me. They did their thing, left the room, came back and wanted more. I'm 4 hours into this appt now and freaking out. The radiologist himself came in and wanted to see my boobs! He came in and said my US looks fine but he really doesn't like my Mammogram pictures, there are some assymetrical issues, please don't leave the hospital, go eat lunch and come back in an hr he needs to chat with my doctor. I could barely eat lunch Come back an hour later....they do another Mammogram at a higher pressure on my left breast. Wait around. The radiologist calls me back into the viewing rooms. Shows me the first set of images that he didn't like. There is a undefined area in my boob looks not good (I don't have clinical terms!), and you can see where the wall of my breast is caving in (this is at like 14 lbs pressure). Then he shows me the image of the 40 lb mammo. And he says I like this picture, you can't see the mass we saw. He asked if I have had a trauma to my boob (seat belt, dumbbell etc.) I told him no I have had NO chest injury. He (being the radiologist), said it might be a fat necrosis, from an unknown injury. since the 3rd image was better than the first two. Here's where I'm still freaking out, please tell me if any one has anything similar to share: 1. I have had no injury to my boob to have a fat necrosis. I would know, as all women would, if i had a blow to my left chest/boob! That's like asking a guy if they are sure they didn't get kicked in the balls! They'd know! Lol 2. Why in the higher pressure image is it ok that the first two images showed a not so pretty spot, and my breast wall sinking? I feel like obviously if you put 40 lbs on my boob it will flatten out...but when there isn;t 40 lbs on my boob it's STILL caving in!! There is still a mass in there! I'm confused! HELP 3. The radiologist is happy with 1/3 images so he's convinced it's the fat necrosis. However, the breast doctor wants me to go in for a Breast MRI (Friday). Why the breast MRI if the radiologist is satisfied? Because it's probably not fat necrosis? 4. I have two kids, can I request a double mastectomy to just be done with these issues (i'd rather have no boobs than boobs prone to issues, or deflating boobs) so my kids can not have to go through all this with me? Sorry for the rambling, this is what circles my mind when I can't sleep! Log in to post a reply",

The first appointment was such an anxiety-ridden one that I felt frazzled the whole time! Is it normal for something to \"disappear\" under higher pressure just for picture? I guess I am not comforted by that, since it's clearly still there, it was just squished really heavily! I do like that the Breast Doctor is sending me for the MRI even though the radiologist is convinced it's fat necrosis. I'm not convinced, seeing as how I have never had a trauma to that breast. I really appreciate all of the answers and the chance to get some of this off my chest!",
