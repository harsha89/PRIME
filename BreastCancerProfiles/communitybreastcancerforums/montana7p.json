I'm inclined to think it's something related to surgery or radiation -- scar tissue impinging on something, radiation damage, shoulder shifting from tightness from surgery and impinging on a nerve.  I'm making all of this up, but carpal tunnel just doesn't make sense to me.  I'd be interested in knowing if you get anywhere.  The numbness in my fingers is really annoying.",

      "Content": "montana7p wrote: I have been lurking on this website for the past year and a half.  I am a year out from chemo and am now dealing with both fear of recurrence as well as the decision about ovarian suppression. I know there is a hormonal therapy thread, but I thought I'd post this here since it seems that the recommendation for supression is based on the aggressive nature and staging of my diagnosis. I am 40 years old and had been in chemopause for the past year, but my FSH levels have been declining for the past 3-6 months and at the end of April I had my first period. My skin looks good and I've been feeling like maybe I could shed the disgusting fat around my belly.  I actually desired to have sex for the first time in over a year which was fabulous. BUT...I had the dreaded ovary discussion with my oncologist today about suppression which he recommends. I am so sad about it.  I know I should do everything possible to prevent recurrance. Is this a clear-cut choice for me? Any words of wisdom from those having been in the same boat are appreciated.

My radiation oncologist perscribed the domeboro soak 3-4 x per day and then either using aquaphor or 100% hydrous lanolin (very gooey and sticky) as the only other topical treatments 2-3x/day. In retrospect, I think what makes it heal is a little bit of time. I'd say I was pretty uncomfortable for about two weeks. Now, on Sept. 13, I am happy to report that the only way I'd know is from the suntan outline. My radiation oncologist offered vidocin for sleeping and if it was really bothering me during the day. I took it on and off for about a week. So, hang in there while you're all red. Mine really started to turn the corner about a week after the rads were finished and healed pretty quickly after that. You can do it!",
