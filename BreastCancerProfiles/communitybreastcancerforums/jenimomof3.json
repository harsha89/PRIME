      "Content": "Jan 6, 2013 09:13AM - edited Jan 6, 2013 09:54AM by jenimomof3 I have been lurking for a couple of weeks, but have decided to join in on this topic.  I am currently scheduled for a mastectomy (right) and immediate reconstruction on January 24, 2013.  I am a 46-year-old mother of 3 (23, 17 and 15), and was diagnosed with DCIS and IDC on November 29, 2012.  Thankfully, most of what was found was DCIS - the area of IDC was very small and was a grade 1.  I had an MRI on 12/12 and they found another area of concern, which is why I am now scheduled for a mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. I am nervous, but at the same time I am eager to start a new chapter in my life.  I met an awesome lady at our auction house a few weeks ago who was diagnosed with lung cancer and is having her lung removed this month.  She told me she saw her situation as a new beginning, and was excited about the possibilities the future holds for her.  She has inspired me to try to see,my situation in the same way. Thank you all for sharing your stories and experiences.  I have found these boards to be very helpful in educating me on what to expect and what to plan for prior to my surgery.  I am trying to plan ahead and figure out what I need to take with me to the hospital and what to expect when I come home. ",

The pain is minor - the most troublesome thing for me is those darn drains, but there's not a ton of drainage either, so I'm dealing with it.  Trying to figure out how to put those drains in the pockets on my cami without looking like i have a growth underneath my top is a bit of a challenge too!  LOL Reconstruction (free tram) is scheduled for February 18.  I was not thrilled about going under anesthesia twice, having two hospital bills, two recoveries, etc., but there was no getting around it, so it is what it is. Prayers and healing thoughts have been coming from me on a daily basis to everyone who is going through this. ",
