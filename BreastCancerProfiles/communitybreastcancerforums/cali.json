I have been getting 500 (somethings) of Taxol and 500 (somethings) of Carbo by IV on Saturday, followed a few days later by a 2 week course of oral 5FU (Xeloda). After the Saturday infusion, I try to work from home on Tueasday, and return to work on Wednesday. I feel like crud, though, and wonder if it is hurting my career to show up in poor shape. (BTW is chemo fog/chemo brain real?) So, basically I am working full-time through chemo, with two days away from the office for each treatment. Is this normal? Thanks!Â ",
