Still have a pretty numb chest wall. Had therapy, learned massage to trunk, bought a sleeve for flying, LE resolved, and that's been about it till last Thursday. I don't know why or what I did but I just blew right up. Chest wall, armpit, shoulder and entire arm swelled. OH crap does that hurt!!!!!! It's also my right arm so I was fairly useless for about 2 days, had to keep stopping and resting my arm to get the throbbing under control. Have been wearing my sleeve and glove and massaging at night and I'm much better. Don't know how to wrap and so hoping I never need to learn. Now I'm just wishing I knew why. I know over the holidays I was not exersizing as usual and put on 5 lbs. I now need to lose about 25. Mabey that tipped me over the edge. Bless all you ladies that deal with this every day. After these last few days I can't even imagine but I know reality is that chances are I will have further problems. Any way to ease the pain when this happens?  Ibupropen and tylenol didn't help at all.

Just finished rads in Jan. The other night taking off my bra I noticed swelling on my mastectomy side. Saw PT this week - trunkal LE. I don't have any evidence in my arm at this point. Unfortunately it is my dominant arm on my affected side. I've had 2 PT appointments so far for drainage and to learn how to do it at home. I have 1 more appt. next week before I'm on my own. The therapist says the swelling is mild at this point and should be controllable ( she is certified). Also have a script for a gauntlet and sleeve for air travel. I just feel really overwhelmed and upset about this. I'm still dealing with nerve pain from chemo and have just started to be able to be semi-normal again. I want to think that this isn't some huge setback but I feel like I've been knocked down again. The thought of daily drainage and wrapping and sleeves and compression garments etc, etc, etc is just rather overwhelming right now. I'm sorry to whine. I guess I really need to hear what it is like managing this. How much does this interfere with your life? Any words of wisdom would be helpful.
