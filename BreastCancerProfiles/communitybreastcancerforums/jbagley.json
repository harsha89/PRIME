The only problem with it was, she used mandarin oranges. It hurt my mouth, but I drank some of it. She is trying so hard and doing a good job. She is my little nurse (I m a nurse as well). My hair has finally decided to leave me. It started really coming out the day after my second tx. Little sprills on top, that wont come out even when I pull on the,. Might have to get the razor out! I will be doind tx on mon, labor day--tues.) I want to thank everyone on here for all the support and answers. Jennifer (38 yrs old)",

Have you checked out the new click for breast cancer, stoneyfield farms is donating 0.10 cents for every click. I posted my story under Another Young Woman with breast cancer. It can be linked to your face book or twitter. I also have a web site on you tube that is very relaxing. Angels with relaxing music. This video is awesome. The lady has painted all the pics of angels and composed it into a video. I found it last night around 1am eastern time. Grimbol--sorry you are not feeling well. Ativan really does help. I guess I'm a pill pusher too, with ya vtEllen.phenergan suppositories work too if yyou end up going to er for fluids, ask to have some sent home with you. I worked as nurse in an er for 7fluids yrs before becoming FNP. ((((Hugs)))) jennifer",

Their thought was who would take care of the paperwork when I was on my chemo week.......but everyone is already doing that. My patients are upset that I am out. I have been in contact with some of them through email and facebook (the ones I trust anyway) I have seen some at walmart etc. Once I tell them what is going on, they are flabergasted.

It is pink with darker pink ribbons imprinted on it. So I am walking around and on the way out this older lady stops me and asks if I am in treatment. I said yes, 3 of 8 done. She says to me, \"I am a 4 yr survivor\" I am glad yoy cae back this way. I gave her a big hug and congratulated her. She wished me luck with my treatments. She said the hair will grow back. The other one is: I was wearing a pink bc braclet, the rubber kind. I got off the pink ribbon store. I had gotten 5. So on the way out this older gentleman stopped me and asked where I got the bc bracelet. I told him online. He had been looking all over the place for one, because his wife was just diagnosed with bc. I took it off and gave it to him. He had tears in his eyes and gave him a big hug too. He immediately put it around his wrist. I feel I will be her angel. I started crying on my way out. I made a little difference iin someones life,. HOPE, COURAGE, LOVE!!

I go for #4bc tomorrow, have to be there for blood draw at 740, that's the earliest yet. Gotta get zach to daycare then abby on the bus then scoot to lafayette cancer center which is about 30 min away. My s/e usually start day 2, nausea, icky feeling, then on day 32 I am so fatigued, I have a had time getting up over my stairs to get to the bathroom. so we all have s/e but we are all different. I whine a lot and cry a lot after chemo. I think it is the chemo, it has happened after every tx I have had. I sometimes just start, sometimes I don't even have the enery to cry. Hope everyone has a safe holiday. To those who are post tx, you are in my heart, sending healing energy to. (Reiki energy). Soon to be reiki 2. Jennifer. Hugs, <3",

We need to ven to someone and we all understand what each other is going through. Our family's are there for us and supporting us but they truly don't know what we are feeling inside. The fatigue, the crying, (I find that I am terribly emotional days 3-6) the nausea. We are here for each other!! So if we have to whine, whimper or what ever, go for it. It needs to come out, we can't keep it bottled up, its not good for the cancer cells that we are tryiing to kill! I am on day 3, my tastes started going south late last night, little nausea so far, waiting for the fatigue to hit, usually starts in the evening on day3. We will see. Eyes are weeping pretty bad, have a hankerchief next to me at all times! For all having se, I wish I could take it all away. ((((Hugs)))) to all jennifer",

I got on the news feed with my daughter. The survivors went up on stage and a woman was singing I Will Love You Through It by Martina Mcbride.

About anything!!!!!! That's really what we are here for, companionship and compassion through a really tough ordeal. We need this. My onc doc stated that there is def a shortage of Taxol. But the center that I go to has some in stock. I might get some of it. If not Dosi-Taxol is a sister drug which is prob what I might get at some point. my next treatment starts in 2 weeks and it will be taxol (i hope). DebinUtah--Some other great relaxing music is Reiki music. You can find it at Amazon or any other type bookstore. Anything for Reiki music is soothing and meditative. I listen to it every night before I go to bed. I have to agree to someone's post, that A/C causes insomnia. I sometimes don't get to sleep until 11 or 12, then wake up to go to the bathroom around 1 or 2 and find it hard to get back to sleep.  To everyone else, hope this week is a good one.

His last day nurse before he was discharged sat down and talked to him about being the support partner. Her husband had colon cancer and was on chemo. She sat right down with him and told him he needs to get involved with some type of support group for the spouse. I was really impressed because he is taking it all serious. He is the type to hold it all in. I have emailed him a couple of threads from this site for caregivers. I had the taxol on Monday without any reaction. I was good on day 2 and day3 which was when my hubby was in the hospital. I kept it together pretty good. I was in \"nurse\" mode. Day 4, I crashed. My whole body ached really bad. Even my fingernails hurt. I now have some numbness in toes and fingers. Not too bad, but noticable. Vtellen, I am still praying for you. It could just be a plain fluid filled cyst, since the taxotere isn't touching it. Hugs to all and everyone who had tx, praying for minimal se. love u all jennifer",

Great present. I need to schedule a mapping and simulation with rads dr. Summergirl, very good idea about fb page! Not moderated. It will be good to keep in touch and talk candidly! I have had numbness and tingling in my fingers since the last taxol. I went to Mt. Marie, South Paris, Maine yesterday and found a lot of quartz crystals. Tourmaline and lepidolite. It was so much fun. Digging through the dirt. It was one of the best days since my BC diagnosis! Love and hugs Hope minimal side effects! Jennifer Fb name. Jennifer Bagley.",

Keep your chin up, if you want to go to the dinner, go. Do what you need to do for you. My last tx is oct 31. I probably wont be able to take my daughter trick or treating. Taxol on Monday. My last one was #4 A/C, it has kicked my butt. I have only had 3a good days. The last 2one I have been tired, have had a headache since wed, can hear my heart beating in my ears all the time. My hematocrit was 9 last visit, they are prob around 8 now. They might give me aranesp. Along with neulasta. I've heard aranesp can cause blood clots. I feel better lying flat then sitting in a chair..... Anyway, hope everyone has se free weekend. hugs jenn",

My husband, family and really close friends have been so supportive of me. I've had more than 10 ppl ask if I need them to watch the kids or drive me to treatments etc. Everyone has been helpful. The only person that has been negative is my brother. He doesn't understand the cancer or. Just scared. To everyone that is having bouts of depression and being down. When I start crying or blubbering about my BC, he says. \"This to shall pass\" he says this at least 3 times a day and says the bald thing is only temporary, your hair will grow back! The things that I have learned from this dx of BC is: 1. I am a lot stronger than I thought I was. 2. I have a lot more friends then I thought I had. And they are very supportive. 3. I am going to be able to relate to more of my patients then before. If I open up my own practice, I am going to offer a support group. 4. I have strong healing reiki energy and nothing is going to stop me. I am going to live life to the fullest. 5. One step at a time, one day at a time.
