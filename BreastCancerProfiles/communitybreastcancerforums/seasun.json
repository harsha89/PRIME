I am stage 3B and was so sick for 5/10 days after each FEC. Taxotere was bad but FEC was worse. I can only speak for myself and my own SE though. Six weeks of radiation after was nothing compared to the FEC. Now, 2 weeks after last Rad's skin is healing and fatigue is getting less and less.",

But I have just had my 4th treatment (3 of FEC and one of Taxotere). But I know the drugs are working even though for the first 7-10 days afterwards they make one sick. Hang in and the folks at this website offer so much information not found anywhere else. Good luck to all - Valerie",
