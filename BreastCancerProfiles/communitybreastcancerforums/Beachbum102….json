I am still seeing peeling mostly now the boost area over the scar. I am distressed about the scar, it looks larger and puckered. It will turn red when I shower or rub Aloe on it. My armpit is still a bit tight, but I am working on that. The big deal was the look of it. My Dad was burned when I was 9 years old, and the visual of a burn makes me nauseous. Weird reaction but anything that looks like a burn makes me ill and weak in the knees.  My other big complaint, is the struggle to keep the pads on to keep it covered. I had the stretchy tube wrap and all it did was roll up. So I got out some ribbon and made festive shoulder straps to look like a cami top. That worked wonders, and kept it all in place, and comfortable!! No tape, and I could safety pin the pads to the fishnet. I could also wear my soft form just by pinning it to the fishnet. So a huge win for my recovery. I hope this may help someone struggling to stay covered and heal.",

Let's try to go with it is nothing until it is something, and then you roll on it as hard as you can! So relax, do something you love to do this weekend, and see what we have to fight.

Stay away from Dr. Google, the info is usually outdated and incorrect or just plain wrong. Having a positive proactive attitude will serve you well. I do not have any history of breast cancer or any cancer in my family. So stunned would be correct. But I have a great care team, and my treatment has moved along quickly. Keep a notebook handy to write down questions for your Doctors, the information will come at you fast and non-stop. If you have someone to take to your appointments to help keep notes, that can be helpful. Some record it on their smartphones. Ask questions here, we have all been there, so you will find answers for all of your questions. And we have hints and tips for just about anything! The women here are amazing! You will feel better when you have all of the info, have a care team in place, and get started with treatments. The American Cancer Society has a great website, and they can be helpful. They have a lot of resources to help navigate treatment, find resources, and they offer some great programs along the way. Please visit here often, and let us all know what we can do to help. There are a lot of threads to follow, to laugh, to cry, and rant and compare. But remember here you are never alone, we all walk as one! Welcome! Cheryl",

And I worked full time 42 hour weeks. Not sure how I did all that, but it is a blur right now. I am seeing my RO tomorrow to schedule to start the rads. I am just afraid that by doing the rads to prevent a return, that the mets will grow crazy and I will second guess if I should have gone back to chemo asap. The rads scare me because I have heart damage from the Adriamycin, some side effect that is. The Tumor Board agree that I should do the rads then chemo. Depressing for sure. I really wanted my hair back for summer. So I get the swing from high to low, good days and bad days. I try to keep it all happy and positive, but I feel like I take steps backwards all the time. I was told that because we so depend on our care teams that when things change we react badly because we fear what could happen without them. And when our heads go to the dark place, it can be very depressing and confusing. It's cold and snowing, no sun, I live alone, and I am not working so I can go to treatment. I totally understand the \"blues\". And soon as we complete the treatment, we think we should all good to go, 100%! Uh no not really. I'm still fighting the side effects that linger, trying to recover from a mastectomy, and now rads?? And more chemo?? So for the rads graduates, any helpful info you can share to get through this hurdle? Thanks!",

This is a one hit wonder treatment plan for me. Or as I call it, go big or go home! It is painless, quick, and the days go by fast. I have #10 today already. I apply 100% clear Aloe Gel after rads, and several times during the evening. I wear soft tees and no bra to promote healing and keep the area clean and dry without pressure. And I still follow healthy eating and consume plain water to hydrate. And a walk does the body and soul good! I hope your rads go fast, and well!",

They said that my head had to be exact for the radiation and the tattoos. Well the radiation is for the boob I no longer have, so what does the head have to do with it?? The second day I left it on, and nobody said anything. Every day since as soon as I give the info, they tell me take it off. I get the fact that they need to line up the tattoos, so they have to see them. But why can't they cover my chest after they line it up? If the rads go all the way through my body, I would think it would make it through a little washed out hospital gown! After going through chemo and surgery I am finding radiation to be a different day. I loved all of my other nurses and techs, but the ones I have for radiation are not on my A list. They have a \"all business\" attitude, and not a warm fuzzy feeling from any of them. They are not so friendly, use Sharpie markers like I am a whiteboard, and never tell me much. I asked them about the dose of radiation, and I was told it pretty complicated but I could ask my RO. And when I asked for information about side effects, I was told we deal with that when it happens. Happens?? Exactly, what happens and when does it happen, and how do you plan on fixing it?? Grrr......I will so glad that I never have to go back there! We do have a very nice lighted 3 panel tropical beach scene on the ceiling to look at, my favorite place!",

I had a great view for chemo, and the nurses are fantastic. So having to go to the Cancer Center triples my drive each way, and I am not so fond of the people there. I feel a disconnect, just not sure why. I feel like I am just a number moving through my rads there. So I am glad that I won't have to go there often, just for my PET scans, and for follow up with my BS. Everything else I can do close to home at the CC. So I hope I am done after the next 18, and no boost week. I'm not too sure what that will do for me at this stage of the game.",

I called the nurses and told them what was going on, and they told me to call the PCP. They said I was too far out from chemo, so it probably wasn't that. But my pulse was racing, and I was concerned because of the heart issues that I have from Adriamycin. So I slept the rest of the night, and I feel fine today, other than the rads issues.

I wanted to know my Vitamin D level, and I was told to schedule an appointment to see my GP for that. Ok another Cha Ching in the cash drawer. Then I have heart damage induced by the chemo, Cha Ching off to the Cardiologist. I have a port, big Cha Ching off to the surgery center and the Vascular Surgeon. Then the port surgery was draining so my Oncologist sent me to the ER, and another big Cha Ching for the cash drawer. The ER Doctors did not resolve the issue, so off to the Vascular Surgeon again, and more bills. I had a mastectomy and had blood pressure issues after the surgery so that was 4 days admitted to the hospital. 4 days, I was scheduled as a 23 hour stay. I'm glad I had someone available to feed my fish. So now I have a bigger pile of bills. I have numb feet and hands so I was sent to a Neurologist for arthritis. Really? Maybe neuropathy from Taxol?? So I needed another Doctor to see me and tell me that it was from chemo. Shouldn't my Oncologist know that?? I also have a new Eye Doctor hopefully to correct my blurry vision. Still working on that one. My breast surgeon is shipping me off to the RO on Friday. Cha Ching another big day for the cash drawer. Along the way I acquired a second Cardiologist because my first Cardiologist did not have privileges at the hospital when I was admitted. I also found myself in X-Ray for my feet. The bone pain from the Taxol and Neulasta was unbelievable. It was so bad they thought that I had a broken foot. Report came back degenerative joints, so off to Ortho for a really snazzy moon boot. At least my toenails felt better, it had open toes. At this point, the only person in the building I haven't met is the Janitor!! Now after all that, I see the new RO on Friday. Sorry my rant went a tad long......My question is why do we need t-shirts etc. for rads? What do I really need for rads? How were the side effects, and when do they appear? Thanks Ladies",

I see the RO on Friday, but the rads may be refused at this time to start chemo, again! The MO is concerned about the mets in my abdomen and wants to start soon since the Taxol response wasn't good, and the breast tumor grew back and fast. The mets are very small and the MO wants to get them now before they start growing. So one thing to prevent the original breast tumor from coming back, but another to shrink the mets. Another round of run, worry, and wait and see. So I hope to have a better plan in place on Friday. I'll see how long that plan works.......geez it's exhausting!

I see many who are still dealing with issues left from the winter. I hope they all resolve soon. But I do see lots of recon coming as well. I had a failed immediate recon then rads, so I am thinking that it stops here. I've read a lot, but with the way they had to remove the tumor and close the mastectomy, I don't have much to work with. And all of the time off and recovery, I just don't see it for me. I want to finish healing, and lose the chemo weight I gained and get stronger. But I go back to work on Monday at my new job, so I think I want to focus on work, and finding me. And I want a summer to hit the beach, last year was spent at the Clinic for me. Then I'll think about doing recon, or not. But right now I am pretty happy not being a patient, and dealing with more physical issues. My head is in the game with one, and other than sorting out my clothes that don't work with my sexy sports bras, I'm ok with it.  Take Care everyone, I hope you are well. Cheryl  ",

I just got back from spin cycle and rode 14.0 miles on the recumbent spin cycle. I have knee issues so this works well for me. I am getting in shape, but losing weight, sadly not so much! Not sure why I can't drop pounds, but I have a appointment to see my PCP in a few weeks. I am exercising like crazy, and step counting, eating great, and still the fat stays. Just getting frustrated. Since I am tall, everyone tries to discourage me from losing pounds, but I gained 25 pounds during treatment and my clothes won't fit. I hope you enjoy LiveStrong, it is really a great program!

I start rads next week and my Oncologist wants me back in chemo, thank you Stage IV. I get it. And I forgot to get the Aloe Gel for rads, so back to Drug Mart!! Oh geez, this is exhausting...... Where is the quilt show?",

The tumor had attached to the skin, so the PS had to rearrange the skin so I have to heal before any reconstruction. Big surprise when I woke up, but it was so numb I couldn't feel it. But now at this stage of the game, I am not so sure I want to do. It is a large time and money investment to get through it, so I think I am going to pass. But I am 58, so that plays into it also. I am going to rads #4 today, nothing yet! Has anyone had a sore throat? The nurse said it can happen. And anyone with lung issues? Thanks!",

But I do have some questions that someone may be able to answer. I have several nodules in my lung and I also have mets in my abdominal lymph nodes. Does anyone else have this, and what is the treatment for this. My BS wants me to go for radiation as a preventative measure, but the MO wants to go to chemo again. So I am not sure of the benefits trying to prevent the breast cancer coming back in the breast area, or attacking the nodules and mets in the abdomen. I am concerned because I have permanent heart damage from the AC, and the Taxol regrew the original tumor. The tumor had shrunk almost 60% on AC, but 40% regrew in 6 weeks. So very scary, and I am triple negative also. So looking for \"big guns\" to take this on. Going back to chemo is annoying at this stage of the game. I wanted to move forward, but I feel like I am chasing a greased pig at the county fair! I have a hard time making a decision because I feel I don't have enough info to do so. But most of that comes from knowing what I have already learned from AC/T. Thank You! I hope everyone is staying warm, it's a low of 15 today! Go Bucks!",

Write down everything, and save every report. I have multiple binders from all of the info I have from the last 10 months.

It is disturbing because anyone that walks down the hall can see the monitor. I have asked for the radiation dose, and I was told it was complicated. I asked about side effects and they told me they would deal with it if it came up. What comes up? How do they plan on fixing it? I'm just very frustrated, and I can't wait to be done. Sadly I have 18 more days to go, and then she will decide how the skin looks if she is going to add 5 boost. I had a modified radical mastectomy with clear margins and I am Stage IV. Ain't no 5. Just what might come back? Being triple negative, and I cannot have AC/T ever again, my treatment options are limited. I am more concerned with living than fearful of it coming back.

But all the skin is still there so I hope to make it to the end without many issues. My big whine is the fatigue. I am dragging. I went from a whirlwind of appointments the first week of June, to 4 months of AC/T chemo, then 2 weeks later surgery, and now rads. I don't ever remember being this bone tired.

Thankfully this winter has been so easy for us West siders! And I stay West as much as possible to avoid the snow. I start rads next week, and I am dragging my fatigued butt to get there. I am not looking forward to it. I haven't heard much good about the whole thing, before or after! But for me it beats chemo. Thanks for sharing the quilt picture, I am sure she loved it!

I'm going to rad #4 Thursday, and my treatment area feels warm and tender tonight. I was told that I shouldn't notice anything until the end of week 3 or 4. Not so sure about that one. And all the sharpie dots, very attractive. I look like I got attacked by some crazed dot to dot coloring book artist! Seriously, I thought sharpie markers were school supplies. I'm glad that it's cold in Ohio, and I can cover it with a big collar and a scarf. So for those ahead of me, what should I expect to happen? I've seen some pretty scary things about rads.

And the price is great with lots of coupons to use online. Keep trying, it took me months to be comfortable! Cheryl",

I just had everything else! How are your feet/toenails and cuticles? I had skin peeling on the bottoms of my feet and around the toenails. And my skin is super dry, and dry cuticles. I found some wonderful products at Sally Beauty. I use Foot Therapy (small yellow box) to soak my feet and ankles. I love that stuff, it feels great! And I also get my cuticle oil there. I use new files every time I do my nails since I am concerned about any germs etc. But they also have the wig supplies too. I have a real hair wig, so it takes a little more to keep her pretty. But I love it, and it is relaxing in a weird way to sit and do \"my hair\". They also have the wig caps and silky pillowcases too. I was so fortunate to have a great assistant when I was there, she too has to wear wigs. So very helpful. Maybe a silky cap and pillowcase would be helpful to you so you could be comfortable. I hope you get some answers so you can feel better. Its so hard to sleep when you can't be comfortable.",

My eyebrows are a little off, but I fill them in with make up. I would try the Biotin it is cheap OTC. I usually watch the Drug Mart for when they have them on sale BOGO. But it is working very well for me. My nails are back also, and back to normal color. And strangely the nails are very hard. I finished AC/T on 11/25. I also use Johnson's Baby Shampoo and Pantene conditioner on my real hair. Not sure if that helps you at all, but I hope so. Good Luck! I hope it works for you.",

It is FREE for us, and the class here is 12 people, we are the first class. The 3 month membership is free so we can use all of the classes, pools, track, and machines any time. If it is available, I would highly recommend it. And I am losing weight, a bonus! I also walk 6000 to 9500 steps per day.  I do feel really good right now, 6 months out from Taxol. I just wish the exercise and Yoga had started sooner so I wouldn't have to lose the weight and get back in shape. Thankfully I was pretty fit when the shit bus hit me. All that exercise is really cutting the fatigue as well. After chemo, surgery, and rads it is nice to be tired from something other surviving treatment!  ",

I would work on Monday 10 to 8, on Tuesday I had chemo in the morning and worked from 3 to 8. On Wednesday I worked 10 to 8, and was off on Thursday and Friday. Saturday I worked 10 to 6 and Sunday from 11 to 5. I worked in a retail position so my days could be flexible to a point. I still had to get my hours in. On Monday mornings I would go to the blood lab for my CBC and metabolic panels, and on Wednesday I would go for my Neulasta injections. Exhausting for sure. But working with the public was also a problem. I had to be close to the bathroom for sure. Then I had my regular week, and back to the chemo schedule.  You may do better on your cocktail, it is different for everyone. But not a walk in the park for me. Looking back I am not sure how I did all that. But I did it. Hopefully you will have the desk position, and that should help you. Good Luck, I am sending a pile of hugs to be used when needed! Cheryl",

I hope you have your chemo bags ready to go, and are all set. If you have any questions I may be able to answer, just ask. Nobody here walks alone ever, and I am waiting at the finish line for you to meet me. Make sure you hydrate before chemo starts, it helps alot. I still drink about 4+ bottles of water a day. Stock the fridge for the days after chemo. Plan for easy small snacks, it does help to eat. Popsicles, Jell-O, cottage cheese, frozen grapes, juice, yogurt, fresh fruit, and mac and cheese helped me keep the nausea away. I always took the meds, it really helps to keep on schedule as needed. It is very difficult to keep nausea away if you do not take the meds. Brach's lemon drops help with dry mouth, Biotene mouthwash helps as well. Lip gloss and body lotion, cuticle oil, and Tums. Good to have some OTC for relief when you need them. I used baby shampoo on my head to keep my scalp clean. But the good news - my hair started to grow after the first Taxol infusion after AC. I was so happy to see that, and Biotin helps it grow. And your hair will come back as well. I will probably get a trim this week. So for all of the side effects, there are plenty of tricks to get ahead of them. I always took plenty of small snacks and bottled water for infusion day and I really felt better with something in my stomach. Seriously nausea was my big fear. I drank water, ate a lot of small meals and snacks, and never ever had to vomit. Maybe TMI, but it is a huge fear for more ladies than me only. But find a way to keep it at bay, and positive thinking helps. Good Luck Ladies, you got this! And with Easter soon here, take all the pictures of friends and family. You will still have your hair, and next Easter you will have it all back! :) ",

Have fun with your family, you have a whole lot of loving and living to do, don't waste that time on cancer. You have enough time to \"do\" cancer. Your husband must love you to the moon and back, take advantage of that. And your parents are coming to support you. That is fantastic to have so many caring and supportive fans in your corner. Save your tears and fears for when you come here to find support with all of us that get it. I can only give so much to cancer, I have given plenty and I am ready to move on and get my life back. Don't worry about your armpit, part of mine has moved a little after surgery. I was told after rads that the hair probably won't grow back and I won't sweat on my right side. Could be worse! And I know how scared you are, but so is every single person here on the boards. We wouldn't be normal if we weren't scared. It's okay to have a pity party now and again, just not a lifetime of pity. Stay here on the boards, you will meet the strongest and kindest women ever. Pour your heart out, and you will have all of the support you need 24/7. I so wish I could say that this is easy, nothing easy about it! But I will help you, nobody here ever walks alone. I am following those that have gone before me, and I am waiting for you. One step, one day at a time. Good Luck! Cheryl",

A positive attitude will serve you well, with a lot of patience thrown in. I am 58 and single, I so get having to carry the load. But I can focus on me, and not worry about all of the things life can bring to our day. Take care of you, that is so important now. This is all about you and your future. If you think you may want extra support, talk to your Social Worker. Join a local support group, or maybe confide in a special close friend. But take a long deep breath and try to relax and just focus on what you truly need. Before chemo I had a ECHO, CT, PET, MRI, US, and mammogram. And I always had a CBC and metabolic panel done the morning the day before chemo. It just depends on your Doctor. You may want to have your teeth cleaned before chemo. Your MO will tell you what you need and when. I also had my flu shot and my pneumonia shot but that has to be worked in around the chemo, ask your MO. They will get you going. I play games on my iPhone, read, cook, whatever works really. I made a necklace for a friend for Easter the other day. But it is best to stay busy, and keep your mind busy too. Exercise is great, or maybe a new hobby. Everyone finds a way to cope. So come here often, you will find everything you need here. But time spent worrying does not change the process or the outcome. But you can do this. Read through the other chemo threads, you will find a lot of help from the others that have started before you. Just ask, you will have a lot of help. Take care, let me know if there is anything I can you with. Cheryl",

It sounds like you are planning a party with all of your friends at chemo! Nice. and wonderful support. I always wore a bedazzled tiara to chemo. I told me nurses it had super powers. Yep a little crazy, but the laughs were so worth it. Then all 5 of the infusion nurses started to wear them every time I went to chemo, Tiara Tuesday! Maybe you need a little fun for your chemo group........just sayin. It was great fun. I even wore my tiara to my last day at rads. The Doctors and techs were cracking up when I went in to change and came out in a gown and tiara doing my happy dance. I find a little humor goes a very long way.

It really got in my head. I think going 33 times day after day was the rough part. And three weeks out my skin is still healing and wearing the bra with extra parts is very annoying. I go without it as much as possible. I worked all the way through chemo, not easy at all, but I kept a regular schedule and that helped. I am going to start looking for a new job Monday after Easter. I had travel time both ways and the rads so the time was tough for me. I spent about 1 1/12 hours total for each rad treatment, and the days with the Doctor ran longer. I was glad that I wasn't working. I am not too sure how I would have made that happen. But now that I am done, I will have a free schedule until I go back to chemo. So that should be easier.

I usually drink about 4 to 5 bottles of water per day! But the popsicles do count as a liquid when the water tastes weird. And I have margarita and pina colada ones, no alcohol. So they cool your mouth and throat, and count as a liquid. They usually have a lot of flavor so helps getting enough liquid.  For chemo I always took yogurt, celery, pretzels, water, mac and cheese for lunch, and bananas. Just small snacks to keep something in my stomach. I always felt better having all the drugs with a snack during the infusion. My worst fear was the nausea, and I never had a problem with vomiting. Never once! But I took my meds, drank a lot of water, and snacked. You just have to find what works for you.  Good Luck. Cheryl",

Nice fast results! The port incision is very small, about 1\", and I had no issues with it. I had it done at noon and went home as soon as I was awake. I worked 10 hours the day after. The annoying thing is the seat belt strap in my car. I have a cute small stuffed puppy that rides under my seat belt and keeps it off my port. And he makes me smile, a good thing!

The bloody nose was a nightly thing when I was on Taxol, but that is a rare occurrence these days. I have a large cool mist humidifier, and it helps a lot with breathing issues. So I'll wait and see what happens when summer arrives in humid Ohio. I just hope the Lake winds help me there.  The food was tricky on chemo. Something would sound good until I took a bite, and sometimes one bite and in the trash. Very annoying for sure. But I did well with mac and cheese, yogurt, fresh fruit, canned mandarin oranges, Jell-O, popsicles, whole milk, pudding, chicken, and noodles. Strange menu but the nurses said to eat whatever it took to not drop weight. A big success since I gained almost 20 pounds by the end of chemo. But it is coming off, slow and steady. I did not many restrictions on food, just fresh raspberries, strawberries, and lettuce. They did not want me to eat anything that could not be washed properly or peeled. But I am so glad to eat all of that now. Buy small amounts of food items until you know what works for you. I ate the same things over and over. And pass on the things you love, because you may have a strong reaction to it after chemo. Brings back all of memories from chemo. I thought that idea was bunk until now. I can't gag down mac and cheese or mandarin oranges. I liked to treat myself on the way home from rads to homemade ice cream and homemade hot fudge. But after 33 rads, my thighs are showing it. And I haven't craved it since rads.  I hope this helps, if not let me know. Been there done that! Cheryl",

Take someone you trust to the appointment so you gather all of the info. Record your appointments with your smart phone. Make notes so you can ask questions. The timing is slow, we all hurry up to wait for those appointments, and then hurry up to wait for the results, and on it goes. We all feel better when we control the process and the people. Look through the boards, there are excellent threads to answer some questions, but also to suggest what to ask the Doctors. Please remember that knowledge is power, and power will give you some control. Now is the time to be ready, ask all the questions, look at the info on the boards and be prepared when you see the Doctors. You can do this, it is amazing what one can do when the time is now to do it. Please visit us often, we all help each other get through this. Take Care.",

I had a larger tumor and chest wall attachment so I am now doing rads. The only pain is going every day. No big deal I have had sunburns worse than this. Poison ivy is more annoying than rads to me. So while we all have to make choices between treatments within the recommended protocols, we all do it. I haven't decided on reconstruction yet, but right now I will probably pass on it. The cost is limiting, the recovery time and surgery time is long and complicated to me. And at the end of the day, once I got it out of my head, I don't think I care to do it.

We need to attack it from any and every angle that we have available. The faith and love that your parents have is very powerful to them. But with BC we need everything we can find to stomp it out. Perhaps when you combine your treatments with your parents faith you will all be able to find peace and results! I wish you well, and I hope this resolves for you soon.",

I have 16 Doctors on my team. While I see a few on a regular basis, the other specialists are available to me anytime I need them. I prefer that team simply because I have constant \"second\" opinions for treatment, and I can change the plan if needed. On three separate occasions my case has been presented to the Tumor Board, and I am confident that they have developed a working plan for me. Once you have all of the info, you will be able to move forward and feel confident that all of the Doctors have a plan for the best outcome. Good Luck, I hope the waiting goes by quickly!",

There is so much to see here. The Emerald Necklace is something to see. The parks circle Cleveland and have so much to offer. Beautiful parks with miles of trails, and something different at each park. There are waterfalls, Indian carvings, caves, deer and abundant wildlife to watch. Mentor Headlands has natural sand dunes, and little mountain. But the wine festival at Geneva on the Lake will be so much fun. The town is very nice and looks like a time warp. Medina is also nice to visit with nice shops and good restaurants to visit. I like to go to Vermilion to visit the small shops and it has some very fun festivals in the summer. The Wooley Bear festival is a huge local event hosted by Dick Goddard from channel 8. For a fun evening try Blossom, it is the summer home of the Cleveland Orchestra, a true international gem. I love to sit in the grass with a picnic and enjoy the Orchestra. Playhouse Square offers wonderful entertainment, and has been a favorite of mine. I saw Momma Mia, Tommy, Jesus Christ Superstar, Camelot, and the Mexican Ballet there. They have so much to offer. Another favorite of mine is the Walleye Drop on News Years Eve in Port Clinton. A very fun street party to ring in the New Year. And yes it is outside, but like no other in freezing Ohio! Well enough about all that. If you want to know anything else, let me know. There are still so many things I just want to see here, I guess they belong on my to do list. But I do want to zip line! This summer is looking to be busy, I hope to get back to NY to visit the wineries, Bully Hill is a favorite, and I loved Corning. I hope to get a much needed break after rads to get on with my list of must do. I have 18 to go, then I can check it off. Seems like a long way.............. I'll let you know what else I add to my to do list!   ",

They have a lot of different programs that offer assistance. How about trying personal fund raising? Many local restaurants and national chains are very generous with fund raisers. How about a trying to publish a cook book to raise funds and keep that budding chef on track. Ask at the school and see if they have any resources available. Does she really have to put class on hold for now? Many people work during treatment, school may be a calming influence and keep it normal. I would try to find some other living arrangements, toxic is just plain wrong. Have you asked for assistance through the cancer clinic or her doctors and nurses? Or perhaps another patient could use a roomie until health returns. Do you Facebook? I guess I would turn over every rock, open every door, there are answers out there. I know for myself that the resources are there, it's the finding them that is not easy. But I always ask my social workers, and somehow I find a way..............Good Luck!",

It's good to be able to say when it started just in case its from the chemo or meds. I always keep a spiral notebook with my daily meds, food and water intake, and any issues or side effects.

We have a lot of fun, we wear Tiaras on Tuesday infusion day, crazy socks for Halloween, and festive beads for St. Pat's. Christmas was festive, and I am working on their Easter Basket! They are not only concerned about our time there as a patient, they really make the effort to have fun, be kind and compassionate, but they know us as people first. We have snacks and juice, and a microwave to heat our lunches. They also had a nice small collection of books, magazines, and BC info. Local churches also make quilts for every new patient, and others knit lovely hats to keep our heads warm. The support staff are so helpful, and keep us straight on appointments and orders. It is the best part of my journey, I can't say enough about the level of care I receive there.",

I just had my surgery on December 15, 2014 and I had my drains removed this morning. I just wanted to share a few tips for feeling better. I packed my warm robe and slippers for the hospital, a wrap style robe worked well with the drains. I took my faux mink throw to cover up when I sat in my recliner to read and have my meals. I took plenty to read, mouthwash for dry mouth, lemon drops and lip gloss. And plenty of body lotion to rub on my dry skin. I was very fortunate to have very little pain, and I felt great when I woke up in recovery. I made sure I warned them that I always feel sick after surgery so they made sure I had plenty of meds. I think the best advice I got was from my chemo nurses. Drink a lot of water, all day every day and my attitude is the most important part of this journey. While not every day is good, it is what we make it. So we all laugh, and we all cry, just some days we do it at the same time! And it feels great to be here to do it another day. Good luck to you all, I hope we all have a healthy and happy New Year!",

I've done it all, and my only thing left is chemo again since I am triple negative.  We are all lost at some point, but knowledge is power, and the choices are yours to make. Do it for you, and you will feel better that you had the option to make the choice and go at it. I went the fearless badass approach. So game on! We have your back. Cheryl",

I try to wrap my head around that, the what is next, and how is the treatment working. I try to focus on the good side, not the negative side. If I woke up every day looking at the dying side of this, I am sure my attitude would plummet. All we do at this point is go to battle, and you know how to fight the unseen, fight the unwanted, and fight what wants to stop you. I try to break it down and fight each battle as my way to win the war. Sooner or later we celebrate the victories, we regroup and make our move.

As far as telling people, I had a mixed bag. The people I thought would step up have sat down, and others have jumped on the bus and ride in the front seat. It's hard to say what they will do. Some you can tell on a need to know basis, some you won't tell at all. It depends on how you feel about it. It really is your decision who to tell, when to tell, and how much to tell. Take someone with you to the appointments, nice to have extra ears. They will hear what you don't hear. They can take notes, and organize questions and answers. You will receive a lot of important info, keep copies of all of your tests and appointments. Put a notebook in your purse and take it with you. Handy to have to write down anything you think of. You will have a lot of info coming at you, but it will all fall together, and you will feel so much better when you know. You have time to decide so don't rush it.
