It is worse at night when I am trying to sleep. In the last 2 weeks, my right leg has gotten weaker, and shakes sometimes when working. My regular check up with my surgeon resulted in an appt for a bone scan on Nov 25. I am so anxious, waiting for results. They were chatty in the room setting me up, then low talking and silence! makes me paranoid. anyone else have this type of pain and weakness?",

Unfortunately, I got my results today, I went to my family doc, she was out, but I saw a another doc, and I have a possible metastatic deposit on my L5, lumbar spine, that is new since my last bone scan in 2010. Feeling kind of shocked/numb right now. I knew something was up with my increased pain in my hip, and weakness in my leg. Don't know what the next step is, will have to see my oncologist I guess",
