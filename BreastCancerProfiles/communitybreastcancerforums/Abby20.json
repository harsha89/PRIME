I am doing my best to be positive! as many of the wonderful ladies in this club mentioned, the first stage is difficult. I am still waiting for the result of my MRI-guided biopsy. My exact dx is not clear yet. I am reading and hearing different opinions about mastectomy vs. lumpectomy, and still confused between my options. My surgeon is in favor of mastectomy but when I consulted with an expert oncologist she said there is no medical benefit of removing the whole breast. So far, all I know is that I have 1cm tumor in my left breast. I want to take an informed decision but the information out there is confusing. I don't have a personal preference; I just want to go for the most effective treatment ... I guess this is all what we all hope for  cheers,    ",
