Fast forward to this week - I've got a small pea size lump (feels smooth and similar to the other one) in my left breast and am scheduled for a mammo and sono in two weeks.  Then it hits me that my clear mammo results for the past few years are probably just a false sense of security - they probably didn't get a good image because of the density!  I've been reading that lymph node involvement above the collar bone (mine swollen note it up my neck a little bit, but below the jaw) could indicate a very serious cancer situation regardless of tumor size. I'm so scared I'm completely nauseous - I'm going to call the imagining center to see if they've had any cancellations and can get me in any sooner.  I struggle with anxiety and my remaining xanax perscription is expired and I'll need to get into my GP to get it renewed.  What are the odds that swollen lymph node (it's still swollen, but no bigger than it was 1 1/2 years ago) would have stayed constant if it was swollen from cancer cells?  How am I going to get through the next two weeks?  Please help.

Again - I greatly appreciate your responses.  ",
