I started seeing stubble at 4 weeks so I have 3 weeks of hair growth. I can not wait for it to get longer!! So far I still have my eyebrows and most of my eyelashes. Oddly enough I've kept all but the lashes on the bottom of my right eye and I can see some new baby eyelashes poking through now. Here I am on my last day of chemo, at 5 weeks, then today at 7 1/2 weeks...  ",

I need about another inch so I can get past the buzzcut look. I went hatless/scarfless at a big family dinner last night though and I'm 9 weeks out. I don't have enough to venture out in public like this yet but enough to be comfortable around my loved ones. I colored it yesterday too to get rid of the bits of weird chemo gray that grew in during chemo. It turned out great! I used Clairol Natural Instincts and it covered everything nicely and it's so soft. It's ammonia free and non-permanent. I obviously didn't need the whole bottle so I poured equal amounts of color and activator in a dish and applied it for 20 minutes. On a sad note, I've lost most of my eyelashes in the last week. The new ones are already growing in at least! ladym13 - If I were you I'd get my hair styled/shaped and go with the short do. That's just my personal preference and probably stems form my discomfort in a wig. Do what is most comfortable for you and don't worry about what anyone else thinks.",

This is 7 months past chemo. My hair is about 3 inches long now and I've started to wear a head band occasionally to control the poof. The humidity makes my hair grow like Jiffy Pop!! It's getting long enough now that I can shake my head when I get out of the shower and feel my hair move. It's a small thing but it makes me happy. On a side note, it was one year ago today that I got the life changing call. What a long, strange year it's been but I'm here, I'm happy and in many ways am stronger than I was a year ago.  ",

Still no sign of chemo curl but I had curly hair pre-chemo so I'm assuming I'll see curls again at some point? I've colored it a couple times with Clairol Natural Instincts and that seems to be covering the weird chemo color that's on the ends. I did need to use a darker color than I used to to get similar results. I don't think it's quite enough hair to look like a real hair style yet but it's been incredibly freeing not to have to cover my head!!   You can see the rest of my chemo hair growth pics here... www.flickr.com/photos/katherin... ",

I look like Kramer if he put his finger in a light socket when I wake up in the morning, lol. :) I'm wearing headbands to help control the poof on top and that seems to be helping for now. On the plus side, I've found a great new hair dye. I've always used Clairol Natural Instincts and been pretty happy with it. I've recently switched to the Vibrant version though and like it much better. It has 100% gray coverage and it works much better at covering what gray I have.",

I've been trying to get things done this week. I had my teeth cleaned yesterday and am going tomorrow for an eye exam. Today I went to the breast care center and got fitted for a bra/prosthesis. I had a nice chat in the elevator with a lovely women going through chemo. I don't know if this has been discussed yet but are any other T/C girls icing their fingernails during Taxotere? Apparently it's not something they do where I'm getting my infusion but they said I can bring my own ice/frozen peas if I want. I figure if it won't hurt and might potentially help, why not?",

To top it all off I went to the dentist yesterday to get a couple cavities filled and one of the novocaine shots must have hit a blood vessel. My cheek is now swollen and a bruise is developing. Oy!  As if the chemo wasn't bad enough now I get to go with a black and blue chipmunk cheek! Oh well, this too shall pass. My best wishes to all of you dealing with chemo now and those yet to come.

Calamtykel - I'm sorry to hear you're dealing with nausea. Hope the compazine helps. I was a little nervous about nausea after my 1st treatment because they didn't send me home with any nausea med prescriptions. I had 3 days of Emend (day of chemo and next 2 days) and got Aloxi in the IV the morning of chemo but it turns out that was enough. I just made sure to drink a lot and eat small meals and that helped. LizzyMack - I'm sure your skull is a non-issue and they're just being cautious. We'll all breathe a sigh of relief with you when they give you the good news! Rachel5738 - So happy to hear your bone scan was clear!! It's hard not to worry about mets when we have aches and pains but it's nice to remember that we can have pain for perfectly normal reasons too.  Has anyone one else signed up for the Chemo Angels program? Here's the info... Chemo Angels is a program dedicated to supporting people with cancer. In addition to providing helpful information and cancer related resources, we match patients who are going through the difficult time of chemotherapy with \"Angels\". The function of these Angels is - through little notes, cards and occasional small gifts - to bring a bit of cheer and encouragement.   I've received mail from both my angels this week and they're so sweet and encouraging. I totally recommend signing up if you haven't yet. It's an amazing organization and I would definitely like to give back once I'm on the other side of this cancer journey.",

He's wonderful live, has a beautiful voice and really knows how to work the crowd. Definitely worth seeing if you get the chance.  Shaved my head right down to the skin last night. I had initially buzzed it to about 1/4 inch but it's been falling out like crazy and my scalp hurt. It was getting patchy and mangy looking too which was freaking me out. Looks crazy but feels better! It's amazing how fast it goes. Last week at this time I still had nearly a full head of hair! My wig came in the mail yesterday too. It looks like clown hair! I think it's going to be scarves and hats for me. I did get a halo of hair from the TLC website that looks very passable with a hat. I've been wearing that when out and about, especially with the kids. I just don't want to deal with the puppy dog eyes I get, being a young Mom of 4 with cancer.  I hope everyone is feeling strong and has a great day. While I'm so sorry anyone has to go through this it's so nice to know we're not alone. Take care all!",

It has nice thoughts like \"When I tell you I have cancer, I will be sad. I will be sad because I am sick, but I will be happy because it is not a sickness that you can catch from me, and so you can still kiss me and hug me and love me.\"  And \"For a while I will have to take medicine that makes me feel bad, and this medicine will make all my hair fall out. I will look different. But I will laugh when I remember your own sweet little baby head, how round and bald it was, and how warm it was on my lips when I kissed it every day.\"",

I'll have to check out the book. :) Like CalamatyKel I'm also a homeschooling Mom of 4. I have 3 boys, 9, 7 and 5 and a 2 year old girl. I'm so grateful we were done having kids before this happened. I'm married to my best friend and we just celebrated our 10th anniversary last December. He's incredibly supportive, for example he took all the kids to the park this afternoon so I could rest in peace and quiet. What a guy! I'm very close with my parents and brother and his wife and we all live within a few blocks of each other. We're also Jehovah's Witnesses. Our strong faith has been my lifeline through all this. As Philippians 4:6, 7 says: \"Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God; and the peace of God that excels all thought will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.\" I also love photography. I got my first DSLR a couple years ago and I've been having fun learning and enjoying this creative outlet. I love to read and try to read several new books each month. I love fall and am looking forward to the cooler weather, fall foliage, apple season and sweaters. Love it! And because I like to share here are my sweeties. I'd love to see photos of you and yours too!  Maxwell, Noah, James and Isabelle...  ",

I got mine on a Saturday morning and didn't start having pain from it until Monday morning. You should be just fine for your LGFB class. I went to mine on Monday and it was great! Lots of free goodies and it was nice to connect with some other women in real life who are going through this too. My hair started coming out on Friday (day 14) and I lost a handful everytime I took a shower. By Monday I had lost about 40% of my hair but since I have really thick hair nobody could really tell but me. I got to enjoy the Jason Mraz concert Monday night, my last night with long hair. By yesterday it was coming out like crazy so we buzzed my head. Shed some tears but I'm getting used to it and it's really quite comfortable. My 5 year old told me I look handsome :) Probably because that's what I always tell him after his hair cuts! I hope everyone is feeling well and taking good care of themselves. We'll be done before you know it!",

I have size 5's, do they smoosh down too much in this bra or is the projection ok? They were a bit smaller than I was expecting but once in the small pocket on the Target camis I find they look big enough under clothes.

They're supposed to be official Coobie bras and they're only $4.99 each with shipping for $2.06 (for NY at least). I was able to get 2 black bras with shipping of $2.57 for $12.55!

Not too much pain, lots of numbness and occasional burning in my under arm. I'm feeling better than I imagined I would though. The kids were waiting on the front porch for me with big welcome home signs which was pretty great. I spent two nights in the hospital and they were missing their Mama and I couldn't wait to see them too. The surgery itself went well. I felt very calm that morning and didn't shed any tears. Apparently, they had to re-do the sentinel node dye injection again while I was in surgery so that made things run behind a bit. My poor family was sweating it out in the waiting room starting to get worried. Thankfully, all went well and the 6 nodes they took were all, at least with the preliminary pathology, negative. Final pathology may be done by tomorrow and I'll see my BS next week. Now I'm just dealing with healing and drain care. The drains don't hurt but with 4 of them they sure are bulky! NowI see why everyone is so eager to get rid of them.  Thinking of you today orchidgal.  Hope that pepper_cook, tory, Kim11 and Psalms 91 are doing well too!! PS: roserx, thanks for the anesthesia info. I was able to read it the morning of my surgery and it was very helpful. Thankfully I had no major issued with the GA. Just a bit groggy and sleepy afterwards but not much nausea.",

Shawn, glad you're feeling better and better too. I hope chemo goes well for you both! I'm feeling really good. It will be 4 weeks tomorrow and I feel so much better than I expected to. I haven't needed any pain meds for the past couple weeks. My range of motion on my prophylactic side is almost 100%. On the SLN side I'm probably closer to 85%. I don't have pain there, just tightness that runs down my arm. I've been doing my stretches and exercises from my PT though and they really help. I'm back to my normal routine and can pick up my 2 year old daughter again which makes us both happy. :) I got my Oncotype score results last week and it's a 13 which puts me at an 8% risk of recurrence over the next 10 years with Tamoxifen. I have my first appointment with my oncologist on Wednesday to discuss whether she recommends chemo or not. I'm pretty sure that because of that darn micromet I'll feel a lot better doing some kind of chemo. With a fairly low recurrence rate I definitely want to the skip the more intense chemo regimines but I'm hoping the onc. will think something like CMF will be beneficial for me.   ",

I loooove them! This was the first time wearing a bra since my BMX last month and I felt like I looked like my old self for the first time. The Target camis have been comfy and lightweight but I think the microbead forms look more natural in the bra. I really like the scoop neck compared to the deep V. My size 5 breast forms fit just right too. They didn't smoosh down at all and they're just the same size as my real breasts were. The bra itself is very comfortable. It's soft and stretchy and so far stays in place just fine without being tight or restrictive (just for reference I wore a 36B before). I like them so much I ordered 3 more from the same seller on eBay. I got a set of 3 (black, beige and white) for $16.59 with free shipping. If you're interested in these bras keep an eye on this seller. There are the ones LindaLou posted too. stores.ebay.com/Brazilian-Expl...  Also, I want to take a minute to thank all of you helpful ladies here in the reconstruction alternatives forum. It seems like many (most?) of the women my age get reconstruction and it just never felt like the right thing for me. I just wasn't interested in the added surgeries or putting foreign objects in my body. The advice, experiences and photos you've shared made my decision much easier to make. A month ago tomorrow I had my bilateral mastectomy and I'm feeling great and so far have no regrets about not reconstructing. I've been healing quickly and I feel almost normal now. I haven't needed pain meds for 2 weeks, am doing all my normal activities and can pick up my 2 year old daughter again. :)  Though I'm happy with my decision I'm not very comfortable going flat (yet?). The recommendations shared here for affordable, comfy bras/camis and lightweight prosthesis have been priceless! It's made the transtion into my new breastless life so much easier. Thank you so much!!!",

Finally got caught up reading several pages of posts. calamtykel - sending lots of positive thoughts your way that you hear good news soon!! Sweeney - I also have found myself having less hot flashes since I've been on Tamoxifen. I've been on it about 6 weeks and so far no noticeable side effects. I still get the occasional hot flash but it's more like once or twice a week where it used to be 6-8 times a day!  My hair is continuing to grow. It's coming in thick and even which I'm happy about, now I'm just waiting for length. Looks a lot like Sweeney's avatar. It's coming in my normal brown color but I still had some weird chemo gray mixed in so I colored it last weekend and it worked great! I used Clairol Natural Instincts, it's non-permanent/ammonia free and is really gentle on your hair. I'm not quite to the point where I can go out in public scarfless/hatless but it's getting close. I can't wait!! Unfortunately, the eyelashes and eyebrows I'd been so happy to keep fell out at about the 8 week mark. My eyebrows have thinned a lot but I still have some and I lost just about all my eyelashes but they're growing back evenly, just really short still. I just can't wait to look and feel somewhat normal again!!!!",

This all started with mastitis which cleared up with antibiotics. Then a couple weeks later I noticed bloody nipple discharge. I had a clean mammogram and ultrasound and they said come back in 6 months. My NP wasn't comfortable with that and set me up with a breast surgeon. He suspected an intraductal papilloma so I had a subareolar resection the end of May. Unfortunately, they found DCIS in addition to the papilloma. I then had an MRI and they found an area of concern. They did an MRI guided biopsy on the most worrisome spot and found .8cm of grade 1 IDC. Since it's in a different area than the DCIS I'll need a mastectomy. I've opted to go bilateral with no reconstruction at this time. I'm scheduled for surgery July 20th. I'm scared but eager to get the cancer out of my body. I'm anxious to find out what my further treatment will be. The BS looked at my lymph nodes on ultrasound and they looked fine but who knows what they'll see under the microscope. In one way I'm scared of doing chemo but I'm also scared of not doing chemo, you know?  I hope everyone's surgery goes well. I look forward to getting to know you all better through this crazy journey.",

Therefore we thought we'd find several invasive spots. Ends up there were only 2, 1.3cm and .16cm, both grade 1, ER+ (38%) and PR+ (61%) and HER2-. Also lots of DCIS, 13 out of 22 blocks examined. Bad news is that they found micromets (.45mm) in one of  my lymph nodes so that's now considered positive. Thankfully the surgeon doesn't want to take more nodes since the other 5 were negative. I'm guessing with the positive node that I may need chemo now but I won't know for sure until I see the oncologist on the 18th and find out the results of my Oncotype test.",

Hope everyone is healing and feeling well. :) I was able to get all 4 drains out last Wednesday and it's been great!! I'm feeling almost normal again. Still some tightness in my armpits, more so on the SLN side, and of course a numb chest but overall I feel really good. The exercises the PT gave me seem to be helping and it feels good to stretch everything out. I'm glad I got the Target camisoles and microbead breast forms. They've been really comfortable and I look like my old self with clothes on. I'm now anxiously awaiting my first appointment with the oncologist on the 18th. I'm eager to move on to the next phase of treatment so I can hurry up and get it over with. I'm curious what my Oncotype score will be although unless it's extremely low I want to do chemo. I'm wondering what regimen will be recommended and how soon we'll begin. Seems like waiting is par for the course in this whole cancer journey! On a happier note we got a new kitten this week. Our elderly cat passed away a few months sgo and I really missed having a kitty to snuggle with. She's really sweet and cuddly and is a nice diversion from the stress of all things cancer related. Isn't she cute??  PS: Congrats nkrun, that's awesome!! I hope you're able to breeze right through radiation. ",

I had a subareolar resection to remove the milk ducts behind my nipple because they believed I had an intraductal papilloma. They did find the papilloma but also DCIS. After an MRI and biopsy they also found invasive cancer, I had no palpable lump. The odds are greatly in your favor that you are fine but better safe than sorry get it checked out. Keep us posted!",
