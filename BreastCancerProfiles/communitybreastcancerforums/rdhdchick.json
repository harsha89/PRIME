Just had my second of four Taxtotere/Cytoxan treatments (not bad compared to so many others), and I have a terrible itchy rash on my poor stubbly scalp. The hair came out right on schedule at 14 days, shaved and was fine for a week until the second dose of T/C. I've been washing regularly and moisturizing with SPF 30 lotion, but this is just so itchy! Tonight I washed with surgical wash (Hibiclens) and had my daughter put aloe on the spots to cool and reduce them. Any other ideas? Has anyone else had a surefire way of dealing with this? I've not been wearing my wig or hats or scarves, just going bare due to the heat... Thanks and my best to all!",

I've been in those shoes many times, either as a patient, or the person who got tapped to take the patient to the ER. Is it any wonder our health care costs so much, we have zero efficiency in the most expensive part of the hospital! Good luck with the pain!",

Do I have to stay inside during chemo. I'm getting paranoid of infection.  I've worked through my first two treatments, although I've taken one or two days off. I even flew (for business) during the second week of my first round. Common sense will dictate what you can do, and talk to your nurses and Onc. 2. Can I go to work? As Above. 3. Can I do cooking, cleaning, and other similar things? I was able to keep up with my home, with the help of my teenage children. Make sure you get help with these things, you should not be trying to keep house when you are fatigued or dealing with your side effects. 4. Can I go to drop off my kids to school? As above. 5. Can I go for shopping and grocery? As above. 6. Is there any other thing which I should do or avoid during chemo? Move. Drink lots of water, if you can. Eat healthy. Let others help you. Don't overdo it. If you have troublesome side effects (muscle pain, mouth sores, etc) talk to your nurses and onc about what they can to to help. Use these boards to ask questions, you are not alone.  7. Can I attend my yoga classes? YES, however, depending on your chemo, you may experience muscle/joint/bone aches, so some positions are not recommended (downward dog is one). Talk to your yoga instructor about other positions you can use, and make sure to tell your nurses and onc what you are doing.",
