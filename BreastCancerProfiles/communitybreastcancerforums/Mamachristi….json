By failed I mean the \"interval increase of asymmetric density in upper right quadrant of right breast\", which led me to an US which also can't identify it as a cyst. So on to core biopsy this week. I do have mammo report, but not US report. I just know they read it and said biopsy. I would have thought US would have shown a cyst if it were a cyst. I don't think it's too hard to get freaked out. Makes you rethink lots of things, maybe that's the thing, I need to focus on living more? A sign maybe? :-",

So needless to say, wound is quite fresh. Things I've seen in practice stay in the back of my mind, waiting for the next chance to be useful/important. Never thought it was going to be me. Im just trying to be informed so IF I need to make decisions I can do so with the info I have obtained. I found myself trying to schedule this biopsy at 4:30 on a Friday. Scheduling didn't have the order, then closed at 5. Don't want that again",

I'm still a bit shocked by the size of it, but hopefully nothing in the end. But, i have been sharing this with friends and i have 7 who are not going for their first (in their MID 40's they have NOT had one...) and I am thankful that this will put them where they need to be, caught up and aware. Many hugs to you folks who are going through the fight. It's something I have to absorb over time, so I have to think about what I want, etc. so i dont fall apart if it's something i have to do. It's just how I am. I have yet to really get scared and sob but I've certainly cut some things out of my life that really arent that important.  Many, many hugs and thank you for the support!",
