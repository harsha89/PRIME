I have 3 kids 17, 11 and 5 and I am a single parent. My kids lost their dad almost 4 years ago and I refuse to let them lose their mom too. anyway..enough about me. I just wanted to let you know that you will make it through it, just hang in there. I was diagnosed 4/17/07 with a late 2/early 3 stage. The size was 5.5 cm and spread to my neck. With all the research that has been done, it's a long road, but a recovering one. You will be amazed at how strong and helpful your children can be. When I was diagnosed, I figured if I am going to have any cancer, breast cancer is the one that has come the longest way in finding cures. The road may be long and tough, but that is why there are friends and family...and the wonderful people I have found here. I feel a special bond here and hope that you do too and it helps you when you need help. Just reach out and talk to anyone...we all listen very well :) Good luck and keep us up to date.",
