I have had a pain in my rib near the side/back for about 2 months.  I also have a burning sensation at times.  Could this be bone mets?  I hate this blasted disease.  Every ache/pain gets you back in the mode of thinking what if.  My markers weren't bad in April.  Thanks for your help.  I look forward to meeting everyone here.  I wish I would have found this when I was going through treatment. becky Log in to post a reply",

I had the bone scan today.  What should the bones look like on the monitor?  I couldn't see it well but I did see it.  The girl took a few extra views and then left the room to see the radiologist.  She came back and said I could go.  I didn't expect news today but how long should it take? Thanks so much! becky",

Again, thank you for responding. becky",
