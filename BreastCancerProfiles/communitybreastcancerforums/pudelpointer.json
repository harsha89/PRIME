    "Content": "pudelpointer wrote: Hello, I had a baseline mammogram. I am 37 years old and currently living out of my home country. Here they recommend a mammogram at 35 so my doctor had me get one. I have had a bit of left breast pain since January. Originally it seemed to be cyclical or caused by muscles pulling underneath the breast, but the doctor wanted a mammogram to be sure which I am thankful for. They found a 2.5cm mass in my left breast at 4 oclock. It is oval in shape, circumscribed and low density. There is no ductal pattern calcification but dermal type and punctate/caurse type calcifications. It also says Lymph nodes of axilla are undefined. Does anyone know what that means? I am going back for an ultrasound tomorrow. Crossing my fingers that this is benign like the characteristics of the mass could suggest. Just hoping it is to verify and they didn't see something they are not saying. Another crazy thing is I do not feel it at all. I need to stop trying to find it because I am making my breast sore! I am so nervous. My husband is one that doesn't worry until there is need to worry. I wish I could be more like him. His ability to pack lots of things in a small space has rubbed off on me, But not his ability to avoid worry! Thanks for letting me chat! Log in to post a reply",
