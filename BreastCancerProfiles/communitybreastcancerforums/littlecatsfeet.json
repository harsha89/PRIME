She was extremely supportive during my initial breast cancer diagnosis and treatment 7 years ago; this was a blow to her as well, and we were both a bit weepy. We are a very busy center - it's actually remarkable what we accomplish with only three staff - and the potential for more is on the horizon, so her mind is also there. She asked me about prognosis, which I have actually refused to think about (I know I have mets to the bone, but I had a CT scan this morning, so all will be known for sure on Thursday at my next appointment - and I am praying that the rest of the scans are clear). She's concerned about my ability to continue working, if she needs to hire someone else, etc. I really didn't have an answer for her. I'm not even sure what my entire diagnosis is. I told her that I would have a treatment plan on Thursday, and hopefully more answers for her next Monday - but maybe I really won't. It has dawned on me that I can live one day at a time, but work can't. What do I do with this?

      "Content": "littlecatsfeet wrote: So I had a fun weekend larping - even ran, and with no pain! - but also slept on a leaky air mattress on a sheet of plywood for two days (still, fun trumps all!). Since Monday I have been having increasing pain, mostly in the thigh on the hip with mets. No pain walking, going up stairs (some going down); some discomfort in the hip and thigh when sitting for a while. I notice it mostly if I twist my leg a certain way, and that's when it hurts, like a deep bone bruise. Sometimes it feels like a nerve thing, because I feel it going up the side of my thigh and around to the middle of my butt cheek. I have no pain in any of the other areas of bone mets (shoulder, skull, rib), so I'm kinda inclined to think I just overdid it this weekend - but who knows. I am also wondering if this could be the Faslodex - I had one treatment two weeks ago (with a pamidronate infusion), and am going for a second treatment today. Is Faslodex pain just in the joints? Or does it affect the nerves going through the joints? (lotsa questions for a Thursday morning, huh?)

I have a stupid crazy schedule coming up this weekend (friday night event at work, then all day Saturday-Sunday event), so I called the onc office to see if they would consider giving me a half dose of Zometa so that I could function (otherwise, I told them, I'm not showing up for the infusion). The office called me back and said that they'd switch me to pamidronate, which had fewer and less severe side effects (a two hour infusion instead of one). I'm not reading anything online that's making me feel all warm and fuzzy about this treatment either. Can anyone tell me what I can do pre-emptively and proactively to lessen any side effects this drug may have? I reall really need to be able to function - this is my job I am concerned about. My manager has expressed concern several times about my ability to continue during treatments, and although there is never any real pressure, sometimes I still feel it, you know?  Thanks for your input!

I've already been put on Arimidex, will pick the prescription tonight. CT scan within three days, to make sure that it isn't anywhere else. That is the plan. I told my onc that I feel the mets on my skull - tingly. I debate whether or not the pressure I feel is from them or blocked sinuses and stress. He opts for stress, for both symptoms. My parents are nothing short of frantic, and my adult kids (especially my daughter, who is at least asking a lot of questions) are scared.
