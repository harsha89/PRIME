I had been fighting for a two years to get a mammogram but the doctor has been saying no because of my age. I had the lump for a year and finally they agreed to the sonogram. But since then all of the shoulda,woulda, coulda has started. \"If I find out it is cancer, should I have fought harder for mammogram?\" \"Would it had made much of a difference?\" \"Could that two years have changed the potential outcome of the situation?\" I know it's easier said than done but we can't allow ourselves to go crazy over these types of questions especially considering what we might hear on Monday. As far as lymph nodes go, I have severe swelling in left armpit, one in between neck and shoulders that is protruding so much that it can be seen at a distance. The lymph node problem did not start until a year ago when I first discovered the lump. I told the RAD when I had the biopsy. He said he can see them but they are all probably benign. Told him about nodes and swelling in armpit. His response \" it's all in my mind\". Told him about left itchy breast where the lump was found again his response was \"it's all in my mind\". I also left his office feeling like a hypochondriac. What we have to do is channel all of those thoughts and questions into something positive so we are able to deal with what we may hear on Monday.",

Must come for more study in 4 months. If you should develop any changes within now and then contact your doctor immediately.\" That's all it said! No explanation of what the lesion was. No reason for why I MUST come in after 4 months. Nothing. I don't know if I should be happy or what. I know I have a lot of unanswered questions. The letter was so vague I don't know what to feel right now other than confusion. Please if any of our more experienced sisters happen to read this please give me some advice. Am I making a mountain out of a molehill?",
