I didn't bother since i am always so cold anyway. I will have to look into those supplements. I think I read somewhere else that glutamine was good during chemo.

I bought one of Rebecca Katz's cookbooks but have only tried one recipe so far. It has good information on how to eat and control some of the SEs too but the recipes require a bit more time chopping than I have been willing to do. Summer, thanks for the tip on the wipes.

Catherine, when is your last tx? Seems like it should be soon. I noticed you are kind of borderline triple negative. Wondering if you will share what your next treatment steps are? It is interesting to see what the different MOs do. Well the spot on my heel that hurts eveytime after tx has now blistered and cracked. I have been putting ointment and a band aide on it but very tender when walking. It should heal just in time for the next tx. Lovely. Have a wonderful day!",

I should have guessed the Taxation is doing it. That is the one that seems to be giving me all the problems. Did your MO call in a prescription strength hydrocortisone? If not, and the OTC stuff isn't cutting it, you may want to ask for it. I know there is one that is like 2x as strong but you need a script.

Day 3-7 were usually my worse with fatigue / flu like symptoms but you may beeeze through. Take meds at the first sign of nausea or pain. Keep on top of any other issues like constipation or diarrhea. Chemo causes this in many. Don't hesitate to ask here or call your MO's nurse if you have questions. Nails - I too have kept polish on my nails and cut short but not iced. No lifting or discoloring. Icing is not done by many at my place but it is permitted and certainly can't hurt. Neulasta - My MO does give the Neulasta shot after each to keep the WBC from dropping too low.

At least I know the chemo is making it all the way down to my feet killing those bad cancer cells if they are lurking there! Hiker61, sorry to hear about your father in law and all that poking! You need to find out who is good with finding those veins and ask for them each time. I have noticed that at my center there are some who come in and will only let certain people poke them. I decided to get a port in to save my little veins. Thanks for the tip on those blister pads. Went to Target to pick up some stuff and totally forgot to look for them. Ugh, I have no memory if I don't write it down. Will have to go back tomorrow. Rachel11, my hair starting coming out @ 12/13 days after the first tx. It was coming out quicker by the time I had it buzzed on day 15 but I still had a lot of hair. It just had to go cause it was below my shoulders and the long strands coming out were a mess. Not to mention it was too itchy for me to take. It probably took another 3 or 4 days for the stubble to stop falling out and I still have some sparse hairs that look like they are going to hang on the whole time. So I think if you can stand it, you should be fine. Sorry to about your grandmother. Lezza13, hope you feel better soon. I am definitely finding tx#3 to be a bit more challenging with skin issues than the others. Hope everyone has a pleasant evening and is keeping those SEs in check.",

I took a Benadryl at night which has helped with the itching too. Be careful in the sun. Chemo makes our skin sensitive and it doesn't seem to take much exposure to burn. I found this especially true on my face. My normal SPF was definitely not enough. Good luck! Hope these are your only SEs.",

Mary- i have been getting a rash after every tx but it clears up before the next. Seems to be getting a little worse and taking a little longer to clear up each time. Must be the cumulative effect. After 1st tx, it was the area close to my port so I thought maybe that area was still healing. 2nd tx it covered more of my chest but didn't itch so used mostly aloe. This 3rd time, it covered chest and whole neck and really itched. I will be 2 weeks post tx tomorrow and the rash is finally faded on my neck and most of my chest. I think onvacation has been getting a rash from the beginning too. Good thing is, it should go away before next tx. It may just take longer each time and doesn't look pretty.

They cut my Neulasta dose in half this time + it has been much better. But I did try Claritin this time instead too so maybe that is the reason. Anyway, see if they can cut your dose down or give u something for the pain. U shouldn't be that uncomfortable. Luv that u went out \"topless\". My daughter has a dance recital coming up next month but she has already told me \"Mom, wear your wig\". Guess that speaks well for the wig or is my bald head that bad!? Slak - hope u are feeling better. Certainly don't need any \"extra\" SE's. At my last tx the tech was having a hard time getting a blood draw from my port so he was chatty. He starts telling me how he was just sick and had to go to the dr and I'm sitting there thinking really, r u sure u should be here now? At least he had his gloves on but I sure was glad to be done with him. I normally feel a little germaphobic at that place. He wasn't helping. Janie - Sending positive thoughts for minimal throne time. For those that r having metal mouth or other taste issues, Rebecca Katz has a couple books and a website with recipes + suggestions. She uses the FASS rule - olive oil for fat, lemon juice for acid, sea salt and grade b maple syrup or agave nectar for sweet. For the metal taste she says to add a little sweet (syrup or nectar) + a squeeze of lemon. I have also read that using plastic utensils can help. For the scarf wearers, Goodwishes will give u a free scarf. Go to www.goodwishesscarves.org. I requested one last week. Can't wait to see how it is. Hugs!",

I still have a little stubble all over but most of those loose hairs have now come off from shampooing or from my frantic attempts to roll off my head.

I had mine put in at the hospital and turned out they used the kind of port that usually goes in your arm. It is a slimmer port and since I am skin and bones in the area they used, the surgeon thought a regular one would be too big. The slim one still sticks up a god bit on me. I kind of wished I had known they were going to use that size and asked to be placed in the arm. Oh well, like you said. Only a few months. Good luck tomorrow!",

Never would have thought I wanted to get my hair buzzed! I too wanted to keep looking like myself as long as possible but those long strands were a pain. I had lost weight pre diagnosis too. I had been walking lots and eating better for @ 6 months. Then this, go figure. Then i lost more after diagnosis.

I made the mistake of spending 2 hours outside with just the 30 SPF that is in my moisturizer and no hat. I don't usually burn easy but boy did I get red especially on my face. I went out and bought one of the widest brim hats they had at Target and wore it with 50 SPF on next time I went out. Big difference. I even noticed there were many others wearing hats at this festival. I think chemo makes our skin more sensitive. Stay on the lookout for the numbness. It can even happen after treatments are done. I finally got peppers and tomatoes in my garden yesterday (wearing my hat). I am way behind this year so I guess I will be getting my veggies in the fall! Oh well, at least they are in.

I had major \"c\" issues the first time but made adjustments and now have gotten that under control and only very slight \"d\" issues in the week post tx. Here is my drill. Day of tx, I take fruit and veggies to snack on during infusion along with a protein. Take a small dose of milk of magnesia for the next 3 days. I had this left over from surgery and my mo said if it worked for me, fine. Continue to eat fruit and veggies as long as they taste good. Breakfast is usually a bowl of oat bran with fresh chopped dates. Make my own blueberry, strawberry, raspberry, banana yogurt smoothie with whey protein most days. If I eat a low fiber food like mac + cheese or eggs, I try to have something with fiber with it. Such as steamed veggies or a high fiber English muffin. Some nights I just have rice and steamed veggies. I have little dairy other than the yogurt and maybe some cheese. I mostly drink water with lemon, some green tea and coffee, when it tastes ok. I do eat less for a week - 10 days after tx and snack more times a day. I'm not tying to eat less, I just either don't have the appetite or food doesn't taste right so I only eat a few bites. Hang in there. You'll be feeling better soon and moving into your \"good\" week. Hugs",

Right now I mostly wear out to dinner and my daughters activities. I plan on wearing it everyday when I return to work. Hopefully I will be able to stand it on my head for that long! So far I have only worn for a few hours at a time. Melrose, you are a tough cookie with no buzzing! So do you still have a decent amount of hair? Maybe you won't need to buzz. I look in the mirror at what stubble has been hanging on and wonder what it would look like if I hadn't buzzed so short. I think probably pretty sparse. Reneetampa - been thinking about you. Haven't seen you in a while. Hope all is well. Janie - hope you are feeling better and are enjoying the weekend. Had my blood work done yesterday. All counts were a little lower than last time. Even the white count was slightly below the range and it has been on the high side previously. Wonder if they will give me a full neulasta shot next time. I have been getting half and it has been nice to not really have any bone pain. For those that have good white counts and bad bone pain, ask your MO if they will cut it back. It is a beautiful day here and my energy is pretty much back to normal. Would love to enjoy the outdoors in the garden or a walk by the river but I think I need to save that for another day when my skin issues are better. My other heel has blistered but i have been able to keep it from cracking (fingers crossed). Doing ballet walking on the balls of my feet a lot. Maybe I will get more shapely calfs. Guess today will be more cleaning or maybe some on line shopping! Hope everyone enjoys their day with minimal SEs Hugs to all",

Looked like you needed a special tool so made an appt at the store today. Started a post to everyone this am but didn't finish before I had to leave so just left up on the iPad (which I have done before with no problem). Turned out the \"special\" tool I needed was the end of a paper clip!! Well, they had a tool at the store but said a paper clip would work. How silly of me! At least it was an easy fix and I know what to do now. Then when I came home I finished up my post. Hit submit and the screen went blank. Couldn't get it back. Just not having luck with these gadgets. Took a break from them. Hope this one goes through. Slak and onvacation - thinking of you today and hope your tx went smoothly. Mary - you have probably buzzed by now. I say take control of your hair too in whatever way that works for you. I buzzed at 15 days post #1 and it felt great. Couldn't take the itching and clumps in the shower anymore. Jenny - I think you need to consider the demands of your job and how you are recovering from surgery/recon. Not everyone's situation is the same. I have been on disability since surgery. I have some desk time but also have meetings, lunches, dinners, and entertainment with clients. I just could not handle that with the tx and recon recovery. And I am sure the stress of trying to do so would have been huge. There are good days but it has been taking me longer to get to those days. My MO says many can work, as you see here. Give it a go but as Janie suggests, listen to your body and be open to a change of plans. Melrose - hope the fever is under control! Sounds like you were on top of it and no trip to ER is super. I get low grade ones each tx but not high enough to concern the nurses, crossing my fingers I didn't jinx myself. Lezza - thx! The cracked blistered heel is in good shape. The one that didn't crack still has a blister. I am going to try icing, more elevation and more moisturizing this time. I will let you know if it helps. I am trying Aquaphor on some of my drier, redder parts of my new girls. It seems to be working better than anything else I have tried. Good tip. Sorry if I missed anyone. It stinks typing this twice.

I don't think it is that unusual to have to stop a regime due to adverse reactions. I have read of some stopping early under various regimes. There are many on the triple negative thread (all grade 3 tumors) that have had the A/C + taxol regime. It seems to be a standard regime if you have Positive nodes so sounds a little stronger. I guess you need to know how many rounds are needed. Is it like staring all over again? If so, ugh! I was wondering if you could get this under control with meds and then do the same for #4.

First few days you will be fine but for me, days 3-5 are the worst. Try and drink starting today. I didn't drink much before tx #1 and had much worse SEs.

Ok, so I appreciated that since mine was a very aggressive TN and caught early so lets get it out before it spreads. Then my MO was pushing to have the port in and chemo 2 weeks after BMX. I didn't schedule the port placement until another 2 weeks later and chemo a week after that. I just wasn't mentally ready before then. I have a few coworkers who mean well but I have to distance myself from them too. They really don't understand like you all do here. One thinks he understands because he had bi-pass surgery.

She had her reason (no evidence of greater response with no nodes involved and more long term heart risk) but would have added to my tx if I really wanted it.

When I met with an RO to see if i would need it, they told me rads would start 3-4 weeks after the last chemo and be easy in comparison. Guess they should say it is easy since it is their field! Had a very sleepless night. Like worse than being on steroids and I'm not on them right now. Go figure, slept pretty good with the steroids this last time and it catches up to me later. Will need to keep moving today or I will fall asleep. Hugs to all!",

I have a wig bit find that I go without anything at home and mostly hats when I go out. Find what makes you feel comfortable. Jenny, I bring a bag packed with lunch, snacks, water. I may play words with friends, listen to music, read, watch a movie, etc. They have drinks, some snacks, internet and tvs at my place. The IV has battery back up so you can move around. I get up several times to use the restroom. If you sit the whole time you are not drinking enough. I drink 60 oz + when there. The nurses say you should drink 2-3 quarts the day off and day after. I find drinking more the day before and several days after has helped with the SEs. You can sleep or talk with others. Wear comfortable clothes and take a sweatshirt or something in case you get cold. My place has warm blankets but sometimes that is not enough. The IV is room temp vs body temp so it can make you chilled. The first time will be the longest as they take it slow to make sure you are tolerating well. My first time they sped up the Cytoxan and then had to slow it down as it was causing the tingly nose reaction. Now they know exactly how long each should take. For me it is @ 3 1/2 hrs but the first time took closer to 5. I meet with my MO before each tx so I bring my list of questions and take down any notes. Believe me, you are going to want to write things down they tell. Chemo brain or maybe just overload kicks in.",

You could be \"crashing\" from the anti nausea meds that they gave you but they will flush out. I get more steroids and benadryl each time. The benadryl really makes me sleepy the first afternoon. Keep yourself hydrated with soups, fruit pops, fruit, water, whatever works for you. The day before, day of and couple days after are most important to stay hydrated. It will make you feel better. Try to get at least 64 oz a day. I found eating more protein and iron rich foods helped with my energy but the key is to eat. Many small, bland meals were easier for me every few hours. Eggs and fruit smoothies with protein powder have been some of my favorite go to foods. Also, try to get up and move some. As tired as you may be, you will feel better in the long run by moving. Take a short 5-10 min walk, hop on the exercise bike. Whatever you feel up to. Maybe even just getting outside for a breath of fresh air. You will feel better by Monday!! These symptoms won't last that long. I found day 3-5 to be my worse for fatigue. Need a few hour nap during the day. But then I was feeling the bounce coming back. Hope you feel better soon!",

I think the weather made me extra sleepy so I took a nap when I got home. This time when I was walking out, it felt like someone had poured lead in my legs! I could tell myself it is all the exercise biking I have been doing but I haven't really been doing that much. Weird new SE? Hopefully it will pass quickly. Stumbled upon a way to make myself drink more. I took a bag of white cheddar popcorn to snack on. It was on sale and I thought something salty and a treat that I don't usually buy. Turns out I had to keep washing down the popcorn so I drank much more than last time - nearly 90 oz! Even the chemo nurse commented and said they should have popcorn for a munchie. I will definitely be taking another bag next time. But of course, now I feel very full with all that water in me. Only could eat a small amount of dinner. Oh well, I will eat a small snack later. Onvaca-keep your nails short and I read that nail polish or clear Hard as Nails can help. I have been painting mine more than usual and so far so good on that SE. Keeping my fingers crossed. I use Cetaphil cream for my dry skin too. I like it even better than the sample of Lindi cream I picked up that is supposed to be designed for those going through chemo (and really expensive). Good luck to those that have a TX Thur or Fri. May it go smoothly. To those that recently had, here's to minimal SEs.",

They are long nights. I can only hope to drag my tired butt there. Sounds like a wonderful idea to go to the beach. Georgiamom-doing the happy dance for you too!! I see Dr. Bowen. After #4 I am supposed to be done since I had a BMX and don't need radiation and i am triple negative so no further targeted treatment. I did ask my MO yesterday to have the lab check the type on all my tumors as i had multiple. I realized that the triple negative was only based on 1 of the tumors at the time of biopsy, not post surgery. Apparently they deemed the other tumors to be of similar characteristics and didn't test further. Have any of you other ladies had this experience? Anyway, she agreed to contact the lab and we will go from there. Probably won't change anything but why cut corners if there could be other treatment options? Now I can't remember if I took a Claritin last night before bed and I get my Neulasta shot today. Hate the memory fog! I try to write what I take down and when. Humm, to overdose or underdose? I think I will wait and take one later today. Hope everyone has a wonderful day!",

I was already keeping socks or something on my feet during the day. Now I slather my feet with cream and sleep with socks on. Onvacation- good for you getting errands and a nap!

I will be thinking of you and your dad tomorrow. Be strong and stay positive. It will all go well. Melrose, I need to come to your house Sat! I have been craving more meat than usual. A grilled burger sounds yummy. I picked up some salmon burgers at Trader joes. Trying to be good with what I eat but may have to give in to the meat craving soon. Jenny, The port area shouldn't hurt for too many days. May feel a little funny when you turn your neck certain ways. Took me a little while to get used to it. I took 1,000mg of Tylenol for pain. They gave me a script pain killer that I had filled but never took. Hiker, I think I surprised a mother from my DD's class with my no hair. I haven't really made a big deal about my BC so not too many of the parents know. I showed up last week to the chess award ceremony with just a hat on. Didn't feel like putting on the wig. Then I saw her last night at the band concert and this time I had my wig on. She did a double take. Probably has figure out something is up now. Hair has thinned everywhere for me but can't say it is totally gone anywhere. My eyebrows and eyelashes seemed to thin after the 2nd tx. Thought I was really going to lose them big time like my head so ran out and bought an eyebrow pencil and new eyeliner. The eyeliner is a big help as there are some gaps in my lashes and the liner camouflages that. Can go with or without the eyebrow pencil. Hopefully the rest of you don't lose either. Hugs to all",
