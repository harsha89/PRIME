Still so undecided...the drains are back in both sides though and now I am week 8 and returning to work tomorrow in spite of them. Having said that, the drains may be the deciding factor anyway...maybe I will get too far out to have chemo anyway. Oddly enough, the drains have become a security blanket for me. Surgeons NP wants me to see a different MO...the one I see is very knowledgeable, but is a lecturer, not a listener. To appreciate my patient status at this facility, I should probably mention, I work there as well. To further my struggle in my decision, it is specifically to treat cancer... and the people who go there will do anything to hang onto hope. I lean towards saying no to chemo...but then I fell as though I am betraying the others...people I will be caring for.",

Who knew cancer was such a personal journey. We all have the same monster but every diagnosis, treatment plan and choice is different. And yet, we are all in the same boat. We go through this individually together. Although I would not wish this on anyone, there are a few good things cancer does for you... meeting all of the people here and learning of the journeys others have endured are a couple of them!",

So far, my drains are deciding my fate as I am falling out of the time frame for chemo. I do know these thoughts eat your mind alive with worry... and I don't wish that on anyone. My MO initially walked into my room and told me the good news is that your cancer is curable. I felt so positive initially. The truth, after researching, I have decided we are damned if we do and damned if we don't. Statistics within statistics and not one of these people in the studies are necessarily comparable. I have not yet seen one predictor graph give me 100% disease free survival...and that is what it takes for me to believe it is \"curable\". After reading so much here, I just believe cancer likes us. It is all so hard to wrap your head around and sort out. I wish you peace and confidence in your decision.",

Jennie93, thank you for the links... and by the way, my MO told me the same thing while making a joke about his baldness! dtad, thank you for taking the risk with your candor. Do you know if you Google \"Refusing Chemo\" you just get sites about chemo? Much like if you Google Bilateral Mastectomy without reconstruction you just get sites and pictures of reconstruction. Ksusan, thank you too. Nice to hear from those of you who got through almost unscathed! Mustlovepoodles- you are an inspiration to me! I have been battling my JP drains since week 2...Today I had 1 side aspirated and the other side won a drain back...I go back to work with it next Thursday. I work Recovery Room. As far as the chemo goes, I am 'scared half to death', but leaning towards it...just feel I might try to kick myself if I don't. Still thinking though...think I will continue to read your comments...over and over. Thanks again!",

I still have fluid beneath both incisions and am pressured to go back to work. I have to wear a binder so tight (pads, ace bandage, hand towel and sports bra) that I have abrasions that are causing the only pain I have ever had...outside of those zinger pains! So yesterday, when I got the news about chemo I was devastated...still am. My results of genomics were \"High Risk Luminal Type B\". Unsure of this test as I was preparing for the Oncotype score. I am not a gambler by any means...but I do worry about long standing effects that might make me less engaged in life. As far as hormone therapy, I am uncertain about those too. I already have high cholesterol that I choose to treat with diet and exercise, have had \"white coat\" hypertension, and I have circulation issues with hands and feet not to mention existing joint pain that I just deal with. I don't want to sound like a mess. I have no problems with these things and can manage in life well...now. I worry that adding these drugs will change that! Thanks again to all for sharing... ",
