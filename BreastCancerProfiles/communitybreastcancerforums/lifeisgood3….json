I'm feeling overwhelmed and underprepared for a mastectomy. when i last saw my surgeon it was pretty clear a lumpectomy was all that was needed. I don't know if i'll see him again before my surgery. I did call his nurse and get some info on what to expect vis-a-vis recovery and time off. Also haven't had much time to think about reconstruction , but I feel pretty firmly that i won't do it. Wishing you the best of luck in August. Hope you have many caring hands to help out at home.  ",

If it's any comfort, I've spoken to a few people who say the place we are in right now (waiting) is the hardest. It is so easy to let our minds go to the dark places because we just don't know what to expect. I've had several knee surgeries, including a partial knee replacement a couple of years ago, and was not nearly as nervous then as I am now. I'm planning to stay busy - it's my birthday tomorrow so I'm going to spend some time with friends. I see your history and it looks like you've been through a lot already. I see your picture and it looks like you are a sassy fighter! Yes, part of you is being removed, but it certainly does not define you, or me, or any of us. We are soooo much more than our breasts. Stay strong and tell that hubby of yours to take good care of you. I'll be thinking good thoughts for you next week, and we can compare notes after our surgeries!",

Be a fighter! MsMisha- I understand the family feeling freaked out. It comes with the territory. Let your family get their heads wrapped around this and hopefully they can be good support for you. Also, don't be afraid to lean on those friends who say \"Whatever you need...\" I've 'taken advantage' of my diagnosis and did a little shopping (found a nice, soft, comfy shirt to wear home from the hospital on Thursday), and had a pedicure last night.

I will know more after the formal pathology results. Now that it's done I really think the anxiety leading up to it is much worse than the little bit of pain I'm having now. All the best of those of you still facing your surgeries and treatments. So grateful for this group.",

I've just told people now they have two reasons to be extra-nice to me!! I am told it should be fairly straightforward, but i'm not certain how the lymph node process works. Do they only take one, unless it's cancerous? Do they take a few, just to be sure? I realize i should have asked my surgeon but it was one question that I didnt' have written down.

They are holding dates for surgery for me next week. If the new spot is cancerous, i will go from lumpectomy to mastectomy. Some folks have been asking me, \"Why not just have the mastectomy, instead of doing all of this testing?\" I'm not sure what the answer to that is, if there is a good answer. I imagine it has something to do with the mastectomy is a more extensive surgery and longer recovery time. Anyone else go through this? Thanks...",
