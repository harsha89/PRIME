I've made peace with that, and with the treatment to follow. I haven't had the luxury of breaking down or crying yet, partly because, I'm being strong for everyone else involved, and partly because I'm trusting my awesome God. I wanted to tell you about the incredible lady who did my EKG last week. I'll call her Connie. She told me, she's getting ready to do her 4 th go around with breast cancer. She's been living with it for 16 years. She was the picture of health, and working everyday. She certainly inspired me, as I hope, it inspires you as well. I'll be praying you get an excellent report. Please let us know how it all goes.",

The current dx is HER2+ Er/pr. I guess I won't know much else until after mastectomy, which I'm hoping can hold off til early oct when we'll have better medical coverage. I've met the oncology team at the Stephanie Spielman Comprehensive Breast Center. I really liked them, but I must say, I love the medical oncologist. She was highly recommended by a friend (stage IV survivor almost 10 years), and also by my surgeon. When I told her, \" I will be your 2nd miracle,\" she smiled, and hugged me and said, \" yes, you will be.\" I've made peace with mastectomy, and treatments, hair loss etc, but not knowing stage, or if there are mets is difficult. My husband is one of those that acts like...if I ignore the problem, It will go away, so I'm concerned for him. I'm also wondering about bras & such right after surgery. I don't want to miss church any more than I have to. It's such a huge part of my life. They are all so supportive of me. Does anyone know how soon you can wear a bra that looks at all fit for public?",

Now I have my energy back with absolutely no SEs. This is Day 13. My question is...Do you think my WBC has probably bounced back? I didn't get Neulasta or neupogin, but I feel like I never had chemo. I think if I had known about the steroids leaving the body (the funk, the peeing) I would have rode it out a little better. As it was, I thought I was getting a uti, and that depression had come to stay. Are chills a common SE for some people? Blessings Paula",

I knew that I'd be crushed when I had to look at the incision, but, it looked pretty good. I wasn't grossed out at all. My surgeon, or whoever closed the incision did a great job. They glued it together. I don't think there will be too much scarring. I did not get tissue expanders. They will do recon in 8-12 months, depending if I have radiation. When they gave me discharge papers, hey also had me fill out paperwork for assistance. I had broth, pretzels, & crackers before taking the Percocet. Then about 10 pm they brought me a turkey sandwich, vegetable beef soup, and a yogurt. I chose the yogurt for the acidophilus. Anti-biotics can give you a really bad yeast infection, and nobody wants to deal with that with everything else we have to deal with. So ask them to give you yogurt. The nurses had it in the nurses station. If you don't like yogurt, then get acidophilus. You can get it at any drug store. I get mine at Walmart. Blessings Paula",

I had read the pathology report, but didn't go far enough. After final report the her2 was negative. I'm still learning what that is. Anyone here who can enlighten me?

So far, with my only treatment being arimidex, and no symptoms or side effects of medicine it's been easy to pretend this doesn't exist, but its almost time to face reality. Isn't the Ohio landscape beautiful this year? Seems like we were cheated out of all this brilliance on the trees the last couple of years. We are hoping we don't get a storm that blows them all away before next Sunday, when we can take a long drive after church into the Hocking Hills. Another couple from church are going with us and we'll. stop for church along the way. Well I'd better get myself dressed. We leave for worship service at 10am. Blessings Paula",

He gave me 4 drains for a single mx, insisted on removing only one per week, and requested that I not drive or use that arm until ALL drains were out for 1 week. He also won't write for bras or prosthesis until 12 weeks post surgery. His bedside manner leaves something to be desired, but he's an excellent surgeon. I guess his deal with not sleeping on that side is because of the lymph nodes that were removed. He's trying to lesson the chances of lymphedema. I do have some swelling on the mx side. When BS saw it a couple of weeks ago, he said it didn't seem overly swollen. It's the flesh on my side under my arm, and in the upper arm. There's no tightness, or pain, or any discomfort at all. It just concerns me some. Has anyone else had this? Im at the end of my 4th day if I count chemo day. I feel fine.

I know with this being so recent for you both, you should have some insight to share with me and others who are still waiting for surgery. Dulcigirl thanks for the tips. I've got my stool softener ready, and looking for something soft to protect surgery area from seatbelt. Wendy you & I may very well run into each other at some point at the Stephanie Speilman Center. Have you been there at all yet? It's a really nice place. All testing & treatment is done there. The staff is excellent. There is a Hope's Boutique on the 1st floor, where you can get whatever you might need to make you more comfortable, and beautiful through this battle. They have wigs, hats, scarves, jewelry, lotions, camisoles, bras, foobs, compression garments, clothes. Their staff are trained to work with BC patients, so they are kind and respectful too. There's a cafe around the corner to the right of the elevators on the 1st floor. I haven't been in there yet, but since you will probably have someone with you at some of your appointments, it might be good to know. Also, since the Stephanie is part of the James Cancer Center, you will receive a beautiful quilt from a group of volunteers called the Stitching Sisters. Have a blessed day Girls. I'm praying for you all. Blessings Paula",

I've been proud of myself, as my Percocet can be taken every 4 hours, but I've been going 8 hours without it. Of course, if I have pain I will take them sooner. I just don't want to become dependent on them. I had been told I'd have 2 drains, so you can imagine how I felt when I woke up with 4. I was amazed at the great staff at OSU Hospital. They were kind, and really on their toes. I never waited more than 15 minutes to get my meds when I asked for them. I was concerned because my temp was gradually rising. It was 100 about an hour before discharge. I didn't want anything to keep me in here. I'm sleeping in the post surgery camisol, only because it has pockets for the drains. My husband didn't think he'd be able to do the drains, but once he watched the nurse do it, he was fine with it. I will be fine once these drains come out, and I get a little strength. About looking at the incision: I was sure I wasn't going to look for a long time, but whe I did see it, I was amazed at how good it looks. The surgeon used glue, and the scar will be very neat. I'm not getting recon for 8-12 months, depending on if I need radiation. I hope I don't need it. I am taking stool soften, because pain meds really block you up. Prayers for you Connie, and the rest of you having surgery his week. Blessings Paula",

If I'd have drank my usual huge cup of coffee, the sinus pressure would have gone away quickly, but as I couldn't have anything to eat or drink after midnight, I kept the headache until I got pain meds after surgery. I'm thinking of you girls who are getting ready for surgery. You'll be amazed at how much better it is to be done with surgery. Don't forget get ask for anti-nausea meds. You'll probably see the anesthesiologist before surgery, so ask him/her to give you something to avoid nausea. Blessings Paula",

The cosmetologist told us to wash and condition our hair or baldness just like we always did. Using your usual products. She said DON'T use shampoos with conditioner built in. Shampoo hair or scalp, then rinse, apply conditioner and leave it while you finish your shower, then rinse. She said this will help your new hair when it begins to grow back in. You can register for Look Good Feel Better by calling the American Cancer Society. Blessings Paula",

I get it at Walmart for about $2.49 for a 10 day supply. I still have a bit of stiffness when I first get up, but don't have all that bone pain.  I also have degenerative joint disease, which generic Tylenol helps. I take it in the morning with my arimidex. It's an easy way to find out if this pain is caused by tamoxifen. Paula",

Sometimes when a muscle contracts really hard it can be sore for a couple of days, but I doubt that's what's causing on going pain. Try the Loratidine (generic Claritin) for a few days and see if it makes a difference, but by all means get it checked out. Years ago I had really bad leg cramps, so I did some research to find out how to avoid them. Turns out I was low on calcium (post menopausal), potassium, & magnesium, and I wasn't getting enough fluids. Dehydration will definitely cause you to cramp. Paula",

The scans were good except for a wicked bright area of the shoulder that showed more activity than my knee & spine where there is degenerative joint disease. So, I had an MRI which was supposed to take 25-30 minutes. My spine was killing me from that hard table, so when they pulled me out to do contrast dye and 30 more minutes of MRI, I begged off. Therefore, the radiologist would not commit to no mets. My BS, onc, researcher, and I all believe it is arthritis as I've had bursitis in that shoulder over the years, but without the radiologists word I can't be involved in the trial. I'm ok with that. I had minimal SEs with AC. I'm so thankful for that. I have my Fighting Boots on. I will beat this. Blessings Paula",

I have just a bit of stiffness when Ive sat for a long time or been in bed, but that is gone by the time I walk to the bathroom. I don't get the hot flashes that many women get, but I didn't have them with menopause either and I think there's a correlation there.

Stephanie please ask for a port, especially if you're getting Adriamiacin. It can leak from the vein and cause dire consequences. My infusion nurse told me it happens much more often than they like to admit. Besides getting your chemo through the port, they can also do all your blood draws, and if you need dye for scans they can use the port to administer that too.

You won't need Neulasta, because you have an extra week to bounce back before your next treatment. There's another good reason to get it every 3 weeks as opposed to dose dense. It's less likely to cause weakened heart muscle, and pre-leukemia down the road. Many of you may have heard that Robin Roberts of Good Morning America had a bone marrow transplant earlier this year for pre-leukemia. It was caused by the dose dense Adria/cytoxan she received in 2007 when she had breast cancer. My onc gives it to all her patients every 3 weeks rather than dose dense. Best wishes Paula",

I wanted someone to answer you right away. I'm a believer and I know personally that God does do miracles everyday. I read on this forum a few weeks ago a post from a woman who was stage IV, mets in liver, lungs, and bones from skull to knees. She had just gone for scans, and was in shock because the onc told her she is disease free. They told her it was miraculous! I don't remember her name or the exact thread, but it was in the stage IV only. It's very difficult to understand why some are healed and others aren't, and I don't pretend to know the answer to that. I will promise you, that I will be praying for you to be healed.

Crazywabbit, since you're ER/PR +, I assume you'll be taking either arimidex or tamoxifen depending whether or not you're post or pre menopausal. Claritin works for the bone & joint pain associated with those too. Usually getting a headache after chemo is caused by the infusion being run too quickly. I had headache after the first 2 infusions. Ask your nurse to slow it down a bit. Weekly Taxol is so much easier. My only SE was fatigue. However, you do need to protect yourself from neuropathy. You can do that by getting L-Glutamine at GNC. Take 30 grams daily. One heaping tsp is 5 grams. I used 15 grams twice daily. I mixed it with grape juice in a tiny little juice glass. Also take vitamin B6.  Warrior, I love the Look Good Feel Better class. It was very informative. They give you a makeup kit for your skin type plus other gifts. Enjoy. Paula",

Just find something that tastes good to you. I could taste Taco Bell. On Thursday & Friday of the first week I would be very cold! but no fever! and I peed about 400 times a day. I found out later that was the steroids leaving my body while sticking their tongues out at me as they left. On Saturday I was completely back to normal, tastebuds & all. I did have major fatigue & anemia, but compared to how people used to suffer through chemo, I considered myself blessed. I NEVER got Thrush because I ate a yogurt everyday. If you don't like yogurt take acidophilus. I NEVER got mouth sores because I made a mixture of 1 TBS salt & 1 TBS baking soda in a quart or so of water. I kept it in the bathroom, and everytime I used the toilet, I took a swig, swished it in my mouth for 30 seconds and spit it out. Works great! If you get a headache from chemo, it's almost always from them running the infusion too fast. Just ask the nurse to slow it down next time. Myra, sorry, I see that now. I was also dx at stage IIIc. I just had a bone scan Monday and everything is fine.  I always took my iPad and a book to chemo. They usually offer you snacks & drinks.  I found I needed to take a stool softener the day of chemo and for several days after. They will probably tell you this, but in case they forget, after using the bathroom, close the lid and flush twice for the first couple days after treatment. That protects you & family from the chemicals. Best wishes you'll all do fine. The not knowing what to expect is the hardest. Paula",

If chemo has to be delayed further, they can always start you on tamoxifen or arimidex until chemo starts. I delayed surgery for about 6 or 7 weeks because of insurance issues, so my docs put me on arimidex in the meantime, so we were doing something proactive. Paula",

So I had an MRI that was supposed to last 25 minutes. After 30 minutes they pulled me out and said they needed to inject dye and do another 30 minutes. My back hurt so badly from that hard table, I told hem I just couldn't do it. I limped out of there like a 90 year old woman. Because I couldn't complete the MRI, the radiologist wouldn't commit to it being arthritis. He said, it could be mets, but he couldn't say either way. So, now I have to go through all of that again.

I also rinse my mouth 4 or 5 times a day with a mixture of baking soda & salt in warm water. I have a 24 year old son has been Type I diabetic since he was 6 years old. He takes 4 insulin injections a day. Since diabetics are a bit more susceptible to yeast infection and thrush of the mouth is yeast, I find it very helpful to take 1 acidophilus pill each day, and I eat yogurt every day. So far, no mouth problems at all. Since you're getting taxotere and one side effect is neuropathy in feet & hands, ask your onc about taking vitamin B6. It's supposed to help. I pray you have an easy time. My side effects have been minimal. Blessings Paula",

They moved to Ky. several years ago when her husband retired. He died last Spring. After my DX, she called to ask me why I got checked. She said when her DH was sick she found a lump, but ignored it because caring for him was a full time job. Since then it had grown and become painful. So, on November 16 she had a mammo, which came back clear, but the lump is still there and is still painful. I'm really concerned that something was missed, and since she's in such a small town, she may slip through the cracks. I'm going to check on her Monday, and see if I can get her to go somewhere else.

Tricia~I had no idea how much pain is involved in this until I had it myself. I'm sure it's indirectly related to chemo, in that because I've been so inactive the past 6 weeks because of SEs. I went back to OSU this morning to get 4 of the injections I needed. The social worker had me call her cell as we were arriving, then brought the meds right out to our truck so that I didn't have to walk. How kind! I have to call the hospital pharmacy rep on Monday to get help with the remaining 6 injections. I have Medicare D. The 10 injections were $1000 and my co-pay was $400, which I didn't have.

Hopefully, because of the incredible price of the injections, the pharmaceutical company will help. They're usually pretty good about that. Blessings Paula",

There were 4 of us in the class (all BC warriors). The cosmetologist had been teaching this class since 1989. She gave us each a nice bag with cleanser, moisturizer, foundation, lipstick, mascara, eyeliner, eyebrow pencil, powder, and sponges. She showed us how to apply makeup, how to tie scarves, take care of wigs, etc. when we left we got to pick out a hat to take, and were each given a beautiful vase full of fresh cut flowers donated by a local florist. The class was friendly, relaxing, and informative. I really enjoyed. I hope you do too. Blessings Paula",

The nurses will be right there though with emergency kit just in case. She also told me I can start on vitamin B6 today to get it into my system to help against neuopathy. Said, to wear gloves to do dishes or for working in any kind of water, to cut nails short, and to NOT USE MY HANDS AT ALL FOR WORK first day after treatment. I don't know if that is just first treatment or all treatments, but I understood it to be the first one. Blessings Paula",

Some people get Taxol dose dense (bi-weekly). I'm getting it in 12 weekly treatments. When all is done they will have gotten the same amount of chemo in 4 doses as I'm getting in 12.

I thought I might have to do it myself. I had scans on Wednsday to determine if there are mets, as tumor was large and there were 13 positive nodes. I see the onc on Monday, then I should know if I'm starting in Nov, or Dec. Im hoping to do Thursdays, so I can get the Neulasta at the Breast Center on Fridays. Otherwise, I'd have to go to OSU on Saturday for the shot, which entails $5.00 for parking, a lot more walking (I use a cane), and maybe a longer wait. So, I'm thinking, I'll either start on Nov. 29, or Dec. 6. Either way, I'm glad you ladies are here so we can share our experiences, and encourage each other. Blessings Paula",

It's the stories of the veterans on this forum that gives us Hope, and helps us cope. Nicole~Not long after dx I was standing at the bathroom mirror mourning the breast I was about to lose, feeling sorry for myself. Then I remembered the brother of a man in my church. Jim had a spot on his face that his family kept pushing him to get checked, but Jim was stubborn and wouldn't go. Long story short...It ended up being cancer all through his face. He had to have the whole left side of his face removed. Nose, cheek, jaw, part of his mouth. He was able to keep the eye. Anyway, I thought to myself...I'm mourning a breast...This poor man is basically losing his identity...His Face!!! It helped me put things into perspective.

I haven't had any SEs at all except I got a little bit jittery late last night, mostly in my legs, so I took an Ativan along with my Unisom. I went to sleep quickly, and slept very well. I take the steroids once today, then twice on Sunday & Monday. I hope I still sleep well. At the Breast Center they put you in a private or semi-private room for your infusion. Very Nice! Skimommi~I can't believe you have those awful chicken pox as an adult. Had you been around anyone with shingles? That will give chicken pox to anyone who hasn't had them before. I had them in 2nd grade. I hope you're over it soon. N8tureGrl~Than you for checking in and encouraging us newbies. I started chemo yesterday, so Thursday evening I got my long hair cut off to donate to Locks of Love. I have a wig ( short auburn bob ), hats & scarves. When it starts to fall, my DH will do the deed. Blessings Paula",

She was in rehab for 2 months after another set back and hospital stay. She got a horrible diaper rash in the rehab. A bright red, raw, rash. Nurses worked on it for 2 months and it was barely better. When she came home I treated it with Aquaphor with about 5 TBS of Mylanta mixed in. The burning rash was completely gone in 3 days.

I asked the BS if I could wait until we had insurance in oct. he was ok with that, but wanted me doing something, so the mo started me on arimidex. I took it for a month or so before surgery. I'm off it now until after treatment. The bad thing is the job didn't work out, so I still have only Medicare. Sickofpink I'm glad you had such great friends around you while going through a difficult time. I'm getting my hair cut very short next week. Donating to LOCKS of LOVE. MeganB that's good to know about the saline, and it makes perfect sense.

One 2X today, then tomorrow I start taking 1 three X daily. No problems with constipation that way. Be sure to drink lots of fluids. My taste buds didn't leave until Days 6, 7, & 8. They were back by Day 9. I found other things that I could taste a little better during that time. Get plenty of protein, red meat, peanut butter, dairy, etc to keep your red blood cell count up. You may have a day or two of depression. Just ride it out. It won't last. You may have a couple of days of non-stop peeing. That and depression are the steroids leaving your system. I was also very cold on Days 7 & 8. If you're taking steroids, don't be afraid to take the Ativan at night to sleep. Steroids ruin your sleep, but the Ativan really helps. Don't be afraid to ask your onc any questions you have, and if your have problems the meds don't help, by all means, call them. That's what they're there for. They want you to call if you need anything. Beachloving~you can any probiotic in the vitamin section of any pharmacy, Walmart, etc. also get Kefir (spelling) in the dairy section. It's like a tasty yogurt smoothy. It's a good source of probiotic. Ok Girls, I'm off to buzz my hair. Blessings Paula",

About an hour before chemo rub a dab on the port site and cover it with a small square of plastic wrap like Saran Wrap. There's no need to tape it. The Emla Cream will hold it in place. It will numb the area so you don't feel it when then access your port. Some people do an awful lot of complaining about their port. I had NO problems at all. I watched on the monitor as they placed it. I was completely relaxed from the meds, but was aware. NO PAIN at all. I even slept on that side the same night. I finished chemo in May, but since I was diagnosed at stage III, they suggested I keep the port for at least a year. I never know its there, unless I happen to touch it and feel the little bump. Ask them to place it so it's not rubbed by bra straps. Paula",

I just go every 6 weeks or so to get it flushed. I've never had one moments problems with it. I didn't go to chemo class. The nurses, pharmacist, & researcher, worked with me individually, so between what they taught me, and what I learned on BCO I felt like I had it covered. I will tell you a couple easy, inexpensive ways to protect your mouth from sores or Thrush. 1) mix 1 TBS salt with 1 TBS of baking soda in a quart or so of water. Keep it in the bathroom and every time you use the potty, take a swig, swish around in your mouth for 10-30 seconds then spit it out. I never had mouth sores or even tenderness. 2) every day eat a yogurt, or just take an acidophilus. It will protect your mouth from Thrush. 3) for the first few days after chemo, always close the toilet lid before flushing, and FLUSH TWICE!!! That will protect you and your family from chemicals being spewed into the air from flushing. 4) Hydrate....water, lemonade, Gatorade, decaf tea. Whatever tastes good to you, but caffein doesn't count. 5) Rest when you can. Chemo saps your energy, so when friends or family ask what they can do, tell them, even if it's just driving you for chemo, or fixing a meal for your family. Most people want to feel like they can help in some way. They just aren't sure what to do. TELL THEM! 6) try not to worry too much about hair loss. IT COMES BACK RATHER QUICKLY! My hair was long & straight before chemo. I had it cut in a pixie the night before starting chemo. The night before my second chemo (3 weeks later) I had my son buzz it off. You don't need to shave it. I bought pretty scarves & learned how to tie turbans on the Internet. Even some cool tee shirt wraps. I loved how quickly I could get ready for church. I still shampooed my bald head, then towel dried it, but I put the pony tail Doo Dads, brushes, & hot rollers away. My hair came back in curly! It will probably go straight again eventually, but for now I'm enjoying the curls.  7) there many great meds for nausea. So if you have nausea, and what they give you isn't working, call your doc. There's always someone on call, and they don't want you sick. I had 4 Adria/Cytoxan (every 3 weeks). Then 12 weekly Taxol. I NEVER had nausea. I still have the entire bottle of pills they gave me for it. Never even opened it. 8) HYDRATE HYDRATE HYDRATE 9) don't be surprised if you have to take a lot of breaks. I would get out of the shower & sit on the toilet to dry off. I'd sit there for maybe 5 minutes before I had the energy to get dressed. When going to church or the store, my husband would drop me at the door & pick me up again. 10) Wash hands frequently & remind others around you to do the same.  HYDRATE!!! Put your fighting boots on & slay this dragon!!!!",

I have a 24 year old son who has been Type I diabetic since age 6, taking 4 insulin injections daily, plus he has migraines, enlarged liver and is HIV positive. Shortly after that diagnosis in March 2009 my beloved Aunt June fell in her home and suffered a severe head injury, so after surgery and rehab she came to live with us. I did everything for her including changing diapers. She was with me for over 3 years until she passed away in late June. After 12 years of sobriety, 5 years ago my husband literally jumped off the wagon. So after years of taking care of everyone else, I forgot to take care of me. Two weeks after my Aunt June (affectionately called A.J.) died, I noticed some tenderness in my left nipple, similar to the tenderness I sometimes had back in the day when I still had periods. It didn't last but an hour or 2, but it was enough to remind me that I was late getting a mammogram. I figured a year and half or 2 years late, but it was 4 years. I was so upset with myself and even embarrassed. I had always gotten them yearly since turning 40. Two weeks later I got the mammo. The left one hurt like the devil. I just kind of knew. A few days later I had another mammo and ultra sound. While I was still on the table the radiologist came in to say, he was 70% sure there was a cancer. A week later another US and a biopsy. Two days later the surgeons office called with the dreaded news. So, here I am, 4 weeks out from mastectomy, last drain out yesterday, scans today to rule out mets. I see the onc on Monday to discuss scans, port placement, and start date for chemo. Thank you all for sharing your journey with me. I'm not sure ill get started by the end of next week which is the end of November, but I feel like you're my new besties. Blessings Paula",

I think it was from the zophran given before treatment. I went to church sunday, and out to lunch with friends afterwards, then DH & I took a nice nap. No other side effects, but I'm really tired today, so I'm going to go have a nice nap. Powermom~you started with me. I'll hope you're doing well. I'm rooting for you! Blessings Paula",

I'm really praying they rebound quickly so I don't have any treatments delayed. I really want to stay on schedule. I've had no nausea with any of my chemo, but with AC I dealt with fatigue, faintness, shortness of breath, and dead skunk tastebuds. Several days after my final AC, I developed a blood clot in my leg, so I'm on Lovenox injections twice daily. I guess I have to do that until I finish chemo. I'm sure that was related to chemo in that I was so inactive because of SEs. I hope this gets better for you really soon. Blessings Paula",

To prevent mouth sores I rinsed my mouth several times a day with a mixture of 1 TBS baking soda & 1TBS salt in a quart of water. I got in the habit of doing it each time I used the restroom. Just rinse for 30 seconds or so, and spit it out. I NEVER got a single mouth sore. Blessings Paula",

I think you'll be able to do that just fine. You didn't mention which chemo you'll be getting. I'm getting Adria/cytoxan every third weeks for 4 treatments. Then 12 weekly taxol. I just had my 2nd chemo this past Friday. I've had no nausea or vomiting. The anti-nausea meds tend to cause constipation, so I get a head start by taking a stool softener in the morning and one in the evening, starting the day before chemo. I do that for several days. I take an acidophilus each morning, eat a yogurt a day, and rinse my mouth several times a day with a mix of 1.tsp salt & 1tsp baking soda in a pint of water. That protects me from mouth sores and thrush. You can also use Biotene mouth wash or toothpaste. As far as I can tell from my Bloodwork, chemo hasn't affected my blood glucose levels at all. I tried for many years to get my son to have an insulin pump. He refused. He doesn't have the best of control. His A1C has been as high as 12.

I don't usually wear anything on my buzz at home, but I wear hats, scarves, and my favorite, \"T-shirt wraps\" at church or anywhere else I go. I've heard great things about Zangmeister. My best friends husband was treated there 2 years ago for stage 3 colon cancer. He is cancer free. I also know 2 ladies who are cancer free now, who were treated there. One had BC, the other had Lymphoma. We're you speaking of Reneeinohio? I know she's in Westerville and being treated at the Stephanie too. It was more difficult at first, losing my hair than losing my breast, but I figured there's no sense in making myself miserable over something I have no control over. So, the day before I started chemo, I cut my long hair in a short pixie, then the day before chemo 2 I had my son buzz it. It's a lot easier than watching all those long strands fall all over the place. I'm a christian and my faith has really helped with my attitude. Please let me know if you have any more questions.

I had 4 treatments of AC and got them every 3 weeks so I didn't need Neulasta since I had an extra week to bounce back. Has anyone told you to take Claritin to combat the bone pain associated with Neulasta. The generic, Loratidine, works just as well for a fraction of the cost. I take it to combat the bone pain caused by arimidex (estrogen sucking drug). We are all different, but I can tell you how AC affected me, and how I coped. I had treatments on Fridays every 3 weeks. Counting Friday as Day 1. I felt fine for a few days. Taste buds left me about Day 6. But were fine by Day 9. On Days 7-8 I had to pee what seemed like 400 times a day, and I had chills, but no fever. I later learned that was the steroids leaving my body. (Sticking their tongues out as they waved bye bye) A few days after my second tx I got very light headed when standing (probably anemia from low RBC) I stayed very weak throughout AC, but was never nauseus. I kept mouth sores away by rinsing my mouth several times a day with a mix of 1 qt. water with 1 TBS salt and 1 TBS baking soda. I kept it in a closed container on the bathroom sink and everytime I went to the bathroom I'd rinse for 10-15 seconds and spit it out. NO MOUTH SORES EVER! To avoid thrush of the mouth, I took acidophilus everyday. Eating yogurt works too. Just make sure it contains acidophilus. If you can get your oncologist to let you do your AC every 3 weeks instead of dose dense it's better for you. 1) you won't need Neulasta 2) there's less chance of weakening the heart muscle 3) there's much less chance of developing leukemia in the future I hope this helps. If I can can help in any way, please let me know. Blessings Paula",

Typically you're given nausea meds just before chemo, either by mouth or IV. The Ativan & zophran are for the off chance you might have nausea after chemo. Most people don't. Ativan is great for nausea, but also for anxiety. The Claritin (or the generic Loratidine) should be taken the day before your Neulasta shot and for 4 or 5 days after. It will greatly reduce the bone pain associated with Neulasta. Please continue to check in with us here. Blessings Paula",

Not when we're spewing at both ends or seeing our bald heads the first few times, but when you're out and about, do your best to put on a smile :>) I have a friend who sometimes has to answer her husbands business phone in her home (plumbing). She says if you smile while you're answering the phone it comes across in your voice. I get accused of having great strength through this too. I like that idea. I'm hoping that I can be an inspiration to anyone I know who may ever go through something like this. But right now Michelle, I'm just praying for you, that this will soon be just a vague memory.

My sister went down to the cafe to get us a sandwich during treatment. She could have gone to a fast food close by too. They do suggest you eat before going for treatment. I had 2 pieces of toast and a yogurt, and coffee. What kind of chemo are you getting? I got Adria/cytoxan and my week since has gone pretty smooth. Blessings Paula",

I never had nausea thanks to the drugs given before treatment. I took my Ativan at bedtime only, on the steroid days. The first day off steroids, Tuesday, I was more tired & sleepy than usual. On Wednsday I was very down in the dumps. On Thursday & Friday I was very cold & a bit achy. On Saturday I was back to being me. Also, between Thursday night and Friday night it felt like I peed 400 times. I found out the excessive peeing and the Wednsday FUNK were from the steroids leaving my system. I had a difficult time tasting anything Wednsday & Thursday. On Saturday I felt fine. Today is Sunday and I can't wait to go to church and out to lunch with my husband & friends after. All in all I'd say my SEs (side effects) were minimal. I took a stool softener twice a day for a week. I'm still taking one a day. Wash hands or use sanitizer, avoid crowds, rinse your mouth with the salt/baking soda mixture at least 4 times a day. I also took acidophilus and ate a yogurt everyday, because chemo kills good cells as well as bad ones and I wanted to avoid a yeast infection ( mouth thrush or vaginal). My beverage of choice is decaf iced tea, but I haven't drank it since chemo day. I didn't want chemo to ruin it for me. I've been drinking flavored waters and Cranberry/Gingerale. On the days my taste buds weren't working I could taste Edy's Peppermint Ice Cream and McDonalds fish sandwich which by the way has 30 grams of protein and we need to make sure to get enough protein. I hope this helps someone. One more thing....If I had known ahead of time about the day of funk and the peeing from steroids leaving the body, I would have just hunkered down and rode it out instead of worrying that I was getting sick.

(Deep vein thrombosis). They started me on injections I give myself twice daily in the stomach. I was also on Coumadin. On Wednsday I saw the nurse/practioner for follow up and she said, because I still have 12 weekly taxol to take, I have to continue the shots through that 12 weeks. They took me off Coumadin. I was also dx with a UTI. They gave me macrobid for that which caused a bright red rash on my legs. I've never been sick. I'm 62. Had the flu twice in my life. I can shake a cold in 3 days. Now this crud! I pray you are all doing well. Blessings Paula",

My DH has always been the type that when something bad comes along, especially dealing with a life threatening disease, he acts like if he ignores it, it will go away. 20 years ago his cousin, who was also his best friend was dx with cancer of the pancreas. He wouldn't call Michael or contact him in any way. I knew he was grieving over it, but didn't know how to handle the situation. We lived in Florida at he time and Michael lived here in Ohio. I finally bought a \"Thinking of you card.\" Jim wrote him a note in the card and mailed it. Michael died days after receiving that card. I was so glad I had insisted on Jim sending it. He took me to all my post surgery appointments and cleaned my drains, but he doesn't want to talk about this. I've found over the years (I'm 62) that men always think they're supposed to fix things, so when they can't fix it, it's easier to ignore. That doesn't mean they don't care. Sometimes, it's just their way of dealing. Blessings Paula",

On Tuesday I was more tired than usual, but a nap took care of that. Wednsday I was depressed. That was my second day off steroids so the downer was from those leaving my body. Thursday the funk left, but I was so cold in the evening hours I stayed wrapped in my robe, blanket, & socks with the heat cranked up. Same thing on Friday. I didn't have a fever. Saturday I was back to normal. Oh yes, from Thursday night to Friday night it felt like I peed 400 times. (Also the steroids leaving the body). If I had known that coming down from steroids caused the day of depression, I could have just hunkered in an rode it out easier, but I thought it had come to stay. If I had known that I was peeing out the steroids on day 6 & 7 I wouldn't have been worried I was getting a uti. I did lose my sense of taste for about 3 days, but I could taste Edy's Peppermint Ice Cream & McDonalds fish sandwich (30 grams of protein). Drink your fluids, be sure to rinse your mouth several times a day with the baking soda/salt mixture. I did and didn't have any problems at all with my mouth. Keep us posted on your progress.

Pet scan showed no abnormalities, but mo had the bone surgeon check out all the scans to see if a bone biopsy was in order.

I took an acidophilus every morning (refrigerate when opened) and ate a yogurt each day. My thought was, thrush is an over production of yeast, and if the A & yogurt keep me from getting a vaginal yeast infection when I'm on antibiotics, why wouldn't it work for chemo and mouth thrush. Rinse your mouth several times daily with 1TBS salt & 1 TBS baking soda in a quart of water. I brushed my teeth once a day with a fluoride toothpaste. The rest of the time I brushed or just rinsed with the mixture. I had absolutely NO mouth problems. I hope this works for you. I get my 2nd Adria/cytoxan this Friday. Blessings Paula",

I really felt it was viral so I didn't bother with antibiotics. I went to the dollar store and got Tussin DM. I think it's the generic for Robitussin DM. It quiets the cough, but also helps you to get all that phehm up. I was actually able to get some rest and it let my husband sleep too. I had AC #3 a week later, and in fighting that on my own, my WBC was higher than before I started my first chemo. I hope you get some relief soon. Blessings Paula",

My BS won't give me a script for bras or prosthesis until I'm 12 weeks post surgery. It's been almost 6. I had to have EKG, Echocariogram, bloodwork, and an MRI today. The MRI is to rule out mets to the shoulder because that area showed more activity than other places that I have arthritis or degeneration. We're still 99% sure that's all this on the shoulder is too. Anyway, MRI was last test of the day. As soon as they slid me inside I saw that it was just too close to my face. I'm not claustrophobic, but I felt like I couldn't breathe. So I asked them to stop. So, no MRI yet.

Depending on how often you get chemo, you may get a shot(Neulasta or neupogin) the day after to boost your WBC. I got Adria/cytoxan 4 treatments. I got them every three weeks, so since I had an extra week to bounce back I never got Neulasta and I did fine. I got a cold after AC #2. I doctored it with over the counter meds and fighting that cold actually boosted my WBC. I had surgery in October and it was about that time the cancer story unfolded on Parenthood. So it was really close to my heart. I've always loved the family dynamic of the show anyway. The producer of the show's wife had just been through her own battle with breast cancer, that's why they were able to keep it so true to life.

I've watched it from the beginning. As I recall, they did this last year, and I think it was replaced with a hokey reality show. Does anyone else notice how the powers that be have a problem showing anything family related other than sitcoms? First they cancelled Judging Amy, then Brothers & Sisters. I hope Parenthood can hold its own. Blessings Paula",

A couple of years ago there was a reality show about a woman who weighed well over 300 pounds. They followed her in her everyday life while trying to lose weight. I can't remember her name, but her battle also affected those who were close to her. Along those same lines they could document her fears, surgery, waiting for and getting pathology results, chemo, hair loss, fatigue, etc. Parenthood is usually on NBC Tuesdays at 10:00 pm, unless they change it this year. It usually starts the new season just a bit ahead of the other shows. Blessings Paula",

They argue, but always get past their disagreements. The show has dealt with alcoholism, teen sex, adoption, Asperger's syndrome, infidelity, financial struggles, and bi-racial relationships. It's good to see a family drama on for a change, instead of all the police, reality, and fantasy crap. I hope it's around for a long long time. Blessings Paula",
