I am getting very frustrated with getting prior authorization for BRCA testing.  My breast surgeon's office can't find the code for the test.  I have called my primary doc's office and also Tricare and no one knows anything.  The lady I talked at Tricare had no idea what I was talking about and kept telling me that my doctor should have that information. So if anyone has had the test recently can you please let me know if there was a code on your Tricare statement or if you called a certain number for authorization. Thanks so much!
