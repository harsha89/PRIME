I had double mastectomy and wondered if I should continue, my PS told me to keep going and enjoy it! Only advice she gave is no pressure on the arm or under arm on the left side where I had my Nodes removed. My massage therapist even read up on lymphatic massages. So far I've had no problems with swelling or pain related to the massages. If anything it helps when she very gently rubs my left arm. We are both getting use to my expanders, since we have basically been through the whole process together.",
