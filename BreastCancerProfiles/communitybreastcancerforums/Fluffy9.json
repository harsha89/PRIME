      "Content": "Apr 26, 2013 04:43AM - edited Apr 26, 2013 07:08PM by Fluffy9 I had the same problems with my shoulder blade and arm. Do u spend a lot of time at a computer station using a mouse? The reason I ask is because I had the same type of pain. It was horrible. Sure, the thought of it being bc related was my first concern. But instead of going to my oncologist first, I went to my ortho doc. He told me he had the same problem and he remedied it by lowering the mouse pad at his computer. Instead of it being on the desktop with his keyboard he rigged up something that he used the mouse on below the desktop height. I tried it and it worked! It was great. Just thought I would tell u this. Maybe it will help u. Now if it acts up I do the same thing and it stops it from getting bad.",
