I also had to go back for more mammos and ultrasounds because they found something else, either another lump or a swollen lymph node=( Thanks in advance. The patient presents with a palpable abnormality within the lower-inner quadrant of the left breast. Implants. Full fluid digital mammograms were obtained with CAD. The breast tissue is extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography. Bilateral subpectoral saline implants are intact. In the area of palpable concern is a rounded,mostly circumscribed mass superficial in position measuring 1.3 cm.Â  Benign-appearing calcifications are seen in the left breast. In the superior left breast is an oval subcentimeter asymmetry. Targeted left breast sonogram was performed, which does reveal a lobulated partially circumscribed hypoechoic solid mass measuring 1.7 cm. Though this is superficial in position, this does not appear to extend into the dermis. Impression: (1) Solid, indeterminate mass in the seven o'clock position of the left breast as described. Left breast ultrasound-guided biopsy is recommended. (2) Subcentimeter asymmetry superiorly within the left breast. Focal spot compression view with possible ultrasound is recommended. BI-RADS Category 4: Suspicious abnormality-Biopsy shoul be considered. Log in to post a reply",
