BUT no clean margins, even after two resections!  The path report showed it was ILC, which doesn't show up on mammograms or ultrasounds, so I had an MRI.  Turned out there was also a tumor in each breast.  So my onc. and surgeon got together and decided I should have chemo first.  The hope was that it would clear up my armpit so no further surgery would be needed there--the surgeon was worried about damage to blood vessels & nerves.  I had 4 AC and 4 T, then six weeks later a bilat. mast.  The pathology report showed NO cancer left anywhere--the tumors were gone and also clean in the armpit.  So chemo before surgery is definitely the way to go in some cases.  Yours may be different.  But if your surgeon has never heard of chemo first (called neoadjuvent therapy), get a second opinion. ",

(I kept forgetting them.) Take a tape recorder with you to your doctor's app'ts and record so you can hear it again if needed.  Your regular surgeon should refer you to two or more plastic surgeons.  Go for interview appointments with them, armed with your questions.  I went to two, and only one of them told me you have to have expansion before radiation if you want reconstruction later.  I had a bilat mast on Dec. 4.  The most important part of recovery is not to push yourself.  Take it VERY easy for at least a month.  The best part about a mastectomy is that it really lowers your chance of recurrence--so it definitely can be the right thing to do.  Good luck with your process.  Take it day by day.",

Wow, you had 3 different kinds of cancer?  Wonderful to have it gone!  Keep up that positive attitude!  =)",
