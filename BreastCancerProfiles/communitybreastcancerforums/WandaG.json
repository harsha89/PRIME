I'm a stage IIIb finished chemo in Feb 06 and rads in May 06.  Sometimes the fatigue is overwhelming.  One day I had to put my car in park at a red light so that I didn't have to keep my foot on the brake. After all the treatments I became diabetic then underactive thyroid. Now I've lost weight, 38 pounds, which I'm not complaining about since I ate everything that was not nailed down during chemo.  After blood work now I'm anemic and on iron and B12 shots. Sometimes I get weak and tired to the point that I shake.My doctors have been wonderful to check everything out, but I get so tired to doctor appointments.   I know people that have never made the journey that we have cannot understand how we feel.  Everyone comments on how good I now look at a size 6 and with hair, but little do they know how bad I feel at times. People think that once the treatment is finished you should be normal again, but I wonder what normal is.  Sometimes I think the only normal is a setting on the washing machine. But I'm thankful for each day.",

Park Mastectomy is the least expensive place I found them. I just had my 2nd mastectomy and I've been wearing the Breast Illusions and everyone thinks they look very natural. My daughter-in-law just laughs at me says every time she looks at me she thinks of cream filled donuts, so she calls them my krispy cream donuts.",
