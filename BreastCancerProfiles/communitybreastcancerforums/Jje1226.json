    "Content": "Jun 30, 2017 05:04AM - edited Jun 30, 2017 12:38PM by Jje1226 I also was in your boat about a month ago. I had grade 3 Dcis in my left breast with an focus area of microinvasion. Due to size of dcis 85mm, I did have a masectomy. Currently 1 week out from it, and just did the left side. Overall recovery is going better then I thought. My final pathology came back as pT1mi Sn0. Meet with the oncologist next on the 14th, but everything I am hearing so far is probably no chemo, radiation or hormone therapy. It's all so overwhelming at first, get a couple opinions. Everyday gets a little easier. now i am feeling like it's all a huge blessing we caught it so early.",
