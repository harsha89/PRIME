I think Caris does a bigger genomic profile than Foundation One from what I get in my reading. That might be the better test. Caris test for ER, PR, HER2 also where Foundation One does not I believe. Here is a webpage that compares Caris, Foundation One and OncoDeep&Trace that might be useful to everyone.

It has worked well for me. I am triple negative compared to ER PR +. I am on a three week cycle. First week: carbo and gem, second week: gem only, third week: rest week. I am on neulasta to keep white cell count up. Red cell count down a little but not bad. Platelets usually around 250,000 but last week down go 103,000. My platelets tend to bump up and down and usually is back up to The200 range so I have not had to miss treatments or get platelets. Wishing you well on carbo and gem. Prayers and hugs. Tricia",

I know we can look up clinical trials but I want a database that you can search for any clinical trial related to TNBC, the drugs, and the RESULTS of the trial. I am hoping we could filter by drug or mutation/expression, etc. It just seems the information is scattered everywhere and not one place that summaries results. Such as, the Keytruda trials and TNBC, what were the results from the studies that have been finished and a list of the ones that are continuing. So a synthesis of trial results. Thank you.",

Leaving for Florida tomorrow for about 5 days before my next treatment. Kcan: what drugs are in the clinical trial you are looking at? Some of the trials mix immunotherapy and chemo drugs while others only do chemo or immunotherapy drugs. Just curious. I try and stay on top on any new CLINICAL TRIAL results for TNBC. Always searching for next possible steps. Hope you guys can make decisions soon about which treatment options you are going with Praying for everyone. Hugs. Tricia",

Said as long as the tumors are stable will leave me on current treatment. Will switch if tumors increase or see rise in TMs since TMs have been a good trending measurement in my case. Three more cycles of carbo and Gemzar and then repeat MRI on April 10th unless TMs start to increase. Kaayborg: thanks for the feedback. My side effects on carbo/gemzar are minimal so far. A little more nausea with each infusion but controllable with antiemetic meds. I do have some liver discomfort in front and back now. Onc not sure why since my cancer is less and she does not see any tumors pressing on my liver capsule. She is consulting with some of her other oncs to see if they have any other ideas. She prescribed a muscle relaxant that I will try although the liver is not a muscle so not sure it will work, but I will try to see if it will help. I had no liver pain at beginning of treatment. I have some pretty bad back pain (bone and muscle) that we think is from the neulasta so will try taking Claritin one day prior and a week after administration. The pain gets better during my rest week. Ct chest is clean so no bone Mets seen.",

In March 2017 my CA27.29 was normal, July 2017 my TM was a shocking 791 (or I thought that number was shocking, keep reading). Ct scan at that time was negative although my ALT AND AST were slightly elevated. Onc decide to wait a month and retest. August 2017 my TM was 1867. Did an MRI which showed diffuse liver cancer. By the time I started Carbo/Gemzar at Emory (which I went to to get on a trial, which I didn\u2019t because it would take 3 more weeks and wanted to start chem fast) my TM WAS 3521, yes 3521. Started Carbo/Gemzar in September and my TM is down to 372. I had a TM drawn today and hoping it is more decreased, will find out by end of week. MRI in Nov after 3 cycles of chem showed improvement with tumors decreasing in size by 1 cm (they are tracking 3 tumors). I have an MRI Jan 18th after my 6th cycle. Hoping it continues to show improvement. As far as my liver enzymes, here were my highest values that occurred in September: ALT 209, AST 140, all phosph 135, my total bili has been .3 to .6 the whole time (normal thank heavens). TODAY ALL MY LIVER ENZYMES ARE WITHIN NORMAL RANGE. Also I have a bad fatty liver. Going to a Hepatologist tomorrow to see if I can address my fatty liver. If the cancer doesn\u2019t kill me than my fatty liver might. :( So overall improvement but know my case is serious. I feel good and just trying to live each day one at a time and enjoy. I have my good weeks and bad days with crying but try and focus on all the positives and blessings in my life. Turn to God and pray many times a day for divine healing. ,",

Here is some information about Xeloda that might explain. \u201cChemotherapy drugs that affect cells only when they are dividing are called cell-cycle specific. Chemotherapy drugs that affect cells when they are at rest are called cell-cycle non-specific. The scheduling of chemotherapy is set based on the type of cells, rate at which they divide, and the time at which a given drug is likely to be effective. This is why chemotherapy is typically given in cycles. Chemotherapy is most effective at killing cells that are rapidly dividing. Unfortunately, chemotherapy does not know the difference between the cancerous cells and the normal cells. The \"normal\" cells will grow back and be healthy but in the meantime, side effects occur. The \"normal\" cells most commonly affected by chemotherapy are the blood cells, the cells in the mouth, stomach and bowel, and the hair follicles; resulting in low blood counts, mouth sores, nausea, diarrhea, and/or hair loss. Different drugs may affect different parts of the body. Capecitabine belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites. Antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within the cell. When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they are unable to divide. Antimetabolites are cell-cycle specific. They attack cells at very specific phases in the cycle. Antimetabolites are classified according to the substances with which they interfere.\" So during your off week the cancer cell may be trying to divide and the Xeloda is killing them. Might be why you have pain during off week. I would think cancer cells divide at randomn times and not only during your on week. Source: http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/Xeloda.aspx Just a thought. ",

Had repeat TM this pass week and it dropped to 95. First time in double digits since treatment started (was 3580 at start of treatment). So thankful that the TM dropped some more. Also at the start of treatment I had no liver pain. About the last 5 weeks I have pain in my back and front liver area and pain that radiates to right shoulder. Probably tumor pushing on phrenic nerve. They put me on a steroid challenge thinking inflammation and gabepentine for the nerve pain. Front liver pain better and shoulder pain better but still have some back liver pain. Liver enzymes are normal except alkaline phosphatase that bounces around from normal to elevated about 10-15 points. So just watching right now. Next MRI is April 10th so hoping for tumor shrinkage and less diffuse cancer since TM has decreased some more. Praying and thinking about all of you.",

Next MRI is scheculec for Feb 8th so hoping for continued shrinking of tumors and less cancer. Usually on carbo/gemzar you don\u2019t lose your hair, may have hair thinning. I have not noticed that. Side efffects have been constipation, sore back muscles for two days that starts on day 4 after treatment but only last two days.i get aloxi for nausea and that works well for me for three days. Sometimes have to supplement starting day 4 with zofran but not much. After 4 th cycle had to start getting neulasta for low white count. Hope this combination works well for you.",

Last week\u2019s MRI showed stable tumors but three were more noticeable, not bigger. Maybe be just a technique issue because it was done on a different MRI machine and of course always a different radiologist who reads the scans. So just going to do TMs every cycle and repeat MRI in 12 weeks. I feel good overall. Just some fatigue but fight through that. Just praise God this therapy has worked for 22 months. I do research for clinical trials every week. once this treatment stops I am planning on doing a Caris test to look for mutations and amplifications. Haven\u2019t had one in past. I am looking at personalized vaccine trials as well as in situ tumor trials with immunotherapy. Something different then chemo since I can do chemo if cancer gets out of hand.

I tried to get into the Keytruda trial (355) but they said it would be the end of September before I would start getting treatment. I have extensive mets to my liver and did not want to wait a whole month to start treatment. That was very frustrating to find out the length of time you have to wait to be cleared for a clinical trial. I started Carbo and Gemzar which were going to be the clinical trial drugs with or without Keytruda. Keytruda was the trial drug. Did not want to wait a month of starting treatment and end up in the placebo arm. Switched to Emory MO so hopefully I can get into trials a little quicker. Plan is to see how the Carbo/Gemzar is doing and if not working re-biopsy tumor and send off to get Caris and Rationale Therapeutics testing. I want the Caris and Rationale Therapeutic testing, being at a NCI center is not always open to that but I am going to push for that. So far, little side effects from the Carbo/Gemzar. Just a case of thrush which was treated with Nystatin. Platlets down to 121,000 but hoping they stay above 100,000 to continue the treatment. WBC, RBC and Tot Liver Bil are good at this time. My liver cancer does not image on scans at all, only MRIs. I have a lot of fatty liver that makes scans difficult to read. I have my next MRI the first of December to see if Carbo/Gemzar are working. TMs are done at the beginning of each 21 day cycle. My last TM was 3532 before chemo. If you have any suggestions for me, please feel free to post. I want the doctors to be as aggressive with me as they can. I look up clinical trials and articles all the time to have options and to push my doctors. Prayers and positive thoughts to all.",

INT230-6's three agents are in a fixed ratio. The penetration enhancer facilitates dispersion of the two drugs throughout injected tumors and enables increased diffusion into cancer cells. Nonclinical safety studies showed no findings following drug injection into healthy tissues. Historically physicians administer the two active drugs comprising INT230-6 by intravenous (IV) infusion to achieve a systemic blood level at the limit of tolerability. Unfortunately, dosing drugs IV delivers only a small amount with a low concentration at the tumor site. This approach especially for late stage cancers is not highly effective and often quite toxic to the patient. Past attempts at direct intratumoral injection with chemotherapeutic agents have not shown the ability to treat the injected tumor, non-injected tumors or micro-metastases. This lack of efficacy for local administration is possibly due to poor dispersion and a lack of cell uptake of the agents. Due to the use of a novel cell penetration enhancing agent INT230-6 treatment has demonstrated strong efficacy in animals having large tumors. Our in vivo, pre-clinical data shows that INT230-6 thoroughly saturates and kills injected tumors. In addition, the drug induces an adaptive (T-cell mediated) immune response that attacks not only the injected tumor, but non-injected tumors and unseen micro-metastases. Cured animals become permanently immunized against the type of cancer that INT230-6 eliminates. INT230-6 has shown good long-term stability when stored properly. The drug is now in clinical testing in the U.S and Canada in a Phase 1/2 trial. ",
