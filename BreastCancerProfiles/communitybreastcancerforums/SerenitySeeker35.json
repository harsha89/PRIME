I will start at the beginning... one week ago, I noticed an itch in my right nipple. I went to my gyno the very next day. She performed a general breast exam. She said she didn't feel any lumps and prescribed me some steroid cream for the itch. I never had any other symptoms with the itch so I wasn't too concerned. Fast forward one week, the itch is gone but now my lymphnode near my armpit on the same side is very sore. To be fair, I have been pressing on it pretty regularly checking for any swelling. I keep feeling like it is sore but I don't really feel any swelling/size difference from the left side nor can I see any swelling. Also, my breast is otherwise normal looking and feeling. I have had no change in appearence or any lumps... and trust me, I have checked often. Is it possible that I am fine and just irritated my lymphnode from pressing on it or should I worry? My gyno is supposed to call me back tomorrow with her opinion but I need some input now so I will sleep tonight. Anyone have any experience with this? Thank you all for your support and help.
