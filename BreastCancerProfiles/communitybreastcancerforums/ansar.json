Five weeks later, they fit my surgery into the schedule and it was time I used to research and plan for that event. I really get how the girl scout leadership thing feels big now.  My mind, too,went immediately to those sorts of potential obligations.  The thing is, everyone's treatment is so different, as I'm sure you know, both in what they undergo and how their body deals with it.  It might be something you can handle easily despite treatment, it might not. I wouldn't commit to it right now--maybe there's a way you can be involved with a co-leader or even two?  That would be my  plan.",
