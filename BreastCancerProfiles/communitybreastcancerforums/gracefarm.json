My (right-side) mastectomy was Nov. 2 and the drains were in 5-1/2 weeks. Like you, fluid built up and was aspirated. Now it's building up again and I see the surgeon next week. (One good thing about still being numb is that the aspiration didn't hurt a bit!) But my surgeon didn't order rest, so I was glad to read this advice. Maybe I'm doing too much too soon. Happy New Year, everyone, and may 2011 be better than 2010 was for us! Kim",
