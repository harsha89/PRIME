Most other mammals do not have prominent breasts unless they are currently lactating. Sexualization of breasts harms women and their self esteem. Naturally small breasted women grow up believing we are inadequate and unlovable if our breasts do not grow to \"acceptable\" dimensions. Clothing doesn't fit well, because it's styled to exhibit \"correctly proportioned\" breasts for public approval. Then we are pressured, even as teenagers, into implant surgery to make up for the perceived deficit. It's just as bad, or worse, for women with large breasts -- we are perceived as stupid, promiscuous, or sexually available. Imagine how embarassing this is for a 13 year old girl, and it never gets better. Large-breasted women are pressured in high school to get reductions to participate in ballet, gymnastics, or cheerleading. When reduction DOES make sense to relieve pain and posture problems, insurance companies make us prove it's not just a cosmetic procedure. Either way women receive unwanted attention because of the size of our breasts and we accept that attention as proof that we have failed as females unless we make an effort to conform, whatever the cost to our safety, health, and self esteem. Breast size should NOT dictate our value as human beings. Even with a disease as horrific as breast cancer, we are still pressured to \"normalize\" our appearance after surgery, though reconstruction contributes exactly nothing to subsequent health, extends surgery and recovery time, and has a risk of complications in people whose well being is already compromised by cancer and its treatments. I am fortunate that my surgeon did not continue to pressure me to reconstruct after I said I wanted to be flat after my bilateral mastectomy, and she accomodated my request for a smooth, flat chest. Now that the dressings are gone 2 weeks after surgery, I am pleased with the results -- no extra skin, no dog ears, and smooth incisions. Even so, I still have a lot of swelling and bruising, notably in underarm areas where the elastic binder may have been too tight, plus a lot of blue staining from the SNB, and some dead looking skin on the cancer side that my surgeon assures me will regrow and heal okay. Surprisingly, nobody in my social community who was not already aware of my diagnosis and surgery were even aware that I no longer have breasts until I mentioned it, even though I previously had prominent double-Ds. Everyone else has been very supportive and caring, and I've encountered zero negative comments about my decision not to reconstruct -- in fact quite a few women have said they too went flat, sometimes decades ago, and I Never Even Noticed. That's how important breasts actually are to everyone but ourselves. Maybe it's because I live in a 55+ community where most of us have grown out of our obsession with breasts. Mostly, we're glad to be able to enjoy life, even with the health problems that come with aging. I have complications healing from a simple mastectomy. I cannot imagine how much worse these complications would have been if I had opted for reconstruction. I just want this over with so I can return to a normal life. If others have the stamina and fortitude to proceed with reconstruction, I won't judge you. For me, though, it wasn't the right choice for a multitude of reasons. I wish all of you good health and happiness no matter how you choose to make yourself whole after breast cancer.",

Problem: skin flap necrosis -- 3 weeks duration, and wound dehiscence as of last Saturday. The story so far ... 1 called my surgeon's office first thing Monday am - Doc's on vaycay, PA isn't in, give it half an hour and we'll call back. Called back before lunch, PA was still \"late,\" no ETA. Go see our associate 88 miles away (one way, on lots of toll roads -- twice as far if not) Oh hell no. OK, go to ER. Same hospital that did my bmx. 2 went to ER, seen by doc who said the wound wasn't infected based on bloodwork (btw thanks for the hematoma on the back of my hand -- why oh why do they love to stick fragile old lady hands instead of elbows with big fat veins), the skin is dead and necrotic and dehisced (\"I believe I said that, but thanks\"), and that it needed debridement. Then he went off for about an hour and came back only to give me name/phone of a surgeon who could see me Thursday (today). Me: huh? That's it? Did I just spend 4 hours here and all you can tell me was I oughta get that looked at by a doctor?\" Doc said \"sorry you feel that way\" and handed me discharge instructions. It's been real. 3. Did a lot of calling the next day to see if anyone else in town could see me and fix this. Nope, so I made an appointment with the fill-in. Got a same-day appt with my primary who winced and prescribed Levaquin to knock down the slimy ooze and chase off its relatives in case they show up. Called hospital, spoke to ombudsman, they've started a complaint and investigation and will maybe adjust the bill. Yeah I have retirement savings that need to last me 30 years per Social Security actuarial tables. No, I'm not sending any of that to you for 4 hours of nothing in return. Oh, and my pulse oximeter had someone else's blood on it and there were bugs crawling around. 4. Whined to my nurse navigator at Blue Shield. She's been great all thru this. HER calls get returned pronto and I might be in love. Sure enough, misc staff from surgeon 1's called but none had advice on wound care or could confirm that gaping oozing chest wounds are not necessarily fatal. Surgeon's 2 assistant called, says the doc will be happy to look at it. On Thursday. \"I've already had it looked at, I need this treated,\" described ER experience. Played the \"sad old person without money survived cancer only to die from hospital germs, lives out in the country and tired of trips into town to get looked at\" card. Whined to nurse navigator again. Must have worked ... 5. Surgeon 2 office called saying they would now like photos so doctor can maybe skip the 'look at' phase and advance to 'treat the damn thing already' phase. Obliged with graphic photos. Keeping them on hand for any future internet manbabies who creepy-message me documenting their anatomy. ... days go by or so it seems. ... 6. Surgeon 1 calls, says surgeon 2 got the photos and will fix me up during my office visit. Keep skeptical thoughts to myself. Showered, noticed stitches deep inside the (expanding) wound. They're blue. 7. Today: Surgeon 2 looks at it, runs out to grab a scalpel, and carves out a full serving of Human Jerky, because that's essentially what it is. Damn glad I never drank the reconstruction koolade and stayed flat because just imagine. Skin from collarbone to underboob is basically numb since surgery so there was no pain whatsoever. A swish of peroxide, a squirt of baciatrin into the hole, a wad of gauze, many kind words and that awful paper tape that always makes me itch, and I'm repaired in less than 10 minutes and should heal well in a couple more months. 10 whole minutes that lazy ER doc couldn't spare in the middle of a fairly busy day. 8. Follow up with surgeon 2 in a week. Nice guy, A++++ would visit again. Nurse navigator will call me tomorrow to see how it all went. Went well and probably wouldn't have without her help. I probably won't die from this after all.",

She reused some of the extra skin inside which left a little bit of a ledge so bras won't ride up. I have a bit of underarm flab but nothing resembling the dog ears many others have had. There's still some swelling that is going away slowly. The healed scars are flat and thin. I am mildly diabetic and have high blood pressure which both probably contributed to the flap necrosis. The incision type also has a higher complication rate. I'm not faulting the surgeon at all -- the end result will be smooth and flat, which is what I requested.

I was concerned about that before, but it's showing some new skin growth around the edges which is encouraging. Interestling, the doc explained that the hard swellings under my former boobs are leftover skin she incorporated inside the flaps to encourage healing and avoid a concave appearance -- I asked to stay flat and I think the end result will be very good. A hint of shape without saggy extra skin. I have anchor-shaped incisions that run along the inframammary crease and up to the former nipples. Thus the scars are lower down instead of nipple level, and not nearly as wide as the usual style. Sort of an 'ultimate breast reduction' from how she described it pre-op. I see her again in six months if all goes well. If needed, I can get a revision at that time. First appt with medical oncologist is June 21. I shouldn't need chemo as nodes were clear.

Drains removed (painless!), steristrips removed. Incisions still a bit goopy so the doc cleaned them up and covered with gauze to let them dry out. I'm back in an ace wrap for a couple of days. As I suspected, about 2 to 3 square inches of skin on the right side (not part of the incisions at least) is dying due to poor circulation. Doc is confident it will be fine once the dead skin sloughs off in a few weeks. I can only imagine the complications if I'd opted for reconstruction instead of going flat. Us old farts don't heal as well as you young squirts. My skin is very delicate and reacts angrily to anything it doesn't like. I have blistered skin around the edges of the tegaderm that I removed several days ago. Even the metallic trim on the effing pink ribbons I was using to wrangle the drains raised a line of blisters one sweaty night. I already had to remove the bandaids over the drain holes from earlier today because the skin was burning. Same thing happened after the biopsies -- I rejected the bandaids bigtime. Oddly, the most painful area of my chest is over my sternum. the rest is still swollen here and there, with a real mishmash of sensitivity and numbness. I could swear something was taking a pair of pliers to my non-existent nipples. The doc very kindly gave me a copy of the path report: 3 sentinel nodes plus 1 axillary node removed, all clear. My breasts weighed 653 and 728 grams respectively or just over 3 pounds total, which I found slightly amusing. Tumor was 11 x 8 mm microscopically, unifocal (good, only one -- this type is often multifocal in the same breast), mucinous carcinoma with sheets of neoplastic cells suspended in mucin. Tubule formation <5%, nuclear grade 2, mitotic count 6 figured in 10 hpf, no lymphovascular invasions, no microcalcifications. TNM classification: pT1c, pN0, Mx Stage: IA Lymph nodes showed mild sinus histiocytosis, no atypia, no metastatic cells. I have some googling to do to see what those words mean lol. Left breast had benign parenchyma with fibrocystic change and no significant nuclear atypia or ductal hypoplasia. No in situ or invasive carcinoma. Presumably the entire suspicious area of papilloma and sclerosing adenosis on the non-cancerous side was successfully mined during biopsy a month ago. Next stop is the medical oncologist, who will probably want hormonal treatment as the tumor is ER/PR positive. No chemo needed as it's HER2 negative. No radiation required as all breast tissue was removed. Mucinous carcinoma is a rare tumor type (1 to 3 %), and tends not to be as likely to spread as your standard invasive ductal carcinoma, which is good news. The combination of rarity and non-aggressive behaviour means it doesn't get studied much, though occasionally it does show up as stage IV.",

He started me on Femara 25mg daily. He was informative and answered questions thouroughly, and had obviously read my records beforehand (don''t count on that, or even that they read the right patient's chart) so I feel pretty confident that I'm in good hands. Healing is ongoing but slow. Non cancer side (left) is doing fine, only a few small scabs left. Right side still has large eschar on the vertical part of the Wise pattern (anchor / inverted T). Surgeon assures me it will heal fine so I'm trying not to rush things. I still miss being in the pool, but until it heals completely there's no chance of that.",

Nobody will see me - I'm not their patient, they don't take obamacare (well f me for being poor). Made an appointment with my pc doctor for today. Maybe he can tell me at least how to avoid infecection / wound care etc. Called the hospital ombudsman to ask why they didn't actually treat the wound and just sent me to yet another doctor. She said she'd register a complaint and hsve it looked into. Called my surgeon again, somehow got someone in IT by mistake. She passed a message to the nurse who of course did not call back. Called my patient navigator at Blue Shield, explained everything that happened. She called my surgeon's office as that's the only way I ever seem to hear back from them. Surgeon's office called back, talked about how great this on-call surgeon is bla bla bla, I said I have had enough of people looking at it, they need to TREAT this and quit the runaround, and I didn't survive breast cancer just to die from a stupid infection while they all sit around doing nothing. I have a DEXA scan in town today to see just how bad the Femara I started on last week is going to f up my bones, then my own MD right after. Massive hot flashes and yay carpal tunnel now, prob from the femara. Is it worth the remote chance of recurrence to be crippled by this shit? Planning more substance abuse today to avoid self harming.",

Echocardiogram happens tomorrow, followup with cardiologist is Wednesday followed by lymphatic mapping (assuming I'm cleared for surgery). Double mastectomy happens Thursday. Or not, who the hell knows. Anyone else turn up with \"surprise\" heart disease before a mastectomy? Did they handle it any differently? I finally got hold of a human at my breast surgeon's office so they can request the results from the abdominal ultrasound I had a couple weeks ago for completely unrelated digestive issues that apparently shows some kind of lesion on my liver. Considering I have one of the \"best\" cancers (1 cm invasive mucinous carcinoma which supposedly \"almost never\" metastasizes) and nothing unusual about my lymph nodes at the last breast ultrasound, I don't have any idea what to expect. Well I do, but maybe the news will be good for a change. Not that I ever expected a routine mammogram to detect cancer, or a routine pre-op EKG to detect a previous heart attack. \"Just keep a positive attitude,\" they said. \"Eat healthy food and get lots of exercise,\" they said. \"Get your routine screenings,\" they said. FML. Also, all the \"friends\" telling me about miracle herbs that cure cancer can foad, seriously. I'll gladly trade places with them. They can \"cure\" themselves with woo if they want but leave me out of it. I'd rather trust people with actual medical degrees and not fancy certificates from watching videos on the internet.",

I have hard swollen lumps under my arms, with deep grooves from the elastic binder. Gental massage doesn't seem to help so I'm just leaving them alone. I'm afraid to use cold or heat for pain relief on skin I can't feel, so I'm probably suffering more than I need to. First actual shower today after getting by with sponge baths (yeah, I know. It's a long walk to the shower house because the one in the RV isn't much use for anything but storage, and I can't yet drive the golf cart). I'm hoping the moisture will help loosen the steri strips because they are tight and hard. Follow up with BS is Monday. The cancer side drain has dwindled to about 15cc per day, still getting 25 to 30 from the non cancer side. Hopefully she'll remove both of them and give me an idea what to do with the hard swellings under my arms and on my chest. The dark red bruising has mostly faded. I have some persistent orange-peel skin on the remains of both breasts which is sort of concerning at least to me. The skin on the most bruised part on the right side (cancer) isn't in good shape. I'm still hoping it's a reaction to the tegaderm.",
