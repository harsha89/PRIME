I'm so glad that the chemo is over! At the moment I'm just try to enjoy myself. It's so nice to have a break from all the hospital visits!  I'm try not to think about the Rad yet, but I do go and check in March 11 Rad post every now and then.  (((((((((Sammolisa))))))))))",

The 2nd week was not too bad at all. I manage to do some yoga, free weight and riding without any pain. Running and swimming will be the next one on my list. Also I had to buy some new bras to go with the port.  ",

Yesterday was my lowest point of this BC journey (so far). I HATE the drain. It's sore, uncomfortable just evil!!!  I'm counting down on the day when it will be gone from my body. My doctor want the drain output over a 24 hours period to be 15ml or less over 2 consecutive days before drain can be removed. I get a bit upset because it had been 10 days and still 40ml. But after I had read all of your posts and some of you had 2 or more drain to deal with. Wow! I'm stop complaining, you all are a trouper!!!! ",
