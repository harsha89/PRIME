No offense but I don't want to share s very personal procedure with anyone and the last thing I want is strangers watching poison flowing into my blood stream. I have someone drive me only because the odds of me actually pulling into the facility are slim to none if I drove my self, I have a panic attack when I turn on to the road leading to the center. So my friend gets me there, makes sure I am started and sleeping then leaves for a while then comes back.",

Unfortunately the nurse screwed up and the port flush went under my skin vs in the vein. Talk about pain... oh my 3 days of being super uncomfortable and the edema is only 80% dissipated a week later. Between group chemo and either unprofessional or incompetence by nurses I am going to need to change cancer centers. On the bright side, day 8 and no diarrhea where day 7 of my first treatment caused me to be in bed or on the toilet for 4bdays. Could it be the Probiotics i am taking? My fear is I didn't get the right treatment , how else can I feel ok?",

Not that easy when I have to prepare all kinds of things since I am on my own. There is a great deal of mental prep that has to happen too. Oh and to top it all off, my 23 year old son found a lump in his r breast. It feels round to me so hopefully a cyst. He goes to the Doctor monday.",

After that downstairs to chemo for 4 hours, third T/C treatment. I was/am considering changing the cancer center thinking my next treatment was the 19th not today. My consult with the new MO was scheduled for today. I'm staying put for this treatment because I don't want to go off schedule. With my luck changing centers would cause a delay in treatment because of insurance. Enjoy your weekend everyone.",

I wish they would let us respond to posts underneath the original vs having a reply end up at the bottom of the thread. I found the Facebook pages much easier. Flat and fabulous breast cancer is my favorite. Chemo has taken its toll on me physically and mentally. I thought I would go flat with a BMX but now I am considering doing nothing. My thought us if it took 11 years for this cancer to grow and my first go round also took 10 years, what am I buying my doing it? A mutilated body? There is still no guarantee they get all the cancer and I've already been radiated. So maybe Ill sit this one out and wait to see. Being alone, 57 and broke I think the quality of life is more important then longevity. I had to send my dog, my life, to my daughters because the neuropathy in my hands and feet make it difficult to walk him He has so many issues he won't even let my son walk him or if my son takes him to the park, catching him to leave. My daughter has a dog which helps her deal with hus issues. The journey should be over fir most of us 5/2017 girls. I wish you luck.",

Besides the port issue I've had no side effects to speak of really. I actually had my Oncologists PA to check notes to make sure I got a treatment. She said side effects dont happen on TC until treatment 5 or 6. ???????? I am seriously considering changing Chemo centers as I have no confidence in the quality of the staff.",
