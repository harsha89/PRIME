They also inserted blue dye into my breast. They kinda sprung that on me. Did you get blue dye too? Im so confused thinking back on it. I thought blue dye was for lymph node biopsy. Can anyone clarify why they would've injected blue dye before an ADH excision? When nodes, (sentinel or lymphatic) weren't even on the discussion table? Getting nervous for results this Friday.",

Though I don't think it matters for me because it came back negative for my mom who is a breast cancer survivor. It will probably come back negative for me too. I guess there are still many genes they don't have a test for yet. Tinkerbell, so when they did your excision, they didn't see any ADH? They got it all on the Stereostatic Biopsy? Wow, that is wonderful. I would love to know how you manage the stress of the Mammo every 6 months... do they give you Ultrasounds or MRI's in addition? Are you on Tamoxifen? Your appt. is the same day as mine ( I get my results). I will be thinking of you. Take care everyone, ..",

Perhaps some folks move over to the \"wait every 6 months\" club too. Also, I see that you were diagnosed quite a number of years ago. That gives me hope. Thank you for the advice on bringing the sports bra. Hope you are doing well.",

Looking for words of wisdom regarding the surgery. Also, something I noticed on all of (or most) of the posts in the ADH forums is everyone's signature page. They say DCIS, or IC or lymph node removal etc. etc. As if all of the ADH patients eventually end up with pre-cancer or cancer. Feeling super down today. I'm new to the forum and am impressed by everyone's courageous stories. Hopeful",

I too was first dx with microcalcifications... Had the stereostatic biopsy and then they found the ADH. Here is a great website about everything we are going through: http://breast-cancer.ca/microcalcs/ It's my understanding that one can still have cancer lurking when there is no lump, with just microcalcifications and ADH. I will find out soon. Surgery is 9/16. Post Op appt is 9/23. Hope you are well.",
