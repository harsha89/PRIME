      "Content": "dhmeiser wrote: Abigail Alliance responds to New York Times editorial on FDA's Avastin Decision Abigail Alliance responds to New York Times editorial on FDA's Avastin Decision By Ron Piana | July 26, 2010 This is decision time at FDA. Since the agency gave accelerated approval for Avastin in first-line treatment of metastatic breast, two follow-up studies \"failed to confirm the magnitude\" of the benefits seen in that first study of Avastin. Consequently ODAC voted 12 to 1 vote urging FDA to reverse its approval of Avastin in this indication. In an editorial, the New York Times weighs in, urgingFDA to have the courage to reverse its initial approval. Here's the lead: \"The flameout of an enormously expensive drug to treat advanced breast cancer will pose a critical test for the Food and Drug Administration. Will the agency have the courage to reverse course when a medical treatment that it approved based on preliminary evidence flops badly in follow-up studies?\" The opinion piece takes the obvious reductionist observation: Our healthcare system cannot afford expensive drugs that do not confer a proper survival-to-cost ratio. Abigail Alliance co-founder Steve Walker responds: This (NYTs) editorial reflects a typical lack of understanding of why the FDA granted accelerated approval for Avastin as a first-line treatment for breast cancer in the first place. Because there are now multiple approved treatments for metastatic breast cancer, with most women going on to treatment with several of them after their first line treatment stops working, it has become impossible to measure a first line drug's effect on overall survival (how long a patient lives) after beginning treatment. The first trial of Avastin in this setting (on which its accelerated approval was based) indicated a significant advantage in delaying progression of the disease. The problem is obvious. Given the uneven response of patients to various drugs, and the FDA's crude clinical trial standards designed only to measure and compare the average response of populations (as opposed to how individual patients benefit or don't benefit from a drug), the FDA made the right call with Avastin (by approving it) the first time around. Think about it. A patient is treated with Avastin and may, or may not, benefit individually in terms of delayed progression or extended life, because the trials are not designed to try to learn whether the individual patient benefited. The FDA's statistical trials, by design (a problem that cannot be fixed - it is an inherent limitation of statistics-based trials) cannot measure individual benefit. It can only measure the time to progression and the time to death of an individual, which is then dumped into a pool of those measurements from hundreds of patients in each trial arm, and used to calculate an average time to progression and an average time to death for the two populations (those who got Avastin and those who didn't). They then compare the average outcomes (actually the average patient in one arm to the average patient in the other arm). Seem simplistic? It is. Each patient then goes on to be treated with multiple other drugs (but each patient's experience is unique - different drugs in different orders, with very variable outcomes, and mostly outside clinical trials where measurements relevant to the initial trial with Avastin may or may not be accurately measured recorded), then at some point, they die. The patient lives, say, 18 months after being treated with four different drugs. Why did she live that long? Which drugs worked to extend her life, which ones didn't? The FDA's statisticians have no idea because the trials they mandate are designed far too simplistically to measure it, and it is the FDA that makes and enforces the expectations for trial designs, despite their frequent assertions to the contrary. The media's consistently incorrect take on this, including in this editorial, is not surprising only because the media almost always fails to properly explain what happened. The most recent trials of this drug actually confirmed that there is a progression-free survival advantage, just not as much of an advantage as the first trial indicated, which means the drug is having a positive effect - on average, and it is still impossible to statistically measure overall survival for a first-line breast cancer drug. If they ran another trial, the result would show yet another progression-free survival result. The real problem here is not that Avastin doesn't work - it is that FDA has long refused (actually for about 50 years) to update its clinical trial and regulatory science. Randomized controlled trials and the simplistic statistics that drive them, invented in the 1950's at the FDA and written into law by Congress in 1962, aren't working anymore. Just a small amount of progress in a still incurable form of breast cancer makes them unworkable. It is very difficult to make progress against a disease when FDA's regulation has become so obsolete, we can't even measure progress. With so much in the balance - more than half a million lives a year in the US alone - can't we do better? We actually can, but resistance to real change at FDA is so profound, even getting started is proving to be an epic struggle. They are not saints over there. They are government employees following very old rules and policies in very formulaic ways and failing on a grand scale. Maybe you should write an editorial about that My wonderful wife Kimberly L.

      "Content": "dhmeiser wrote: In my research I found this article,  I can't post the entire article but the abstract is here: International Guidelines for Management of Metastatic Breast Cancer: Can Metastatic Breast Cancer Be Cured?  A distinctive subset of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is oligometastatic disease, which is characterized by single or few detectable metastatic lesions. The existing treatment guidelines for patients with localized MBC include surgery, radiotherapy, and regional chemotherapy. The European School of Oncology-Metastatic Breast Cancer Task Force addressed the management of these patients in its first consensus recommendations published in 2007. The Task Force endorsed the possibility of a more aggressive and multidisciplinary approach for patients with oligometastatic disease, stressing also the need for clinical trials in this patient population. At the sixth European Breast Cancer Conference, held in Berlin in March 2008, the second public session on MBC guidelines addressed the controversial issue of whether MBC can be cured. In this commentary, we summarize the discussion and related recommendations regarding the available therapeutic options that are possibly associated with cure in these patients. In particular, data on local (surgery and radiotherapy) and chemotherapy options are discussed. Large retrospective series show an association between surgical removal of the primary tumor or of lung metastases and improved long-term outcome in patients with oligometastatic disease. In the absence of data from prospective randomized studies, removal of the primary tumor or isolated metastatic lesions may be an attractive therapeutic strategy in this subset of patients, offering rapid disease control and potential for survival benefit. Some improvement in outcome may also be achieved with optimization of systemic therapies, possibly in combination with optimal local treatment. Journal of the National CancerInstitute Advance Access originally published online on March 10, 2010 JNCI Journal of the National Cancer Institute 2010 102(7):456-463; this is more of an FYI,    but I would like comments if you feel that the medical community may be turning around on treating stage IV as possibly curative.

This means the FDA may disapprove the drug, by September 17, 2010; this means in most cases, insurance companies will not cover this medication. My wife Kimberly has stage IV metastatic breast cancer, and this drug has been a miracle with her treatment! Despite the recent clinical studies which show this medication does not extend life of people with metastatic breast cancer. But despite this information Avastin treatments have kept her alive! If the FDA disapproves this drug for metastatic breast cancer it will certainly mean a slow death sentence for my wife. I am imploring you to not disprove this drug for metastatic breast cancer. The FDA does disapprove this drug and is not covered by insurance the cost would be overwhelming and most likely mean the demise of my wife of 17 years.

Some other tidbits I feel I should share is Kimberly is donating her body to medical research in hope that it helps train doctors and scientists to treat and eradicate this horrible disease We will be planting a sugar maple tree in honor of Kimberly,  Hopefully at her university or somewhere it will give both shade in the summer and help feed the hungry with it's sap (it was kimberly's favorite tree)  God bless every one of you  ",
