I'm glad you get to see the doctor soon - I have to wait a week. Here's hoping you get good news tomorrow!!! ",

Called back for the magnified mammogram, abnormality described as microcalcifications and pleomorphic. It seems like the BIRAD classification is rather subjective, though. My original radiologist described it as BIRAD 3, then changed to 4B, then the hospital's radiologist changed it back to 3. Keep in mind that the BIRAD number is not a diagnosis, but a recommendation to get a biopsy. I go for my biopsy on the 21st and I'll keep my fingers crossed for you as well!",
