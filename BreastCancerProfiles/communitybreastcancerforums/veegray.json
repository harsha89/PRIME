I feel almost silly for being scared after reading all the stories and how it appears to be a \"not so bad\" procedure. However, I am scared. I have a great support system, wonderful friends that lift me up and spread their light and love whenever anyone needs it. I know with this team backing me up it'll all be ok. Just needed to vent for a minute, and tell somebody I'm scared.",

I know that as for me, I'm gonna go thru this kickin butt and takin names, and you'll do the same. I work with survivors on a daily basis, just different kind, they're survivors of domestic abuse and they have taught me so much over the yrs while I thought I was teaching them. So I figure if these women can go through hell and back and continue to fight to live, then surely I can do whatever is headed my way.. thanks again and I'm sending you light and love ..",
