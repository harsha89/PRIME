As for the rest - take a good care of your back, if possible see an occupational therapist to address posture and have exercises. That pretty much repeat my story, minus the family history. Past exams showed no issues. However I developed some tightness in sternum and around the rib cage, particularly on the right side, and also from time to time I have a radiating pain in my right shoulder, back and front, which is particularly bad in the evening. Then about month ago I felt a small lump in my right breast during self-examination. I was about to leave on holidays so you can imagine what sort of holidays I had. Haven't slept straight though a singe night. Did't even google. Made an appointment upon return. Pain around sternum remained. Not constant but i felt it a few times a day, and we all saw on booklets for bc pictures of women holding a hand above the breast. Then Thursday morning i started feeling pins and needles all over my body, pain around armpits and upper arms, shooting pain from neck down the spine. Spent all night googling, which didn't help. I called sick and went to hospital first thing in the morning, also demanded my Gyn to move appointment forward from next Monday and an MRI on top. Spent most of the day at medical facilities.Turned out a trapped nerve and a very small cyst and my dr. now thinks I am crazy. I also learned a new word - costochondritis. This is what was causing pain around sternum. I took painkillers and anti-inflammatories and slept like a baby. I also put away all pillows and slept on an orthopaedic one that I bought on the way home. Made a world of difference. Good luck with your exam and do something about your back, it can seriously suck the joy out of life even in the absence of the disease like cancer.",
