      "Content": "TwinsRock13 wrote: I am 36 years old and went in for my first mammo Aug.7th, my doctor thought I should get one because breast cancer runs in my family, and my aunt currently has breast cancer.  My 1/2 hour appt. turned into 2 hours.  The radiologist found microcalcification in both breast and the both have clusters. He did additional magnification films and an ultra sound.  My doctor sent me to a breast specialist and I am having a biopsy Aug 28th.  I know I have an 80% chance of it being b-9, but the clusters are what scare me.  (And my docotor)  If my biopsy comes back b-9, do I still have a higher chance of getting cancer because of the clusters?  I'm just scared and think about my 4 year old twin girls.  Are their chances higher for the same thing when they get older?  Or, because I nursed them, their chances are slightly less?  Any advice is good.
