(LOL).  It was even a different subtype of Triple Neg BC.   Also it wasn't noted in my Breast MRI in 2009, but was there in 2011 (not having one in 2010 is another issue - insurance).  I'm nervous about the bone pain from Neulasta.  In 2000, I had daily Neupogen shots beginning with my second round of A/C sometime during each 3 week cycle (I had 4 cycles of A/C).  I do remember low back pain, but it wasn't too bad.  I wonder if the SE from Neulasta is because it's long acting?  I may ask if I can have Neupogen instead of Neulasta.  Best to all of you.  Glad to be here.",

So if I develop more neuropathy in my feet, I've already experienced it and still have it in my left foot.  So far, no increase after my 1st round of T/C.  I did have terrible, SE - constipation on day 4 - 5 since day 0, finally resolving to diarrhea on day 6 (Day 5 I called my onc and was told to take a half bottle of magnesium citrate and to take the rest if I didn't have \"results\" - which I didn't).  Magnesium Citrate is one of the choices as a coloscopy prep (LOL!).  Today is day 8 and I feel much, much better.  Day 5 was a lost day - I slept the whole day.  This afternoon before dinner I sat in a beach chair in front of the Atlantic Ocean reading your and other's posts and reading a detective book on my Kindle (which my DD gave me last Xmas; DS gave me a lighted cover for it.)  Perfect late afternoon.  DD and DH are coming soon to be here with my truly wonderful MIL and FIL and me.

I posted some stuff on Calling all TNG's (triple negatives), too so if you'd like to check there, read on. My chemo nurse told me that there are normally fewer pbs with neuropathy with Taxotere and so far, I haven't.  Also my hair started coming out Wednesday afternoon and I'm now wearing a scarf because the wig is as we know too itchy.  I'm going to look into a wig liner to put on under the wig.  I hope that helps.  I may just end up wearing scarves most of the time. Lot's of women wear scarves.  Thank you all for your kind support. My oncologist says I'm doing well and that I should add exercise to what I am doing.  I'll try.  I'm eating a very large bowl of All-Bran every morning in hope to avoid the big C this time!   Best to you all and no SE's!",

One of the really hard things about \"before\" treatment is the waiting for each step. When my oncologist decided what my treatment was going to be, then things started moving a lot faster. I am grateful to a few unnamed patients in my Onc's practice who changed around their treatment day or time so that I could start my chemo on 8/26.

I am so impressed with those of you who are working. I don't have the energy for it.

I have been consulting a psychiatrist and feel so much better that my antidepressant dose is now high enough to make me feel better. I also have been listening to the book, The Secret, in my car on CD's. My suggestion is to not hesitate to let your docs know if you are depressed. We are finding our way through challenging times AND taking chemo that can by itself cause depression. It is just a symptom to be treated. Best to all of you, Lee",

That will also give me time to order a night cap from the American Cancer Society. Thanks!",

So I called the oncologist on call.   He told me that Aleve can reduce platelets, but since I had gone in the previous day for bloodwork and my platelets were normal, I could take the double strength aleve, which did help help the aching.   He also said that I should stop the Aleve 4 days before my next treatment.   I'm really glad that I asked to go in for labwork on day 15 because I was really tired on day 14.  My labwork was fine - I think it just was that I did to too much on day 13 that made me tired - I hope that I won't need Neulasta.  Best to all of you and no SE's!",
