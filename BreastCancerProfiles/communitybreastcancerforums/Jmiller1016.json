Of course my whole family thinks I'm being ridiculous for being upset. I am 37 and went in to get check because of severe breast pain and bright red bloody discharge. After having a mammogram and ultrasound they found a suspicious mass. So they ordered a biopsy for it. The biopsy came back that it was a fibroadenoma. I asked them if they were sure because with everything I read I figured it was a papilloma. She said they were positive. I then asked if a fibroadenoma would also cause the pain and bloody discharge. She said no. She said that it was highly unlucky that a fibroadenoma would cause either of those things. I asked what was next then and she said that's all they can do there and they were sorry that they didn't have more answers for me, but to get in touch with my gynecologist. Well my gynecologist sent me there because they didn't have any answers for me, and had ran all the tests they could. So now I don't know what to do. I happy that the mass was benign but it CAN'T be normal to have pain and bloody discharge from one breast. Log in to post a reply",
