With my sister Hala, my mom Sami, my brother Adel and countless friends behind me (couldn't have done it without them!), I underwent a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery in March 2007.  And a funny thing happened as my body started to heal - my mind did as well.  The world just suddenly snapped into focus.  Everything that was important became totally clear, and so did the negative parts of my life that I needed to let go of if I wanted to follow my new mantra - go forward...Forward. Forward. Forward. Staring down the scariest thing that could have happened to me gave me the strength to take on new challenges I didn't have the courage to tackle past.  When I got back to work, one of the first things I did was walk into my bosses' offices - NBC News president Steve Capus and NBC Universal president and CEO Jeff Zucker - to tell them I wanted to be  TODAY's fourth-hour co-host.  Before cancer, I don't think I had the confidence to fight for the position, but  now here I am now, living my dream job with Kathie Lee every morning.  It's funny when I think how I owe my job, in part, to cancer. Click for related content One of the opportunities I've had in my new role on TODAY is the ability to share my journey with the audience.  As a journalist, taking my personal life public was a tough thing to do, but the response I've gotten has made me so glad I found the courage to open up.  More often than you would think, people come up to me on the streets of New York and, without a word, just give me a hug.  Nine times out of 10, that person has had breast cancer or knows someone who has.  My position also let's me bring awareness to this horrible disease, and attention on the desperate need for a cure.  It blows my mind that in 2008 our answer to breast cancer is still lobbing off body parts and essentially setting off a bomb on a person's insides.  It's my hope we'll find a cure in my lifetime, and bringing you stories like Dr. Susan Love's Army of Women, as well as the stories we'll highlight throughout the month of October, is a step in the right direction. It would be wrong to paint everything about breast cancer in a positive light.  There are times wearing or new dress or at the beach in a bathing suit and I look down and I think, \"That's not me.  I'm not whole.\"  Rationally I know that I am not my body, but I still struggle with those physical insecurities.  And perhaps that hardest part of this process is knowing that cancer has robbed me of the chance to be a biological mother.  The medication I take every day to kill the stray cancer cell that may be swimming in my blood stream essentially shuts down my reproductive system.  That is really tough. Still, the most surprising side effects of cancer is that it has given me more courage than I ever thought possible.   My life after cancer is more courageous and more honest and fuller than my life before. So to the woman with cancer who is in her bed right now and feeling so sick she doesn't want to even think about getting out of bed, I know how you're feeling.   And take it from me, I know going forward it's going to bet getter.  God gave me a second chance, and yours is about to start.  Welcome to the sisterhood of breast cancer survivors.  There's not a stronger, prouder or more determined group of women out there",

I think I went to work the following day.  It was a bit sore, but not bad.  Regular bra...but I guess that would depend where in the breast the biopsy is being done with regards to how comfortable a bra would feel. Mine was firly centralized, not close to a bra line.  They put you under, so you will most likely get fasting guidelines for after midnight the night before...but you will get that info. And they do want someone to assist you home. I walked home with my husband...I think I did some window shopping, too! (I live in NYC!) An \"exchange\" surgery is part of the reconstruction process. I had a BMX (bilateral mastectomy) in April. During that same surgery they implanted \"temporary\"implants called \"tissue expanders\" (TE) which does exactly as it says.....slowly expands the remaining tissue to accept the permanent implants several months later.  The TE's are a pain....they are slowly filled week after week by a plastic surgeon (PS) until they get to a reasonable size for your body frame. Then after several weeks of settling, you go back in to remove the temporary and put in the permanent implants.  Everyone says that surgery is a real relief from what you experience with the TE's, which, did I mention, are a real pain...and are a much better shape. So I am actually looking forward to this next surgery!  :)  They scheduled the OR for 3 hours first thing Monday 7:30 AM, but I think that is more than enough time for what he is going to do. I will be home Monday afternoon. I hope you never need to go down this route, but if you do, there is plenty of info on these boards that offer alot of good info and support! I will be sure to drop in after the surgery...probably Tuesday to let you know.  Mommysta, good luck with your consultation. Come back here if you have any questions or thoughts afterwards!  And write them down Ladies...have a fabulous weekend!

Regarding your MRI report, they should give that to you when you pick it up the images.  They cannot legally withhold your records...they are yours after all!  I can't imagine that some one has not read your MRI yet, but sometimes transcribing them is the hold up.  I can't really speak to how long after you will hear results on the biopsy.  That is pretty specific to the facility. How long I think women should wait is a whole other story!;) If I can recall mine from 2004 I think I had my excision on a Tuesday morning and did not hear until Friday. I do remember being annoyed because I felt they should have called me as soon as they had them, which was not the case.  When I had not heard by Friday, I called and got them then. The only questions I think I would ask is what you are asking here...how long before I get the results and why isn't the other breast being worked up?  I will say that calcifications in of themselves is not necessarily an abnormality. It depends upon how they look, i.e. how the cluster is formed, whether or not they are layered (remember your first report?) and some other considerations that are difficult to interpret!  Perhaps they feel the ones on the right don't look abnormal....but I would ask anyway! I will say that a sister of mine developed a very good relationship with her BS over time...she had several lumpectomies. At one point on the way going into the OR she told him she felt that there was something going on in the other breast, and pointed out where.  He went ahead and biopsied that one at the same time as he had her under for the other.  Good thing, as she had cancer on both sides.  That is not to worry you at all.  Her situation was totally different.....but in the end you need to trust that you know your body and yet are not worrying about something that is not worth worrying about, and as importantly, you need to trust your BS and be able to communicate with him/her...effectively and openly. You need to trust their decisions.  If not find another. I hope that helps... I continue to mend...3 nights in a row of milk of magnesia...so I was up all last night! Wearing this surgical bra 24/7 is a real pain, but I don't want to mess with the results, so I will do what I am supposed to do. I have another visit this Thursday with my PS. I will wait a couple of months and decide how I want to deal with nipple reconstruction. I have time for that. One final thing...I promise not to nag....smoking does not help the vascular healing process, or scars for that matter.  My husband smoked for years...tried quitting several times. Finally his doc put him on Wellbutrin and that finally did the trick. It is said to be the worst habit to kick...and probably not something that you need to think about right now...but you need to get at it. It is nuts to deal with the possibility of breast cance which we can't help, yet at the same time creating such a high risk for lung cancer.  We need to try and control what we can....OK, ok....enough said! I promised I would not nag! God Bless!",

What will get you there? A reasonable appeal? Another schedule/plan? Asking the other teacher what would work for them in light of your circumstances? I would just caution against venting for the sake of venting since you are both still working there. See if there is still a way to get what you want....any other \"win, win\" situation that might not be seen at first blush.

Both had negative mammo's; neg U/S and neg MRI's but decided to go ahead anyway.  Both ended up having BC after all.  I was one of the few that \"dodged the bullet\" yet 2 months ago I was dx with both ductal and lobular carcinoma....go figure. I chose a BM because I am a bit done with cancer if you can appreciate what the last 3 years have been like around my family, and as it turned out I truly feel like I made the right decision based upon my pathology report ...although I hate my TE's!!  Patience is the virtue that I still in need of developing, I know this too shall pass. There is a wonderful website called HDGC@yahoo.com for support around this issue.  Although rare, the more we learn the more testing is being done, and more people are being found to have this genetic issue.  We are at the tip of the iceberg when it comes to genetic mutations....and right now although Total Gastrectomies and prophylactic BM seem draconian....it is the best we have to save our lives, extend time with family and loved ones and fight for more research and a cure. There is info out there, try to get informed as much as possible...good luck to you and God Bless!  Angel10",

Waiting is the worst part of this....and no consolation I am sure, but if it were cancer 2 days more would probably not make any difference. Now an infection is something you want to treat quickly and hopefully that will be what you are dealing with.

But from what I have read from this site, that varies from practice to practice, so no standards or norms. I would EXPECT that within the week they should let you know the results....hopefully sooner. It is an anxious time. I had a surgical breast biopsy 5 years ago and was not concerned about that one AT ALL.  This time, I was not so sure but was determined not to worry too much until I knew...The way I figured it, if it was cancer I would have plenty of time to worry...if not, I was wasting time and was worrying my family for no reason, so I  tried not to obsess. It is a difficult time...hang in there. My dx was this past February. I had a bilat mx in April and have TE's which will hopefully be exchanged in 2 weeks.  It has been a roller coaster ride, but I focus on the fact that I no longer have breast cancer. Take a deep breath....one day and one test at a time. You have a tremendous support network here at this site, and hopefully with your family and friends. Keep us posted. God Bless, Angel",

I just want to advise you that should your daughter need to have a biopsy, please get a second opinion first....and make sure it is a breast surgeon that does it. If there is one thing for sure in my humble opinion is that breast cancer diagnosis, treatment and procedures, is always better done in the hands of those doctors that deal with this all the time, not just as a part of their practice. You will find tremendous information and support on this website, so you have come to the right place, but please, and I know that this is practically impossible to do, but please don't get crazy about this.  You really don't know what is going on, and 80% of what is looked out with breasts turn out to be harmless, benign or as we like to say here B9!  If there is something to be concerned about, you will have plenty of time to be concerned.  If there is nothing, then you will have wasted precious emotions and well being by worrying about  something that was not worth worrying about.  Either way, try to be the strong support your daughter will look up to either way. Give her a hug, tell her it is probably nothing but that you will get the best possible doctors to check it out, and in the mean time take it one step at a time. God bless you...and keep us posted.",

Elevated blood levels are found in less than 10% of patients with early disease and in about 70% of patients with advanced disease. Levels usually drop if treatment is working, but they may go up in the first few weeks after treatment is started. This rise is caused when dying cancer cells spill their contents into the bloodstream. The normal level is usually less than 30 U/mL (units/milliliter), depending on the lab. But levels as high as 100 U/mL can sometimes be seen in women who do not have cancer. Levels of this marker can also be higher in other cancers, like lung and ovarian, and in some non-cancerous conditions, like benign breast conditions and hepatitis. CA 27.29 CA 27.29 is another marker that can be used to follow patients with breast cancer during or after treatment. This test measures the same marker as the CA 15-3 test, but in a different way. Although it is a newer test than CA 15-3, it is not any better in detecting either early or advanced disease. It may be less likely to be positive in people without cancer. The normal level is usually less than 40 U/mL (units/milliliter), depending on the testing lab. This marker can also be elevated in other cancers and in some non-cancerous conditions, and it is not elevated in all patients with breast. The page can be found at http://www.cancer.org/docroot/PED/content/PED_2_3X_Tumor_Markers.asp?sitearea=PED Oncotype score is different, so you need to be sure of exactly what is being defined. I have heard that markers are not really useful individually, but should be taken under consideration with other info, test results.  Thay can be helpful, or misleading....  Good luck and God Bless!",

Freundgirl...where are you? Springfield MA? Where did you get your oncologist from? Are you confident in them? Springfield should have access to many fine docs. Don't mean to jump the gun here, but something just doesn't seem right. Anyone else care to comment on this issue? God Bless! Angel",

My PS told me most expansions should try to be completed in 8-10 weeks from mastectomy due to the fact that he believes that is when the skin is most opt to stretch easily. My TE placement was done at the same time as my bilat mx.  I waited 10 days for my first fill. When the TE's were placed they already had 50 cc's in them.  I did 3 fills of 150 cc's each, 1 per week for the next 3 weeks (my TE's are 600 CC large). To be honest, I thought I was going too fast! That last 150 cc fill was a doozy!  I ended up with a cellulitis infection, that I do not think was attributed to the fill rates, but nonetheless, I was hospitalized for 6 days and it slowed the whole process down. No complaints from me!   When I was released from the hospital I was put on long term antibiotics to be assured I was clear of any infection. Within 3 weeks I developed liver toxicity from the antibiotics and ended back in for another 6 day stay!  Before I was released I was at 500 cc's. I asked for a 50 cc fill in the hospital, was released and went back to the PS office 10 days later for a final 50 cc.  I am now at 600, my PS would have preferred 650 but I said \"uncle\"! I am done! Soooo...I started the last week of April and will have my exchange August 17th...with 2 unplanned hospitalizations.  No set procedures as you can see from the various responses. Hoep for the best, expect the unexpected and ask your PS what they think!  Let them walk you through what their process is...timing, fill rates etc.  I also think it is a good thing to show your PS that you are interested and knowledgeable about the process. I learned alot here....much more than I did from my own docs....so keep asking! Good Luck and God Bless! Angel",
