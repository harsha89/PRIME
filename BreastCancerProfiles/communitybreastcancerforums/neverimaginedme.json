I am 32 yrs old and I have no history of breast issues. About a month ago I began with some pain in my right breast(up high and wrapping around to the armpit area) it didn't go away so upon self exam I found what I thought was a lump. Well, to my surprise, on Monday my Obgyn felt it too, and referred me to a specialist, who on Wednesday also felt it. He ordered a mammogram and U/S that day with results STAT (alarming but nice) but they showed nothing (which as I am reading isn't SO unheard of, especially concidering I have my period right now, and am on the younger side and have somewhat dense breast tissue). SO, ok.  He was going to call me today to tell me to com back in 1 month (mid cycle) to re-evaluate the lump as he thinks it's a fibroicystic lump but wants to observe to be sure. BUT...This morning I had a discharge from both breasts. More from the sore one with the lump, but it was present in both. At first it was puss-like yellowy brownish. I called immediately. They had me come in for a breast pap smear to test the fluid. I was amazed at how much she got to come out. What came out at the doctors was more white/cloudy in color not puss-like...which is good I think. ? So needless to say, I am a little worried. Anyone have any similar experiences or helpful feedback? I have no idea what they even test for on a breast pap and what the results will or will not do for me. I am so stressed from all of this. Thanks for reading, I tried to kep it somewhat brief. I hate that the weekend is here and I have to wait the weekend for results. This is consuming my thoughts. I can't help but worry. My family is worried. You never expect things like this, you know? Log in to post a reply",
