Today was my 28th whole breast treatment and it's gone better than I anticipated. When I asked him if my fatigue was all in my mind, he answered, \"No\" and gave me what he said was the scientific term. Actually, neither my husband or I caught everything he said, but it seems that the term refers to the widespread side effect caused by treatment to one area of the body. Does anyone know what I'm talking about? I don't. I may have to call the nurse in the morning to see what the term was.

Research indicates that this is caused by lack of blood supply to the fat cells, such as what happens with surgery or radiation. These lumps can just be absorbed into the body. If they are too persistent, they can be surgically removed. Probably, this lump that I have will just go away. Maybe the radiation can shrink it as it would a tumor. It's located just above the nipple on the breast that had the tumor. I don't know if that has anything to do with it.",

I've not set up a signature, so I'll say that I was diagnosed on 7/26/13 with DCIS, ER+ PR+, HER2-, stage II, grade II. The surgery with lumpectomy and reduction was on 8/28 and went well. They a few days later, I developed an infection (not staph, thankfully) which has postponed the radiation. It looks as though I'll be able to start in about 3 weeks as the wound has finally begun to close. Here's my question: I've developed a necrosed fat lump in the cancer breast which continues to get bigger. Has anyone had experience with this? Will it have to be removed before radiation can be started? The PS didn't seem a big concerned about it and I haven't yet spoken with the radiologist. I'm not panicked, but the complications are getting a bit old.",
