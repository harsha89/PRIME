I've been so nervousÂ  and jittery for the past two days that I can't stand it. Instead of getting better, it seems to be getting worse. I haven't been sleeping well either. Not sure what to expect. Any ideas? Thanks, Lisa Dx 12/3/2010, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIIC, Grade 2, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
