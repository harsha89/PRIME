      "Content": "Aug 2, 2011 07:23AM - edited Aug 5, 2011 01:50PM by deep2deep So glad someone started this thread!  I am in week 5 of neoadjuvant chemo with Taxotere, Carboplatin, and Herceptin.  Hair is gone (finally shaved it 2 days after it started falling out - so glad it is summer!) and otherwise it is pretty tolerable.  I actually had a neg mammogram - wasn't due for a routine one until September.  But I had found the LN myself in my axilla, which was evaluated by ultrasound at the time of the mammogram.  That got the needle biopsy first and found poorly differentiated ductal BC.  That means aggressive.  The MRI (breast) and PEM (PET/CT of breast) found a 1.5cm tumor that was then biopsied and found the same thing. I had the PET/CT of my whole body to make sure there wasn't anything hiding anywhere and had MRI of my head for the same reason.  All that was done within 10 days and I got a port.  Started chemo 10 days after the first path results on my LN.  Pretty amazing. Hooray - It's only in my LN! So I was pretty happy to realize that the aggressive tumors respond the most to chemo.  I am having lots of breast pain - at the site of the tumor, but elsewhere also (and on the other side too...glad I am planning on double mastectomy, cause that makes me anxious). What I am wondering is whether that pain gets less as chemo goes along??  Also did anyone have pain in LN that were not known to be involved?  Also - for those who did chemo after surgery as well as neoadjuvant chemo, what was the reasoning?  ",
