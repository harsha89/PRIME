I had a lumpectomy in June 2010, HDR brachytherapy in july and then started tamoxafin. I am also doing Herceptin treatments weekly. The herceptin is part of a research study my onc got me into for stage one patients.  wondering if any of you are having trouble with the treatments. ",

I am just wondering about any side effects people might have had from it, if they did it without chemo.  O2bHealthy- I was very excited when I found my Dr at the CTCA. And very happy I was healthy enough to go into the trial. I do weekly treatments for a year, I am about halfway done. But recently I have not been feeling very well. Increased BP, increased HR, SOB, fluid retention and occational weakness and dizziness. I am going to see the cardilogist next wednesday. Hoping it is just the half way done blues ;) ,  maybe electrolite imbalance or hormones as I do not want to have to stop my treatments.  ",
