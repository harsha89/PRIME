    "Content": "daughterinlawLA wrote: My mother-in-law found a lump in early July. She had it checked out last week and her doctor told her he believes that it is cancer and malignant. Her mother had breast cancer as well. She is scheduled for her biopsy on the 30th of this month, and of course the waiting is very difficult. I'm wondering if it is usual for a doctor to tell a patient that he's pretty sure she has cancer and then schedule a biopsy two weeks later? Also, how can a doctor form such an opinion before the biopsy? Log in to post a reply",
