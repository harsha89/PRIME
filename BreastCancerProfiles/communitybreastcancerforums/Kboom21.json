I am 33 and history of one cyst 7 years ago that only had one ultrasound, never monitored more other than self exams. In the past two weeks, 6 other lumps and one possible mass were found by clinical exam. I go in for diagnostic mamo and u/s with biopsy Monday.  The feeling you describe about when your milk used to come in....I tried telling my MD that. Like I noticed a heaviness in that one breast particularly and almost sometimes like a crawly and occasional uncomfortable feeling. She did not look like she was getting what I was explaining, but the feeling of milk coming in is exactly it. Thank you for the words. I hope your results turn out well. Stay off Dr Google this week",

My skin is fine, it's the tissue underneath that just feels \"harder\" and heavier than usual. Thank you ladies for the insight. Will be thinking of you all as well! I get that twinge feeling, well, more likely a \"crawly\" feeling in my left breast just by my nipple. I will definitely heed every single one of the pieces of advice given here. I appreciate all the messages and insight, really do!",

History: Back in 2007 a small \"lump\" was found just next to my nipple, close to the surface. Ultrasound showed nothing, literally nothing. The tech couldn't even look at the screen and figure out where the area of the concern was (bad tech?). Anyways, since then, we have been watching the area. The lump remains the same, no growth or changes I can detect. However, over the past 8 weeks or so, I've been doing weekly self breast exams and have noticed that the area near the top of my breast toward the collarbone and into the arm pit feels \"lumpier\" and thicker. I've also noticed a little nipple discomfort now and then which sometimes feels like a \"tickle\" and/or \"itch.\" I feel like my breast feels a little heavier and just has a difference \"presence.\" This is very hard to describe! I don't get periods as I have the Nexplanon arm implant for the past year. I am going in today at 2:00 PM for a clinical breast exam. I'm going to push for a mammogram after reading that it could be anything from fibrocystic breast changes to in situ cancers, etc. Of course, part of me is worried, and another part trying not to set myself up quite yet. No family history of BC, just very dense fibrous breasts. Anyone with similar symptoms and what ended up being your path? Log in to post a reply",

Without telling doc where I found my suspicious area other than what breast, she found a few lumps in the armpit area of my right breast and a few larger ones in the left armpit (2), and 1 above my left nipple. She noticed the change in fibrous tissues as well. She wholeheartedly believes they are cysts, but to calm anxiety and fears we ordered a mammogram with a follow up ultrasound and biopsy as needed. I am currently sitting in the Clinic parking lot waiting for the order to be faxed over so I can call and make the appointment. I did ask about the breast MRI, but do to insurance purposes we have to go through the mammogram and ultrasound first. However she said if the discomfort and pain persist in the other results are negative it is something we can definitely consider",

There is one lump that did not change nor did the rubbery oblong 'lump' next to it. Those are still very much palpable and present and I'm still getting some pain/sensitivity in that area around the nipple. I do realize it quite possibly is a fibroadenoma from all the reading I've done here. I will post more when I know more.",

      "Content": "Dec 16, 2014 01:38PM - edited Dec 16, 2014 05:30PM by Kboom21 Well I don't have much to go off of yesterday. I went in for my 2:30 appointment. Was to have a diagnostic mammogram first. I got in the mammo room, put on my BB markers and the tech walked out saying she'd be right back. I waited 20 minutes......another lady called me and asked me to step out of the room and walk with her. I was confused to say the least, she brought me back to ultrasound. I asked her why we were doing the u/s first and not the mammo as ordered. She replied, \"the radiologist said you don't need a mammo and we don't typically do them on women under age 35 (I'm 33.5).\" I told her, \"the order is for a mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy if needed. She asked if she should talk again with the radiologist and I told her to go right ahead or I would be happy to call my physician who ordered the testing. I reminded her, the testing was ordered because more lumps and fibrocystic changes were found, not because I just 'wanted' a mammogram. Like I wanted to be there in the first place? I waited on the u/s table for another 5-7 minutes. Then the first tech came back and asked me to come with her back to the mammo room and said \"well, I guess it looks like we are doing this after all. I asked him if he was sure, and he said to get it done.\" So who was the one really second guessing WHY I should not have a mammo done? So diagnostic mammo is finished and I'm brought back to the u/s room again. Tech literally looked around two areas on my left breast (order was for both breasts), took 3 pictures and went to get radiologist. He comes in, fishes around for 2 minutes only on left breast and says all clear and that it is just really glandular tissue I probably feel. No one walked me out. They all left and I was left to clean up myself and escort myself back to the dressing room. I am furious. I feel like I was not taken seriously or treated like an actual patient. I'm 33, so apparently to them I didn't warrant kindness? I have a few people I know under the age of 35 that go to this same breast center and they have never been treated like that....maybe it was a case of the Mondays, I don't know. I asked for my BIRADS, the radiologist said I would get the report in the mail. I go in for my annual next month and I'll be talking to my physician about the experience and plan to possibly file a grievance with the hospital on the way I was treated and rushed when finally in doing the testing. Needless to say, I would like to have someone else look at my mammo and do an u/s just to be sure. I'm sure there is likely nothing since the radiologist believed the mammo was clear, but feeling rushed like that when in the testing and then totally disregarded because of my age makes me feel like maybe they took quick glances and not a thorough look, makes me have doubts. However, I am happy with the results of course, pending they ARE correct. I plan to just give it some additional time until I have my annual and wait and see if the pain/burning dissipates on its own before then. I will rejoice being on the good end of news at this time though.",

I'm 33 as well and going in for mamma and u/s with biopsy today for \"cysts.\" What I have researched about complex cysts is that they have either noticed a shadowing inside the cysts or debris, indicating there is some solid particles or matter inside. Usually with these, they like to biopsy that matter to ensure it is benign. I hope that helps answer your question? Vascularity inside the cyst means there is blood flow to the particles or matter. Not sure how this affects outcome of malignant versus benign, but as a nurse, my gut says they may be concerned the matter inside could be cancerous. Do you have family history or other risk factors? Lymph nodes can swell and reside on their own as they filter bacteria and viruses regardless of whether they could have cancer cells in them. Depending on outcome of your cyst biopsy will determine whether they will be concerned about the node.",

We (and insurance) pays for that healthcare, so the time with them should be leaving the patient with all questions answered that can be. I still have 3 days until my mammogram and ultrasound/biospy. I'll be waiting a little longer for those benign results (staying positive). I understand risk factors are low and I'm sick of hearing that. I'm young, 33. Only risk factor was having first live birth after age of 30 and only breast feeding for 8 weeks (story in itself). I know many without family history who have brca. Just waiting for that all-clear.

I was feeling around my main cyst, the one I've had for years now. I noticed this morning, that if I \"move\" it off to the side a little, I can feel a blob right up against it. Part of it feels nearly just has hard as the cyst, but the rest of it almost feels like rubber. My MD nor myself noticed that at the breast exam on Monday. The cyst and this blob are also right under/next to my left areola, about 6/7 o'clock position.....so very similar to you Frodo.",
