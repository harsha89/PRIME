Mother died of it in 1988 at the age of 51- mets to the liver after 5 years in remission. I am afraid I will die of it too. Like her I am in remission cancer free- but like her it may come back. My fathers side of the family - all the women had died from breast cancer mets. I don't have the cancer gene from genetic testing but they say I have the \"Familio\" aspect which is a \"grey\" area! I am HER2 pos and ER PR pos. But the surgeon and docs didn't mention having my ovaries removed. My case manager did though. Is it common to have your ovaries removed at the same time of breast mastectomy or later? If so I am not looking forward to another surgery at all.  I am doing everything natural right now to keep cancer away from me! What else can I do?",

But it grew about 1 inch..then it slowed down a bit. then it took about 6 months for me to get 2 inches. After that my hair started growing much faster. However mine grew back white and grey! yuk. so I dyed it. and it looks good now. see my pic. I am keeping it short on purpose. much easier for me to deal with. I got my eyebrows back 2 weeks after chemo. all of them. My eyelashes took longer then my head of hair..and still to this day are very short,about half the length they used to be.it's been since Dec 2009 when Chemo ended.",

Doctors said cause I am young and healthy. They got it all the docs said. Stage 3A- ER PR positive- HER2 posi. 3 nodes infected- 2 out of 3 batches of lymph nodes removed  just to be safe. Adriamycin was given to me in low dosages every week. Oral Cytoxan at home- I was on a study at USC LAC- Kenneth Norris and the City of Hope ! Adriamycin made my feet hurt and peel- like a bruise under my feet and shed skin on my feet- they gave me Zofran for any nausea- it worked great. take it early they say..don't wait till you're nauseated. I lost 12 lbs while on this chemo though- wasn't very hungry. My nails began to come off too..not all of them- just my thumbs and big toe nails. weird huh? my hair of course fell out the 3rd week after chemo in chunks until all gone! second round of chemo was Taxol- They said this one is easier then Adrio.-- but it wasn't Adrio was easier for me- taxol made me have bone aches. The solution was not what you would think. The doc gave me cemetidine- a pill about 300 mg. They said typically it is used for stomach problems- but the studies show it takes away bone and joint pain affiliated with Taxol! Please remember to ask your doctor for it right away if you have bone pain! You do not need to suffer these days. They have things to help you overcome most all pain! I am cancer free and plan on doing everything natural to keep it off of me! I pray yours will be swift and you will be free too.",

I was reading that radiation combined with chemo can have devastating and irreversible effects on your bone marrow. Is this true?In other words you will lose some of your bone marrow. Plus I heard that radiation can cause other cancers to grow. Is this true????? As for the skin. A nurse and other patients have told me to use BAG BALM. I got a can of it for only $5. I am very nervous about taking radiation! Help!",
