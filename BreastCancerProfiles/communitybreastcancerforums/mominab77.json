      "Content": "mominab77 wrote: Last September I had a lumpectomy to remove a complex fibroadenoma (3 o'clock, near chest wall). I recovered well, never had an issue until a couple of weeks ago when I started to feel achy and a fullness near my armpit that traveled across my breast (same one I had the surgery on). I was due for my period so didnt think anything of it. Period had come and gone and it still hasn't gone away but now it's a constant burning, tingling sensation that radiates from my armpit to my nipple that is not coming and going. Dr said it's probably nerve pain which it could be. I don't feel any lumps...but I also didnt for the fibroadenoma I had removed. So I'm just wondering if those who have had surgery...is this a normal thing? Like I said it came out of the blue and it's a different feeling then what I have had since surgery. Due for my mammogram so maybe my anxiety is getting the best of me... Log in to post a reply",
