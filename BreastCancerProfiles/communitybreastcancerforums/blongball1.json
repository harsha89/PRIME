I wasn\u2019t sure what questions to ask, and everything seemed to be happening so fast. I would encourage you to ask your doctors about the benefits vs. the risks, how long they expect the treatment to take, what it will entail, how often, etc. Will there be radiation? If they are thinking surgery, and if so, would it be a lumpectomy or a mastectomy, if a mastectomy, will you have reconstruction. If so, it\u2019s usually started at time of mastectomy. I know so many things determine other things, but try to arm yourself with as much information as you can. And what you can\u2019t get or if you forget to ask, heck, that\u2019s what we are for. :) I\u2019m right there with you, and will be here to see you through. Stay strong, stay positive, and remember...it\u2019s your body, so you get to decide what happens to it! Wish you well! Message me anytime. Bonni",
