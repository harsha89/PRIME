I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1996, had the full range of treatments (chemo, high-dose chemo, stem-cell transplant, radiation) and was in remission for 12 years. Now, this April, several scans and a liver biopsy confirmed that I have mets to the liver (one definite one, the other smaller one could be just a hemangioma). I have been researching RFA, but my onc and a local liver specialist did not recommend RFA (their main reservation is the metastatic nature of the disease. Also, the liver lesion is close to the diaphragm, so're they're concerned RAF could damage the diaphragm). I insisted on a PET scan and got it done 2 weeks ago. The results \"highlighted\" the liver mets and a possible site on my right hip bone, although the bone mets isn't 100 percent clear because the PET scan report compares it to a CT scan report from Feb., on which it says \"no lesions in the bone visible\". My doc said having RFA would be \"invasive\" and wouldn't change my overall survival time, because \"there could be other tiny cancer areas in your body which are not visible yet\". I'm still convinced that I should at least get a second opinion re: RFA for my condition. Any recommendations? Thanx Karin",

I had the initial breast cancer 12 years ago. At that time, I had extensive treatment -- mastectomy, standard chemo, high dose chemo with autologous stem cell transplant, and five weeks radiation. Now, I am trying a different approach. I started Arimidex, and am also doing naturopathic cancer treatment, and I am on the low-glycemic diet (because sugar fuels the cancer cells). I am waiting to have PET scan done to determine if there are other mets elsewhere. If not, I might be able to get RFA. Is anyone out there who had RFA done on liver mets?
