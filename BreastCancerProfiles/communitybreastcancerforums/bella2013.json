He said he would have to remove a large portion of skin in order to get the spots in question. I opted for BMX with DIEP Flap Reconstruction. I am six weeks post op. I do not regret my decision. The decision to have a BMX was easier for me to make because I had a simple mastectomy. Because we learned so much about the cancer when I had the lumpectomy, I did not have any more lymph nodes removed and I did not have my chest muscle removed which is done in a radical mastectomy. My Oncotype Score was 14 which took chemo and rads off the table. I am on day 3 of Anastrozole. If I had chosen BMX as the first step in my treatment plan I would have chemo and rads.",

Ten women could have IDC and each would have their own treatment plan different from one another. The size of the breast cancer tumor, the location of the tumor in the breast, the stage of the cancer, the grade of the tumor all go into deciding your surgery and treatment plan. It makes me want to scream that a female gynecologist would have such a cavalier attitude about where to go to get treatment. She should be your advocate and pave the way with a referral to MD Anderson or another breast cancer center. I just can\u2019t say enough about the team approach.

I am assuming that if you are having your breast MRI then you had the biopsy and have some info about your tumor. Just doing a search on other cancers that are hormone receptors brought up uterine and ovarian cancer. The breast MRI is the best diagnostic tool to see if there are additional tumors in your diseased breasts that might not have been detected yet. Sometimes tumors can hide. The breast MRI will also determine if there is anything suspicious in your other breast. The breast MRI is not a whole body MRI. It is specific to the breast. It gives your BS, MO, and RO the best information to determine your treatment plan...i.e., lumpectomy with chemo and rads or mastectomy. Take a deep breath...try not to focus on things that are unknown...you have a good team and they will guide you to the best possible treatment. You have many years ahead where you will battle the dark fears of a recurrence. Take this one day at a time. You will feel better when the tumor has been removed",

The pain will eventually subside. I didn't drive until I was five weeks post op. The DIEP Flap involves a major incision from hip bone to hip bone. It was the pain and tenderness from that incision that kept me from driving. You just had a huge surgery. Your breasts are going to settle down. I am eleven months post op and mine have softened. As your breast heal your PS will show you how to gently massage them (don't do that yet). I had my nipple tattoos done in November. It makes such a difference. I do know that fat tissue is heavier and more dense than breast tissue so if you were to have DD's they are going to be heavy. The underarm sensitivity will calm down. I call week three post op \u201chell week!\" You are so tired of hurting and you do want your body back! I promise you it will get better. If you can't wear a soft sports bra then maybe try a snug fitting tank top. If you can't get any relief from the nerve pain then consider asking your PS for Gabapenten. The Oxycodone and 800 mg Ibuprofen didn't touch the pain. I didn't know about Gabapenten until I was already healed. Sending you healing ((hugs)). You can do this! The worst is behind you!! P.S. Did you have the robotic surgery",

I had two lumps appear near my SNB. I was sure that they were scar tissue but I went back to my BS who also thought I didn\u2019t have anything to worry about but sent me to my breast center for an ultrasound. My sister was with me and told him I wanted a PET Scan. He asked why my MO would not order one. I explained her reasoning. He said he would order a PET Scan and use the two new lumps as the reason for the Scan. He said we may not get it but he would fight for me. I had the PET Scan in June. It came back NED. I fired my MO and I meet my new one this Monday. Since you are having a recurrence and it has metastasized...surely that is reason for a PET Scan. Maybe you could find a MO who is willing to treat you and not just toe the line with the gov\u2019t. It is so frustrating and I am so sorry that on top of having BC you have another monster (gov\u2019t) to fight. Sending you ((hugs))",

It\u2019s basically a partial mastectomy. Not only was the pre-op difficult but you were likely under anesthesia for at least two hours. That\u2019s a big deal. Also the emotional stress from diagnosis thru the lumpectomy takes a huge toll on you. Be good to yourself. If your body is experiencing fatigue just go with it and rest. You will get back to your normal energy level, but for now your body is telling you what it needs...lots of rest. Remember, your body has been battling cancer, it really is tired.

I too had pain when my drains were removed, but I believe that is when the healing really begins. Do not be shy about asking for meds. You just had your breast amputated! That is a huge surgery! I have Xanax, a very low dose. One 30 Day prescription would last me a whole year. I would only take it if I was experiencing a season of insomnia and then would only take a half pill. When I was diagnosed I started taking .5mg every night at bedtime. My anxiety levels were so high and when my head hit the pillow my mind was racing. The Xanax helped me get a good eight hours of uninterrupted sleep. I continued that dosage through to two months post op then have tapered off to half a pill .25g. The pain relievers didn\u2019t offer me any pain relief. The Xanax lowered the anxiety I had about the pain and let me drift off to sleep at night. If the pain relievers helped you by all means ask your surgeon for a prescription! Just because it wasn\u2019t offered to you doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t give it to you. Experiencing pain that is affecting your ability to sleep is impeding your healing process. Go to your surgeon, gynecologist, or PCP...you will get help. Blessings!",

You should not let any shower water hit your chest. You should turn your back to the shower head and let the water run over your shoulders and down your chest. I wore an oversized front opening sports bra (fruit of the loom from Walmart. My chest hurt down the my sternum also. When I drank cold or hot beverages I could feel it going down. It was so strange. Remember your chest had been through a lot of trauma. It will take several weeks to settle down. I can\u2019t speak to the nipple attachment issue but I do encourage you to address the care specifically of that nipple. Ask him if you can choose to wear your own sports bra. Maybe even take one with you. At day 9 post-op with drains is about normal. My post-op appointment was on day 12. I had all four of them removed then. I thought if I exercised or moved around more that would help my body release the fluid! NOT!!! The calmer you stay the more your body adjusts and sends the fluid where it needs to go. Ask away!!! Someone here will try to answer your questions. It sounds like you are doing well",

My husband retreated also and I couldn\u2019t understand why. When I asked him he said, \u201cyou said you just want to be left alone...you need peace and quiet and space.\u201d I did say that but not intended for him...I was telling him to explain why I didn\u2019t want to socialize...stand around and chat after church, have friends over, etc. So once that got cleared up then we got back on track connecting emotionally not physically...but I was in so much pain I didn\u2019t want to be touched except for a shoulder rub or a foot rub. I also asked my nurse navigator if there was a marriage counselor/therapist at the breast cancer center. There was and she said he was excellent. Sometimes I thought about us going together and other times I thought about going for myself. I also had my sister who walked this journey with me and was a great sounding board Men are made to conquer problems. They can\u2019t fix this cancer diagnosis and I think they feel helpless. and scared. He may be withdrawing without even realizing it or because he doesn\u2019t know what to do. We are in our 31st year of marriage and I can say that communication is so important. Even if he won\u2019t talk about it he can listen to you and how you are feeling. He can hear what you need from him. Cancer is a full out assault on our bodies and our lives. Everyone close to us will be affected in some way. Listening to my husband respond to family and friends who were asking about me revealed a lot about how he was dealing with my breast cancer, especially after my BMX with DIEP Flap reconstruction. He was very protective of me in that he explained what a huge surgery it was and never gave the impression that I was just breezing thru it. He was honest about the pain I was experiencing and/or the lack of strength and stamina. That told me \u201che got it\u201d. He got what I was going thru. This past week I received results from my full body PET SCAN. It came back negative, NED. No cancer anywhere in my body. That was such a relief. It is like a dark cloud that had been hovering over us was finally lifted. The future didn\u2019t seem so uncertain. Laughter and fun has come back into our marriage. Continue to vent here! We are here for you. Barbara ",

This recovery will be a walk in the park compared to my BMX with DIEP. Besides, I am taking advantage of my insurance covering this and especially this year since I have met my deductible!
