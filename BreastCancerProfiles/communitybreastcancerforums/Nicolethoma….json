I knew you were out there I just didn't want talk about it, I think they call that denial??? Someone asked why I have to wait 3 weeks for my cat scan, it's not scheduled until Jan 7th I get my results on the 14th if that clears it up. Thank you all for all of your words of encouragement, It is a great feeling to know I have somewhere to go when i feel like no one understands. God Bless you all and I will be back",

Thursday is the only day I have ever been, oh and I didn't mean I was doing my chemo closer to home I meant radiation, I take a xanax before bed and I noticed some of my posts look like they are written by a child, but it's either that or not sleep so you know how that goes i'm sure. My drive is only about an hour and a half and I would willingly make the hike forever after the experiences I have had here where I live. My 1st oncologist who gave me my test results after making it very clear to me he ONLY came in to deliver this news because it HAD to be done and he never worked on Fridays, actually blurted out I have stage IV IBC that had met's to my lungs. He then handed me a sheet of paper with all of the different stanges of breast cancer on it pointed to the very last one and it had my survival rate highlighted 20% after 5 years. He didn't expalin what inflamatory Breast cancer was, he just excused himself from the room and said he's meet us at check out. While I was changing back into my clothes he was changing too....into his golfing clothes! He told me I had to call and schedule my double masectomy and lymphnode disection, as well as get my port implanted and he wanted it done with in the week with chemo to follow as soon as posssible. He shook my hand and left the receptionist the follow up and repeat the instructions to my completly numb brain and obviously that was the last time I saw him. He had wanted me to have a follow up with U of M anyways so I went ahead and did the surgeries with my original surgeon who removed my lump and lesion in the 1st place and then followed up with U of M for the rest of my treatments. I am on team 5 tumor board maybe different teams meet up on different days? Anyways I really miss work as well. How did you feel during radiation? Were you as exausted as everyones says?  I can't imagine it's worse than weekly chemo and chasing around an extremly active 8 month old but what do I know. This last week my Wt blood cells took a nose dive from 5 to 2 so I'm feeling it pretty hard do they continue to go down with radiation? I just keep forgetting to ask my Dr. We talk for 20 minutes about everything and then I realisesd I asked her one out of the 20 questions I meant to ask. How many rounds of chemo have you had to have? How long have you had where you didn't have to have it, at stage IV are you ever in remission? Tell me if I am being too nosy. I have been in such denial that I  have been so silent about my questions i just push them out of my head, and I refuse to start googling because so many sights cannot be trusted but now I find myself getting more couragous. My Year is off to a great start I had 2 very joyful days and I hope yours is as well. God Bless you for being so forthcoming and answering so many questions, your an angel. Happy New Year! Nicole",

It just goes to show there is no ryme or reason to this disease. My grandmother on the other hand is 92, she cooks everything in bacon grease (she lives in the south) and has a whisky or 2 every night,and never even had a cold in the past 10 years I have given up trying to figure this stuff out! Good luck to you God Bless. Oh and PLEASE do not put much thought into statistics and percentenges! For every percentage I am given I have 10 miracle stories about women in our shoes living long and happy lives, there are too many factors in each individual situation to let random statistics that change from day to day get you down. My Dr. was an ass and the next Dr. I saw had all different things to say, I shouldn't even have put that in there! ",

Good nutrition is always important of course but be careful with supplements and also doing ANYTHING too radical to quickly. Talk to your onc when you have questions and women like Judi who really seem to know the right resourses. I have been given everything from mushroom capsuls to pureed asparegus by the pounds and had cod liver oil dipped wash clothes help over my  liver for hours at a time! I tolorated this from my mother because it made her feel  in control but I had to put a stop to it everntually, there is a lot of advice out there but you are ultimatly in control.
