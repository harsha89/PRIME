    "Content": "BLB wrote: Has anyone had at CT Scan where the doctor said, \"Well, in any other person I'd say you had a lung infection/pneumonia but because of your history we need to make sure it's not a breast cancer recurrence?\". I am terrified! I am almost 9 years out from my original diagnosis. I had an early stage bc and treated it aggressive. I have been having bad allergies all spring. We moved to a new city and within 3 days my eyes were swelling and a got a sinus infection. After 10 days on antibiotics my head felt better but my cough and chest still hurt. So, they did xray and Ct scan as my lungs were clear 2 weeks before. My doctors have scared me so badly! I feel better after prednisone and antibiotics (4days on) but am having panic attacks waiting to see a pulmonary doctor. Anyone else had this happen? Also, would I be feeling better and breathing so much better if it were cancer? Log in to post a reply",
