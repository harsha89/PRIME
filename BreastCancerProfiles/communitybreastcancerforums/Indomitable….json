I can't seem to find any research re: breaks in chemo so I'd like to hear from anyone with a similar experience to see how it was handled.",

I developed no blisters but the charred (black, tight) areas of skin just opened. My supraclavicular nodes were included in my regular tx sites and turning my neck on Friday apparently caused the initial split in the skin. Oh well. Two more boost or reductions to go. Thank God that area is still intact. And I forgot who asked but I've had the bolus used every other treatment. The cold gel pad reportedly increases the dose to the area of interest. My wonderful tech was kind enuff to allow me in the dressing area 1 patient prior to my actual tx so I could sit on the bolus while waiting for my turn up at bat. It worked wonders! Of course, I had to ask but he obliged. BTW, I noticed you're triple neg. too. Perhaps that's why we're getting it. Will pick up the silvadene script after tx today--if I last that long. Thank God I'm off today. And to someone else (still using chemobrain as my excuse for forgetting who posted what)- I love Flylady!!!!!!-especially when I follow my routines -even though I often skip the 15 min declutter. Sorry about the arimidex issue-can't help. I'm triple negative. u'll probably think i'm just paranoid but i sure do wish there was something else i could take. Will pick up the Foods that fight Cancer book as I have already read the AntiCancer book. Rad Onc said I could resume taking my antioxidants the day after tx. Congrats to those who've finished before, Hang in there to those still undergoing tx. And thanks to all!",

Don't really think that it's the rads as I've only completed one week. I, too, have a new discomfort in the underarm area but think it is related to the positioning. I don't have the \"custom mold\" so it takes about 10 mins to \"get things lined up.\" More uncomfortable than the underarm is the backache (between the scapulae) I develop while lying on the table. I've been taking an occasional tylenol vs. ibuprofen. I would have liked to have completed rads before  the New Year, too but had delay after delay. At least I've finally started. Good luck Pill in whatever you decide. Will try to get the Remedy. Thanks for the info.",

Never really particuarly proud of them but they did have their positives....I can live without them but the thought of my husband seeing the still healing incisional scars and drains just threw me for a loop today. I'd been handling this fairly well. Sorta felt like a set back today (increased pain(back), increased drainage, And no boobs)--but then I realized that it's the realization that this is just the beginning that has me thrown.
