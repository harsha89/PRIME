For that I go to another facility that is affiliated with Froedert but closer to home.  However, if Froedert had been closer to home I would have gone there for Rads and still had the same RO.

Needless to say I have requested that he not be part of my team.   Also, if your RO says to use lotion, find out exactly where you need to apply it.  I didn't realize that I needed to lotion the armpit and around to my back.  I found this out when I started turning pink and it got a little irritated. Once I lubed this area it calmed down. You will meet with your RO once a week so he/she can monitor the condition of your breast. Because everyone reacts differently I'm sure you'll have your own personal questions to ask during these weekly meetings. Good Luck!",

I am having my rads at a different facility than where I had my lumpectomy and chemo because it is closer to home. So far, everyone is pleasant. However, when I had my dry run yesterday and I was lying on the table while RO was making adjustments, I heard a man's voice! My RO started talking to him, called him by name and I realized he was the tech who scheduled my treatments. Without so much as a 'how do you do'  he started making marks and templates on my breast and all of the sudden there was another person who I didn't know leaning over me making marks. I was in shock!! When I finally found my voice, I asked them to explain to me what was going on. He did, but never introduced himself or the other tech. After it was all over he asked me if I had any questions or concerns. I told him I was upset that people came into the room that I expect or know.  He apologized and said I would meet the team today when I have my first treatment. We talked a bit more and I calmed down.  Today I am going to tell my RO how upset I was and that everyone involved should have been introduced to me before I was lying exposed on the table!",

It went away about 3 weeks after chemo but I started rads last week and am wondering if it will return. It is definitely not a hot flash but those are plentiful as well!  I don't know who it drives crazier, myself or my husband because we both wake up when I have to throw the covers off Today is day 5 of 30 and so far my rad (left) breast is a little achy. I'm not sure if it is the rads or the new non-under wire bra that I had to buy. The bra comes off as soon as I get home from work. I have a 1/2 hour drive to rads each day and once again it is cold (6 degrees) and snowing. I was told if the weather gets really bad to give them a call and cancel.  I still have to have 30 treatments but it will take a little longer if days are missed. Thanks to everyone who has posted about creams and SE. So far the Medline Remedy cream is working and it smells good, too! I have some Aquafor on standby for when things really heat up. Even though it is only day 5 I think fatigue is already setting in. The last 2 nights I fell asleep on the couch at 8pm!",

GubbyAnn and Peaches ~ Congrats!!  WOOT WOOT!! GubbyAnn - My SO scheduled a mammo for 2 weeks after I finished rads. My RO said no way and made him push it out at least 3 months.  Got my first boost today and while I was getting dressed after, I noticed my tumor scar was starting to peel as is my arm pit.  This is not like a sunburn peel. This stings!  Did the Domeboro soak (felt so good) and really globbed on the aquaphor and covered the peeling areas with gauze so my clothing doesn't rub.  Weather around here is crazy! Yesterday we got 8 inches of snow in 4 hours and today it's 40 degrees and sunny! ",

Congrats to everyone who has finished or is fast approaching the finish line!!!   I had my 2 week follow up with my RO and her eyes almost popped out of her head when she saw me.  First, I have abandoned my wig and have an inch of snow white hair (I'm rockin' the Amber Rose look!) Second, I am almost completely healed except a little pink on the boost site.  She said I had one of the worst radiation burns (without blistering or breaking skin) that she had seen yet, I had healed quicker than someone with only a mild burn.  So ladies, it does get better, a lot better!!  I highly recommend the Domeboro soak.  It is so wonderful at calming the inflamed skin.  To celebrate I went swimsuit shopping for my trip to Florida at the end of the month. I found a suit with a high halter that covers the radiation site completely.  Well, except for the armpit, but that doesn't see much sun anyway. :) I also saw my MO to start on Arimidex and of course, had to have blood tests.  Found out my Vitamin D level was extremely low.  Most adults have a level between 30-50, Mine was 6! I am now on a prescription mega dose once a week for four months.  Did anyone else have a drop in Vitamin D during radiation?  Maybe it was the harsh winter without much sunlight. The trip to Florida will help with that :)",

Up until last Friday I had discomfort but no pain. But after Friday's treatment I have pain in certain spots. Almost like I'm bruised inside. I'm now taking 600 mg of ibuprofen before bed which helps a lot as does the Domeboro soak The wine Saturday night helped, too   My brown underarm is starting to peel in a couple of places, exactly like my nurse predicted and my tumor scar area is about 3 shades pinker than the rest of my breast. Wonder what is going to happen once the boosts start! I've heard so much about fatigue but so far I'm only a little more tired in the evening. Also, during chemo I only had a couple of days after each round where I was fatigued. I must have great stamina because I've surprised everyone (including myself) that I've continued to work full time during all this.  We're supposed to get another 3-5 inches of snow this afternoon just around the time I have to travel to Rads. YUCK! I'm so tired of winter! I just want to go someplace warm!",

The same tech said I  couldn't have that time slot because they would have to bump others. Fortunately, my RO and the person who does the scheduling interceded.  I now start on the day and time I want and no one was bumped to accommodate me.

The scan will determine if your bone density is within range for your age.  This lets your MO know if you need to be watched more carefully for osteoporosis while on Arimidex.",

Since the beginning of rads I noticed an achy, bruised feeling at the tumor site and during the boosts my RO said she could see exactly where the tumor site was by how irritated it was. Now when I do the Xeroform gauze the site gets weepy and gooey and when I do the Domeboro soak it gets dry and crusty. It is also painful and need to take ibuprofen several times a day. I see the rads nurse on Wednesday and will find out if this is typical or if I need to stop one or the other treatment.  On the flip side, I got lucky and have experienced very little fatigue and have continued to work full time!
