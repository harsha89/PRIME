      "Content": "Aug 27, 2017 03:23AM - edited Aug 27, 2017 03:28AM by tannme Lsunshine, Sweet Pea, and others in August, I'm so glad to have found this thread. My bilateral nipple sparing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction is scheduled for Mon 8/28, 12:30 PST. I'm injected with dye for the sentinel node biopsy at noon and then surgery begins at 12:30--2 hours for the BS and 4 hours for the PS who will place alloderm slings and TEs. I'm so anxious about future complications, such as nerve pain. I'm \"taking a sledge hammer to a tiny nail\" (DCIS Grade 3 comedo necrosis 5.5cm!) according to my gynocologist; however, she said she understood my reasoning and personally would choose mastectomy of a breast over lumpectomy with radiation. Anyhow, the oncologist said I'd be looking at 40 years of alternating MRIs with mammograms every 6mos to monitor my breasts that \"already know how to make cancer cells\" and have a current 20-30% chance of recurrence plus an additional 0.5-1.0% for each additional year I'm alive. LOGICALLY I'm fine with my decision. I just wish my stress would be checked by that.",

Surely will be even more nervous in the morning, and it helps to read input from everyone who has just been through it. Hope to hear from LSunshine and Sweat_Pea later this week, too.",
