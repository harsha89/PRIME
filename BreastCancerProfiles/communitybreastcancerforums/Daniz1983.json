I\u2019m so nervous and scares of the chemo and side effects but I told myself I\u2019d take all the medicine before just in case. What chemo are you doing? Thank you for responding and yes that does make me feel better to know it grows slow. I tried looking it up on google once and it scared the daylight out of me so I stopped. So I will try to stress yet I\u2019ve been nothing but stressed since I got diagnosed :( I also wanted to tell you one lady told me she is drinking alkaline water daily in addition to regular water and her side effects have been non existent. I bought a case to drink while treating but wanted to tell you to try people are having amazing results. She sips on it all day and drinks about a bottle and half to two a day. That\u2019s it. Wishing you a wonderful weekend keep me posted on how you\u2019re doing whenever you get a chance!!!",

Can you share what you read about the research showing controversial about that alkaline water. I tried looking online but Wasn\u2019t able to find much so invasive just curious before i strt drinking the water. Also. I literally just got an update from my doc who said that they heard back o my HER2 testing and the doc said he would rule the HER2 negative. My oncologist will call me tomorrow to Dow is tteatment but I am certain I will be starting AC+T. I\u2019m terrified!!!!! Not sure why completely ruling it as negative when it was clearly amplified the second time... :(",

It is awful finding out and hearing those words from the doctor. But you are not alone. Start telling your friends and people around you. I told my family and friends and the support has been amazing. Once you start telling them and talking about it you will find thy people want to help. I am 34 years old so just a yet younger then you, we are also a family of three and I literally also just found out I have invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 3 and have a 3.2cm tumor. I was diagnosed right before thanksgiving and haven\u2019t started treatment yet. It\u2019s awful and everything is moving soooo slow. I see a lot of discussion on the HER2. My first test was HER2 negative. Then fish analysis came aback amplified but I only tested positive at 2.46 they said anything below 2.0 is negative. Soooooo now long story short my doc had my case reviewed by another specialist who wants the HER2 RETESTED. I\u2019m freaking out Bc everything is so so slow moving and I have no treatment. This has to be retested in California. Apparently the best doc is out there who tests for this HER2. I am negative on ER/PR. My treatment will either be TCHP or AC+T depending on the test outcome. So first treatment then surgery I will be doing a double mastectomy. But I\u2019m super nervous as well about everything and don\u2019t know a lot.  Did anyone out there have a similar problem with testing so low on the HER2? I\u2019m scared Of this delay that this thing will just spread.. :( any input will be greatly appreciated Much love to everyone!!!",

That's crazy and I hope they adjust it for you next round. I got the neulasta shot attached to my arm. It beeped 24 hours afternoon first infusion and went off into my arm. I did feel a bit better afternoon it went in. Was yours a patch or a shot that\u2019s attached to the arm? (Hard to explain lol) I had to get my zofran changes to a pill form doc had given me a melt tablet it was so gross then she added and third medicine. Sunday I literally felt like I was overdosing on the medicine my head felt sooo bad and just like you so dizzy. But I also had a very rough first round. Major major nausea and vomiting. I wasn't able to eat or drink anything I lost a total of 8 pounds and freaked out. Monday I started eating and drinking a and today I even had Chinese food. a friend of mine had it ordered and delivered it was so nice.

I must admit that even though it\u2019s only been a little over a week an half since my 1st AC treatment I already feel a little difference in my tumor. It doesn\u2019t hurt anymore, I can touch it without pain and it actually feels a bit softer and tiny bit smaller. I know it sounds crazy but it makes me excited I hope this nasty AC treatment kills and tortures the crap out of those nasty cells like it did me. Anyway enough of me hope everyone is doing well.",

I even stayed on top of the meds and still felt like crap. I wore the sancuso patch I put it on night before I just think nothing will help me with the nausea just have to see how to ride it out and get somewhat better. I'm literally in a fog. I lost 8-9 pounds again since Friday. Can't eat or drink anything. This just sucks you guys. Ive been saying that I can't do the last two rounds it's been awful you guys. I just don't know how i will handle two more times of this and then off onto Taxol 12 times. I have been mor negative this time around. 😞😞",

I heard back from my oncologist on Thursday afternoon Right after I saw my BS and did the ultrasound. Hariry my breast surgeon actually did the ultrasound so I know it\u2019s probably correct. My oncologist told me that they presented my case to the board Thursday afternoon with other oncologists and their breast surgeons who said that they wanted to stop Taxol immediately. She said that my tumor and the cancer is obviously not responding to this treatment. She said that we had to do surgery right away to remove the tumor. My breast surgeon actually was amazing she squeezed me in immediately on Friday and yesterday I had a lumpectomy to remove the tumor and cancer. She told my husband that from what she could see she was able to get clear margins and that she sent it to pathology. I will get the results on Tuesday. This will tell them the actual number of alive cancer cells and what's going on. I was pretty upset I couldn't just do the double mastectomy. Oncologist said that they will most likely put me on another chemo for 3 more months. Carbo and Gemzar. Then after that I will do radiation and HOPEFULLY I will get to do my double mastectomy then. And she mentioned an oral chemo pill after that too. I am just praying praying and praying that this thing is completely out and that it doesn't grow back in the meantime. I'm so nervous y'all I can't explain my fear to you guys now. I still have tissue in there and it's not out yet and will be switching treatment what if something starts growing or even worse it spreads. My goodness idk. I'm going crazy. I can\u2019t believe this happened and the stupid thing was growing. I was doing soooo well. After AC the dang thing shrunk from 3.2 cm to 1.46cm why couldn\u2019t it have continued shrinking more. I\u2019m grateful it didn\u2019t grow to a crazy size I have met women\u2019s online who are also triple negative and their tumors grew to a huge size on taxol. Anyway sorry for the long update but that's what going on with me. Y'all keep checking yourself still even while on Taxol make sure to report pain right away and push for scans. I've been complaining to my oncologist about the pain for the past 4-5 weeks now and she wasn't worried. I had 4 more Taxol to complete. Hugs",

Port placed in. And now just waiting and more waiting. I wanted to see if anyone had this problem like I did. My 1st test showed I was HER2 negative. They recommended AC+T for treatment. 2nd rest the fish anlysys or whatever it's called said it was amplified. So my new treatment was TCHP. Then when I spoke to her she I tested HER2 positive at 2.46 my onc said anything below 2.0 is negative, and since I tested slightly positive she wants now a second opinion from another specialist. Well that specialist (also an oncologist) reviewed my case the other day and said she wants the HER2 retested. She wants it done in California by some bearcats doctor in the country. I have no idea how this is and what this means for me. My oncologist said that due to my age and being so young she wants to get the treatment just right for me. But it's been 3 weeks since diagnosed and this thing is just growing inside me, I feel like. Did anyone have this problem? I feel so hopeless like they don't know what to do with me. So sorry for the loooong post. :( Thank you!!",

So how are you doing after your first treatment? Hope you are doing well for Christmas. I finally got results and answers from my doc they got my results from California and are ruling me HER2 negative. Not sure I feel comfortable either way knowing I tested slightly positive second time around but oh well. Tripple negative and AC+T here I come. I start next week after Christmas. I\u2019m sooooo nervous and so scared. Scared of everything. What if the treatment doesn\u2019t work and doesn\u2019t kill anything. LOL your daughters realonse is hilarious. I am certain my 5 (almost 6 year old) daughter will have the same response when I cut mine off. I\u2019m not sure when to chop my hair before or after my first round.... keep us posted on how you\u2019re doing. GenevaCanada, Thank you for posting it that way about loosing your hair I need to start looking at it like that. How long after your 1st treatment did you notice your hair fall out",

It\u2019s awful that your treatment was postponed a week but hopefully this will give your immune system enough time to get build back up soon. You know I am freaking out a it this as well. So so scared Bc I actually have a weird cold this week, I\u2019m coughing and nose is stuffy so I\u2019m worried that it\u2019ll be like you said this effects my immune system so much that I won\u2019t be able to do my chemo like with you. I am going to the local store today though and get some bones for the bone broth to make today. We gotta try anything :))) I recently met a young girl who went through this last year and had issues with her WBC as well. She said neulasta wasn\u2019t working for her, she had to inject herself for 7 days after her chemo therapy for the WBC and had no problems after that. I\u2019ll see what MO says after my blood work Thursday but I\u2019ll ask about whatever is out there to help I really don\u2019t want delays. May is so far away and I hate the thought of going past that. On another more depressing note I\u2019m with you LAMinders, my hair started falling out slowly yesterday. Tons of strands came out. Not clumping yet but definitly so many strands. I couldn\u2019t go to cut I had to talk to my daughter to explain so she\u2019s not shocked, she\u2019s only 5 but is aware of everything going on.

This Process is so hard it's like dealing with it over and over again. I have my great days and then I have the really bad ones. If I remember correctly you are my age, I'm also 34 and I'm also on the Facebook page young survival coalition and they didn't make any collage of photos or anything of me when I joined about two months ago. But I'm also part of another fab page for young women with breast cancer and I must say I love it. I love all three groups I'm in thy are very private but the women on there are amazing. I have met so many wonderful women on there who are so supportive I've become friends with many of them. We exchanged numbers and everything and I just think that has helped me tremendously. To talk to people privately about what we're going through is a huge help to me. The third group I'm on is a somewhat localized group from my area and that helps also. I have thought about seeing a therapist but from what I hear from other survivors this will really help once the treatment and surgery are over and then you are at that waiting stage and going for check ups. I hear girls have a rough time with that also. I do think talking to someone will definitely help. If you think the support group 18-35 might be somewhat of assistance it may not be a bad idea to talk to other girls going through this. I don't know I personally would try it don't look at it as you are the oldest there we are all in this together and want to support one another. It's so important to talk about it, I have noticed a difference in myself when talking about it. About your doctor, is there a way to get another opinion from another oncologist in your area? If I can be of help and if you want me to add you to this other young women with breast cancer group I will be more than happy to do that. It's helped me a ton just like this page here has no feel like I know all you girls hahah 😂😂😂 and I wish we were closer it would be amazing. Best of luck to you girl!! ❤️ Hope everyone else is having a great Friday morning. I\u2019m off today for Taxol #3 wohoooo. I hope and pray it goes as well as the others two have.

Your tumor, does it hurt? Does anything ache? Ive have pain on the cancer breast and a bit on the other too. But the tumor also hurts my oncologist says it's normal bla bla. But I do know women who have had their tumor grow back or cancer spread to surrounding tissue on the breast. So, I'm nervous. Anyway. I am planning my surgery and I'm trying to figure out if I will be able to travel 2 weeks after finishing chemo.

Frustrating that instance wouldn\u2019t pay for retesting again but I am confident that they know what they are doing in the labs and have the best treatment for you. I\u2019m curenetly between AC+T and TCHP. Hoping i hear some news and can start something this week. After chemo will be doing a double mastectomy. This next year will be extremely rough. :( When do you start chemo? Please keep in touch and share how you\u2019re doing!! Hugs!",

I'm not 100% suremon that but my surgeon removed 2 lymph nodes and had them tested, mine were negative. But I haven\u2019t had my actual surgery yet. When are you tarting chemo?

You know Laura I actually though the exact same thing perhaps the shot didn't work or didn't go in right. But it was attached and taped up to my arm good I felt that prick good too and then when the meds went in it made a sound and was blinking for 45 minutes and then after that the green light was off and read your to remove. I am definitely going to ask MO if the show could have failed. I would honestly rather them just give a shot in the arm lol. PauletteK thank you for saying that!!! I am so glad to hear I'm not the only one who is having this then. I am having two weeks between infusions I am scheduled to go back on the 12th I really pray and hope I'm like you then where the WBC goes back up by then. Until then I'm just gonna lock myself in the house this week I'm not risking this. Thank you ladies soooo much.",

I know I DID LOL. it was so bad and the side effects were awful. I did Taxol #3 yesterday and I must admit it\u2019s been soooo much easier than AC. No nausea here whatsoever. NONE it\u2019s amazing. Steroids amount sucks it\u2019s more steroids for me and Benadryl.what I do is afterninfusikn I come home take a good nap and then feel good. Able to eat drink and function. It\u2019s so nice compared to what I was going through. Ac had me down for 6 days straight. Drink plenty of water/fluids before and after throughout the day and weekend it helps flush out all the medicine. The biggest side effect for me has been the headache. I get a headache Saturday and usually drink coffee and then I\u2019m good. Sunday is worse as far as headaches. I am trying not to take Tylenol or anything Bc my liver enzymes are super high so they are watching that. Other side effects slight aches, heart rate is higher for sureso I monitor that by measuring my BP daily. No neuropathy for me yet. I am icing my toes and my fingers. My oncologist actually requires this. They have dry ice packs at my infusion center that they give me. They put it over the feet over my socks and put a glove over it to hold it in place. The fingers I just hold onto the ice packs. If thy don\u2019t have those at your infusion center I can recommend some which were recommended to me that you can purchase over amazon. But I didn\u2019t since they have them and they are free. It\u2019s totally doable. Do not be scared I know I was freakin out my first two times but when I noticed I wasn\u2019t getting nauseated it wasn\u2019t great and I honestly didn\u2019t even even have to take my Xanax before it\u2019s so much easier for me. If you have any more questions about it or anything else please let us know. Feel free to PM me too I will be more than happy to chat with you like many did with me! 💖💖",

Icompleted AC in feb had my ultrasound and that showed my tumor shrank from 3.2cm to 1.46cm. And now it's a bit bigger I guess a few millimeters bigger. I'm freaking out. Breast surgeon said that she would talk to my oncologist and they would probably add something to the Taxol. I\u2019m guessing carboplatin. But why in the world didn\u2019t they just add then then.

It was awful nurse talked to the doc and they said they would drip it slower. I'm not sure why I'm doing blood work one week post treatment I know she wants to see me to discuss side effects and follow up post infusion and she said she wants to see my blood work a week later to make sure it's all doing okay And I'm handling well.

One girl had minor neuropathy but hasn't started icing her hands and feet and no issues. Some had low blood counts. But at least no nausea. One had hot flashes and had a reaction during Taxol #2 and that\u2019s it I\u2019m definitly staying off that blog!!! oh I was freaking out and had me so scared like you had to come here for some encouragement. I\u2019m literally having phobia and living in fear at the moment so scared of Taxol. But I don\u2019t have a choice for now I\u2019m teyong to still recover from ac #4 I\u2019m still not myself. And then force myself somehow to Taxol. I\u2019ll give it my best shot and pray God helps us all through this. I\u2019m glad though you said that about honey I had no idea. I use honey instead of sugar. But don\u2019t eat right at the moment it\u2019s impossible. I did when I got diagnosed but my energy levels are so low now that\u2019s we have a meal train going and they\u2019re helping a ton. I realllllly need rob find some energy to work out",

Not my fingers or my toes but my arm up to my elbow it was weird. I don\u2019t think it was actually neuropathy but I\u2019m not 100% sure. I am icing feet and hands religiously MO and even my breast surgeon recommended it so I am doing it and I feel like it helps. Of course I do th want to say zero neuropathy bc I still have 8 more treatments so I am just praying there isn\u2019t no energy of it. I mean not taking any supplements I may ask about I think next time.they did have to lower my Taxol dose slightly due to my liver enzymes being soooo high. They are somewhat more normal now. We will see. Otherwise I am feelin great. Can\u2019t say I have no side effects but they are nothing compared to that AC!! LAURA, I am so sorry the neuropathy has been so difficult maybe the break will be good for you. I really hope and pray the supplements help and honestly I would just say tart icing NOW you can give it a try it\u2019s just ice. Just put it over your sock on the feet and then a latex glove over to hold in place and on your hands just hold your hands over. No glove they say that\u2019s due to frostbite if there is a glove holding it. Do notmblame yourself. Give it try from now on and talk to your doctor. Try not to give up the treatment now we have come a long long way for that!!! I know you can do it I know you can. You handled AC like a champ and completed it you are a strong beautiful woman if they maybe just tweak your dosage maybe that would help if it\u2019s really bad I know someone else who had that. SWEWING, CONGRATULATIONS GIRL ON FINISHING!!!!!!!! THATS AMAZING!! 🎉🎉🎉💖💖 good luck with your surgery and planning of that and prepping for that. I\u2019m slowing interning plastic surgeons as well just trying to look ahead and prep for that. Keeps my mind sometimes occupied when I have something else to plan and look forward to. May I ask you a question about your surgery decision please. Are you doing implants? If so are you doing Above muscle or under muscle implants? Are you sparing your nipple? I don\u2019t think I will spare the nipple but want to hear what others are doing etc. have you decided on shape of implant? Sorry to ask so many ? But I love to know other people\u2019s decisions. Oh also MO said yesterday doing a lumpectomy with radiation is same as mastectomy. I just found this crazy idk why and I know she is the professional with the degree LOL but it got my mind all screwed up and now I feel like my firm decision on a double mas slightly got altered. This process really sucks and is so hard. I\u2019m not even finished treatment or anything and honestly I\u2019m already freaking out about reoccurrence. It\u2019s so crazy and sooo mental. 😢🙁 HARIRY, sorry to hear about the puffy mess but I am getting it too in my face. I HATEEE these damn steroids. I take Dex 5pills at night and 5 in morning before chemo. I hate it. It\u2019s about 40-50 mg\u2019s. It\u2019s a ton I feel like but that\u2019s it. MO said after yesterday (I haven\u2019t had any reaction to Taxol) to stop the morning Dex. So only 5 the night before. Then she will wean me off those when I\u2019m up to Taxol #7 she said.

Honestly I took a break from all the boards I'm on everywhere even on Facebook I had to take some time off from the \"cancer\" scares and talks. Peoples stories freaked me out for a while. I can't lie but say that I am jealous of you all for doing radiation and/or mastectomies and other things. I'm back in the chemo boat. I had my emergency lumpectomy on April 27th. The surgeon said she did get clear margins and they said it was not in the lymph system which is great thank the LORD for that!!! They did confirm I was 0% ER And PR so im still triple negative. I got a new oncologist one who specializes in tnbc and in breast cancer. She does tons of trials and studies herself so I am now with her. She put me on more chemo. I started last Friday with Carbo infusions and on Monday I started Xeloda, which is a chemo pill that I'm taking. I take that 3 pills twice a day 14 days on and 7 off. I'm supposed to get a total of 4 carbo and 6 months of xeloda. I pray the cancer doesn't come back or form again. But for now all I can do is pray and hope. I'm spending the summer with my 6 year old and will try to enjoy every day I get with her. Hope you all are doing well. 😘😘😘😘",

MO noticed a bit of a difference after treatment 1. And I felt it this pruning and the giant hard golf ball kumo that once was isn\u2019t so hard anymore and doesn\u2019t feel like a ball either. Wohoo. Hopefully we all will have a great response like you. But, I do have a question for you. Are you doing Taxol after AC? I\u2019m just it\u2019s cut currious beacuse I am hoping to be doing a double mastectomy with reconstruction after the treatment so I wonder if I have a great response if I'll have to finish the full 12 sessions of Taxol. Probably will. But that sounds like they should be able to replace your implants after you ten completely finishe",

Someone posted a link where to check all your products for the chemicals in lotions shampoos etc. I think someone posted a link before (but I just can't find it now anywhere) so if you wouldn't mind sharing again please I would greatly appreciate it. Good to know I'm definitly ordering some clear nail polish or nail hardener today. I don't see any difference yet I've only had one infusion but I have seen too many women's nails get so bad. My cuticles have gotten different not going to lie. Good to know about the selenium in Brazil nuts. The hot flashes suck. I thought they would go away after taxol. Laura, I had a red rash on my cheeks Saturday and I used Benadryl cream it got rid of it right away. Y'all are brave I still can't leave the house bald. I hate my bald head so much. I live in Texas so it's not really that cold sometimes I can't wear a hat and I hate it. I wish i lived up north where it was cold so I could just wear a thick hat and not worry about the damn wig.",

I really like it a lot. I'm not kidding it helps I have met so many amazing ladies. I love this group and that one on fb the most. I am glad you are pulling yourself together I know it's so hard and such a struggle. I have my bad days too then I get online and talk to the ladies current warriors and survivors and it's so hard helpful. I am icing my fingers and toes during infusion. Are you guys icing??? It is helping with the neuropathy for sure. So far I am good there hopefullymit stays like that.Taxol #3 yesterday. Port again wasn't working they couldn't get the blood to draw back before or after. So annoying. Then port and skin inside and out got irritated so they had to poke me several times. But I'm good today and in good spirits 💪💪💪 Ooh but they had to lower my Taxol dose due to my stupid liver enzymes being elevated. It was frustrating. I really didn't want them to lower it I want these nasty cells killed with as much power as possible lol. 😂😂😂",

I\u2019m only taking steroids night before and day of chemo. Then cemo day they give me anti nausea in the port and Benadryl. They did tell me that Taxol and the steroids can cause the stupid headaches. First week I took Tylenol and it helped but now I\u2019m not taking anything. Just gonna try to power through it. Lol but you are right I used to take the zofran and gosh the headaches from that were terrible",

I am taking 20mg at night and 20mg in the morning so total 40mg of Dex. It\u2019s insane and I\u2019m so annoyed bc I have been putting my on weight and craving everything. But this Friday will be Taxol #5 for me and I get to reduce my steroids to 20mg. As far as periods I haven't had one this month. I had one last month in Feb. This month I haven't had any it\u2019s probably stopped. Which is driving me crazy bc I'm also having waaaaay more hot flashes. I'm freaking 34 years old and feel like I'm going into menopause already and have major hot flashes, this is just BS!!! 😔 Ok I'm done venting. Swewing, Good luck with your surgery!! I\u2019m doing the same thing no nipple preservation but I think I\u2019m gonna do silicone implants. Hope it goes well. Has anyone heard of the Look good feel better class? I'm doing it this Wednesday and I'm super excited. I hear they show you how to do your eyebrows and give you some good pointers and make up samples and really should be fun. Have a good day ladies!",

I\u2019m really not looking forward to that. Did you get a wig by any chance? I\u2019m thinking of getting one but don\u2019t know what to get they have real hair now too. Thanks for sharing that site I\u2019ve started looking for some headscarf\u2019s that are comfortable and nice. Paulette, I think loosing the eyebrows and eyelashes will be hard. I\u2019m really stressing about loosing my hair. I finally heard back from my nurse who said that my final retesting of the HER2 came back and that doc is ruling it as negative, he\u2019s ruling me as a tripple negative. So I\u2019m sure my treatment will now go back to AC+T... either way it sucks I was just hoping to use the cold caps to save my hair with the TCHP but oh well can\u2019t now. So I\u2019ll be starting very soon. How long after your first treatment with AC did your hair fall out? I\u2019m tryijg to plan ahead I want to save my ponytail. (I know crazy) but my hair will probably never be this long again :( Usasam I hope your wife is feeling okay and hanging in there.",

I have another questions for everyone, did anyone get sick before their first treatment day? I am getting sick. Loosing my voice, coughin, somewhat of a sore throat nose a bit stuffy and I\u2019m supposed to start this Friday. Anyone else have this problem?? I\u2019m so worried about being sick and already lowering my immune system. 😞 Mjb1018, That is the same plan for me to shrink the tumor then do surgery. But I will be having a double mesactomy with reconstruction. I had issues with my breasts since I was 21 it sucks u really don\u2019t want to but what can you do, my doc thinks that\u2019s the best approach for me. But I am scared of the treatment and that the treatment won\u2019t work. Agh. Sswp, Thank you for the reply and to all the ladies with their hair and wig talks I appreciate it. This has been a great holiday but also a very hard one for me. Sswp you are brave for hosting such a big family. :)))) I cannot figure out what to do with my hair and wig too. I know I want a wig but don\u2019t know anything else. Hugs to everyone!",

It's rough but I haven't had really any nausea I take my anti nausea meds round the clock. My new oncologist is much better and they manage symptoms waaaaay better and really have a ton of drugs out there for the nausea. I cannot believe the way I suffered in AC and my old Oncologist didn't really change anything or add any meds to help that. It's so crazy. The ones that had a lumpectomy??? Do you guys feel anything in there????? Is there anything you girls are feeling? I'm feeling something old what it is but it's tender. I have an ultrasound next Wednesday but I'm freakin out AGAIN. Every time something bad happens with me and I just can't seem to shake it. My oncologist last week said she can't feel anything she said that to her I have healed nicely. But I still called my breast surgeon and I have an apt next week. Someone had asked me about my pathology of the tumor after the lumpectomy. They said that 90% of the tumor was still cancer. It grew .4mm while on Taxol and measured at 1.8cm when they removed it. They did get clear margins and there were no node involved. I'm triple negative. My new oncologist requested it checked again for ER PR and HER2 which all came back negative again. I was hoping it would be slightly positive or something but oh well what can you do. I just pray pray and pray that this doesn't come back but it's so scary. I don't know when I'm having my surgery yet I still want a double mastectomy. My breast surgeon is recommending radiation too but the radiation doc was saying I don't need it I'm doing double mastectomy. 🙄🙄🙄 which is annoying. But I guess they know but the fact that my breast surgeon thinks I need it makes me really want to have it. I trust her. It's stressful figuring out what to do. My hair has grown in a lot. It's pretty good maybe 2-3 inches or a bit more even",
