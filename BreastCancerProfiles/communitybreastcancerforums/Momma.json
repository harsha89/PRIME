My daughter was diagnosed last Oct at age 27; stage 1, grade 3, no lymph node involvement, ER+/PR+ (she's doing very well). What her team told her was that they would recommend a MX and chemo, no radiation. The reason being that they are concerned with the long-term effects (20 to 25 years) may cause other cancers; not to mention some of the lasting side-effects such as bone density loss. Because of her young age they did not want her to have radiation. It's not as much an issue when you're older but the concern is receiving it at a young age. So I guess it's a personal choice. Everyone's case is different and everyone's comfort zone is different. Good luck with everything.",

The first one I had done because both my doctor and I could feel a small lump in my left breast. The mammogram just showed dense breast tissue. After this years mammogram, the letter I received said that there were some areas of concern that would need to be evaluated, and an appointment was made for six months from now. I called my doctors office, and the nurse (not mine because the nurse and doctor are on vacation this week) said that my results showed benign microcalcification clusters in my right breast. I asked her to have the doctor give me a call next week. I usually wouldn't get stressed out, but I was diagnosed with Lupus 12 years ago, and recently found out that my daughter and I both have a genetic heart condition. I am just wondering if this is something I should worry with and maybe ask the doctor to order a biopsy, or just wait the six months and wait and see. I still have the lump on the left side too. I am not sure if it is a coincidence or not but the last two weeks my breast have been so tender I can hardly wear my bra. Log in to post a reply",

This year showed the microcalcifications on the right breast. Nothing showed up on the left (I assume. I plan on checking with the dr. next week when I go for a visit and also ask for a copy of this year and last years report). So, basically it is the microcalcifications they have said to wait six months. I am having the ultrasound done Thursday next week. I am still not sure what it will show with the calicifcations, but we will see.",

      "Content": "May 25, 2011 03:24PM - edited May 25, 2011 03:26PM by Momma Alicia, I'm so sorry you are going through this. My daughter was diagnosed in October at the age of 27. Her's was 1.6 cm, stage 1, but grade 3 (which is aggressive) with no lymph nodes and clear margins. It was caught very early and all will be ok with her. I say this because your situation seems similar. It is very overwhelming and scary. But you will get through it and gather strength from it. The decision between lumpectomy & mastectomy is tough. My daughter chose lumpectomy with chemo and radiation, but now her team of doctors don't want her to do the radiation because of the long-term effects (in 20 or 25 years) so she will have a mastectomy. It's tough at your age but you need to do everything possible to beat it and live a long, long life. She worked full-time through it all and the chemo was not very bad. Her doctor said that youth was on her side for not having too many side effects.  You will get through this and the fear will lessen and the determination to beat it will set in. Good luck, my prayers are with you.",

My daughter was dx  with bc last Oct at the age of 27, and it is not in my side of the family, but is on her dad's. The good news is that she got it early and it's stage 1. Don't listen to anyone who tells you you are too young. Chances are everything is fine but being pro-active is the best thing. It is terrifying, but you will be able to do it. We have learned to take everything one day at a time, and enjoy every day, and breath deep, slow breaths to help yourself fell calmer. Good luck. My thoughts and prayers are with you. ",
