      "Content": "ggtexs wrote: I am hoping to get some opinions here...I had my port placed over two months ago. A little painful but ok otherwise. They used it for my weekly Taxol the very next day ...but they put the port right on top of my incision (I have been told most are plced below the incision) so even though it was used for like 3 times the incision never healed well and it seemed to keep 'gaping'. About a month after initial placement it was open enough that they sent me back to radiology where they ended up doing a revision. This meant...well they tugged and pulled and cleaned and re-sutured. The result was the wound seemed closed but the 'line' from the port to my neck seemed tight and the port was still right in the middle of the incision....andI went through a lot more pain. We used for 3 more weeks and guess what has happened again? it is gaping again and I actually see something shiny there!!! Even though I am about to finish my Taxol I am about to start my FAC (eeek!) so I really need to get this fixed! anyone out there with an arm port? My onc. REALLY doesn't want me to get it there...might be last resort ;) I am going in tomorrow morning for another revision..... Log in to post a reply",
