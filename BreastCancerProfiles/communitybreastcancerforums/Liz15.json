I know I'm way late on this post, but I was just told I should get surgery to remove my fibroadenomas; I've only had one other surgery in my life so I'm terrified about it. However, y'all's posts have given me so much peace and I just wanted y'all to know that. Ready to get these nasty things out, and now I'm not so scared to! Thanks again!!",
