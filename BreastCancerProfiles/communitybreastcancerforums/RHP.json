I have only seen my rad onc once which was when I met the team. She talked to my husband the week after my post op visit. He told her I was opting for the brachy and she had her receptionist call and set up the appointments. So the next time I see her is to have her do the simulation and mark for the cathiters.. Should I call and see if they will call in a prescription or will I need it for the first visit? Boy I hate over thinking this stuff. It all just seems so unorganized, I hate asking questions on the phone, they always act like I am the only one who ever asked that.. I cannot believe how many people go through this and that it isn't more scheduled and simplified.. sorry ranting again.. Have a wonderful evening tomorow and treat yourself to something!

I am really really stressed,   They hadn't contacted me as promised when she \"got it scheduled\" but I picked up my future appt. when I went to see my medical onc. saw that it was scheduled for Friday then monday through Thursday. Freaked and askt the receptionist who lied and said \"that's how we always schedule brachytherapy..When I called and asked the nurse about meds she went through the whats next and said they would let me know\"later\" about the schedule for the treatments themselves. (I had not mentioned the scheduling thing to her) this was Friday late afternoon and of course didn't start praying on me until late Friday night! I really HATE this stuff! I can feel the melt down coming and just don't know how to stop it! Sorry for the whining, just the support around tends to wind down as this stuff goes on.. I try to keep it all in perspective. How lucky I am etc. but that doesn't always help, and when other people say that, it has the opposite effect!  I would love you to email me and send pictures!  Someone said you should ask to see pictures when you are at the Dr. but I felt like a voyer asking.  So now for a distraction tell me more about these great huggy dogs! Look maybe like Staffordshor (sp) terriers?  Hope the sun is shining and you have soft breezes today Robin",

It is like most of what they do is non invasive (at least it doesn't show that way) blood etc. so when they use a needle etc they are like completely unable to handle doing it so they act like you are the baby. I guess the meltdown stuff has been the hardest thing for me. I am usually a very even person who just handles everything. So I guess now that my life isn't in my control (like it wasn't just an illusion before) I just can't handle it.

So I make believe that all is well, and that waiting doesn't hurt anything. I can't wait to just worry about redness. How are you feeling other wise? Tired? I noticed today that the swelling is finally going down and the breast is much smaller than the other one. So I guess I will actually break down and get an add on.
