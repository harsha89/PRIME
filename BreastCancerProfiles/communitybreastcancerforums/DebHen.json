She is a top rated surgeon at a top rated research and teaching hospital, UT Southwestern Medical Center. However, don't expect much in the bedside manner category. Dr. Hughes was our second choice. She is at Methodist in Richardson-which I wouldn't recommend, but she also has privileges at Baylor Plano. Good luck - it is a daunting process. Debbie",
