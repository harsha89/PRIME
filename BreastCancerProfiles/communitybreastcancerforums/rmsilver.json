I am scheduled to have 4 AC, 4 T, then radiation (but have yet to meet with that dr). I got really sick the first night and was pretty nauseous for 3-4 days (but no more than having morning sickness). I also had a reaction to the compazine (felt like a crackhead, all fidgity, ansty, couldn't sit still or stop moving) and the Zonfran gave me bad headaches...but week 2 has been great, no side effects and feel normal. Will be nice if the rest are like that. I can handle one week on, one week off. Hopefully next time they can give me diff meds and I won't have the reactions.  I am 31 yo, happily married. I have 2 little kids, 10.5 months and 3 yr that keep me busy and distracted (altho not well rested, lol) I found the dimpling/lump while nursing the baby. Can't wait to see what the 3 yo says about me being bald :)  good luck to all of you! hope to get to know some of you better",
