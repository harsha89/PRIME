    "Content": "TXrunnerchic wrote: ((Not sure where to post ... so will cross post))) Nov 2013 I had an abnormal mammo with 'microcalcifications' . Diagnostic Mammo, followed by Core/needle biopsy. Results at that time were benign.. just positive for 'fibrocystic disease' Had my annual mammo this month, followed by the recommended diagnostic and now they are recommending another biopsy because there are new 'micro calcifications' in the exact same area from where they were removed last time. Any thoughts?? I haven't been able to find much info on situations where the micro calcifications recur in the exact same (or darn near close to ) area . I'm heading to MD Anderson's undiagnosed clinic next week for evaluation and see what they say. Log in to post a reply",
