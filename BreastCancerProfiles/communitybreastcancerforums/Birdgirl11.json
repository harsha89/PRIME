Yesterday was Sunday and there were only a handfull of patients being treated. Made me so mad I was fuming! It seems RO's for the most part are concerned with that small area of your body they are treating and nothing else. If you are having side effects, I would continue following up with your MO if they are good or even your general practitioner. Hope things do level off for you soon. I did find with the nausea I felt better when I had somthing in my stomach - preferably protein. We are all so different, but trust your instincts and listen to your body. You know your body better than anyone else. Hugs",

Radiation is tough and no one tells you about all these other side effects you will endure. So when you make your choice at the beginning, you really can't make a completely informed choice, I think. I am still glad I did the lumpy. I get to keep my own boobs for a little while longer, even though one is missing a nipple. But I have had many questioning moments. So sorry to read how discolored your skin is. The calendula and aquafor really helped me a lot. But I also caked that stuff on. I've gone through 3 tubes of calendula and need to pick up one more. A couple shirts and bras are just going to have to go in the trash when this is all done. That being said, I can't sleep tonight because I'm sore and can't get comfy, so again - another lovely SE no one tells you about. The black and charring doesn't sound good, though. Do you have a good RO? What is his take on your skin condition? For my own whine session - I had a terrible RO that didn't listen to me and basically told me any SE I was having other than redness or fatigue was not due to radiation. What bunk. I would get so upset after seeing him that now I'm finding I need a xanax anytime I have any doctors appointment at all! I'm supposed to get a regular pap smear today and my stomach is in knots. I am so ready to get off this ride!",

Beachbum - it sounds like you are becoming a pro when it comes to doctors - sorry to read you have had to meet so many. For rads you will need some kind of cream or lotion to keep the radiated area from drying out. Some good ones are pure aloe and aquafor, and I'm sure your RO will recommend some. After you put that on, you are all sticky and goopy, so to protect your bras and clothes, you will want a tshirt or cami or tissues to cover the area before getting dressed. SE's have a huge range - reading the posts on here can tell you - but are mainly skin reactions like redness and itching and also fatigue. On average SE's start about 2 weeks into treatment and last a week or two after treatment, but that varies a lot too.

Aside from a few very disturbing photos, there are diagrams that show the path of the radiation beams. He also assured me that the lungs tend to repair themselves quite well after treatment is done. So far, I haven't had any issues with my muscles in that area and the cording I had after surgery hasn't returned, either. I've had 27 treatments and mainly have just had skin issues and fatigue.

Maybe because you had a positive node and reconstruction, so they want to be sure to get all surrounding tissue. Mine is full breast, but doesn't reach all the way to my collarbone, just about half way up and then not all the way around to my back, just about halfway into my armpit there too. Hang in there, you are almost done! Then time to recover and enjoy some rest. Hope - I hear you. I'm not much of a complainer usually, but this whole thing is just too much some days. And then some days are fine. My poor husband never knows which woman he will wake up to each day. Even the ups and downs are exhausting. Reader - sounds like we have a very similar DX - welcome to the group! Cath and Pita - congrats on your low onco scores! Great to have an encouraging report in this journey.  ",

Cassie - I do use calendula ointment and so far, it's working out quite well. I can't say if it's any better than any other, but it was recommended to me by several others so that is what I decided to use. ",

They did do weekly x-rays throughout rads, though. The reason I was given was to be sure the radiation area was staying lined up with the area they wanted to get. I'm sure it's possible that weight changes, fluid changes, etc could effect how you lay and the exact area of radiation. So they would check to be sure on a weekly basis. Did you have trouble with your blood counts during chemo? Sorry you are going through the extra stress with the radiation.  ",

I had a yeast infection and both he and his nurse simply stated that it is not a side effect of radiation. No offer to help, no understanding, just a look like, \"That is not our problem.\" I was so put off by my RO that by the end I was taking xanax on the days I had to see him because I was so stressed. No personal care at all. On a side note, I believe my chronic yeast infections, sore throat and dizziness were due to being dehydrated. I was dry everywhere, even though I was drinking water like a fish. That really threw off the balance in other areas of my body. But hey, \"that's not a side effect of radiation\", right? Sorry, end rant. I feel better now.",

Hope, the pain and itching sucks! I am just starting with it and I'm fearful for what is to come. Only 11 down and 17 more to go for me. I was hoping to be one of those women who breezes through with few side effects. Nope. Yesterday I got hit with fatigue like a bad cold coming on. Got worse through the day, even with caffiene. Starting to get red and a slight purple color that makes my poor pigmy boob look a little sick. I work in a school, so I'm hoping I can hold out until Christmas break. Not so sure now",
