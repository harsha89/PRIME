I have 2 drains, which are annoying, but truly no big deal. My drains are still putting out quite a bit of liquid. Like 50 cc's in the morning and again the evening on the right side. The drain on the left has been putting out about half of what the right side is putting out and the liquid is more clear. Anyway. Gearing my nerves up for this next step. Really hope everything goes well. I couldn't have gotten through all of this without you all. Thank you so much for your support ",

Apparently no cancer was found in either breast, so that's good. (thought I have an occult breast cancer/no primary was ever found). So I'm happy that nothing microscopic was found (things too small to be seen on MRI or PET) Initially, they saw only 1 node impacted on the left side. The TCHP reduced it from 3.4 cm to 1.1 cm. The surgery removed 21 nodes. Out of those, they identifies 2 with malignant cells - the one we knew about and another one. The report had very little information about the second one. It also mentioned that a small amount of malignant cells had escaped the lymph node and were found in the fatty tissue. That scares the heck out of me. I don't know what to think about that. I'm having radiation in a few weeks on that entire lymph area so they feel good that the radiation will help with that. Anyone know how effective that is? MY BS is going back to pathology with some more questions. She feels that the report was unclear in a few spots - it was hot off the presses today just in time for my appointment.

My surgery is set for the 28th, but I still don't have a final answer on the surgery I'm having. The initial plan was to have a first surgery to do the axillary dissection and a breast reduction(to make me a candidate for nipple sparing). Then a second surgery to do the actual BMX. They were going to try to go straight to implant in the second surgery if my circulation was good enough. I started asking questions about when radiation would happen within that plan and I couldn't get a straight answer. The PS said I would only have radiation to my axilla not to my axilla and breast. I told him that I had heard at one point that I'd need to have both. He checked with the BS who agreed - no radiation to the breast just to the axilla. Then when I went in to meet with the BS on Wednesday this week she insinuated that I was being a pest worrying so much about the radiation portion of things. (which annoyed me). She assured me that it was just to the axilla. I said that's fine, but when in the process would I have it? After the two surgeries (so basically in August/September?). After the first surgery? At that point I think she realized that we really should have brought the RO into the discussion. She had me wait while she called up to him to talk to him. She came back in the room very sheepish and explained that the RO said that I might in fact need to have radiation to the axilla AND the breast. And if that's the case that would totally change my surgical plan (which is why I was asking about it in the first place). I would no longer be able to do nipple sparing BMX if they have to radiate the breast. So the surgery on the 28th would go from being an outpatient procedure that would take me off my feet no longer than a week and a half to one big surgery where we'd do the axillary dissection and skin sparing BMX which would put me out of commission much longer. I need to get to the bottom of this because I work full time and we have a toddler so I need to be able to make arrangements to be out of work and have some help from family. Anyway- the RO wouldn't give a definite answer until he met with me so they sent me right upstairs to meet with him while I was there. I met with him and he said that he'd need to think about it and get back to me - that he wanted more time to review my case file. So now I'm waiting to hear back from him. Supposedly I'll hear back today. Fingers crossed.",

I have 2 drains and they have finally started to slow quite a bit, but they are still putting out about 40-50 cc's each per day. One I don't feel at all, but the one on the lymph node removal side is more sire and poking me. They are driving me crazy and I can't wait to get rid of them.

I'm tired all the time, I'm sore, I want my drains taken out. I had a bilateral mastectomy and ALND (21 nodes taken out) so my left arm is sore and pretty limited. I can't drive or go off anywhere by myself. I have a full time job. I worked through chemo treatment and everyone has been really supportive/great. There's been some stress from me putting pressure on myself to keep all the balls in the air and not letting anyone down. My surgery was just over 2 weeks ago and I've been totally off work. Basically just checking email periodically to stay in the loop so I don't fall behind. I'm planning to start transitioning back part time this coming week. Working from home. I still have drains, still on pain pills. In my job I'm responsible for bringing in new clients. I submitted a proposal for a new account a month ago. They selected us as a finalist and asked us to come in to discuss it. Of the days they offered I picked the latest date (tomorrow). My boss and a colleague were going to go in person and I was going to dial-in by phone. But now boss just emailed me that he's stuck out of town and can't get a flight back. I really can't reschedule, so now I have to get myself together enough to go and do this pitch myself tomorrow. I'm stressed out. In the meantime, I have a wonderful toddler. He's awesome but a real high-energy handful. I worry about going through all this around him. He definitely spends more time with Daddy lately and I feel so sad that I'm not doing as much for him or spending as much quality time with him lately. I hate it. My parents have been here \"helping\" since surgery. Helping means they mostly do what they think helping is. They will play with my son, which is fine, good. Pick him up from preschool. The first day home from the hospital my Mom is asking me to plan what we should be having for dinner for the week. Before surgery I ordered a full grocery order delivered so we would be totally stocked - but come to find out that my Mom has new food restrictions and she can't eat several of the things I had planned in advance to be made. This resulted in a big, exhausting conversation about what we should have instead. Week two I did another online grocery delivery after a very tense second conversation about what we're planning to eat for the week, this time I made sure that I had things my family could/would eat AND the things she ate. Yesterday was the first time they went to the grocery store and only bought things my Mom needed. The second day home from the hospital my Mom asks me if she can have a wrought iron bakers rack (that she gave me 8 years ago) back. I'm confused. This is the second time she's done this to me with something she's given me. Apparently, the reason this time is that she feels that she could use it in a more meaningful way than I'm currently using it. She wants it to hold towels in her master bathroom(???) I have it in my laundry room holding things I need in there. Over the past week, my Mom has kept coming up to me to ask me to go and do some \"outings\" - go to the movies, to Home Goods, etc. I went to Home Goods one day and I was wiped out for the next full day. The next time she asked I said no. I think she's frustrated with me and bored because I stay in my bedroom and sleep a lot. Yesterday she was annoyed that I didn't come downstairs and socialize with her. I went out to get some dinner with my husband for Valentine's Day on Saturday night. It was nice, but it took nearly all I had in me to shower, dress, makeup, wig-up, etc. and we were only out for an hour. I was totally exhausted the next day. I think that's why I'm so nervous about this work meeting tomorrow. I don't want to blow it or over do it. My Mom came up to me today and says that they are going to leave on Saturday. I say that's fine. Then she wants to have a whole conversation about it. I keep repeating that it's fine. I think she must want me to ask her to stay or ensure that I'm at a point where they can go. I don't know what my status is. (I go on Thursday to have my drains looked at again, they are still producing so I'm afraid that they won't take them out yet. Then I still won't be cleared to drive.) I don't want to keep talking about it. I'm tired. Truthfully, I think it would be easier if they just go. They are now causing me more stress than helping, because they are pushing me to do things I don't want to do. I can figure out how to cover the things they have been doing like picking my son up from school and we can eat easy things for meals. Anyway - mostly I'm just whining. I'm struggling because I wish I felt better/further along. I'm struggling because my family wants me to be further along and seem frustrated with me if I seem that I'm not. ",

I was diagnosed in August with an enlarged lymph node on the left side which was caught on my mammogram. Turns out that I have an occult primary (no primary tumor was ever found despite several MRIs and a PET scan. I was BRCA1/2 negative, but did come back positive for a gene variant called BRIP1.

I'm also triple positive, just had my last TCHP chemo on New Year's Eve. I was just scheduled for 1/28 to have the first in a series of surgeries. The first one on the 28th will be an axillary node dissection with a breast reduction. Then 12 weeks later I'll have BMX with TE's. Then 12 weeks after that they will put in the implants and I'll start radiation. I still have several questions that I need to get answers to. This seems like a lot of procedures to me. I'm 43, married with a 3 year old. I also work full time so having this many procedures/recoveries is going to be really disruptive. I was told that the first surgery would take a lot of tissue that they would then send to be analyzed and may provide some helpful information, though I'm committed to doing BMX. My BS doesn't think BMX is necessary. But I got a second opinion from a BS from Hopkins who said BMX without hesitation due to my family history. So I just need to get to the bottom of how necessary it is to have 3 surgeries instead of having the first two at the same time. ",

That was biopsied and was found to be carcinoma. Nothing else was seen on the mammogram...no primary....though I've been told my breasts are dense. I had an initial MRI that saw the enlarged left lymph node and something small and apparently suspicious in the right breast. Today, I had an MRI/biopsy on that suspicious something in my right breast on the first MRI....now we wait for that result. Heard back today that my PET/CT scan came back clean with the exception of the node in the left breast that we already knew about. What I don't understand is that the PET/CT didn't see anything in the right breast. They still saw something in the right breast on the second MRI today, so they did do the biopsy. How can nothing come back on the PET/CT, but be seen twice on the MRI? Could it be benign? (Hoping too much?) I was just booked for a follow-up appointment with the breast surgeon on Friday morning. The right breast biopsy results should be back by then, so I'm really hoping I get some clarity around what's going on and what we do about it. This is very confusing and frustrating!",

I'd love your thoughts on this concern I have: You may remember that my hospital was recently hacked, taking their system down for a full week. I had just started my radiation treatments - was just 4 treatments in - when things shut down. Since then they have been asking me to come on the weekends to make up treatments I missed. For the past two weekends I've gone in one day. So last week, I went in Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Had Sunday off and then everyday this week. This morning they again asked me to come in on the weekend. I'm inclined to say no. I'm exhausted. I'd really like a break. I can't tell if they are having me come on the weekends due to medical necessity (it was really bad for me to miss a whole week and they are trying to jam treatments in to zap the hell out of me for cancer concerns) or to just get back on their schedule/catch me up to ease their scheduling mess. Yesterday was the first day the fatigue really started. Today I woke up really sore. My shoulders, my collarbone on the radiated side. And I'm starting to feel tired/emotional about all of this. I'm set to see the Dr tomorrow and will ask about it, but wondered if you all have an opinion on it/thoughts or suggestions of things I should be asking about it all. I don't even know the total number of treatments I'm going to be having, so at this point there's this big, long unknown path ahead of me that feels like it's stretching out forever. WWYD?",

Probably will be missing treatment today and have to make it up at the end. In other news, my MO wants me to start Tamoxifen soon. She sent in the prescription and was going to consult with the RO on the timing of starting. I think she forgot that I take Wellbutrin. She previously told me that I can't take Wellbutrin and Tamoxifen at the same time (it makes the Tamoxifen ineffective). So I likely need to wean off the Wellbutrin before I start the Tamoxifen (not sure how long that will take to do). I'm pretty disappointed that I have to stop the Wellbutrin. I really think it helped me get through all of this. ",

I don't feel anything and don't notice any changes in my skin...yet. How long did it take for you to have any kind of skin reaction to the radiation? Or maybe you never did? A friend of my Mom's in NYC had treatment for breast cancer. She sent me a box of creams apparently made especially for radiation. Apparently she used it during her radiation treatment and had great results. I showed it to my Dr and he approved me to use it. It's called radiaderm. (http://radiaderm.com/) Has anyone here heard of it or used it before? It's a 2-step cream process. Right after treatment I put the first one on (it's a \"cooling\" gel) and wait 10 minutes. Then I wipe off any excess and apply the second cream. At night I apply a tube of the second cream again. They are packaged in little single use packets so I can just keep the packets in my purse. I guess we will see how well they work. Anyway, giddy-up...this is only the very beginning of this process for me. And, I have an appointment tomorrow for follow-up with my MO and I know she's going to get me started on tamoxifen - which I'm DREADING. PS - did your doctors ever tell you anything about how much doing radiation reduces the risk of recurrence? Like a percentage or something? Thanks!",

I have an appointment with the plastic surgeon before Christmas and will raise this with him as well. My thinking is that I'm only 43, who knows what the BRIP1 will mean when they know more about it and with my unknown primary they don't know where in the breast the cancer originated. I also have dense breasts and nothing showed up on my mammograms until it was in my node...so I don't trust mammograms as a screening tool anymore. My BS is saying I should do mammogram on the affected side just in case and an axillary dissection on the nodes to remove any impacted. Then they would send all the breast tissue for analysis. My thought is why not remove the other breast as well? I think the BRIP1 will increase my likelihood of recurrence, so why risk it? I guess I'm disappointed that my BS disagrees with the route I want to take and didn't think the BRIP1 was a big deal. I'm tempted to go have the surgery with the other BS, but I'm worried that will complicate things if I want to keep my other treatments and the initial hospital (the second opinion BS is at a different local hospital). Both hospitals are very well respected here in DC. ",

I pretty much just sobbed uncontrollably all day yesterday. :( So many scenarios, fears, things to face coming up. I dread telling family and friends (but I'm not going to until I have a plan in place and a clear diagnosis) Right now only my husband knows. I also just realized that this is really terrible timing bc we are in the middle of going through the life insurance process (have been for a few months and it's been slow) and this is likely to make me uninsurable. I can't believe this had to happen now! I feel like if something bad were to happen I'll leave my husband and son in a bad financial situation. I have good insurance through my job (Care First). I don't know how much insurance covers vs having to pay out of pocket for tx? Also, how do you go through this and keep your job (so I keep my insurance)? I have a senior level position, but with a smaller company. I probably could always go on the insurance at my husband's company, but we need my salary. So many worries swirling through my mind. I barely slept last night, maybe 3 hours tops.",

They found the cancer in a lymph node. None of the other nodes appeared to be enlarged and the breast surgeon said that the node felt mobile not matted so that makes it more unlikely that the cancer had spread outside of that node. Is that true? ",

Apparently they just saw that the oncologist already scheduled the PET scan and I only need that. So fine. So, the MRI results... They gave me the MRI even though I wasn't at the right point in my cycle. I think that since I am triple positive they are interested in seeing the breast at the highest hormone level and the lowest (Monday). So.....with Friday's MRI they saw nothing in the left breast (side the impacted lymph node was on). They saw something very small in the right breast. So on Monday they are going to do a biopsy of the something in the right breast guided by MRI...so they can look again at the left while biopsying the right. The MRI also showed no other nodes seem to be impacted. Sounds like they are wondering if it might be occult?? (Is this bad, good or neither?) She also didn't seem very concerned about the small thing in the right breast being cancer, but then again I feel like that was said by someone else after the mammogram found the node. (They told me I was likely looking at rheumatoid arthritis or lupus). I dunno. So, I don't seem to be any closer to an answer. Just more questions at this point. I can't tell if they are being so positive because they always are or blowing smoke until they know for sure. She volunteered that this was likely \"very early stage...probably stage 2\"... Would they say that if they weren't fairly sure?   ",

It was done in the same facility as my breast surgeon/oncologist. I'm trying to convince myself that if they saw metastasis elsewhere they would have called me right away. Praying its confined to the breast and the one node that they found and which lit up on the MRI. Tomorrow afternoon I have a second breast biopsy guided by MRI. This is a result of them seeing something small on the last MRI. I had a really busy weekend so it's easy to forget that this is actually going on...especially since I haven't told anyone besides my husband and best friend. I also just realized this will blow up my September. I have a very important business trip during Labor Day week and we are booked for a Caribbean vacation at the very end of September. ;(. I have been waiting and waiting for this trip...first vacation since last year...and we will probably have to cancel and lose money. I don't know enough about what treatment entails to make any decisions on this so its just hanging over my head. Sorry for the rant I'm just feeling frustrated",

      "Content": "edwsmom wrote: Hi there, I'd love to bounce my situation off of some others who have been there/done that to see what you might think. I've been doing adjuvant chemo (TCHP) and I'm nearly done so I'm working toward making a surgical decision. I'm 43. I have an occult breast cancer (meaning they can't find the primary) with involvement in one lymph node (it was detected via mammogram by seeing the effected/enlarged lymph node). I have a family history of BC - my maternal aunt and her daughter both have had breast cancer. My cousin (who had a mastectomy several years ago) has now had a recurrence with mets. They both were dx in their 40s as well. When I met at first with the breast surgeon, she presented two choices - axillary dissection with radiation OR mastectomy and axillary dissection with radiation. She felt strongly that there's no difference in outcome between the two choices and felt that a mastectomy wasn't necessary. My oncologist disagreed with her and has shared that she thinks I should have the mastectomy. Since then, I received my genetic test results back. It was positive for a \"variant of unknown significance\" called BRIP1. Due to the unusual circumstances of my occult cancer, I sought out a second opinion with another BS. She felt strongly that there was definitely something genetic going on due to my family history and the young age at dx. Due to those factors, she recommended that I should have bilateral mastectomy to reduce the chance of getting cancer later in the second breast. Today I met with my original BS to share the genetic test results and talk about what surgery I should have. She feels that we don't know enough about the BRIP1 to have it impact a surgical decision at this time. She didn't seem influenced by my family history. She still thinks I could just do axillary dissection/radiation only, but understands if I want to do the mastectomy. I brought up the bilateral mastectomy recommendation and she felt that it's unnecessary, discouraged me from going there. Ultimately left it in my hands to decide. I'm stumped. Part of me wants to go ahead and do the bilateral mastectomy for peace of mind. The other part of me would love to avoid such a big surgery if possible. Then again I'm afraid to not be as aggressive as possible in dealing with this. The other factor is should I stick with my current BS or seek to have the second opinion doctor for surgery?
