I mean from the beginning all the docs said that I needed chemo. Pretty much cause of my age I guess. Was supposed to have 6x FEC, but after the 3rd refused chemo unless I could switch to CMF (was scared of heart problems). They agreed. I'm overseas and really surprised to read that I probably wouldn't have gotten chemo if I was in the states... Peace, Jen",
