So..do I wish I had biopsied what was questionable or thought to benothing at the time? Take a look at my history, and you tell me. It's not minimally invasive, and they are offering.

I think you'll find as you have less side effects and appear more \"normal\" to your kids, they may just forget you have cancer...at least for periods of time, which is a healthy thing for them. I still deal with SEs and I'm always getting my shots and my tests (usually they are in school) so it doesn't impact them too much.

Three years later, after being ONJ clear for two years, I was allowed back on Xgeva. I've since had a crown to replace an old filling (tooth had a small fracture) and I am having another crown done soon. All while on Xgeva.. And witha history of ONJ. Ultimately, a good crown is safer than risking an injury to the tooth that would require more extensive dental work. I can NOT go there again. Jennifer, my dentist is amazing. She's in Santa Monica.

Also, he's not a big Nagourney fan because he goes against the mainstream science ways of doing things. On the other hand, in staying mainstream, I'll be lucky to have two more years...tops. I would like the option of some other possibility....no matter how small. I'm very torn. I don't wants to delay y90, but I really want that tissue. Any advice? Sunset",

Apparently I don't have a whole lotta time. Right now my liver is functioning normally and numbers are good, as of a few weeks ago. But I haven't had chemo in 4 weeks and he says with the amount of tumor I have, that could change at any time, and that could become a problem for treatment. A lot if what's ifs. Still, I'm inclined to take the chance. Gonna die anyway, right? . Seeing Nagourney today and will get a better idea of biopsy risk.

You can\u2019t remove all of your body parts because you MIGHT get cancer one day. If you remove your ovaries, that still lessens your chances of getting uteran cancer. I don\u2019t think Breast cancer and cervical cancer are related. Your hormones and your periods will still cease to function. 2. I had a BMI with reconstructive implants. Hated them..had them removed and did lipo fat transfers. I now have small natural looking soft breasts, but I\u2019ve had seven surgeries, including the initial bmx. My advice would be to go with the implants, as long as you don\u2019t get chest radiation..then that\u2019s another story. The other means of reconstruction are much more painful and body invasive. 3.if you have hormone positive cancer, then you really mightbwanr to get your ovaries removed. They produce the hormone that feeds the cancer. Removing your uterus without your ovaries isn\u2019t really an option. 4. I find very little pluses to menopause. I was 47 when I got BC and was put into a medical menopause. The best part was my heavy periods ended. BUT , I feel like it aged me before my time. Estrogen keeps you young. And my vagina dried up. WORST THING EVER. I don\u2019t think it happens to everyone, but it\u2019s a risk and you are young and shouldn\u2019t need to deal with painful intercourses. You should ask your doc about getting Lupron shots instead of removing your ovaries. There is more to it than snip snip..no ovaries. Not to frighten you, but in reality, it does change you. 4. He may put you on an Aromatase Inhibitor like letrozol, or exemestane. It works better on women in menopause. If somehow you decide to keep your ovaries ..tamoxifen would be the first go to treatment. Just my experiences, btw..everyone is different. Good luck. Hope I helped. Stefanie      ",

After chemo and bmx with recon, I was completely NED. 2 years later,unhappy with my implants, I decided to embark on a pretty intense reconstruction that involved four surgeries over the course of about 14 months. Nobody warned me of the danger that you have been informed of. Sometime after the third surgery, I had progression. I truly, truly believe that I put my body through so much stress, with the anesthesia and the inflammation, that is what brought on the progression. I did do the fourth surgery because i needed to. I've been fairly stable since then, but no longer NED. I do need a fifth surgery to make a correction. I cant say I'll never take that risk again...because I might, but not anytime soon. MY ONC says the data regarding surgery is more experiential than scientific, but there is definitely talk about it among the experts. And, as a side note, after all of that I'm still unhappy with my breasts. I can't win this one",

I'm so sorry for your progression and your prognosis. My cousin passed away a few years ago from BC. She was only 44. She was angry (can't blame her) and really went out kicking and screaming. When I was diagnosed, my first thought is that I would try to leave this world with grace and love. Your post epitomizes just that. Thankyou for being a role model for all of us. I'm sorry you have to to leave your family so soon. Im happy that youve had the wonderful years with them that you've had. I found this ecxerpt in a book I recently read that really sums it up. \"There are the years I will not live, but set against the vastness of eternity, the time I've lost is but a moment. What is forever is the same as if I'd lived another sixty years or more: those I loved will always be a part of me, and I will never cease being a part of those who loved me.\" May you memory be a blessing to them for always.

There is a trial at my hospital of keytruda with Ibrance and Palbo, and that is a choice but I got the feeling it's not his first choice for me.

Don't know you or what you've had in the past, certainly I'm not a doctor. But there are alternatives, and you may want to look into them before jumping off that chemocliff. Sunset",

I just wanted to see my daughter's bat mitzvah and my son's HS graduation. Now my son is in his 4th yr of college and my daughter is soon to graduate HS. So there is plenty of hope and lots of options out there for you. Your combo is a good, but def get at least one other opinion from major research facility. Also, I am curious why are you having a hysterectomy? That would be unusual, unless there is something I don't know about you. I just noticed your location. We are close. I'm going to PM you Sunset ",

You could probably get away with just telling them your cancer came back and, like 5 years ago, you are going to have treatment so you can get better. My children were 10 and 14 when I was dx'd.

They've also see me recover from chemo and surgery and grow my hair back.i no longer appear or act sick, so life is normal for them, as it should be. I'm still here almost 5 years later (with bone mets). I cannot imagine them having to live those last 5 years with the fear of losing their mom hanging over their heads. They have enough to worry about growing up. I'm glad I did not scare my children. One is now in college and one is in high school. At this point there is no reason to think I won't be around another 5. They still don't know I am stage 4. Heck, most adults don't even understand what that means.

My oncologist is very agressive. I did everything. BMX, Chemo and rads. Even rads to the spot on my bone, since there was only one. I continued on with just oral hormonal treatments and faslodex injections. It was a lot to go through, but I came out cancer free, which I remained for three years. Now I'm just on something else. Then there will be something else after that. That's just the way it goes.We jsut keep trucking along. But you will need time to process. I do think you should get a second opinion. I have seen many stage 4 women here who have not had chemo. I don't know if that is a new thing from four years ago or its just doctor's choice. Everybody's cancer is different, so everybody's treatment is also different. There is a woman named Monika on the stage 4 boards who was recently diagnosed and just starting treatment without chemo. Maybe you could touch base with her and she can give you her thoughts on that. Good luck. We are here if you need us. Stefanie",

I went to see a top ONJ specialist at uCLA and this is what he said: It's better to cap or crown it than pull it. He has no problem with me having anything done to my teeth, but he would strongly recommend that no surgery be done involving any part of the bone. That includes having a tooth pulled. I don't know your case but perhaps before you have it pulled, you should look into trying to fix it first. My specialist said cement and seal.... Better way to go. Good luck with whatever you do.

Fast forward 8 months later, this is my standard PET plus the follow up MRI, which shows the met in the spine has mostly healed, and the met in my sacrum shows no change (stable) and no new activity or mets anywhere else.

They are going to send my tumor tissue to Foundation One for full genetic sequence coding, and to see if the make up of the cancer has mutated to something different. From that they will be able to hopefully match me with the correct treatment that will also include an immunotherapy. Have you done this yet? Maybe you don't have to shoot in the dark to see what will stick? I can't say dont be depressed. That would be hypocritical. I do think you can still get this under control.

For some reason I missed his age reference, and for the entire book I pictured him in his 70s or 80s. I'm glad i did, I don't think I could have pictured him younger. One thing I enjoyed and related to were his quirks. My son has Aspergers, and it was kind of nice to see a strange guy, with strange ways, get a nice girl and have a lovely life with her. THAT was my favorite part of the book. I don't think Ove was so much a curmudgeon as a guy with a \"different\" way of viewing how things should be in the world. Ove was totally an Aspie, not a carmudgeon. I think the writer was mistaken in using that word to define him. Stefanie",
