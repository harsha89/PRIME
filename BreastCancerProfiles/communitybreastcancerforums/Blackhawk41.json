Was walking decent distances by end of first week. Found out my margins weren\u2019t all clear and had my second surgery this past Wednesday (exactly 2 weeks apart). Again, felt good next day. Not much pain but took Tylenol to stay ahead of it. Can\u2019t take norcotics die to making me wired and too loopy. By the second night started feeling a pressure and heavy feeling with some sharp random pains at site. Surgeon used same incision site for 2nd excision. I had a few spots of blood? showing up on my soft ice packs and wondered if anyone has had this happen. I\u2019m completely glued with internal sutures and have taken one shower so far. Maybe I did too much the first day after? I\u2019ve been laying around most of today as gravity doesn\u2019t seem to be my friend. Icing still since surgery on Wednesday. Tight supportive post surgical bra. Also developed a rash around lymph node site from what appears to be what they used to clean the site during second surgery. Thoughts or suggestions appreciated. Not so patiently waiting on pathologyfor clear margins as well.
