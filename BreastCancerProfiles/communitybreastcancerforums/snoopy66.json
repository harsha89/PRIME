I'll let you know what my doc says after my biopsy and post op.  Wow, I am just so thankful for this site and to be able to ask questions and interact with everyone as we wait.  I have two kids, my husband and I decided not to share anything until we know exactly what the deal is.  It's so hard though, very close to them (both teenagers, one in college many hours out of state), they can read me like a book, so trying to hide my worry and mood swings is actually the hardest part right now!",

The surgeon described the area of concern to be smaller than a finger tip.  Should I have asked for the write up?  I do trust the surgeon, she only does breast surgery and comes highly regarded. No family history or personal history. The waiting is difficult for sure.",
