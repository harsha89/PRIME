    "Content": "Tamara21 wrote: Im twenty years old and today I was studying and felt a weird pinching from the inside of my right breast. I never felt this kind of pain before. It was off an on all day and when I touch the area it hurts. My breast were already tender, this happens before my menstrual cycle. I was on Google trying to find out what the pain was and was very nervous when all that popped up was Breast Cancer. I'm going to schedule a breast examination tomorrow. This is also scary for me because a family friend just found out she had breast cancer and had to have surgery. I'm just so nervous. I spoke to my boyfriend about it and he said I should go to the doctor and get it checked out. My mom said my breast are probably growing but I never had this pain and out of no wherr. I tried feeling for a lump but I can't tell. I pray everything is alright. Log in to post a reply",
