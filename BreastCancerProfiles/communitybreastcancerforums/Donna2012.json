To be honest I am very happy with this. I could not stand the total emotional turmoil I would be under, going in for scans. If I should have any symptoms, I will get tested then. I will know about a recurrence before they will. Going in for office visits are not stressful for me because If I feel good (which I always have), I cannot receive \"bad\" news.",

My hair thinned on taxol, but I didn't lose it all until I started FEC. The strange thing was that just before the 3rd FEC it began to grow back! That was a big surprise! FEC was much harder for me than taxol. I felt very sick for a couple of days - never actually threw up. The plus side was I did not have to go back for 3 weeks & began to feel good after the 1st week. So, I guess I had 1 bad week & 2 good ones each treatment. Looking back now, I can say it wasn't so bad - but at the time it was just something that I did what I had to, to get it done with.",
