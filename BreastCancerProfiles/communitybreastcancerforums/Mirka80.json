My mom, living in Czech Republic is stage IV with peritonei carcinomatosis, probably spread from breast after 10 years of NED. She is on faslodex.for 3 years only. It seems that there will be some progression as TM are growing. We still wait hovewer there is only one option to follow -chemo. Ibrance is not yet approved by insurance companies i our country. She is ER+ PR+ HER -. I expect that this private clinic is not for free or how did you get there for cure? It is suitable for any pacient? We have a meeting with MO in 2 weeks and we will see next step. I am searching for any opportunity.",
