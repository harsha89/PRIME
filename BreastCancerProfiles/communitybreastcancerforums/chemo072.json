I thought perhaps it was other meds (e.g. ibuprofen for rads burn).  But this morning I haven't taken any meds yet, and I'm stil queasy.  My tummy is beginning to feel more and more like it did on chemo, and I'm wondering if maybe rads somehow \"brings back\" the chemo SE? How long does the chemo (A/C +taxol) take to really get out of our bodies anyways?   I'm wondering if my body was in the process of getting it out, detoxing, and then if the rads stopped that process?  Log in to post a reply",

Healthwell, Patient Access Network and the CoPay relief fund of the Patient Advocate Foundation are all big foundations, but maybe some of them could help.  Links are on my blog. Also, your hospital or docs may know of a private foundation that could help.  I'll go looking for sources for metastatic cancer care for you.  Seems like if there are make-a-wish type options for women with mets that that could perhaps be turned into fiscal help.   SSDI sounds like a good option as well.  Also, my local county income tax forgave various fees.   re: fed taxes, maybe prep those now (or take it all to HR Block and let them do it) and file Jan 1 and get money back?  It's not that far away and it could help.  Or if you have paychecks coming in at all, to stop withholding fed. taxes.  Stopgap I know, but that's what you need right now. ",

And their optometrists were top notch.  And I miss my cardiology doc there too, lots.  But for cancer care, I think it just takes more flexibility and more options for docs than an HMO can provide.Just my two cents. Though, to their credit, they did pay in full for a PET Scan and a bilateral MRI with 2 biopsies at EPIC.  Hope you have better luck at the teaching hospital, and I'm just shocked that your breast surgeon didn't go over the whole positive margins issue with you.  That seems like malpractice to me. Are you going to court??  BTW, even when I was with Kaiser, I did get a 2nd opinion outside of Kaiser, and that was how I found the breast surgeon within Kaiser that I absolutely loved.  Funny that no one within Kaiser could refer me to her, but when I pulled strings outside of Kaiser, I got in with her and it made all the difference in the world.  She actually operates out of Providence, which was news to me when I discovered her.   The thing about an HMO - the right hand doesn't always know what the left is doing.  And they don't know about all the resources available within the system. ",

There's also a young survivors group in my city, and meeting face to face makes a huge difference.  For instance, when I was freaked out about getting a port, all I had to do was mention it and 5 women bared their port scars immediately.  Made it much, much easier to get mine.   You're lucky being in medical school, it means that you have an interest in medicine already, and being able to deal well with medical information makes a big difference, at least in my experience. How to get through, well, you do what you have to do to live to be a ripe old age :) get all the tests and screening you can make decisions at your own pace - yes, it is urgent to get treated, but a week or two delay here and there isn't the end of the world do what's right for YOU  have friends and or family come to appts with you, so that they can listen, because there's a certain amount of denial and lack of comprehension of info. that's natural  one day at a time, one hour at a time, one step at a time get the insurance and fiscal stuff lined up - my blog has a lot of info. on that for me, finances were a stretch i wasn't able to work much during chemo, some people do same for rads the people that you expect to be there for you may not be, but others will come out of the woodwork so ask for help widely asking for help was the hardest lesson...I think being single I'd learned to be really independent, and accepting help was HARD..but oh so necessary you can't go it alone i set up different sets of friends for every chemo appt, to stay for 2 - 4 days  - mostly those were friends from out of town i saved the in-town friends for the rest of the days it took me 10 days to recover from ea. chemo which left me 3 frantic days to get everything done before the next round eeks eat your favorite foods now and then don't touch them during chemo i think that i never want to see earl grey or pez again as long as i live BTW, pez are great to have in the mouth during port flushes (it makes the mouth taste icky) canned peaches were good during chemo what else, ask all the questions you want do you even have to go through chemo?  hope things go well and that this phase of your life will be a distant memory as you wrap up medical school and complete the rest of your dreams... ",

Women who already have had breast cancer have only a moderate risk of a recurrence and are not necessarily candidates for MRI, Saslow said. The reason is that MRI is expensive -- $1,000 to $1,500 per scan -- and has a high rate of false positives, meaning it detects lesions that are harmless.\" I have an intense family history of cacner, I had a tumor show up on a mammogram, I was 39, and even my HMO, the most conservative of spenders, sent me for an MRI.  Which yielded 2 false positives and so I had 2 biopsies that thankfully turned out benign.  But the MRI image was crucial in my decision making to have a mastectomy - I could see not only the main tumor  (IDC) but the DCIS wrapped around it and scattershot throughout the whole breast. That all said, as part of my young survivors group, the rule we've all arrived at given many harrowing stories of being pushed off because we are \"young\" is - if it's lump, get a biopsy.    For young women, breast tissue can be dense and hard to see with a mammogram. U/S helps, but MRI shows everything.  If the biopsy is positive, then an MRI will more than likely be approved. ",

I think that tomorrow at my last rads appt I will insist on a referral for an EKG. Also, I've talked to 2 nurses and 2 docs about various aspects of this already, with no movement.  A while back with my HMO I had a false (?) alarm with a BNP blood lab that was off the charts and was assigned a cardiologist, who ordered an echo that proved that my heart was just fine.  The lab result wasn't replicable the next day, so we assumed it as a lab error.  But the reason for this small story is that at my HMO I was assigned a cardiologist, and he was amazingly helpful - called me at home even, and his cardiology nurse was top notch.  With my PPO I don't have a cardiologist, because for whatever reason (probably the normal echo pre-chemo) I can't get my docs to take my cardio. concerns seriously....but I just have this feeling.  I asked for a post-chemo echo and my onc. said no.  That was however, in August.  So, how to be heard on this one??  I've tried.  Could call my primary care doc I suppose.  After a while I get so tired of being an advocate for myself. Have laid off the meds, sugar and caffeine this weekend and the whole heart palpitation thing got better.   ",

The mastectomy surgery included a sentinel node biopsy, and indeed cancer was found in 1 node.  1 bastard node.  Plus it burst - extranodal extension.  Hence all the hassle of chemo and radiation. If I had had just IDC and NO DCIS, I would have gone for chemo first, with the hope of preserving the breast.  And then lumpectomy + sentinel node biopsy. Not having a breast is a painful hassle.  And I haven't gone the reconstruction route because I just had rads and have to wait 6 months.  Women who have had what I had but were able to have lumpectomies, and then had chemo and rads - they're done with treatment now.  And I still have reconstruction to go, which is no easy path. Oh, also, at first I was told the IDC was 3 cm (it looked that way on screening) + DCIS was 5 cm.  It turned out that the IDC itself was 1.9 cm, and with 1 node, that put me into the stage 2 category.  Sorry for the small tome!  Hope I answered your question. Also, re: freaking out - I worry and wonder before I have info. because I think that question generation process is really important - we have a family theory that it's the question that we don't ask that will get us - hope that made sense! - but I don't really cross the freaking-out bridge until I have the data in hand that indeed I will need to cross that bridge.  One thing you might consider is to get the BRCA genetic testing process going, because if you end up BRCA positive that may (or may not) sway you to go the mastectomy route.   Personally, I think the least invasive surgery the better.  The body is never the same afterwards. Big hugs to you,  and to your sister - hope her's turns out b9!! Let us know how things go! ",

Personally, what got me through was assembling a stellar medical team.  I spent my energy collecting data (all the tests I could get) and people, those friend and family who were willing to get in their with me to digest the medical data, and the medical professionals that were charged with keeping me alive.  If I didn't feel one was going to do the best possible job for me, I went on to the next.  For me, it was all about the team.  Breast surgeon (first order of business), oncologist (2nd order), breast cancer social worker (3rd, my finances were hard hit by this), cancer therapist (at the cancer center), gynecological oncologist, psychiatrist.  The pieces that you may have in place already: primary care provider, naturopath.  I found that my naturopath's recommendations to various docs were gold when it came down to it.  But then again my naturopath specializes in womens health.  A primary care provider who is worth her salt could provide the same referral.  Furthermore, those two helped get me in with the breast surgeon and oncologists that I finally went with.  It's all an insider who-knows-who sort of system, in both HMO and PPO land.  A call from me got me an appt in 4 weeks, a call from a doc to a doc got me an appt in 2 days.  Make friends with your good docs, ask for their help, and get the referrals you need.  And if a doc doesn't sit well with you gut-level wise, keep on looking.  I personally need to interview 3 docs in each specialty before I can make a decision, it's just how I am. Also, the friends and family who were too distraught to be helpful, they went on hold - or into diversionary but helpful strategies: organize food deliveries, organize housecleaning, but lordy oh lordy don't bother me while I'm trying to make medical decisions that may save me life.  They either help or they're out of here.  Anyways, good luck.  The few weeks after diagnosis were the most harrowing in my life.  I never knew from the time I woke up to the time I went to bed what the day was going to hold.  I lost 20 pounds all told. And, don't go to appts by yourself - take someone with you to take notes, because it's too much to absorb yourself. Take care and let us know how it goes. ",

Off to learn about heart issues in young women and keep on keeping on on this issue.  Bottom line, I want a cardiologist, but feel like I'm banging my head against a wall... But thank you for your tips!  I will check into the patient advocacy options through my social worker after I exhaust conversations with my medical oncologist and primary care provider. Today however I'm dealing with radiation burn pain and that's my focus for the day.  Lots of protein, lots of liquids, and morphine seem to be the way of it today.  One day at a time....and this too shall pass.... ",

Plus anesthesia, surgery etc.  it's a serious risk.  (stroke, complications, etc.)  Does the tumor hurt your mom right now?  Mine didn't hurt until it was biopsied, and then it started hurting and didn't stop, and I couldn't wait to get it out.  I agree, maybe a mast. without the lymph node dissection would be ok - the mast took several weeks to recover from, but it was preferable to that tumor hurting.... sheesh, what a hard decision.   prayers and hugs for your mom, ",
