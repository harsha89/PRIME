I decided to do a double mastectomy with reconstruction becuase it would be the least amount of surgeries. They had enough skin to do this but if they didn't I would have had to do skin extenders and then have the implants put in later. I asked my surgical doctor if I was going to need a port before my DM and she said no. My Onc. doctor told me I need it. I just had it put in Wed. It hurts a lot but nothing like my first surgery. I start Chemo Aug 30th so I will try to tell you what it is like. Scared and nervous but so ready for it!!! I want to get it over with! Oh, and the pain from the first surgery gets less and less each day. I still have pain under my arms but it isn't at any degree to what it was. Megan ",

I have strange things happening too where I wake up and my whole hand and arm up to my elbow is numb. I have also been having stomach pain and burning on my arms. I don't think it is the cancer though. They cut through a lot of nerves when they do surgery and the body reacts to it differently. I am having either constipation or diarrhea...nothing normal which I was told is because of the pain meds and my being upset over everything. My doctor told me that in the night is when we are less distracted and that is why I feel more pain then. Maybe this is the same for you? I hope you feel better soon. I go to the doctors next week also to find out when chemo starts.",

They sent me immediately to a general surgeon. Because cancer runs in my family so heavily I told them that I wanted a double mastectomy but reconstruction at the same time. These are the issues that I experienced: 1) Getting my general surgeon and my plastic surgeon's schedule to match up for the surgery was difficult. My cancer is triple negative and fast growing so this was big issue. I actually had a different general surgeon step in because of this. 2) With the reconstruction part there are so many decisions to make I felt very overwhelmed. My plastic surgeon said I was a candidate for this technique called the Bostwick technique where they cut you lower on the breast causing less scaring. I was breastfeeding at the time so my skin was more stretched out than how it normally is. I was a C cup before I got pregnant and felt going back to a C would be great if possible. I told him though if it had to be smaller it was okay. My other option was to do the skin extenders which stretch your skin and then once you have gone through all the stretching -which everyone tells me is very painful- then you have surgery to remove the extenders and they put in the implants. He did tell me about the TRAM but my thinking was that I didn't want more area in my body hurting. It is bad enough with the chest area but the stomach too would be really hard. I had a C-Section with my son just a year ago and I just couldn't think of dealing with that and the chest/arm pain. 3) Then you have to consider what type of implant. I chose the silicone implants because they seem to feel more like they are like breast tissue and I think they will keep the shape better. But with all the scares of what will happen if they fail, etc. I was totally freaked out. My husband and I did a lot of research to where I felt comfortable enough to go with them. I just had the double mastectomy last Tuesday, July 27th, with reconstruction. Was in the hospital 2 days. Came home on my son's first B-day. :-) Everything is great and the reconstruction is amazing!!! Both my grandmother and mom had Breast Cancer and they have so many scars. I am not joking when I say I actually might be able to where a two piece and no one would know I have cancer. Well....obviously, not right now. Oh BTW, my cancer doubled in size from July 13th from 2.8cm to 4.5 cm. Get the stuff out of you as quickly as possible!!! I feel so lucky that I was able to get it out 2 weeks later. Now chemo ahead but at least no big tumor taking over. I hope you are able to figure out what you want done soon. It is such a personal decision and it is like you want more time but there is only so much. Just go with your gut. Oh and once you make a decision stick with it. Don't go back and try to change it around. I almost did this and got myself all worked up and upset. Best of luck to you!!",
