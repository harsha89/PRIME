I just am starting to heal from the reduction/revision and it is hard to think of Masectomys now, but I think I will have to see what oncologist says.",

My oncologist said it was always there before, no never had any indication it was there on numerous mammosite, ultrasounds, and even MRI. Not sure what it was never seen before on all the tests. My onc said that it was not on the original biopsy because they were dealing with actual invasive tumor. Second options maybe in my future. First I need to heal from this reductions/lift/revisions on both breasts.",

Took hormone therapy for 7 years. Now I get pathology back and have been told I have atypical lobular hyploplasia in left and atypical ductal hypoplasia in right Breast severe. I'm so confused , I have never even heard of ADL ADH/ ALH before today. BS wants to confer with my oncologist to see about going back on aromas in or tamifen. If I had known about this I would of just had bilateral Mx a week ago instead of revision and reduction. I am still recovering from this surgery and it hasn't been easy. Any advise would be appreciated.",

But since I already had invasive BC 8 years ago and had treatments including aromas in for 7 years that I should not worry about this. He said I should be glad with all the tissue removed almost 2 lbs that he was happy no cancer or DCIS was found. So for now he suggested I go back on Aromasin if I can tolerate just to relieve my anxiety. But the real issue he said and I have known for 8 years and have lived with it is if the original BC comes back at that point it is a game changer. He ska I have more than likely always had this atypical hyperplasia and that is why I got it in the 1st place. I do not have the BRAC gene and no one I know ever had BC from my family. So no PMX for me and just go on living. PMX doesn't help survival rates if you have had BC. And stay as vigilant as before with breast surgeon visits 2x a year and 3 d mammograms",
