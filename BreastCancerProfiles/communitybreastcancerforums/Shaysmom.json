That only means there is an inflammation in your body and is more indicitative of lyme disease. I was dxed with lobular breast cancer so I had a thickened area not a true lump but I had just had a baby so they thought it was from that.  Since then except for anemia that I have always had everything is normal with bloodwork. I have had mets for 7 years. Stable from 10/01 until 11/09.  ",
