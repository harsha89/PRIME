I'm sorry you are having so many side effects from Femara.  Have you thought of trying another AI or Tamoxifen?  I am postmenapausal and tried Femara but couldn't tolerate the side effects.  My onc switched me to Tamoxifen.  I was doing pretty well on it but now have insomnia so he may switch me again if we can't get the insomnia under control.  If your onc doesn't feel you should switch have you thought about talking to him about an antidepressant? I hope others with postives nodes that have not had chemo will post.  I do think there are many of us. My best to you. Jacqui",

As far as I know the following from Breastcancer.org is still the standard used to determine whether or not chemo is given using the Oncotype Test:Interpreting the results: When the Oncotype DX test is complete, your doctor will receive a report that includes your Recurrence Score. You and your doctor can use the following ranges to interpret your results: I do think it is a very personal decision whether or not to have chemo and each person has to decide for themselves based on whether information they have at the time. I'm glad your chemo is going well. My best to you. Jacqui",

I've been putting Cortaid on it and it seems to help but am wondering what is causing it.  I crochet and wonder if it could be my arm rubbing against the yarn.  I also volunteer with Friends of the Library and wonder if it could be contact with something on some of the donated books.  It's not painful.  I wore my sleeve day for the second time today and when I took it off I had the rash but don't think it's that because I've have it happen before I starting wearing the sleeve. Thanks in advance.  Jacqui  Dx 6/19/2009, IDC, 1cm, Stage IIA, Grade 2, 2/22 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
