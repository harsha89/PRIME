First couple days weee ok and then I felt like I got hit my a truck. Cramping and so much muscle and bone pain. On day 7 I spiked a fever and had to be in the hospital for 2 days on antibiotics since my blood count was almost nothing. Since I\u2019ve been home i have felt almost normal then I try and do normal things and feel so so tired. At this rate I should feel like myself just in time for chemo next week. My hair still hasn\u2019t fallen out but it\u2019s super sensitive sometimes- wonder when it\u2019s going to happen. Tomorrow is day 14 so I\u2019m guessing anytime now I\u2019m going to run my head and it\u2019s just going to come out in my hand. Tomorrow is my first day since my dmx and chemo that I have no help- fingers crossed I\u2019m able to take care of little kidlets ok.",

Found out a few days ago that I start chemo on 11/28. I am doing 4 rounds of T+C as right now, that may be upped to 6 depending on the lymph node pathology. I am a bit nervous on how this is going to hot me as I have 3 little ones 7 and under, and of course not sure how I will keep my immune system up with all the colds etc coming into the house from them. I've done the chemo things before almost 20 years ago, had AC, methotrexate and cisplatin and they hit me really hard. Hoping this time it's not as bad. My partner is amazing but I think he s overly optimistic on how I'm going to feel. Happy to have a safe place.",

Blair2- I was also on the shot and it didn\u2019t work at all! Not sure what the plan is for next chemo. There is talk of either a lower does of taxotere or of increase the amount is the shot. I just got the kids ready for school and my energy is gone. It\u2019s going to be a long day.",

My Aunt is coming in from out of town the day before I start chemo. My partner is also great and his company is pretty understanding of whats going on. Plus lots of people offering meals etc Im going to see about starting my 2 younger ones in daycare twice a week so I can just rest and I don't have to worry about asking for help. Found out lymph nodes are all clear! Will only need 4 rounds and no port.",
