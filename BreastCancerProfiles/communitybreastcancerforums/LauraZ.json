Being a nurse can either work for you or against you when you are diagnosed with an illness, but overall, I think it is to your benefit.  It has made me become a stronger advocate for my patients, especially in coordination of care and navigating the healthcare system. As a patient I found that going in with a list of questions and concerns works best.  That way I can jot down physician responses and make sure all my questions get answered.  It also helps to have someone else with you - 2 sets of ears are always better than 1.  I am part of a research study comparing taxol to AC treatment in early stage BC, and I have found that the research nurse has been a fantastic source of knowledge and advocacy on my behalf also.",

Kneece, RN, OCN.  My husband found it helpful.  Good luck on your surgery.",
