And yes, once I started raising a stink...they stuck together and I do not feel I have received the best care! I started having a lot of pain under my arm and a large lump formed. I started going in and complaining about this lump 6 months ago. PA told me it was a dogs ear. Surgeon told me it was nothing and it could be fixed when I had my next mastectomy. No one even touched it. Finally went to a follow up with my oncologist and he felt it. Said he has never seen anything like it, it is hard as a rock and has to come out. I finally demanded an ultra sound and that Dr removed a large syringe of blood. I have had no calls or follow up on what, how, or why! I have an appointment today for a nurse visit! Thanks for let me rave about this but I'm with the rest of you! Upset and discouraged! Ja",

I was called back for an mammo, ultra sound, then byopsy. I could tell the Dr doing the byopsy knew it wasn't good. He said it was possibly a slow growing cancer. I asked when my last mammo was and he said January 2015, so almost 2 years. Then told me he could see it in my last mammo! What?? I've had this cancer for 2 years because no one called it! In the 2015 mammo it was 4.4 mm and non invasive, in 2016 it was 1.5 cm and invasive. Let me tell you, they called me the next day and scheduled an appointment with my surgeon 2 days later. He thought he could do a lumpectomy with radiation. I decided to have a mastectomy and wanted a complete but they wanted to do the surgery in 2 weeks. Although, when he did not nit know that it was a 1.5 until surgery and never told me. I found it in my path report! He told me he removed 2 limp nodes and the path report said 3 put in separate containers. I ask him about this and he said I thought I removed 2. Is that possible?? I have found it very hard to trust my Dr's .....it's very scary! My insurance is a HMO organization! I'm so glad to find this topic! Jan  ",

Surgeon and PA said it was just a dog ear. In August, my oncologist felt it and said it was hard as a rock and had to come out. I called my surgeon and told him I wanted an ultra sound. That was in August. The Dr drained a large syringe of blood from the hematoma. But no one has explained to me if it should be if concern? I have not had an appointment yet. Going to nurse visit this afternoon. Thanks for any information you may have! Jan Log in to post a reply",
