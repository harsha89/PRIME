    "Content": "Bjbj wrote: I am in the middle of a course of chemo of CMF, Once every 3 weeks for 8 rounds. The first three they used a typical protocol of mixing the steroid / anti nausea drug in the saline and given thru Iv before the actual chemo meds. Then due to saline shortage because of disaster in Puerto Rico they give less saline and do not put the steroid med in the saline. Instead, they give a little saline then do a \u201cpush\u201d meaning a syringe into the iv line. Has anyone experienced this? Does anyone know how this affects the drugs or side effects? From online reaseachbit seems the \u201cpush\u201d is a bit more dangerous to the veins. And does the mrs work the same? I do not trust the circular answer my so called top dr gave me. I also do not understand why this is not in the news ever single day as a headline. Log in to post a reply",
