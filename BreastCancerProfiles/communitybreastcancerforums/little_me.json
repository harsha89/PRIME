I can see a slight assymmetry in the mirror now (upper outer quadrant) and it has never been tender or hot/red. The lump in my arm has been there for around 6 months, it is relatively close to the skin but is probably 1cm deep and has never been tender or decreased in size. The doctor wasn't able to tell if it was a Lymph node for sure or not. Ultrasound and Mammogram on Tuesday. I have a family history of early onset breast cancer but I am only 27 (so I know the odds are in my favour). Just wanting some info to calm my nerves as it doesn't seem to fit with Fibrocystic changes. Log in to post a reply",

It was different to what I thought as well (and I have studied genetics at university level but not breast cancer specifically), I felt like challenging her on it but there's no point doing so as she was concerned anyway. I don't have an appointment yet as I've only just seen the dr. I have to wait for an appointment time to be sent to me; I wish I knew how long it would take but that's more country specific!",

      "Content": "little_me wrote: Hi everyone, I have just been refered for a ultrasound and mammogram to check for cancer I have either an abcess or swollen lymph node in my armpit that has begun to pull the skin beside it (it is painless and I have done a course of antibiotics). The doctor also felt the muscle on the upper outside of my breast felt like there was a thickness to it that was long and flat (please excuse my poor descriptive skills!). I'm only in my late 20's so I'm thankful the odds are greatly in my favour in terms of this being nothing to worry about but I mentioned to her that I had a paternal aunt that was diagnosed in her 30's and passed away and she said that it was only the maternal side that carried any importance. Can anyone here clarify? It's hard to find anything relevant online. So does anyone know what would cause the thickness in the muscle (or under it) -benign or not. And has anyone had a painless abcess for a few months? Thankyou for you time, just trying to quiet my mind while I wait for an appointment! Log in to post a reply",

When I first felt a thickening it was only a 1-2cm across, now the thickened area measures around 10 by 6cm, it's probably doubled every 6 weeks. I'm glad I have had study, kids and work to keep my mind off it as it is pretty concerning not knowing what is causing it. Bring on B9 !!!",

In the meantime I've just thought to myself that cancer doesn't change quickly and I am IN the system and along for the ride (where-ever it leaves me). I found keeping busy was the best cure for feeling anxious.",

As most lumps, bumps and thickenings are benign this thread is for those who have used this site and are now free of concern due to B9 results. (YAY!). If you could please post a short blurb about what you could feel/what was seen and your journey before getting your results. Hopefully the mods will pin this for us. I'll start. 27 + family history. I had a possible enlarged lymph node that hadn't responded after antibiotics. I found an area of thickness on the axillary tail of the breast on the same side. The dr. refered me for an ultrasound and they detected a cyst and benign breast changes. Thankyou to everyone on the site. Best wishes for the future. Log in to post a reply",
