It showed up when I went for my annual diagnostic mammogram. They did the ultrasound guided biopsy, which really looked bad. We were pretty sure it was cancer even before we got the path report back. What we didn't know, and wouldn't know until the surgery, was whether it was a mass or a lymph node. It turned out to be lymph node \u2014 the cancer had completely replaced the lymph in the node. It was in the axilla. I had had a PET scan earlier, and also had an MRI ",

I\u2019d been getting my mammograms there for about 10-12 years when they discovered my BC in a routine mammogram. Doctors, nurses, staff, all wonderful. They are used to dealing with people who come in from all over the world. I did my radiation at the Greenspring campus. Go to their website or look up johns hopkins breast cancer and go from there. Or try the ask an expert johns hopkins breast cancer site. Search for Lillie Shockley. I\u2019m not sure if I spelled her name correctly.",
