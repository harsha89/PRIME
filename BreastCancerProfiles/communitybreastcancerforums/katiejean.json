    "Content": "Feb 25, 2012 12:36AM - edited Feb 25, 2012 12:40AM by katiejean First of all let me say I am so very sorry to read about so many of you suffering so much from mastectomy pain/nerve damage. Just when I think I'm going nuts with little twinges and weird feelings I get online looking for answers and find not only am I not alone, but sadly there are situations much worse than mine and I need to be thankful for what I have/do not have. My sincere compassions are extended to you all! As you can see from my siggy, I am nearly 8 years out from my surgery and although it has not been a walk in the park it has not been unbearable. I do remember feeling like a mac truck had hit me upon awakening from surgery. And an idiot cna had the nerve to ask me \"what happened to me?\" I had the mental capacity to roar (somewhat weakly I might add) \"WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT HAPPENED TO ME? Can you not read my chart? I got hit by a damn truck! Ripped my boob off!\" Hahahahaha....needless to say, that poor cna got assigned to another patient. Hehe.... Anyway, after that I did stay on some pain meds but I can't to Morphine or any of it's derivatives so I weaned off rather quickly. Maybe a week at the most. The drains were el yucko. But once I could take a shower I was very religious about doing the stretching exercises my surgeon had instructed me to do. He was very pleased with my range of motion. I never took any meds again after that initial week. I really had no sensation at all in the area until more recently. I couldn't feel anything-every once in awhile a weird itch or tingle but nothing drastic. Every now and then (like every few months) I will get a charley horse type cramp that seizes up the area. It hurts like hell. But it goes away just like any type of cramp. I used to get some odd shooting pains throughout the area but I don't anymore. I workout a lot (although I have never been able to shed the extra 20lbs I put on during chemo to save my neck but that's another topic) But when I do push ups I am very very weak and ohhhhh the pain later is very intense. But I want so badly to strengthen those muscles! I havent had reconstruction and want to very badly but want to be in good shape to do it. I am very scared about that but that too is another topic. Recently, I've developed a different pain near my mastectomy scar. It's closer to the middle and it's just a pulling type sensation. I've been doing more upper body weight lifting and I'm wondering if it isn't that cording or something that has been discussed here. I tend to develop very thick scar tissue anywhere my body is cut/wounded and I wonder if that is what it is. I am deathly afraid of a scar recurrence. Since the feeling is close to the middle of my chest-on the end of the scar, not close to the original tumor at all, I'm wondering if maybe the nerve endings are healing slowly and allowing me to feel more of the tightness than I did before. When I touch the area I still cannot feel anything it's like touching someone else. It's all very weird and I hate it. But I am thankful to be alive so I deal with it. I will post my recon questions and fears somewhere else but I wanted to let anyone know going through this that it does get better with time, but never truly goes away. I'm sorry I'm rather rambly...you all will have to forgive me as I'm digging up memories to share since my surgery was so long ago. I also wanted to mention when I'm pms-ing and my goodie boob hurts from hormones the mastectomy area aches then too. And also when the weather changes, the whole area aches. And in winter when it's cold I feel achey but luckily here where I live it's not unbearable. That fat injecting procedure sounds marvelous! I have lots to spare! And I am so afraid of surgery again.....",
