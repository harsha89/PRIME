Then July was crazy - back once again to full-time work and cancer diagnosis all if a few short weeks. Then I had thoracic surgery in Sept to remove a hot lymph node under my sternum. I am still recovering from that surgery - sneezing brings tears to my eyes. So, Z and all of you have inspired me. I got really good PET scan results the other day and know that the time is now. That being said, right now, we are getting in the car to go 350+ miles to visit my sister in Baltimore. I hope to work this year of flexibility, weight management, and stamina. Kudo all around! ",

What a body of work and how kind of you to share your time and talents in this way! I mentioned on the Ibrance thread that I am comforted and confident with more information. I also mentioned that I am trying to recreate - 23 years later - all that helped me cope well. One of thing that I really relied on was a local support group. So, I found a new one and signed up for a meeting. I didn't go. In the eight weeks since my diagnosis, I have had to counsel several survivors and the friends & family of survivors in regard to how this could happen. I was the poster child (well, old lady) for survivorship! My MO actually said to me - 'what sucks about this Peg is that you are now going to have to support all the people who are falling about because YOU have cancer!' I just couldn't go to that support group and see the fear reflected on the \"young\" survivors. Even though I am really doing well!!! Anyway, this group has already helped so very much! Anne, your document is so valuable and very much appreciated!",
