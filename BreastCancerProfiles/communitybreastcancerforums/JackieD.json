At that time all I can think about was oh my, I might have cancer, so on the day I had my biopsy scheduled I sat in my car instead of going inside, I told myself what I dont know wont hurt me (Dumb move on my part) Well this year I notice a lump in my armpit and you can actually see it and feel how hard it is. I blow it off again. It wasnt until a friend got the same thing and went to get her's biopsy and got her result, that finally made me go back.. When I went back they had found that the lump I was ignoring has gotten bigger, and instead of one solid and hard lump in my armpit I have two..I am scheduled tomorrow for my biopsy and this time my husband said he is going so I dont run...I have been in a roller coaster ride of emotion this week just waiting to get this biopsy, I feel like I will be even worse when it's done and the waiting begins..I'm a mess, I cry then, then I tell myself I am going to be fine, then I start crying again. I feel like I'm going out of my mind with worry. I'm trying to be positive but my mind can't stop going to what if's....Then I feel like I cant breath...  Log in to post a reply",

My doctor was very upset that the procedure she has asked to be done was not followed. I am very thankful that my doctor understand, that I need a peace of mind and she promised me that she would never send anyone to that horrible place again. I'm praying and hoping that when test is run on the solid mass, that it will come back as benign. I'm actually feeling positive that it will and I will keep thinking positive that it will be. I am so glad I found this place, everybody has been positive and kind, and I will keep what everybody said here in my heart and mind, that 80% percent of lumps and biopsy come back as benign. I will keep you all in my prayers and let you all know the result. Thank you so much. ",

She told me that she thinks I just have a Fibroadenoma, I dont even know what that is? and base on my age and family, my risk factor for having breast cancer was low so she doesnt think I needed a biopsy or futher testing, I know what I feel, the cyst on my left breast hurts and it has gotten bigger, plus my regular doctor ordered this procedure done. What I couldnt understand is why couldnt she just do biopsy so I can have a peace of mind. She made me feel so stupid and that I'm overeacting. I dont know what questions to ask? I dont know much of anything about the breast? I'm so confussed I wish i knew more. Should I get a second opinion? ",

I have been making phone calls, and currently still waiting for a reply. I have an appointment with a breast specialist on September 9. I am still hurting, and I can't wear my bra it hurts too much..(any advice on how to ease the pain naturaly, would be very much appreciated) I'm not as scared though anymore, my anxiousness and fear has been replaced by determination and anger for age discrimination. I feel like this has to change, nobody deserve to be treated the way I was treated, I don't know what I can do to change this but I will try! Cancer doesn't age discriminate! Thank you all so much for the kind words and support. I will keep you all updated. ",
