Its been a few days since 1st infusion and she has acne like all over her chest up her neck and onto her face. Has anyone else experienced the same side effects? I've encouraged her to reach out to her oncology doctor to see if there is an antibioditic she can take, she also was on decadrone prior (a couple days) to first infusion and after a day, could it be steroid or is it chemo. Are there any soaps or washes that you can reccomend? Any help is greatly appreciated Mark Log in to post a reply",

My fiance is at the oncology center tommorrow with her therapist and was planning on stopping down to see oconlogy nurses to show them the rash. If the two of you have any other tips/suggestions/dealing withsideeffects with the TC regimen please pass them along. Did you find as you progressed from 2nd to 3rd to 4th infusion that the cummalitive effect was worse or was it pretty much the same as the first infusion? Thanks for taking the time to reply to my post Mark",
