My last mammagram was five years ago. I guess it wasn't there then. But this seems like such a long time. How will I ever get through chemo. Right now I weigh 86 pounds. I have no appetite and am living on ensure. I know chemo is tough on young people. How will I do it. Sometimes I think just let me go now, but I don't want to die.Plese if any of you know of any encouraging words about finding breast cancer after such a long time, please tell me.
