He also mentioned about scar tissue forming and that will lead to your eyes always tearing if you dont do anything.  Its not something  that happens to everyone and they have no idea why! Hope this was helpful - sorry for being so long-winded!",

I am currently in the Phase 3 trial of Palbo/Faslodex and have been for over a year. Before that I was on Arimidex for approx. two and a half years before I had progression! Babs very happy to hear that you got approved and my best wishes that it works well for you! Are you taking just Ibrance or is your Onc. giving you another drug with it?",
