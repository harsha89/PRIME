However I asked my internist to follow up with one before the third chemo because I realized it can cause damage to the heart. I am also walking as much as I can to prevent problems. Heart issues run in my family. My second AC wasn't great. I was more nauseous and my bladder was not working as well. I'm not sure why but I heard one of drugs is harder on the bladder. I went in for saline today to help rinse it out. I'm fine now. Drinking is very important. They told me to stop compazine and just take Zofran. Anyway. I feel much better today. Glad everyone is doing well.",

Insolvable make everything move faster through the intestines. Soluable softens it and slows it down. Miralax is great for softening. I'm taking it starting two days before treatment. I take steroids for three days with emend for two days. Walking on a treadmill has helped with nausea and constipation. So I'm not taking the zofran unless it's an emergency. Ativan works as to stop nausea so I take it instead.",

I had the doctor keep me on a pump while in the hospital. I hardly needed it. I will be doing radiation next. Will you be doing radiation after surgery?. Ella. You can have a blood clot or lymphodema. You will need to see your doctor asap. You need to go to a lymphodema specialist if you had your lymph nodes out. Ask your doctor for a prescription. They will massage the arm and make a sleeve for you.",
