She is always active and just doesn't understand my limitations right now. She and her husband returned after a month in Mexico, only to book an Alaskan cruise for yet another week. Her husband is a great guy who's been having a hard time with Fibro. If he doesn't travel with her, she'll go with another friend leaving him at home with a long list of to-do's. Whenever she and I speak, she tells me about all the things she's working on. Without being rude, how do I tell her to back off?",
