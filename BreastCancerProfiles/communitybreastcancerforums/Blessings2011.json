But yesterday I woke up with a very swollen uvula (the little hangy-downy thing in the back of the throat) and a killer sore throat. The doc swabbed for strep (turned out negative), and gave me a Z-Pack. Last night I was so congested I could hardly breathe, then the coughing started. I finally got up and took some Phenergan with Codeine cough syrup. That helped.  But waaaaaaa.....my BMX with immediate reconstruction is scheduled for Tuesday, November 8th. Any chance they'll go ahead and do the surgery? When I was coughing so hard last night, all I could think of was trying to do that with a bunch of stitches inside me! I'm so ready to get this show on the road - got my BC dx on 9.15.11, and the surgery has already been rescheduled once. Anyone else have this happen to them? Thanks, Ladies...

At first, I was disappointed, thinking that I didn't want to wait that long, but my husband reminded me that when I get this sick with upper respiratory stuff, it takes me forever to get well. So a December date is a good thing, I guess. My only fear had been the fact that I was initially diagnosed on September 15th. My first surgery date was to have been on Halloween, but there was a conflict in the two surgeons' schedules. Then I got sick right before my November 8th date. I just had this irrational fear that perhaps the cancer would not have spread to the lymph nodes prior to the October or November surgeries, but now....waiting until December, well.... I know, I know. For whatever reason, God had other plans for me, and now I just need to keep trusting in Him, and His timetable, not mine. So I've joined the December club! Is there a comprehensive list of December surgery dates somewhere?

      "Content": "Blessings2011 wrote: I hope I'm in the right place...and I apologize in advance if this is too long! I was diagnosed with DCIS/IDC on September 15, 2011. Two weeks earlier I had some spontaneous bleeding from my left nipple. After a series of mammograms, ultrasounds, ductograms, and two core-needle biopsies. The results showed two separate tumors: one 9 mm tumor that was basically DCIS, but with two areas of invasive cancer - one was 1.5 mm and the other was .5 mm. The second tumor was all DCIS. When I met with the breast surgeon, she offered me a lumpectomy, but cautioned that the distance between the tumors was great enough that it would leave the breast deformed. I let her know that because of my history, I had decided to have a bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. The odds are in my favor: the tumors are small (9mm and 6mm) and the invasive areas are very small;  it is in the early stage; the tissue is the cribriform type; it is HER/2/Neu negative, and estrogen-positive. I won't know about the lymph nodes until my surgery. My mom had breast cancer, and I guess I've always had it in the back of my mind that I might get it as well. She had a left mastectomy, with no additional treatment, at the age of 67. She passed two years ago at the age of 88, having lived cancer-free all the rest of her life. My faith will get me through this. A friend, who is also a survivor, told me that there were angels all along her path. I know I've already met some. The support here is amazing, and the attitude of \"pay it forward\" is awesome. I've been lurking on this site for some time - mostly reading all the posts about how to prepare for surgery - and now I have quite a list going! Thanks for reading this long saga. It's wonderful to be in the company of those who have gone before me. And my screen name? Blessings are what I am finding everywhere these days. Oh - almost forgot - my surgery date is Tuesday, November 8th.   Dx 9/15/2011, IDC, <1cm, Stage IA, Grade 2, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 12/5/2011 Lymph node removal: Left; Mastectomy: Left, Right; Reconstruction (left): Tissue expander placement; Reconstruction (right): Tissue expander placement Surgery 8/22/2012 Reconstruction (left); Reconstruction (right) Hormonal Therapy 9/5/2012 Arimidex (anastrozole) Hormonal Therapy 10/22/2013 Femara (letrozole) Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Blessings2011 wrote: Hi, everyone - I am a quilter, and I belong to two different groups who make \"comfort quilts\" for various local organizations. Quite a few of these quilts are donated to our local cancer centers and Oncology departments to be given out to patients undergoing chemo. They are all soft, 100% cotton, washable, and are usually backed with either fleece or flannel. The tops are colorful, pretty blocks in assorted designs. Most of them are lap quilts, and the biggest ones are maybe 40\" x 50\", depending on the individual quilter. What size blanket do you prefer? Just a lap throw, or something bigger that can cover you completely? (There was another thread on how one infusion center is making patients bring their own blankets now, because so many were stolen  but I didn't want to hijack that thread.) I was dx'd last September and had my BMX in December, but I didn't have chemo. All suggestions are welcome! Thanks!

She gave me back my life when it seemed like I was facing a lifetime of pain and dysfunction after my BMX and recon. Even though I don\u2019t have Lymphedema, we do discuss it during our sessions. One of the things I shared with her was how I had seen posts from women who do self-wrapping/bandaging of the extremities, and how there are not many Youtube videos out there that demonstrate this. (I think I found ONE video on the subject.) Julie agreed that making a video would help her new patients who wrap, and today she posted the video to her Facebook page. She gave me permission to share it here on BCO, in the hope that it might help someone who could use the information. If you would, please take a few minutes to watch and let me know if this helps you. Julie has no plans whatsoever to profit from this\u2026 she just has a passion and a heart for helping breast cancer patients. https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=660029994031337&set=vb.317886481579025&type=2&theater Dx 9/15/2011, IDC, <1cm, Stage IA, Grade 2, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 12/5/2011 Lymph node removal: Left; Mastectomy: Left, Right; Reconstruction (left): Tissue expander placement; Reconstruction (right): Tissue expander placement Surgery 8/22/2012 Reconstruction (left); Reconstruction (right) Hormonal Therapy 9/5/2012 Arimidex (anastrozole) Hormonal Therapy 10/22/2013 Femara (letrozole) Log in to post a reply",

Immediately after surgery, the right side looked pretty good, but Lefty looked like a small animal crawing over my shoulder. The PS (who I loved and respected) said it was fluid from all the pocket work he did during Exchange, and \"maybe it will reabsorb into your body\" at some point in the future. It didn't. I also never lost that \"Iron Bra\" feeling. Having been stitched internally from stem to stern during Exchange, I woke up feeling like I still had TEs in. That  tightness never went away, and all the PS said was \"give it time.\" He couldn't promise that it would ever go away. The LE therapist I was referred to at the hospital could not help me at all, and the incredibly expensive compression garments she ordered for me were useless.  Then I met my wonderful, awesome new therapist - Julie - who took the time to really listen to me, to review my surgical reports, and to look me in the eye and say \"I can help you.\" It has been three weeks and nothing short of amazing the way I look and feel. (I have another post on here that describes in detail the work she is doing to resolve my issues.) The purpose of this post is not to advertise her services, but rather to offer another series of links to videos and articles that she feels are so important for women to understand. She tries to keep up with the latest research, and post something educational at least once a week. It's also to let other ladies know that sometimes we have to be persistent - and even aggressive - in pursuing relief and hope for our futures. https://www.facebook.com/TherapeuticTouchFresno Dx 9/15/2011, IDC, <1cm, Stage IA, Grade 2, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 12/5/2011 Lymph node removal: Left; Mastectomy: Left, Right; Reconstruction (left): Tissue expander placement; Reconstruction (right): Tissue expander placement Surgery 8/22/2012 Reconstruction (left); Reconstruction (right) Hormonal Therapy 9/5/2012 Arimidex (anastrozole) Hormonal Therapy 10/22/2013 Femara (letrozole) Log in to post a reply",
