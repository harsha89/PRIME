I recommend that you seeks some form of professional help to deal with your trauma. Most states have a crisis center that you can call who are able to provide you with resources. If you are really concerned about this lump then you need to see a doctor. You can ask for a nurse to be present during the exam. You have to remember that this doctor's touch is a theraputic touch to find out if this lump is cancer.",
