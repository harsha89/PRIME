Justme I have had cysts too through the years in the breasts and other parts of the body (one in my leg, one on my groin area - had those removed and currently have one in my lower back - been told those are hereditary and nothing major - my dad had them). The ones I had in my breasts were nothing but cysts that would get bigger or smaller around the time of my period. Back in the last 1990's had a hard lump in the right breast. Turned out to be just a fibroadenoma but it kept groing so had it cut out. No history of any cancer AT ALL in my family. Then last spring i felt a small lump.. figured it was just a cyst or another one of those firboademona tumors. The dr couldn't even feel it but send me for a mammo anyway. I was 38 years old at the time. The thought of breast cancer never crossed my mind either. Had another follow up mammo last June, sent for biopsy, turned out to be DCIS breast cancer. Had I not known my body and had listened to the dr who told me it was nothing since she couldn't feel it, I know it would have gotten worse before they finally sent me for a mammo at age 40. I was one of those better safe than sorry people, so glad I went. Good luck to you!",

That sucks\". That was it. I never expected much from her to begin with so I wasn't all that surprised. Needless to say for me it only reinforced the fact that she and I are not close. I have only seen her twice at holidays since everything and she says nothing about it. I really learned who to rely on and who to not count on when going through everything. Sorry you are having to go through it.",

I sort of had the same experience as you, and yes, that damn phone call from the dr that changed my life forever. But I agree with what many of the other posters have already stated. Catching it early is great. Doesn't mean the road ahead won't be rough but I know as much as it stunk having to go through it all I always considered myself lucky I caught mine as early as I did (and yes I am one of those no family history people but pushed the mammos eventhough I was late 30's). As someone posted earlier, once you have a PLAN it does help. You can only do so much so take it one step at a time. Be kind to yourself and get mad if you want to get mad, cry if you want to cry, and know that all of us here on the boards are here for you! Please keep us posted and you can message me on here anytime you want if there is anything I can help you with! Hugs from Texas.",
