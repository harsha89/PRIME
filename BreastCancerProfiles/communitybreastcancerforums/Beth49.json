So far; so good; 8:15 am treatment; then I go to work; X-rays once a week; Thursday is \"Doctor Day\".  Some skin discomfort; just keep using Aquaphor and Euricin.    I'm a lucky one, ILC caught early by my gyn (age 60).  Lumpectomy on June 30, will finish radiation Sept 30.  Oncotype Dx score = 12, so chemo wasn't on the table.  I was glad I didn't sign on to the Tailor Rx study.  Mammosite was an option, I really debated, but at the time I couldn't stand the thought of that catheter being inserted for a week.  Also, I thought the traditional radiation would cover a larger area (not that there's a very large area to cover! ) I've started generic Arimidex for 5 years; was worried about side effects, but so far they are manageable - some joint pain and maybe my hair is thinning, but that could be my imagination.  Already on Actonel for osteoporosis.  My heart goes out to the young gals;  I keep reminding my daugther to do self exams - I never did.....",
