Mammogram did not find anything. Ultra sound did not find any pathology, however, they say the lump that the doctor felt. She then proceeded to go to a specialist where she took a needle aspiration and results were not inconclusive. the specialist took a biopsy (day surgery). the found a typical cell in the duct. today is april 18th and she has a surgery to remove the lesion on April 25th. My wife is healthy and her sister and mother dont have cancer. Her grandfather died of prostate cancer. I have been reading a lot and I am not clear of what is next step. We have a consultation with the doctor one day before the surgery. any comments or help is much appreciated. We are in Toronto, Canada.",
