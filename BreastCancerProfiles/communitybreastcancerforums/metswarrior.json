How are you doing?  Have you heard from any other women dealing with Stage 4 and a pregnancy and birth? Best wishes, Metswarrior",

I have been on Herceptin, Zometa, Faslodex since 1/2005. I have been clean of disease since then. Last week I was diagnosed with mets to my lung. 4 small spots smaller than 1 cm. My treatment recommendations were to combine Herceptin with chemo (either Navelbine or a Taxane) or to take Lapatinib with Xeloda. I wanted to hear your stories and your treatment recommendations and why. I was also considering doing Herceptin, Lapatinib, Faslodex, Lupron/Zoladex. Has anyone tried that combination? Looking forward to your remarks. Sincerely, Dikla Log in to post a reply",

A year before her mets diagnosis she had Cytoxan and Taxotere for stage 1 breast cancer.  Her doctors recommend she have one more round of Xeloda and then start on Adriamycin and Cytoxan. She would especially like to speak with someone who has dealt with or is dealing with malignant pleural effusion and is metastatic triple negative. If you or someone you know is available to speak with her, please email me your name, city you live in, phone number and email address and a short description of your history. Feel free to forward this on to someone who may be able to help or to place this email on a bulletin board or chat site. Thanking you in advance for your help.
