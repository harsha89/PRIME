We're almost there... marie68, I, too, had IV burns. Personally, I thought my hives might be due to sensitivity to dust. Since I am having chemo Thursday, my onco suggested I start the steroids early to help with the hives. It seems to be helping. I didnt know you can opt out of the Neulasta. Is there a reason why you are choosing not to have Neulasta? Have you noticed more hair loss since the 1st infusion like eyebrows or eyelashes? The hair that was left behind from the 1st infusion seems to be continuing to grow. I still get some hair loss on my scalp but there isnt much to lose so it isnt as noticeable. Good luck with your onco appt. Hope you feel better soon.",

Hopefully, you are not the one who is doing the driving. I, too, am not enjoying food these days. You would think I'd get excited everytime I got weighed and my weight has gone down. But now I am just tired of looking. At least I can look forward to gaining the weight back during the holidays :-) Anyway, hope the next few days are manageable. Good luck with everything!",

It will get very messy and it will be everywhere. Even though I had started shedding starting day 14, it didn't look obvious so I avoided cutting it. I used hairspray to control the excessive shedding and I tried not to touch my hair at all. It got worse day by day. I had my hair shaved (with maybe a 1/4 inch left at the top) on day 19 right before my 2nd chemo treatment. My hairdresser did it and washed my scalp. By the time she was done washing it, I had barely any hair left. Unfortunately, what is left behind is spikey and sort of sensitive when I press down on it or when I put my cap/scarf on it. I am debating on whether to shave the rest of it off or not. The stubborn ones that are staying on have actually grown longer since then. I am going to keep it for now because I like having some sideburns when I wear my head covers :-) I'm also curious to see how long they stay on. I'm on day 8 of my 2nd round.",

On chemo day, they will start with giving you Benadryl and steroids in your IV. Then they give you the Taxotere first - this one is the stronger of the two. So the first time they give it slowly so they can monitor any bad reactions. After Taxotere, they give you the Cytoxan. Then they attach the Neulasta to your arm (someone mentioned they got it on their stomach). The Neulasta automatically administers 27 hrs later. Then you remove the Neulasta. Youtube has videos of how the Neulasta works if you are curious. My experience so far has been good. I followed most of the tips from this community regarding the Claritin, constipation/diarrhea remedies, etc. so I think that helped. Chemo day and day 2 were uneventful for me. My SE was mainly tiredness, feeling weak, sunburn feeling at the back of my neck, minor back spasms but manageable with Tylenol. I would feel nauseous when my stomach was empty especially early in the morning but I took the nausea medicine and that helped but it didnt happen often. The worst for me is the dry mouth and loss of taste. All the SEs happened from days 3-8. I felt pretty normal the rest of the time leading into 2nd chemo. Hair loss starting around day 14. I'm on day 8 of 2nd round of TC and the symptoms were similar. No back spasms this time. I should be on an upswing again :-) I hope that your experience will go as smoothly!!! Stay positive everyone!!!",

It was really itchy for a couple of days but now it is just really red. I didnt get this on my 1st round. The vein was around the wrist area. For the 2nd round, the nurse had a very difficult time finding a vein. She failed on the left arm so she switched to the right arm. The vein was in the middle of the arm and she had to use a children's needle. I bruise easily so my arms look really bad but they dont hurt so that's a good thing. I will definitely ask them about finding a thicker vein for my 3rd round. Maybe I can have them slow it down like they did for the 1st round. Today, I woke up and my neck area is all itchy. I'm not quite sure if this is a side effect of chemo - probably. I live in South Florida so every time I sweat it aggravates the symptoms. I am putting a cold compress around my neck to help with the urge to scratch. As long as I stay cool, it is manageable. My scalp is really itchy as well so I am trying Scalpicin. I guess it is working. Hope everyone is having a nice weekend!",

I've looked at images on the internet to compare. Besides the Zyrtec and Pepcid, I apply ice packs to the areas that are really itchy. They seem to go away when I dont scratch. It is really bad for a couple of days but it eventually subsides. The key is not scratching. I didnt have this type of reaction with round1 but it happened with round2 and round3 at about the same timeframe - around 10 days after chemo. If it is not hives, at least I know it isnt anything too serious since it does go away and my skin looks normal again. Djt - I tried so many topical ointments/creams and none of them really worked. Staying cool and ice packs really helped to stop the itchiness. For me, scratching (even a little bit) really exacerbated the itchiness which was very difficult when you instinctively want to scratch. Going for my last TC tomorrow morning. I'm really anxious. I hope I can get some sleep :-)",

I have a Neulasta patch which will trigger tomorrow around 5:30pm. We'll see how that goes... I was hoping to take a nap when I got home but the steroids are making me wired. I hope I will be able to sleep tonight. I havent felt any nausea yet (knock on wood) - there was anti-nausea meds in my IV. I feel a little weird physically like when you are coming down with a cold but nothing painful or anything to worry about at this point. I will let you know how I feel in the next few days.

So try not to think about that too much. Just be prepared that it will happen and try to deal with it as best as you can. I've gone wig shopping. I have very fine hair so every wig looks like a mop on me :-( I was very frustrated with the whole experience. I bought a wig and I will see how I really feel about it once my hair has fallen out. I live in FL so it is going to be too hot to wear a wig so I had planned on wearing it only when I need to like work, social outings. I am hoping that I am confident enough to just wear the scarves and beanies that I bought - they are more comfortable. I cut my hair short the day before chemo started. I am expecting the hair loss to happen soon. Today is day 10 after chemo and I actually feel good. I went to the gym this morning and I feel like I have energy. I am eating food and my stomach doesnt hurt. Except for weirdness I feel on my scalp (I'm sure some of it is mental) I feel pretty normal. If it wasnt for the hair loss I would be OK with all of this. But it is what it is...",

The empty stomach will make you nauseous. I had my 2nd round of TC yesterday and I was starved when I got home. Dont forget to take the Claritin. I hope the next few days are good to you.

I've been lurking around but have never posted anything until now. I had a mastectomy on my left breast on March 5th and reconstructive surgery at the same time. Surgery wasnt too bad and recovery was better than I expected. Next on the treatment plan is 4 rounds of taxotere cytoxan (TC?). My first round is on April 5th. After reading the other topics from previous months, I really wanted to be part of the April 2018 group but didnt see one. Looking forward to hearing from others. Log in to post a reply",
