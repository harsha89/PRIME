A little about me first I'm 28 mum of 4 beautiful children slightly over weight large breasted a smoker whose diet is rubbish. Must add I have quite severe health anxiety. Around 9 weeks ago I was checking my breasts (I do it alot due to my health anxiety) when I noticed a very mild pain kind of like pressing on a bruise on the outside side of my left breast. I checked again to see if there was any lumps then checked my right no lumps so checked left again and strangely no pain. I put it down to maybe pressing a little to hard and tried to put it out my mind which only lasted until that evening then I made the mistake of visiting Dr Google....bad idea I know. I got my period a few days later along with both breasts being sore which is normal for me for a few days after then pain was still there under pressure but then went away for a few days. The pain is there every day but only sometimes when I press it's not affecting my daily life I have no lumps or thickening no swelling or swollen lymph nodes and visibly both breasts look the same as they always have. But as the pain is still there my stupid anxiety makes me believe it's serious. I have a hard time making myself go to the doctors...fear of the unknown...which is why I have left it so long. Does anyone think this could possibly be serious or has anyone experienced the same or similar? Sorry if I sound over paranoid and thanks in advance for any replies. Log in to post a reply",
