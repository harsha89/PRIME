So my story goes I\u2019m 24 , two children (3 & 5) for a while iv had black/brown discharge spontaneously from my left breast everyday , Finally got the courage to go to the doctors which resulted in a fast track appointment for the breast clinic at the hospital. Discharge was present on examination so they got some on a slide for pathology which came back inconclusive! Sent for ultrasound which was clear they couldn\u2019t see anything so they wanted to wait for 3months to see if it\u2019s resolved but was told that\u2019s it\u2019s unlikely and to prepare for a major duct excision! So during the wait my discharge turned to bright red blood so the review was brought forward so was confirmed then I would definitely now be getting the op. So my next appointment was talking to the consultant about the surgery and he requested I went for another ultrasound, this ultrasound came back as dilated ducts and debris so within three weeks I had my date for my procedure (all ducts removed and sent to pathology) and I\u2019m now 1 week post op! ☺️ Glad to have that over but no one really told me how I\u2019d receive my results? If the results are benign will the results just go to the gp? Also has anyone any experience of this and could tell me what there outcome etc was ? Thanks , sorry for the long post but waiting is killing me Log in to post a reply",
