I don't remember that the procudre was painful, just uncomrtable because of the position you must lie in. My docs and any literature I read extol the diagnostic abilities of MRI and at the same time note that MRI's do more frequently produce false positives than mammograms. I had had mammo's done (MANY), several of which revealed a local recurrance (DCIS) on the right, and a suspicious area on the left.  The MRI also looked suspicious which led to the guided biopsy, which was negative.  In cancer terms (all things are relative, right?), DCIS is not so serious. It just means that there are cancerous cells in a milk duct, but they are contained, or \"in situ\" in that small area. It needs to be removed, since if it's not resolved the cancer will invade (that's what happened with me the first time). If this is your first time, your doctor may recommend a lumpectomy which just removes the cancerous area and some surrounding tissue. A pathologist will examine the surrounding tissue (\"margin\") to confirm there are no cancer cells outside the DCIS. If there are none, you probably will not need radiation or chemo. This is something only your doctor can tell you for sure.  Everything about this disease just sucks, from the suspicians, to the testing, waiting, diagnosing, treating, waiting.............hang in there. Ask lots of questions, and don't hesitate to call your doctors office if you want to.  Also, does your doctor's hospital have a Patient Navigator?  These people are godsends, angels.....ask around.  You're in my prayers.....
