She recomended to take vitamin E for a month or get it removed and test it, as scared as I was for the unknown I wanted it out, so now im scheduled for a excisional biopsy under anesth, on April 1st. I keep debating if I had made the right choice, but in my heart I know it's the right thing forÂ  piece of mind. I have a family history and 3 children and very worried, emotions are crazy, I go from crying from I can be strong, to just want to chicken out of the surgery!!!",
