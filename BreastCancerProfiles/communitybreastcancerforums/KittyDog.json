With my MX, I woke up in my room groggy.  With my Hysterectomy, I woke up in recovery first and don't remember much other than telling me to breath.  lol  So I couldn't do that to their liking so I went to my room on oxygen.  With my gallbladder since it was outpatient.  I woke up in pain and until I breathed deep enough for them, no pain meds where allowed until I could control my breathing with oxygen.  So it all depends on your hospital, nurse, and Dr.s.  good luck",

To be safe he had me quit them and change laundry detergent.  I got to thinking.....Aquaphor is made by Eucerin and my Therapist is using a Eucerin lotion on her hands and me.  I looked up the ingredients and the one I think she is using has three of the same ingredients in it as Aquaphor.  Hopefully this is it since the rash on my chest is looks the same  as the one on my arm now . On  the positive side of this my arm is down and I don't feel like their is something under my arm.  I do feel tight across the chest though but I am not giving up!",
