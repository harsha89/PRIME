I was reading your earlier post, and I am surprised to learn that your MO met with you for 4 hours! Mine is no more than 20 mins and even then she will start to get impatient with me/my questions. Also, I didn't know there is a choice of what 'receipe' of treatment for me to elect. I was offered FEC+D, initially, but from my research, I learn that D is very toxic. So then I was offer AC+T. It appears you are only doing the AC part, with the research that you have done, will it impact the effectiveness of the treatment? I'm still debating which treatment to go for, would appreciate your insight from your research. MO said there is a small chance where blood infusion may be needed if there is complications with AC, but never with FEC. For Taxol, there is a chance of permanent neuropathy....and for both d and t, there is a chance of perm hair lost. I was initially leaning towards AC t, from others experience AC is horrible, but taxol, not so bad - but now i am rethinking. GivEn I will need to make like 16 trips + the day prior a visit for blood work! MO cannot accomandat same day blood and chemo! Also no choice on steroids. I asked MO, do I have to take them all, answer was yes. Is there any alternatives, and the answer was no... I gotta confirm which treatment early next week, would appreciate any feedback.....thanks so much! Also r u going to get ice packs for AC? My hospital said there is no need for AC, but will provide for T or D.... FYI -I am getting my PICC put in next Friday! Super frighten with what's coming! :  ",
