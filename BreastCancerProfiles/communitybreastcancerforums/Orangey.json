Like Lorri, I feel a pinch on the breast and it was uncomfortable last night. I thought it would be too soon to feel anything. The treated breast feels much warmer than the other one too. 15 to go. I have been lathering up with Aquaphor since I read it on this site. I decided that with a nice Xmas gift card I received, when all this is done, I'll just get new camisoles and bras. I might need to steal some of my husband's shirts but he doesn't know it yet. Will cross that bridge when the time comes.  Weneke6- did you get the Canadian treatment? I was told that the bulk of the symptoms would show up when the radiation was done. What is happening to you is what I am expecting. Hope you find relief. Off to start day 2. Happy Friday everyone Update-last night when I lathered, hall way light was on so light was dim in the room. This morning, upon inspection, lower part of breast is pinkish. :( This journey is not looking like I was hoping it would     ",

I had a lumpectomy and will receive radiation and, then probably Tamoxifen. I had a partial hysterectomy in 2014 so we don't know if I menopausal yet. Since the cancer was on the same size as the LCIS, I understand that I am not fully out of the woods and monitoring will be necessary. No more delaying the mammograms! Last Tuesday I went for the planning with the radiation technician and will find out this Wednesday if I will get the 16 days (Canadian) or 5 days/5 weeks treatment. At this point, I just want to start already. Fortunately they are very understanding at my job and making time to go to the appointments will not be an issue. I just don't know what to expect. Well, I know what to expect, I just don't know how radiation will affect me and the waiting is killing me. In Paulo Coelho's words: \"The fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself\" I hope to reply back in a few weeks that I'm done, I burn, I cream, and I'm healing :) So many of you are going through what I deem more difficult times than me, not just by being so much younger, but also by the seriousness of the cancer, having small children, teenagers, being the main bread winner, having minimal family support, no family near you or family members that rely on you for their care. My prayers are with you. Stay strong. Stay Positive.",

At least that is what I was told. I was checked laying down and face up. Just in case face down didn't work. Not sure if there were handles and/or how they were located. Face down, your armpit still gets radiation coming in from the side. Mine didn't really start getting color till last Friday or so. Now it's brownish on the outside. As for my nipple, I've only used Aquaphor and hydrocortisone. I thought it might be the hydrocortisone left lingering and thickening but rinsing it is not working 😠 Gotta run. Everyone have a good day. Tomorrow will be here soon enough. ",

I started having a lot of nerve tingling yesterday and today. Well, it kinda started Sunday. Today I stayed home. Not sure how I'll get through tomorrow at work but I really need to go in to finish some lose ends. At most I've been fine for about 30 straight minutes since I've been awake today. Aside from the burning. I also feel like I am hunching a lot. But the nerve tingling is the worst. On another note, my aureola started to discolor. I got scared but, sure enough, I searched this website and someone has asked about it and someone has gone through it before and answered them I guess it's wait and see for now. It doesn't look like it's changing back though. I'm not a tattoo fan but I think I might go that way if it doesn't get its color back. That's so vain, right? I think that the stitches are enough reminder. What I couldn't find, and maybe someone here has experienced this, the tip of my nipple is hard, not the whole thing, just like a half a grain of rice in size. It feels like when you have dead skin on a finger, kinda rough. Aside from tender, the whole breast is tender. I see the oncologist Monday but am not due back to the RO till the 24th. Does anyone have this? While I mostly sailed through radiation, these last few days weren't so kind. For those of you just starting, we all started from different stages, some had chemo, some didn't, mastectomy, various other health matters that have made our own experiences different. For me, it's been nice reading how every one handles this and just hearing people sound out their frustrations. It has helped me put things in perspective and to pull myself together and get up and going. This got to long. Signing off for the night Nighty night",

I have a hard time typing long messages on my cell and don't usually get to turn on my home laptop. It doesn't really hold a charge so it's a fixed spot laptop. :) I've had 10/16 radiations so far!! Yippee. I can't wait for this to be over. As some of you mention, just pulling up to the facility every day starts to become tiring. I cannot imagine having to do 35. I give you ladies a lot of credit. JShannon - I had that stabbing feeling after the second treatment. More when I was sleeping than when I was standing or sitting. Then I hit the weekend and by Monday I was fine. Since I am at 10 now, only 6 more to go, woo hoo, my breast is feeling very warm, heavier and looks red. Very red. Someone mention their breast or nipple being about a third larger than the other side. My nipple is about a third larger. Yesterday morning I actually measured it.  I'm not too tired but this may have possibly been masked with my horrible allergies, nasal, coughing situation. I have been working all along but I also have not had any Chemo or a mastectomy and only had 3 nodes taken out. So I think I started off in better shape than some of you which may account for this. We are all different. I hope to not get too tired (I can hope) because I need to have a life and make plans. Whenever someone says that something is going on towards the end of the month or in February. I have to say, just pencil me in, don't count on me yet, not sure if I will be tired or not. That's going to get old. Uhm, well, I do hope it gets very old and live to tell all about it. Where's the fast forward button? Oh, question. I noticed that some of you are putting cream in your arm pit. I am assuming this does not apply if you have the radiation face down? Would love to hear about what you've encountered. Sometimes it's hard to tell which type of radiation everyone is receiving. Mine is the Canada Protocol aka Hypofractionization. I have had no issues with my armpit as of yet. I did have it after the nodes were taken out but at some point in the last 2-3 weeks,the tingling has settled. All my best wishes to everyone. This is an awful thing to go through but we can do it. And, if you want to rant, that's fine with me. I've been reading all the posts and wish I could reach out and hug you all. We can do this. Stay Positive. ",

On the way back,I knew I wasn't going to make it through the afternoon.I collected my things and came home early. I'm on the 16 days\\stronger treatment. Skin hasn't blistered but is very red/brown, tender. At times the nerves tingle. The nipple is extremely tender. I had to take off my sports bra Tuesday and have become a very creative dresser. I have been sleeping soundly which comes a bit unexpected. I also feel my appetite has increased. Not sure what that is about either. Best of luck to everyone. Hang in there. Rest when you must and recoup your energies. I will still have four weeks of side effects. Not showing up for radiation should help get through it. Although I must say the staff at my facility are excellent. I too am in and out without delays. Somewhere I read that it is important to stay active. I have been going after treatment to a supermarket or store and walked the asisles up and down pretending to need something prior to going back to work. Perhaps that helped? Just thought I would mention it in case it helps someone.",
