I was kicked out of the home I shared with my fianc√© and children for 9 years. He has turned his back on me and I am alone and scared. I meet with the Dr on the 11th. He wanted an mri with contrast and genetic tested before we came up with a plan. I also just started a new job, so I am worried about them letting me go as I have not told them yet. Because I don't have answers to give them yet.",
