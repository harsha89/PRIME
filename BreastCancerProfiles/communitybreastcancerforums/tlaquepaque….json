I asked the nurse how this will compare to the recovery of a c-section and she said that pain-wise this will be easier. They aren't touching or cutting any organs and it won't disrupt bowels etc. We can do this. I think (now I don't know, just guessing) that it won't be so much the pain of recovery as the logistics of not raising arms, not lifting and dealing with drains that will be challenging. I'm still terrified but just going to keep moving forward. We are scheduled for the same day so we'll have to see how it goes. My lumpectomy incision is close to 2 inches long. I just got back to our rental from the beach and I'm giving the kids a nap. I haven't had much pain but now I'm feeling a pinching on my nipple and underneath where the incision is. I didn't go into the water past my waist because I don't want to risk infection but I don't know what this pinching feeling is from. I also tried to put on a underwire bra but that was a big mistake. I will be hand washing my soft bras.",

Not the prescription but I still need something. I guess I'm frustrated because I feel better and want to start doing more but I can't. I get very sore by the afternoon/evening and I wake up at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning with pain. How long, on average, does the pain last?  Also, when have you or do you plan on driving? I have my 3rd surgery on Friday. I'm having a laparoscopic oophorectomy outpatient. I know this will set my recovery back. I'll be tired again etc. I could probably start driving this week but what's the point if I'm going to be back out of it again.",

I did shower but it was not fun or relaxing because of the drains around my neck and trying not to take direct pressure on my chest from the water. I have two surgical bras that I wear with the drains pinned to them. I stopped taking the narcotics today. I'm just taking ibuprofen but 800 mg.  I'll take percocet at night. I am noticing some different pain/pressure in my left underarm and also some tingling. The interesting thing is that my cancer was on the right side and they didn't even check nodes on the left. I'm wondering if I over did it on that side or if it's just starting to get feeling back quicker than the side that had more work done.  Also, here is my blog for those who are interested.

Reading other people's experiences certainly helps me. I had my drains out on Thursday. All but one were under 30 cc a day but one was still at 40-50 cc output per day. The PS pulled all the drains. I took a percocet before the appointment but, WOW, it still hurt like hell. The drain sites were getting infected and were really painful so he took them all out. Well, the one was likely not ready to come out because now I have a seroma. It's unmistakable fluid under the skin with a waterbed appearance. I called yesterday and I'm supposed to use compression over the weekend and then go in on Monday to have it drained. I guess that considering my options of leaving in a very sore and possibly infected drain over the weekend vs. pulling the drain and ending up with a seroma I would pick the later. The seroma does not hurt at all. It's just weird. My kids started back to school this week so child care is less of an issue now for me. It's so hard to care for two children after surgery. I am have a 3rd surgery on Friday. I'm having a oopherectomy outpatient. I'm really hoping that isn't too involved of a recovery. After my lumpectomy and bilateral mastectomy I had nausea and vomiting from the anesthesia. I was given medicine for the second surgery but it didn't help that much. Anyone have advice for the post-anesthesia hangover? ",

I laid awake at night and cried for days when trying to make treament decision. It's so hard to know what to do and then to pull the trigger even when you know what the right thing is to do. I did have my kids young and now I'm thankful for that. When the doctors asked if I wanted to preserve fertility I was able to say no even though I'm 31. I did breast feed both of them. A total of 2.5 years. I asked if that offered any protection against the cancer  and I was told there is no way of knowing but it possibly could have kept me from getting breast cancer at 25 instead of 31. Is anyone here going to get a breast prosthesis after BMX even with reconstruction? I am starting a new job. I signed my contract before the diagnosis and thankfully they are holding the position for me. It will be some time before I look \"normal\" so I'm wondering if I should get some silicone prosthesis to wear in the meantime. I don't know if insurance will cover since I'm having reconstruction and honestly, I'd skip it if it weren't for the job. There is a boutique at the breast health center.",

They ended up agreeing after that.  We went ahead with the lumpectomy to get a better a look and determine course of treatment. The pathology from that surgery showed it was just DCIS with no invasive. Bottom line: second opinions are very important. Thanks for sharing that document.",

However, when I went to the gynecologist to have my breast lump examined he also found pelvic abnormalities. U/s revealed that it's likely just a cyst but since my mother died from ovarian cancer a few month ago it was recommended that I have the whole ovary removed on that side. I have since changed breast surgeons but my first BS told me that I could have breast AND ovarian cancer. I have since been told that this is not likely. I am nervous about the pathology only because of family history. I opted to leave the other ovary for now since the research reveals more problems generally with removal of both ovaries before age 40. I did have the surgeon go ahead and do a tubal ligation on the remaining side since he was in there. I will likely have the other ovary removed sometime in the next 5-10 years unless something shows up in the pathology of this one. I was negative for the BRCA gene but family history and age indicate some kind of genetic componant.  If you are being told to have an oophorectomy I would find out exactly why. I ended up switching gynecologists too because the first guy told me that I needed to have a full prophylactic hysterectomy at age 31. When pressed for an explanation he backed down and said he would just do whatever I wanted. There are risks associated with hysterectomy especially in premenopausal women. I think my first gyno just panicked when he heard my breast cancer diagnosis and wanted to go overboard. I agree that a phophylactic oophorectomy and possibly hysterectomy is probably in my future but it doesn't necessarily need to happen right now. ",
