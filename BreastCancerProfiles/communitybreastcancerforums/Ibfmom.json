My doctor called me the next day to tell me it was infiltrating ductal carcinoma.  I also had an MRI because I was told I had dense breast tissue.  The MRI found that the turmor was behind my nipple so there was no lumpectory or nipple sparring for me. There was also cancer found in the milk ducts, so it became a mastectomy.  My surgery was on July 13, 2010. The did do a sentinal node bioposy the day of the surgery and I did get a numbing agent before. I had 4 nodes removed. 2 were clean and 2 had microscopic traces.  I had the oncotest done and had a very low score of 10 so I do not need chemo. I also had reconstructive surgery started the same day. I am 6 weeks post surgery and feeling pretty good. I go for physical therapy to get movement back in my arm where the nodes were removed. No one told me that I would have trouble raising my arm.  There is so much to know and hard to know what questions to ask. The oncologist started me on arimidex 2 1/2 weeks ago.  I also am not very good with patience or asking others to help me. I have learned that you have to relinquish some of your power to others taking care of you. In the not to distant future, you do get it back.  Good luck. Marla",
