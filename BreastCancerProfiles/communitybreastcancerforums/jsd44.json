I'm one year out from my diagnosis and now 3 months on Tamoxifen and a clinical trial of Affinitor. I don't know if the one year anniversary is provoking the fear, but that shadow seems to be dogging me these days. So, I'm heartened to hear of survivors with Stage III who are doing well beyond the 10-year mark.",

Life is good NOW.\" When I was at the very beginning of things, my friend who was 18 mos. out from her diagnosis said something that didn't make any sense to me then. She said that cancer brought some gifts. Gifts?! I thought then. But now I do understand. There is nearly constant fear for me, but also a heightened sense of life. I am so much more conscious of each moment than I was before, whether enjoyable or not. Every moment counts now.",
