It was so subtle at first, I didn't recognize it coming on, and thankfully, it has not gotten too bad. I had my first consultation and treatments with an LE therapist last Dec. Did fine for a while, then had another flair up that she thinks could have been brought on by 3 surgeries in a row in February and the re-start of chemo. So I'm back to a weekly schedule of visits and massage and wearing my compression sleeve and glove daily. I'm not responding to therapy as quickly this time, but it's not getting worse either. So I guess it's just wait and see. Anyway, good luck to all who are dealing with this little extra gift of BC!",

Does anybody know of anything that works, or helps, that is cheaper?",

I just had my first of 3 taxoteres yesterday and the doc said we'd try an every two week schedule if my body was handling it. So I figure my last tax, if  I don't get off track again, will be Dec. 6. I was hoping to have my reconstruction done by year end, but with my month long delay, that's not gonna happen. But at least I can see some light at the end of the tunnel. My skin is also getting a little dry and I've always had oily skin, oily to the point that I still had occasional breakouts in my 50s. I've got some stubby hair coming back, but I guess that will stop  now that I'm back on chemo. My lashes and brows are starting to thin. It's weird, I don't really care anymore. I was so upset and self-concious at first about being bald, and now it's not that big a deal. I'm a CANCER patient for God's sake. I'm not supposed to look perfect, or even normal. It's temporary. And if you can't handle it (seeing me bald) you've got a lot more problems than I do. I remember when my sweet mama was first starting dialysis treatments. She had to have 3 different operations to get a fistula installed, it failed and was taken out after she endured weeks of a wound vac and trying to save it, then they inserted a line in her thigh, which also had to have a wound vac and lots of problems with healing (she was borderline diabetic and a heavy smoker). She just went with the flow, it was all part of treating her medical condition and keeping her alive and well. I try to remember that every day. It's not a punishment, nobody is picking on me, I just need to keep moving on to the next step and keep living life. Whew, don't know what got me off on that except that I was thinking about and missing my mother this morning. This month will be 2 years since she died. I'm going to do some house cleaning this morning while I've got steriod energy. Hope everybody has a good day with relatively few (or no) side effects.",

I've felt good the last couple of days, the first days since end of chemo that I haven't been totally exhausted, so I hope I'm on the way to getting better.  Hope everyone is doing well!",

I told him to get away from me and held my fingers up in a cross shape (like warding off a vampire). I USED to be nice, but since cancer, I get away from sick people I'm doing pretty good these days. Staying busy. I went by my soon-to-be-exes today to pick up some stuff I still had at the lakehouse, then he came over here with his truck and brought me some stuff that was too big for my car. He even brought me two adirondak chairs and a table he had bought me for my birthday last summer that were over there. I figured he'd keep those, so I was pleasantly surprised I got them back. I need them since my dogs have chewed up all my outdoor furniture! I hope they have outgrown that, but I'm keeping a close eye on them. The fact that I'm doing ok  makes me think that this is all for the best. We are just waiting on the lawyers to get the papers done (and to come to agreement on a couple of things, one being COBRA health insurance for me that HE pays for). But I actually like being alone and having my house to myself and nobody to answer to. Maybe I was too solitary and independent to be married in the first place.

That way if they get blown away, they'd still be locked up and not able to run off, right? Or would a tornado be capable of breaking down the kennels? See, still in a dilemma!

I make a slaw with the broccoli slaw, cut up an apple in it, add some raisins and sprinkle with chopped almonds (all good for you foods). I make a dressing using low-fat olive oil Kraft mayo, a couple packs of Truvia and a couple of dashes of red wine vinegar. Wisk and mix into the slaw.

I took a long handled wooden spoon that I cook with and wrapped the spoon part with a dinner napkin and fastened it with a rubber band (in case there were any rough spots on the spoon). Then I poured aloe vera gel on the wrapped part and was able to reach down my back and put the gel on my sunburn! Works great if you ever need something like this.",

His sister was an accountant at a company I worked for about 15 years ago, but I still keep in touch with the folks there because my sister-in-law still works there. Anyway, his sister had told my sister-in-law about the work he was doing because she knew about me and they had sent me several links to articles. I don't mean to be a downer, but guess what the impetus for this research was? MONEY, just like with everything else. It was costing the U.S. military a fortune to treat all the women soldiers and  military wives who had breast cancer, so they told their doctors to get their butts in gear and come up with something. Oh well, I'm just naturally cynical. I guess it doesn't matter the motive, so long as we get something to help us! My new avatar is a picture I took tonight. A lady in my OvCa group suggested we buy a teal candle (their color) and light it and pray each Sunday night for a cure, and for those having recurrences or other problems. So when I bought my teal candle today, I knew I had to get a pink one too and light it and pray for all my BC sisters too. Love you guys! Ginger and Omaz:  interesting about fewer side effects with the other drug. My hot flashes are awful. I think I'll ask my onc at my next appt. about switching from Arimidex.

I'm still plagued with them. I am so glad fall is here. Hot flashes and hot/humid southern summers are not a good mix! I'm doing well. ASCO in Chicago in June was amazing! I learned so much and met so many wonderful people. As a cancer survivor, it is overwhelming to look at tens of thousands of people who are all working on curing our disease. In July, I took over as executive director of our local ovarian cancer support group. Things were a mess because our last director did not do much of anything for two years, so that has kept me very busy, getting things straightened out and trying to get our membership re-energized and back on track. I've finally joined the gym again. I had my first yoga class last night. I'm a little sore today, but I loved it, I'll go back to that for sure. I've been doing the bike and nautilus since I joined 3 weeks ago. I just now feel good enough (energy wise) and am healthy enough to work out again. I've missed it so much. Even if it doesn't help with all the weight I've gained, I'm looking forward to having my strength back, flexibility and just being able to move. It took me all spring to get over plantar fasciitis (sp?) a very painful foot condition. It's always something (as Gilda used to say)! Anyway, enough of my aches and pains. Life is good. I've quit fretting over finding a job and am content to just live simply (and cheaply!) and enjoy my time to do what I want to do without all the stress. I've missed you girls.

If anybody else is having this, please get it checked out by an opthamologist. He said it is a fairly common SE of taxotere. The tear duct slowly closes up; you get the tearing and crusting. AND it could be the cause of my nosebleeds too! He drew me a picture and showed how the tear duct connects with the sinuses, so the taxotere that is affecting the tear duct also causes a problem with the mucous membranes in the sinuses, which can lead to nosebleeds. If you treat it early, it can be reversed. All I have to do is use a steriod eye drop several times a day for 2 weeks; that should clear it up. But, he said if you let it go, you can end up with a permanently closed tear duct that has to be surgically fixed. Ouch! I told him No more surgeries! So I hope the eye drops work.",

He said for me to wait until after ooph and AI started (which will be in next month) and see what kind of SEs I was having then, and we'd talk about what to use to address them. The main thing I've noticed on the effexor (at least I think it's the effexor; seems like it started after I started taking it) is that I am VERY calm, almost to the point of being emotionless. For example, I haven't cried, been scared or angry over BC in a while, whereas I was having \"emotions\" about it about weekly before. The other night my DH and I got in a fight and although I was having a fight, I was actually very calm inside and not angry at all.

I hate to call it breast cancer awareness month since it has turned into little more than a giant pink marketing machine. Thanks for the words of wisdom on food Lizzie. I'm not fanatical about anything, but I try to eat healthily and do some sort of exercise every day. I've figured out ways to work in foods like broccoli and kale, which I hate, into my cooking where I can. It's funny that Dr. David Shriver-Shreiber wrote a book 20+ years ago telling us to eat broccoli, onions and garlic, and the medical establishment is finally catching up! I wanted to update you on the aromatase inhibitor 'take for 5 more years or not' saga. I was surprised that when my oncologist and I discussed it, he said \"I'm fine with you not taking it 5 more years. It confers only about a 2% benefit.\" He got a big hug! I was just sure he was going to recommend 5 more years of the hell that is aromasin, lol. So I've been off of it about a month now, and I already feel better - fewer hot flashes and joint pains, more energy. I can't wait to see how I'll feel in another 6 months, which is how long they say it takes for it to get out of your system. I read a lot of studies on this and it seems that the biggest benefit is to be had in prevention of contralateral breast cancer. Since I had a BMX, I really don't think I would have gotten any benefit, just more side effects, including perhaps permanent damage to my bones from being on it for so long. I was so relieved that he agreed with my assessment of the situation. Can you believe we are all still here and healthy 6 years later? Hope everybody is having a great fall. Best to all! ",

It took 2-1/2 hours for the nurse to do the tats! I only got a glimpse of them, then she covered me in gauze that she says has to stay on 5 days. I took a shower this morning, and although I wrapped myself in Saran Wrap, they got wet. Hope that doesn't matter. She said keep them covered up and dry. I've never had a tattoo. Is that normal? Or they just being overly cautious? But I'm sooooo glad to be done. Hope I like them when they get unveiled",

We could use a little motivation to go to chemo. Let's all strike for hunky nurses.  All: My doc gave me info on each of my drugs and every one of them had a timetable for side effects that were someone in the range of : Onset: 7 to 10 days; Nadir (worst) 9 to 14 days, and Recovery at 21 to 28 days.. So I'm expecting to feel ok at first and to have it hit me later. So don't feel bad if you still are feeling bad after several days; apparently it is normal. Not that this cheers you up any, but it helps me to know that it's not unusual. I've always drunk tons of water so I'm hoping this will help me flush it out and lessen the SEs.",

We were not poor, but always had to pinch pennies. We had pets, friends and yards to play in. All in all, a good childhood. *Nevertheless, I managed to stray from the straight and narrow and sow a few wild oats in my late teens, early 20s. Moved into my own place at 19, worked 2 jobs, went to night school and partied hard until I almost killed myself; came to my senses, met a nice man and married at 26  (my husband was 35, divorced, with two boys, 3 and 6). *All the usual struggles of starting a new life with a husband and two stepkids who hated me because their mother told them to, but it all worked out into a good marriage. Quit work at age 32 to return to college, graduated with honors at 34. Like Lizzy, I'm a writer (was a Journalism major). Worked some jobs I enjoyed, managed a non-profit, edited a magazine, worked for a country club, a university, and was working for a corporation in their marketing dept. when my world crumbled when I was 44 and my husband died suddenly. He and I were avid golfers and he was playing in a member/member tournament at the club (which I was supposed to be playing in also but my partner cancelled), and he had a heart attack on the golf course. I spent the next 4 years grieving, drinking and eating, gained 60 pounds, almost died twice, long story short, sobered up and got my life back on track. I sometimes think I set myself up for BC with my lifestyle in those years. *Left my job to care for my mother who had a stroke, CHF, diabetes and kidney failure. I took her to thrice weekly dialysis and other doctor's appointments and stuff for about 3 years until her death in Nov. 2008. After taking care of her \"estate\" and getting things in order (I was executrix), I decided it was time for me. I'd been widowed 7 years and taking care of mother for 3. *So I set off on a search for a man to have some fun with. And just my luck, I met somebody pretty quickly and fell madly in love before I ever had a chance to test the waters very much (not that I'm complaining). My husband and I met online, we lived 75 miles apart so we had a weekend relationship but it moved pretty quickly and we married last October. He also has two kids, 12 yr. old boy and 14 yr. old girl. So I'm raising two more kids! And I've never had any biological kids. Go figure. *All my friend were happy for me and said \"you deserve happiness\" after all I'd been through the last few years. I agreed :) And along came breast cancer and here I am with you guys. Gosh, this ended up being much longer than I intended for it to be! Sorry about that. Bottom line: I've had, and still have, a blessed life. I'm happy, healthy (except for having cancer!) and have everything I need. And I plan on keeping on living this life. My husband says \"it didn't take me 50 years to find you just to lose you so soon\". I told him I intend to stick around to be here to nag him when he is 85!",

Calamtykel: I'm sure you have your reasons for not wanting a port, but like others have said, getting mine put in was a piece of cake. I have a great surgeon that I love (he did my BMX too), and I'm sure that makes a difference; but it was a short procedure. I was sore a couple of days, but not too bad. Didn't even have to get any pain meds. I remember when my father did chemo 15 years ago and they didn't do ports as much then and his arms were pretty  much butchered before somebody finally told us about the ports and he got one. So I jumped at the chance to get one from the beginning. I hate needles, so I was soooo glad to get out of being stuck every time.",

I took Zyrtec (I guess that's what they use here instead of Claritin) and Advil proactively. She said do the zyrtec 2xday for 5 days. Also, I don't think this matters at all, but she gave me my shot in my stomach instead of my arm. She gave me the choice of arm or stomach, and just as a lark since I've never had a shot in my stomach, I chose that. Didn't hurt a bit (lots of fat there!) Sweeney: I had CT scan, MRI and PET scans before chemo. But they kept seeing weird stuff on each test they did and doing further tests, which is why I had so many (I think). They were all ok thankfully. Good luck to all having treatments today. Everybody try to enjoy the Labor Day weekend.

Sweeney: My foot pain is weird. I also had not read much about neuropathy and thought it was numbness, so at first I didn't associate the pain with neuropathy. But neuorpathy can present as numbness, pain, tingling, burning, lots of stuff. There is a drug company that has an ad for a diabetes foot pain drug where the picture in the ad is of a foot standing on a cactus. That is sort of what mine feels like. It's almost a stinging feeling rather than a real pain. And it's worse on my right foot than my left. At first I thought it was my shoe rubbing against a callus, but I looked at my feet and there are no calluses, sores or anything on them. I still haven't called the onc. nurse. I can't go in this week anyway, so I'll just wait and call them next week. None of my symptoms are bad enough that I need meds or anything.

Lizzy: At my onc visit yesterday, I told him that my left hand was swelling a little and asked if the cancer center had an LE therapist they recommend. He had his receptionists do a referral for me and the LE lady called me yesterday. I'm going to see her tomorrow. Omaz: I'm 53. Six years ago, I had a blocked artery and had to have a stent placed. I also have extensive family history of heart disease. Because of these things,  my onc didn't want to do tamox because of the potential for blod clots. He, too, at first said tamox for a year, retest and move on to AI if in menopause. But he thinks that  because of my heart issues/history, it'd be better to just plunge me into permanent menopause via ooph and do an AI. He said the main SE with AIs is osteoporosis, but we can handle that with Boniva, Zometa or similar drug. I had worried about the tamox because of the p;ossibility of blood clots (it's why I quit taking birth control pills ages ago in my 20s), so I'm glad there was another option. I hope that the ooph, like the BMX, takes away all (or most) of the risk of ever developing ovarian cancer. All: One of the ladies on another forum had a good idea. She encouraged us all to post a picture of ourselves as our avatar so that we can all know what each other looks like. I agree. I like to know who I'm talking to, what they look like. So I posted a pic and hope some of you will do likewise if you don't have a pic as your avatar. All my pics since cancer are pretty bad, so don't be shy about how you look :)",

On your question about sharing or not your diagnosis ... I am totally \"out\" with my cancer. Mostly because I got involved in advocacy for ovarian cancer. I work in the public eye all the time and tell my story of back-to-back cancer, first breast, then ovarian. But I can understand the hesitation on other's part. I'm older and no longer working, so I don't have as much on the line as some younger women who are still on the career path. Basically, I guess I have nothing to lose by being open. It's an individual decision. Love to all, hope to hear from some others. PS I updated my photo to one taken in November. A little older and grayer, but healthy and happy!",

He said Taxotere instead of Taxol, he called Taxotere \"second generation Taxol\" and he said no A because I've had heart issues in past, so the E in FEC is supposed to be gentler on the heart. Like you, I didn't question too much because he's supposed to be the best onc in town and I felt lucky to get in to see him (he's part owner of the cancer center here!) But then I started reading all that stuff about Taxotere and permanent hair loss and though I've tried to take it with a grain of salt, I've let it get in my head and I'm doubting myself and him too now. I was diagnosed in late May and wish I could just get on with my chemo. The longer I wait, the more doubts I have. I'm on hold because I still have a post surgery drain in, after almost 6 weeks! And it's not showing much signs of shutting down. You said your onc reassured you about the Taxotere? My puppies (10 months old now) are Beagle/Pekingnese mix, brother and sister. My hubby got them for me at Christmas. Some days they are my lifesavers and some days I want to kill them like when they've drug a pillow outside and torn the stuffing out of it.",

I went to see the gyn/onc for a check up this morning. It was pretty much a wasted visit. He said everything is being done that can be done about my hot flashes and other symptoms. About all he did was look at my incision, which has been healed up for a month or more. I wonder what in the heck he wanted me to come in for? He said we would do a pelvic exam and test CA125 (the ovca marker) in 3 months. So today was just a waste of time??? I guess I'm just cranky because it's hot as hell here. When I was out at 10 a.m., it was already 87. They say it's going up to 96. What the .... it's only May???",

Every little thing helps, I guess.  On being a \"cancer patient\" forever: I was talking to a friend the other day who is a non-Hodgkins lymphoma survivor of about 10 years. And we actually came to the conclusion that we are glad that we are cancer survivors because our physical symptoms don't get brushed off like other people's do. If we tell our doctors we have bloating (an OC symptom) or whatever, it gets attention. Better safe than sorry is sort of the conclusion we came to. Yes, it can be scary as we await test results, but I feel like we have a leg up on finding problems early and nipping them in the bud.",

Sometimes tests show stuff that is nothing and that other people would never even know is there because they don't get scanned all the freaking time like we do. I've even read that a lot of the Stage 0 and 1 BCs would have just gone away on there own if they hadn't been detected by mammography and treated. Our body would have just eaten it up using it's own defenses. So who knows ... On the law of attraction, have you ever read the book Sermon on the Mount by Emmett Fox? I love Emmett Fox and his book was written years before The Secret, but one of the chapters is about how much our thoughts influence what things come into our lives. Fox does a good job of combining the religious/the Bible with the metaphysical. I've probably read that book 3 or 4 times and get something new from it each time. In fact, it's on my nightstand and I flip through and reread sections when I'm going through something I need help with.  I had a checkup Thursday. Saw the NP rather than my onc. My blood work was good and she said everything looked fine. I'll have 6 month follow-up scans in March (6 months from end of OVCA chemo). I told her the one thing bugging me is how much weight I've gained, and she pretty much said I'm doomed to be fat as long as I'm on the Arimidex. She said just eat healthy and continue to walk 3 to 4 times a week and try not to fret over it. Sigh ... cancer just keeps on giving, doesn't it.",

Just barely made it to stay in the August group with you ladies. 9/1: Neulasta shot. So, 6 weeks from diagnosis to surgery, then 7 weeks and 5 days more to start of chemo.",

He was very aware of the need for me to be comletely healed. And my PS kept saying \"no chemo till you are healed\".

Exactly a week after I got the shot, the pain set in. I called the cancer center just to run it by them and make sure it wasn't anything to worry about, and they said while unusual, it wasn't unheard for the reaction to come 5 to 7 days after the shot. I asked the nurse who gave me the shot when the pain would set in if I was going to have a reaction, and she said quickly, within a day. So there you go ... once again, there are no answers that apply to everyone.  One last thing, last Sunday in church the pastor used the line from the Bible about knowing the number of hairs on your head.

But then my pain didn't hit last time until day 7, so the nurse told me to just go ahead and take it for 10 days this time. Hope you are enjoying your LGFB class.

My PS called it celluitis, and I said \"I had surgery 3 months ago\" and he said it was unusual, but not impossible, that an infection could show up later. Good news, is they put some clot busting stuff in my port and got it working, hooray, so I don't have to have another \"procedure\" for that. I'm getting a little tired of Procedures.

I've been wanting to try out Yoga, but the only yoga place close to me is called \"Hot Yoga\" where you do the yoga in a room heated to something like 98 degrees. No thanks. It is hot enough in the south. I'm not going to willingly subject myself to more. Give me AC for exercise. I've been doing some redecorating. As I do things, I keep hearing that song in my head \"I'm gonna wash that man right out of my hair\" (I think it was from South Pacific?) I love being able to do what I want and not have to worry about whether or not it is \"masculine\" enough. I bought a teal and lime green rug at Pier One and a table runner with teal, orange, and green in it with orange bobbles on the ends. Then I got a black dinette table with 4 stools. It looks great. I love having all the bright color in the room. The bedroom that was empty since Mark took his furniture, I moved my desk, bookcase, a table and old desktop computer in there and made an office. I had all this in what was supposed to be my dining room. So now I have an actual dining room, with the table I already had, with the leaf in it, and six chairs. Oh, and I'm also having a patio built out back. I'm ready to do some entertaining. I just need this divorce to be final so I can ask a date :) jk on that ... I'm off men, at least for now.

Funny story: I went to the gyn/onc for a checkup yesterday, which included a pelvic exam. His wife and his partner's wife are both very active in our OvCa support group , and I had told them I was looking for a job (so that  might be the source of where this all came from). Anyway, I'm sitting there, naked from the waist down with one of those paper sheets over me and he comes in and says \"have your ever done any research?\" and I said what do you mean by research, I'm a writer and you always start from zero and do research and interviews to write about your topic. He said \"do you have any medical background, have you done medical research? Are you interested in a job?\" Needless to say, I was caught a little off guard having a job interview while I was half naked!! I explained I hadn't done \"medical research\" as a job, but I had done extensive research on both BC & Ov cancers, I had taken care of my mother who had extensive health problems before she died and I had researched all her diseases and kept up with all her medical info (HBP, CHF, Kidney failure, stroke). Anyway, he just sort of left it hanging, so when I got home I wrote a cover letter telling him I'm definitely interested and sent him my resume. It was so weird! But I do hope he has something. I love science & medical stuff, so I'd really enjoy it. Ya'll say a prayer that something good comes of this. And if I have another interview with him, I hope I have all  my clothes on! It's a beautiful day here today. I'm about to go out and plant some flowers I bought yesterday. I am dangerous when I go wandering through garden centers!",

I did surgery first (BMX), then chemo. But I had a friend who did chemo first, to shrink her tumor which was pretty large, then surgery (lump followed by rads). We both had 1 positive lymph node. Many oncs say chemo is a must with any positiive nodes; others say chemo isn't absolute in cases of 1 to 3 positive nodes; depends on the doctor. I had  positive mammo after having a clear one last year. I have dense breast tissue and they said my cancer was there, just wasn't large enough to be seen last year because of where it was in the breast and the denseness. Mammos aren't foolproof, unfortunately. I also had biopsy,  MRI and PET scans before my treatments started. Some docs don't go as far as the PET scans; mine did because they were looking at something that had shown up on an xray; turned out ok, thank goodness. Hope this helps. Every case is different. It's important to find a doctor you trust and can communicate well with to decide on what is the best course of treatment for you. Come back often to this site for support and info. It is great.",

I have a checkup with my oncologist in August, which will mark my 5 years on AI.I want to come off of it, and I'm sure he'll recommend staying on it an additional five years, especially with the new study that was just released at ASCO. What I'm curious about is, how much do s/e symptoms improve, if at all, when you come off the AI? I've had major QOL issues with it: hot flashes from hell, joint pain, weight gain, fatigue, thinning hair (like someone mentioned), every side effect you can have, plus just generally still don't feel 100%. But that could be because I'm menopausal now, plus 6 years older, and I wouldn't really feel better if I quit the drug? It's hard to decide what to do.

I know I'm missing some others, congrats to all finishing up chemos and moving on to the next stage. I've actually been hesitant to ask what comes next? It's like I've been in a safety net with the chemo (cancer cells wouldn't dare grow while you're actually taking chemo would they ) so I'm thinking it's going to be kind of hard to adjust to not having as much attention and treatment being given to the beast.

I'm also a newlywed (it was one year in October) so it's really bugging me that I'm having to deal with this so early in my marriage. One of the reasons I married my husband was because we were so hot for each other and now \"the thrill is gone\" if you know what I mean. There are a couple of threads on here that talk about it (sex issues, loss of mojo) that you might want to check out. When I mentioned it to my onc he wasn't real helpful. He said when I start tamoxifen, I'll have a whole new set of sexual side effects to deal with, so we'll just wait see what we can do then. That's January, so I guess we'll just muddle through until then.",

I still haven't figured out how you get shoulder pain from ovary surgery. I've been awake now since 3 a.m., I guess from sleeping so much yesterday. My shoulder pain is gone, and my belly button is hurting this morning, which makes more sense to me! I'm going to take a pain pill and go back to bed as soon as DH gets up at  6 and leaves.

He said they looked healthy and this was a precautionary surgery, so no problems expected. In fact, when my doctor called me yesterday, I thought \"how sweet he is calling to check on me\", I didn't even think he was calling me with bad news. The pathologist had called him and told him that when he cut into my ovaries, there were cancer cells in both of them. It's primary Ovarian cancer; not breast cancer that had spread. I pretty much zoned out after he told me that, I was in such shock. All I remember him saying is that I need another surgery to explore my abdominal area and see if any of that cancer had spread anywhere. I've got an appointment for Feb. 22 with the gyn onc at the cancer center I've been going to. The only other thing I remember specifically is the doctor saying that my life was probably saved by this prophylactic surgery because ovarian cancer is usually not found until it is advanced and finding it this early is good. So, that's all I know right now. I don't know how I feel about it, I'm still processing this new info and  feel mostly disbelief that just when I thought I was nearing the end of the cancer tunnel, I've got this new disease to deal with.

So he says they think we're dealing with \"early Stage 3\" (an oxymoron, I know), but IF there's not a lot more cancer in the whole omentum after it comes out, they are acutally using the \"c\" word: Cure! They think it's a possibility with more surgery and another round of chemo. I was flying when I left there! The down side is the new surgery can't be done laproscopically, so I'll have a 4-inch long abdominal incision and a longer recovery (up to 6 weeks, ouch), but I'm ready! Surgery is next Wed. They'll piggy back with  my plastic surgeon. I was already on the schedule for my implant exchange, so the PS will do his part and then the gyn onc will do his part, I'll stay in the hospital one, possibly two, nights. I'm so psyched. I can't tell you ladies how much I appreciate your prayers and encouraging words. You rock!

Lizzy, I saw the article about capsacian. I love spicy foods, so good news for me. I've made a gradual - and unintentional - switch to almost being a vegetarian. I gave up red meat years ago when I had some heart issues. Then after cancer, I gave up ham, bacon, all the meats that used nitrates. So that left me eating just chicken. Then I read not long ago that the hormones and antibiotics used to grow chickens are bad for women with estrogen sensitive cancers, so I cut it out too. And I actually haven't missed it. I'm not strictly vegetarian - I still eat meat if I go out to eat, I eat eggs occasionally, and I eat cheese. I had already cut out milk (switched to almond milk). Like I said, it wasn't really a conscious decision, I've just sort of drifted that way. The good news is, at my last physical, my cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels had all dropped and were all well within normal ranges. I was so excited to see that. I had read that meat raises blood glucose, which I didn't know. It was nice to see my efforts pay off in my blood work. Unfortunately the new way of eating hasn't helped me lose any weight, but at least now I'm a healthy fat, lol. Best wishes to all for a healthy, happy new year!",

I'm still doing well, no problems on the health front with the breast or the ovarian. Still working with the Lilies, the ovarian cancer support group here. I took some \"fun\" classes at a local college this fall, that was kind of cool to be a student again. I took a writing class and Italian for Travelers in anticipation of getting around to my goal of going to Italy one day. I'm enjoying football season (yes, Lizzy, it's Auburn and they are doing well, but have the 2 toughest games of the year coming up). I wish it would get cold! It's still above normal for a fall in the south here (highs in upper 60s/low 70s). Let's see what else ... I turned the big 60 in August. I was not happy about that, then I remembered that I'm just lucky to be here so quit bitching and enjoy the birthdays! I cut my hair off short and quit coloring it. I'll change my avatar so you can see it. I got so tired of trying to do something with the thin, baby fine hair I had after chemo, and it wasn't getting any thicker, so I just said to hell with it, let it go natural and see what you've got.

Rachel: I'm wondering about the Taxotere too. My onc said we'll do Taxol if I'm really set against doing Taxotere, but Taxol has it's own demons. He said there is a nearly 100% change of neuropathy, to some extent, with Taxol. Plus it would be 12 weeks to do instead of 6 weeks with the Taxotere. So now I'm leaning back toward Taxotere. Had my second FEC yesterday and so far doing ok. More nausea this time, but took some extra meds today and that's helped. Good night from GI Gina (that's what I feel like now). Regina",

I have at least one hot flash an hour; they last only a couple of minutes, but at night, I toss and turn all night pulling covers off, back on, off, on, off, on ... you know. I'm always tired, and I'm sure it's because my sleep is sporadic. Anybody else taking Effexor? I think it has improved my mood, I haven't had a weepy, sad day since I've been on it; but I think it's also killed what little sex drive I had left from the chemo. The thrill is gone is putting it mildly.

Your hair growth reminds me of mine, about the same length. I have a cowlick growing into a point on top. I look like Alfalfa from the old Our Gang movies (google it, those of you who are too young!) Cal, I've heard that eyelashes and brows can fall out 2 or 3 times before they are back for good :( My hair, lashes and brows will all be gone again in about a week anyway so I've quit paying much attention to it. My legs need shaving, but I haven't bothered with it, figure it will fall out too. I got the BEST treat yesterday. I had signed up with Cleaning for a Reason, and The Maids came yesterday and totally cleaned my house, down to the baseboards. It looks and smells sooooo good. I don't want to touch anything. My husband and I were debating last night whether or not to take showers and dirty it up! This chemo is going fine so far, I've just had one. I've got to do 6, three weeks apart, so it will be mid-August before I'm finished. I'll finish this one about the same time I started by BC chemo. My only complaint so far is this weird leg pain and creepy crawly feeling in my legs. I don't notice it during the day, but when I lay down at night, it starts up and keeps me from falling asleep. I've got a call in to the onc's office. I'm going to ask for something for the leg pain and/or something to sleep. I'm tired all the time, I sure don't need to be going without my sleep.",

I had 14 nodes removed on that side, which compared to others is a lot I guess. But I've been told the numbness would get better. One friend who had this years ago said her arm still feels \"weird, but you get used to it\". I had my first post-op visit with plastic surgeon today. 1 of 4 drains were taken out; I had hoped 2 could go but one is still draining a little over the limit; I go back Monday for it to come out (if it's not still draining too much). The nurse said all looked like it should and to continue to just take it easy and not overdo as that could interfere with healing.  I hate to hear about problems some are having, like the PS changing plans 10 mins before surgery! My experience, knock wood, so far has been good. I thought my breasts looked really weird and lumpy but the nurse said they are \"normal\" for TEs and assured me my final result will be good. I continue to pray for all those with surgeries upcoming and hope that all will go as well as mine has. Regina  PS I have to give kuddos to my hubby; he has drained drains and measured bodily fluids without blinking an eyelash.

I go to my general surgeon today for a 2 week followup, so I'll ask him about how long he thinks I'll keep draining.

I still have one drain in. Am I the only July lady who still has a drain? The left side, where the lymph nodes were taken, doesn't seem like it is ever going to stop. My surgery was the 8th and I had 4 drains. They say it needs to get down to15cc per day to come out and I'm still at 50cc. Anybody else still  have drains and what are your docs telling you? Regina",

I also remember her telling me to learn to type (this was the early 70s) because then I could always get a job and never have to depend on a man. I'm not sure where her \"progressive\" ideas came from, except I remember her telling me once that she was offered a job with the FBI when she was 18 and her father forbid her to take it. I guess she held on to that for her whole life and didn't want me to live my life according to what she wanted instead of what I wanted. Of course, dumbo me, I had no kids, but my first husband had two which I practically raised (they were 3 and 6 when we married) and my second husband had two teenagers (which, of course, are no longer in the picture). Oh yea, I got my revised divorce papers the other day and he didn't take issue with the changes I made, which surprised me. So, I guess it won't be long now before I'm officially single again.

I'm thinking of trying accupunture.   I had a root canal this morning (yuk, first one I've ever had), so my tooth pain has made me forget about my joint pain for the last 3 days   The USA has finally pulled ahead of China in the overall medal count.

I manage to keep up with routine chores like laundry, grocery shopping and keeping the house somewhat clean, but that is about it. The rest of the time I'm zoned out in front of the tv or napping! And I ache, especially my legs. It feels like the achiness you get when you've worked out too hard, but I haven't done a thing! Like Rachel, I'm trying to push myself to at least walk some everyday hoping that will help get my stamina back. I used to work out 4 or 5 times a week, so I miss being active and agile. I feel so weak, creaky ... like I'm an old woman. And I almost can't stand to look in a mirror lately. Left brow is completely gone, right one has just enough hair to give me a little outline for drawing one on. Left lashes completely gone, right lashes all fell out but are growing back little nubs now, but too short to put mascara on. The lack of eye-hair is worse than being bald, it makes me look really sickly. Anyway, I'm not going through anything unique and I need to remember that.

I have a question for ya'll to mull over: After my initial shock and sadness at being diagnosed last year, I've been pretty much OK, emotionally. Even after my OV CA diagnosis 2 weeks ago, I've been pretty calm and my overall mindset has been \"ok, let's do the next treatment(s) and just get done with it.\" I haven't felt fearful, although my brain tells me that it can't be good to have been diagnosed with cancer twice in less than a year. Do you all think I'm nuts or in denial? And if denial gets you through the day, is it necessarily bad? Maybe I'm just overthinking things on a rainy, Saturday night.",

I loved my breasts in my younger days but as I got older and they got older, well, not so much. You made me remember the first time my husband saw me naked (we are newlyweds, have been together just over a year and married since last October); anyway, I was soooo self-concious of my D-cup, saggy breasts, but when I found out that I was going to have to cut them off, suddenly, I LOVED my breasts! I had my bilat mast yesterday and they were able to start on the reconstruction with TEs. The TEs are the only pain I'm having, they feel sore, tight and full. Otherwise, neither my chest nor my arm (lymph node removal) are hurting. But I'm taking my pain meds as directed (every 4 to 6 hours). I don't want pain to start and be out of hand before I take meds; best defense is a good offense and all that. Orchidgal, mark me as DONE! Scrabblelady, glad yours went well too.  Two things to share that might help with those facing surgery soon. I purchased a post-surgical cami too but the PS doesn't want me to wear it, he wants me in a more sturdy sports bra he put on me. So that might have been a wasted purchase, allthough I can probably wear it as a regular bra/cami later. Also, several people mentioned taking lip balm, which I did, but they wouldn't let me have it because it is petroleum based (it was regular chapstick) and they said it's flammable with the oxygen I had. So, check your lip balm ladies to see if it's flammable (I would have never thought of that!) Good luck and prayers are going up for those of you still up for this month.",
