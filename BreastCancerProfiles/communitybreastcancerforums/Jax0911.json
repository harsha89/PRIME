When I got the call it was the scariest moment of my life.. I cried and cried.. so many thoughts went thru my head about whats next, and is my life as I know it over? The word cancer is not the word anyone wants to hear. I told my daughter, who is 14 about a week after my diagnosis.. we cried together many times, but she was my biggest fan thru out it all, and kept me strong! The best advise I can give you, is just take it 1 day at a time... try not to get overwhelmed with all the drs calling, and testings and all the information you are given.. Just take good notes. and take one step at a time.. thats how I managed it. I will keep you in my prayers! :)",
