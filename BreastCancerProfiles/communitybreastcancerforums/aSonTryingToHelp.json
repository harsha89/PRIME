    "Content": "aSonTryingToHelp wrote: Hello All, My mom lives in Argentina and I�m here in USA. My mom had developed a severe case of lymph-edema in her left arm (due basically to her breast cancer, which was removed 13 years ago along with some nodes). A couple of months ago she was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer stage IV (very bad news) to her nodes both locally and regional so they began with radiation which looks like ignited the problem my mom is having with her arm. Well, that was a little bit of history to her (our) problem, now let�s go to the main reason of why am I contacting you. As I said before, her whole let arm and hand got out of control and is very enlarged, doctors says that as soon as she began chemotherapy along with massages and wrapping/sleeves it will get much better. My question to you girls (and hope you don�t mind I�m a man in this forum) Is she really going to get better? Any success stories around here? Any tips? I read that at some point her status could become irreversible. I�m so desperate in trying to help her and feel so frustrated being so far away that I don�t know what to do. I will be glad to hear from someone that was in a very advance stage and successfully beat the swelling. Thanks all and my best wishes to all. Log in to post a reply",
