And your llmd and the woman at the hospital sound like God sends.  Not sure if you've ever had a PIC line.  Ended up needing one for chemo.  There was no problem with the insert nor any problems with it while it was in me.  It was during the summer and I was wearing short sleeves.   I picked up different colored socks and cut the toes out (actually can't remember exactly where I cut them).  Slipped a modified sock on my arm and covered the PICC line. That way I had color coordination and the PICC didn't show. LPBoston never considered myself lucky to have bc.  But goodness, as you pointed out, at least we have more options.   ",

I did have about 200 calories the early evening before chemo. The chemo session went fine. Foolishly took phillips milk of magnesea after chemo in anticipating constipation. So I had a little diarrhea. Today I got my shot. Had taken a clariton. So far the only side effect that may have from chemo is that my cheeks on the inside of my mouth is a little raw. But maybe that is from all the ice I had in my mouth while I was getting my chem cocktail. I understand that the worst days usually start on day 3 - 5. I'll keep you posted. I really like what I've seen on the few trials there have been and the testimony of those thatt have chosen fasting. I've got questions though. I.e.since the good cells are protecting themselves, is the neulasta shot necessary and Is keeping ice in the mouth necessary to help prevent mouth sores? Carla",

Even with clariton each day my bones hurt. Today my back throbs. If it wasn't for that, I'd feel good today. I'm wondering, since I am fasting and fasting protects the good cells, does the white cell count stay higher? Hmmm! Going to fast the next go around also.",

      "Content": "Aug 4, 2013 12:53AM - edited Aug 17, 2013 04:09PM by carla53 Hello, my first chemo was May 30th. I fasted 40 hrs b4 and 24 hrs after. My experience is listed 3 posts above this. Ended up I didn't do chemo for about 48 days later because of the reaction from the chemo leaking from the I.v. sight on the back of my hand. Chemo burn. Endedvip in the hospital for 6 days. Surgery on my hand. Took two inches of infected and clotted vein. Still slightly swollen and red but oh so much better. 2nd chemo on July 17th. Fasted 45 hrs before and about 36 hrs after chemo. Actually had about 600 calories in that duration of time. Did not do a neulasta shot. Felt mostly fine tell 3 days after, then heavily fatigued and slight headache sporadically and slight yucky feeling. But no other problem. Day 4 and 5 got better each day. Day 6 and 7 slight yucky feeling. Slight fatigue. Then around day 12 and 13 a lot of fatigue. After that felt great. Since I chose not to do the neulasta shot, I had a blood test at about day 5 to check my count. If it was low I would have had to get a difference shot to boost my count, but I was good, so no shot. I did not have any bone pain this go around because there were no shots. All in all, I beleive I did quite well considering I was filled with poison (chemo). My next chemo is next Wednesday and just in case it is helping, I will fast again. Carla",

Did approx 46 hours before and 24 hrs after. Chemo was about 3 hours so it was a total of about 72 hours. During the 72 hours I had approx 900 total calories. Had lots and lots of water. Started drinking more water the day I started fasting. The day of chemo and the day after I had about 128 oz of water. For a couple of days after fasting I still drank lots of water, some juice, vitamin water and coconut milk. Although at that point I wasn't drinking 128 oz a day. Also I indulged in 1 cup of black coffee ea day. S.E.'s this last go around. Day 1 chemo day- some gas (pepcid does the trick for me)- maybe a little wired from steroids in the cocktail. Day 2- gas and slightly yucky. Day 3 fatigue, gas a little yucky feeling same for a few more days. After that most of the fatigue was gone but still don't have all my energy back. Again, I chose NOTto have a neulasta shot the day after. 5 days later my blood test was normal and I did NOT have to have any shot :))))))). Also no nausea. No mouth sores. No bone pain (bec I Didnt need a shot). No diarrhea no constipation. Food tasted good Just an ever so slight odd taste in my mouth after i ate. I mean ever so slight. So I had gas, felt a little yucky for about 5 days or so and had some fatigue. It hasn't been a picnic, but I feel blessed, so far, considering what I have read others have gone through. Bonnie and Christina -My oncologist had not heard of the fasting either. She told me it was o.k. with her as long as I didn't lose a lot of weight. So far I have gained 3 to 4 pounds. My last appt with her was the day after my chemo and I was feeling great. She wanted to know more about what I was doing and was happy for me that I was doing so well Today I have started my fasting for my LAST chemo on Wednesday. I will never know what my S.E.'s would have been without fasting or modified fasting. I do know so far I am glad that I have and am hoping that S.E.'s don't get any worse for this last one. Carla",

Did anybody here have clear margins, positive nodes NOT have to have their chest wall radiated? Or anyone have to? Any info, personal history or thoughts will be appreciated. Thanking you in advance.

My blood count once again was good and did NOT need any shots. Sooo glad about that Maybe if I completely fasted s.e.'s would have been better. Who knows. Although I have had fatigue, I don't feel it is because of the fasting or limited calories. I have noted almost everyone if not all on my chemo board has had fatigue and they have not fasted. All in all I am glad I did this. I feel my s.e.'s have been less than most that I've read about. My blood count was good. Never had nausea never had mouth sores. Diarrhea very light and sometimes not at all. Food always tasted good. Will never know for sure what my s, e.'s would have been if I had my normal diet. Good luck to all. And God Bless. Carla",
