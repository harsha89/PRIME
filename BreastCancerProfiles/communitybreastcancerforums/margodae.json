This is a more recently discovered genetic mutation and there is not a lot of information out there. I have been told that it increases susceptibility to several cancers including breast, ovarian, melanoma, leukemia, and prostate. Has anyone else tested positive for NBN genetic mutation...if so what was recommended for you as far as treatment or increase surveillance?

One month ago tomorrow I noticed a dull ache in my left forearm and wrist.  It is tender to touch with minimal to no swelling.  My oncology nurse ordered a bone scan to be done this week.  I am a nervous wreck!  Has anyone had similar symptoms and/or a bone scan???
