And those eyebrows are painted on, for sure. I hope he used hand sanitizer before putting his pinkie to his lips.  Right after I found out I was having chemo, I did an internet search for \"bald women porn.\" Yup, i't's out there. There seems to be a fetish for watching women shave their heads (careful where any of the head-shaving photos you've posted end up). Since I don't plan to stay bald, I won't seek out the men who have fetishes for bald women.",

While I appreciated his urge to reach out to me and share, it was a bit jarring hearing him say that I'd been \"sick\" as I had never considered myself sick.  Almost everyone at work assumes that because I went through treatment, I am \"cured\" and everything is all fine and dandy. I have to correct them and say that I will know the treatment worked when I don't get cancer again. While I don't want to be perceived as \"sick,\" I also want them to know that I will have to deal with the possibility of recurrence for the rest of my life. ",

I lost weight these past six weeks from running around to all my different appointments (literally as I rely on public transportation and walking) and just not having time to eat. My onc hasn't said anything to me about whether I might lose or gain weight on chemo. I hope I have an appetite and don't lose even more weight. I am starting to look haggard.

On Wed, I have planned to do a Look Good, Feel better class, get my Neulasta shot, go to a nutritional counseling appt, and take a drumming class in the evening. It might be too much, but I'll see how it goes. My ex-not-quite-bf accompanied me today. I was such a motor mouth due to the steroid, he kept teasing me for babbling (I am usually fairly quiet). Finally, he left my bedside and went and took a nap in an empty infusion chair as I worked on my laptop. The nurse was far more encouraging than my onc about how I'll fare on treatment. My onc recommended AC/TH because she said I would feel more \"wiped out\" on TCH. In the end I decided on TCH. Well, today, the nurse said that in her experience women have fewer side effects on TCH. Let's hope she's correct. She told me to take Sennakot tonight to ward off any constipation issues resulting from the Aloxi (anti-nausea medicine) in the IV drip.
