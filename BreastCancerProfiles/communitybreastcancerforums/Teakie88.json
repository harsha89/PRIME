I have never wanted to have the pneumonia shot because I always thought I would then probably get pneumonia from it. Two bouts of pneumonia taught me that I needed the shot, and I got it in the hospital after the second time. Thus far, no further problems of any kind.

I keep hearing now (wish I had been told this back then) that women having children at age 30 or later AND no breastfeeding run a greater risk of developing breast cancer. What better place to conduct our own research on whether or not these may truly be factors for breast cancer than right here on BCO? We can't do anything to change it now, but maybe we can help inform our daughters and friends and families with daughters about the possible link that may exist. I also had extremely dense breasts so they monitored me pretty closely, but obviously that wasn't enough. Please jump right in and: give your age for first pregnancy or more, whether you breastfed, and even whether you had dense breasts that required monitoring.

They always go in places they have no business going (around bra lines, areas around groin--you get the picture). They must really like you a lot, Sue, and want to be near you always! On a more serious note, are you wearing any kind of perfume, fabric softener, detergent, that might be attracting them in the first place? Burt's Bees makes a natural herbal insect repellent that is safe for even pets, but reviews on it say it smells bad. The plus side on it says it is nontoxic. Of course, my first thought would be that if you get attacked going to Chincoteague, then you might need to rethink that area. That's probably not an option you're going to entertain. so at this moment, I have no other real suggestions, but I sure hope someone comes along who does! Ann",

When she sees her patients like me, if everything is going pretty well that day for her, she laughs and enjoys being with all her patients. If a patient maybe has passed away or she has seen patients struggling, you can tell that it weighs on her heavily when you see her. Her staff told me that instead of picking up a novel to read for pleasure, you'll always find her reading a book on cancer treatments. She is Triple Board Certified, and I know that she has my very best interests at heart. She asked me to do a TV commercial on breast cancer that started airing in March of 2015. I felt honored that she thought enough of me as one of her patients to ask me. It is still airing on TV as we speak. She asked me a favor in helping to promote her practice and to further advance the kind of care that she provides; I, in turn, felt the least I could do was return the favor. That is the kind of mutual care and respect that we have for each other. You can't really ask for more than that. However, I'm still waiting for Hollywood to call me for a screen test!

He walked in and was greeted by all the girls in some form of pink regalia--pink tutu, pink wig, and other assorted attire. The orthodontist even had on pink slacks. He noted that many of the girls were complaining about having to wear these \"reminders\" on our behalf. It figures that this was the one appointment that I didn't go with him. Had I been there, I would have walked up to the girls doing the complaining and said \"I would GLADLY trade places with any one of you, including wearing a tutu everyday for the rest of my life, in exchange for having breast cancer.\" I imagine that would have shut them up in a hurry. The sad thing is that none of them have any idea that probably at least one or more of them may end up with it down the road, regardless of mammograms or early detection, all that garbage we're always being fed about early detection saves lives. On the other side of the coin, I went into my local Post Office and on the counter was a very simple pink stand-up poster which said \"October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month Find a cure!\" I felt like that was more in keeping with the real agenda. I hope as time goes on that more awareness about the true nature of this beast creates a more sincere approach to breast cancer and less ignorance on the part of people who \"think\" they're promoting this cause the right way, but aren't.

Some ladies on these boards have said they think getting bc is a \"crap shoot\", that no matter what you do or don't do will not influence getting it, and that's fine. Opinions are what make the world go round, and differences of opinion are what make these bc boards so interesting to read So, this is just my opinion on the subject, but I still say there is a direct correlation of some kind between bc and our lifestyles. I purchased The China Study by Thomas and T. Colin Campbell, father and son collaborators who did in-depth research on why people in China did not develop cancer over there as rampantly as countries like the U.S. did. Their findings showed that the kind of food choices the Asians made were far different from ours. For example, milk is not anything that they supposedly drink over there. It might be used to feed babies, but it is not drunk by the adults. It has also been determined that once these countries start fashioning themselves after the U.S. junk food lifestyle, rates of cancer go up over there as well. I was a good 40 lbs overweight when diagnosed, didn't eat healthy enough, didn't exercise correctly, inflammation was more than likely way out of control, ate candy and sweets (my weakness), and my list could go on and on. I have researched vegan (plant-based diets), exercise, inflammation, etc., and from everything I read, the results still seem to point to modifying our diets and lifestyles to eliminate unhealthy proteins and fats. I eat vegetarian fed chicken and turkey (Simple Truth by Krogers) when I want meat to eat, lots of vegetables and some fruits, watch how much dairy I take in. watch sugar intake and balance sugar with protein intake (protein helps offset carbs), walk 6 miles a day, do visualization practice, and take supplementation like Vitamin D. More and more research seems to show how low Vitamin D levels and cancer risk/occurrence seem to be related. So, I personally think the vegan diet is absolutely essential, but I also think other things go hand in hand with that, and I'm just trying to do everything I can to stay at NED for as long as I possibly can. It might be a year, five years, who knows. I do think if I want a fighting chance, I have to fight fire with fire by being more proactive and aggressive than the cancer itself Best to all. Ann",

I was concerned about getting a pneumonia shot as I felt my immune system was already compromised, but I have not had any recurrence of pneumonia at all since then.

Hopefully, they will be able to get her to a more stable condition where her appetite comes back (appetite loss is common) and she starts to feeling better. Please try to encourage her to eat even if she isn't hungry as her body needs nourishment to fight back with. Initial diagnosis and treatment of this disease can be tough on anyone, so please convey to her that so many of us have gone through what she is going through now and that it is \"doable\".

The only time I ever had a side effect with it was just the first time it was given to me. I developed the \"flu-like\" symptoms a couple of days after the infusion, but after that first time, nothing since at all. At this point I'm not sure I would ever stop it, only stagger it out to maybe four times a year, something like that.

I had many, many large liver lesions as well as numerous spots on ribs. A lot of us developed liver mets, bone mets, you name it. In March of 2015 with chemo, Herceptin, Perjeta, and Zometa, I have achieved NED status. You are overwhelmed right now just as all of us were. This DOES NOT mean the end for you. Many women are living years and years with this disease, and the statistics are definitely changing for the better. Why bother? You have a 6-year old son that needs you, and you have every opportunity now to be there for him. Take some deep breaths to get your bearings on your situation, and I guarantee that given a few days or weeks, things will look up for you. All of us at BCO support each other 100%, and I KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS. Please know that all of us are here for you anytime, and we want you to do well. God bless you and best wishes for return to good health! Ann",
