I was diagnosed with stage 2B breast cancer just after 2 days of giving birth to my daughter (it was a csection). I had 8 rounds of chemo, lumpectomy and 14 nodes removal and now radiation. So far, I am doing very well . The skin is getting dry and turning darker but nothing else as far as the side effects.",
