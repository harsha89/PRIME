Honestly ive been dealing with this since mid june and my anxiety is growing growing growing. I wish I could offer words of encouragement on your single status but everything that comes to mind sounds so lame to me right now as I am not married either. I am in a long distance relationship but I dont know if thats better or worse. Long distance is hard as it is. Throw this in the mix and forget about it :) I believe that by talking to my cancer team and reading so much of the messages that I have all the info I need but all the what ifs are still lingering. rest assured we will pull through this together as so many have done before. Feel free to PM me if ever and when ever.",

What a journey this has been for all of us. Thank you all for your willingness and openness. True Godsends.Â I received a care package from the american cancer society with an insert and a bra. That was wierd. Nice for them to send it but wierd having to look at it and know that it is for me. I'll be in the hospital for 2 days and then I get to go home. I won't find out until the evening of the 10th what my showtime is and that has me a little anxious. Yes, it is a small detail but just one more thing to add to my list of \"I don't know\".",

Its been 4 days since the surgery and im surprised at the range of movement I have. One thing that I havent read about is the burning sensation I get when I lean forward. the pain meds help with it though. The burning is almost a sarning sign that its almost time to pop the pills again. The PS said I was able to shower once I got home but am uncomfortable with the idea so I shower from the waist down and spongebath my top half. I have not had a bowel movement yet and thay has me a little concerned. My home nurse said I could double up on th e colace os hopefully that will help. All in all it hasnt been as bad as I anticipated. Main thing is to get as much rest as possible and do but dont overdo if that makes any sense. Hugs to you all...",
