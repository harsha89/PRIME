I was diagnosed in November as Stage IIB, triple negative, with no lymph node involvement. But diagnostically, my MO has classified me Stage IIIB. I got my port Dec. 11 and started chemo on Dec. 12 (AC, every two weeks, with Neuroplast booster), and everything hit me so hard that I couldn't even think to ask for help with the side effects like headaches, etc. I followed all the directions I'd been given, so it was hard but I managed. Day 6 I started to feel better and realized I should have been calling the doctor for help with the headaches, acid indigestion, insomnia--couldn't sleep more than 2-3 hours a night, bone pain, etc. I've made a list for the doctor for when I go back for chemo on Dec. 26. I have loads of questions--even though I've been reading all over the forum--but I just wanted to start out by saying hi, and thanks to each of you for being here and sharing so honestly so I don't feel alone. I've got tons of support from friends and family, but no one who really knows what it's like. I'm expecting my hair to fall out any day, and not looking forward to that, although I got a couple of cute, soft hats. I'm developing some mouth tenderness today, and I suspect I made my baking soda solution too strong (to kill the nasty taste) or if it's from the chemo, or both. I guess I should go out and get Biotene for dry mouth? Any recommendations?",
