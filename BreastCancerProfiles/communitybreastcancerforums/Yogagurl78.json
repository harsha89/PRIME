It'll drive me crazy. Perhaps she thought if the core biopsy came back positive, id have to have a sentinel node done. Honestly, i wish the tech hadn't said anything at all..and just did her job and left the \"explaining\" for my doctor. Thanks for your clarification.",

At the same time ,a lump was found on my rigbt breast and I had a biopsy.it turned out to be a fibroadenoma . It was not removed.. For the past few months,I have had increased swelling on my right breast (the one with the fibroadenona) the tumour is on the lower right quadrant of the right breast ..behind my nipple. This new swelling is on my UPPER and outer right quadrant of the same breast. I went to the doctor yesterday, after a weeks worth of not being able to lift anything or sleep. I had hoped she would tell me it was just a torn muscle and prescribe me some muscle relaxers. I was shocked when she said she felt quite a bit of thickening on and in my breast and since i dont have my periods anymore, she was quite concerned and I'm now being sent for an ultrasound next week.i asked why not a mammogram and she said she wanted to go straight for the ultrasound ,as a mammogram may not pick up what she is suspecting. Which she didn't tell me. I'm now very worried. What could possibly be happening with a \"Thickening \" And Also, can a fibroadenoma change from benign to malignant.? I know I should have asked my doctor..but i was in shock and forgot. Any I right would be great please! Anyone else go thru something similar? Log in to post a reply",

I know the only true way to know what's up ,is having the imaging done. But like all of us here..I guess I just have those nagging thoughts,based on my current symptoms and the serious concern from my doctor. Has anyone that's been diagnosed,have underlying conditions as well, like hypertension?I have stage 2 hypertension and it's been like that for 5 years . Is there a higher risk of BC with this kind of condition? Just trying to ask the right questions to be informed to ask the right questions at my appt. Thanks..hugs to all those going thru this too.

In a few days. I am from BC ,Canada ,where we typically wait weeks for these kinds of tests. The breast centre asked me some very specific questions based on my symptoms and medical history and based on this ,they made an appointment for me on the spot. Here is my question to you ladies, What is the chance of a thickening and lump in the outer upper quadrant to be breast cancer.? I know I have fibrocystic breasts, but all my hormone tests came back normal and with the past 4 years of no changes in my pre menopausal state (meaning I haven't had any problems until now with hormones ,gynelogocal or breast issues other than the known benign lump) The clinic doctor seemed very concerned as did the breast centre. Any thoughts?  ",

I have to go back for biopsies next week .:( In the area of thickening, they found a large mass hidden under a large area of dense tissue. I really hope this one is benign, like the one in my subaerolar region from 2013. The one that's worrying me is the enlarged node they found in the breast tail? She said I needed a sentinel node biopsy.what is that? There was also a small lump that she said was a blood vessel attached? I'm really confused. I don't have the report with me..im just going off what the tech had told me and shown me on the screen. I'm staying away from google. I'm having a hard enough time controlling my hypertension( which is not related to anxiety) Any thoughts from you ladies? I'm actually quite calm right now which is surprising",
