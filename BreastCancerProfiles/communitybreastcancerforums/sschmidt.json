Is this radiation recall?  I don't even know what that is.  Has any of you noticed a pinkish area that stays in the same place for years? I have never thought to bring this up with my Onc.  I also have sore ribs that I am sure is from radiation.

I went to a Bernie Segal workshop once, in Northern Cal, and he asked the audience if anyone thought life was not fair.  Everyone raised their hand and he said \"that proves it is fair.\"  It sucks for all of us once in a while.  Sometimes more sometimes less.  Like I said...the sun will shine again.
