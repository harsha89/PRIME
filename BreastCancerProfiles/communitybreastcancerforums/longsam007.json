My radiation ended in mid-2016, and the attack was in March of 2017. I wanted to die! It was worse than the pain of FOUR natural childbirths I went through! I have received varying responses from the several doctors who treated me, beginning with the ER physician. The ER physician said, \"Your heart and lungs are fine, but you have inflammation of the sac around the heart. I'm a lightweight with meds, so I opted to just take Aspirin. Still experiencing dull pain two months afterward, I was switched to Naproxen. I brought up the possibility of radiation influence after reading about it online. My GP said, No chance. Still having pain 5 months afterward, I was referred to a Cardiologist. Interestingly, he let me SEE the visuals from the initial ER visit and pointed out the plethera of spots on THE LUNGS. I was confused as to why the original doc didn't mention the pleurisy on the lungs, I hope you are all okay now. I am concerned that mine will not be going away soon. I have been switched to Colchicine (sp?) just 3 days ago, and I do hope this makes it go away. I wish you the best.",
