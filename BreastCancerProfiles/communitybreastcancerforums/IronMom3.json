I've been feeling terrible with a lot of nausea, so I'm thinking from reading all your posts that I must speak with my onc about better management for my next round. I'm out of bed today, so that's an improvement.",

Thank you for the welcome and the confirmation that I should be talking to my onc about my nausea. I spent 4 days in bed and vomiting, so I'm not looking forward to doing that again! Leslie2016 - where in Ontario are you? I noticed you have IV fluids at home, I'm going to ask my onc about that. I was so sick starting on chemo day, that I didn't drink anything for 4 days. Of course, then I was so dehydrated I felt awful. I'm sure not drinking to flush the chemo through me didn't help either. I requested to join the Facebook group. My name is Erin Hathway.",
