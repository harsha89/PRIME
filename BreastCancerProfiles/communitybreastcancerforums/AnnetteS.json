Not DEEP muscle massage, but definately a LOT harder than I expected.  I asked her why the difference and she said that the two therapists went to different schools and learned different techniques.  She said that her way (the harder one) was a newer method. She knew exactly how the first one did it. I saw huge improvements in my arm after the first treatment (with the light touch) and no improvement after three of the harder treatments.  I am not sure if it is because you would expect more improvement in the beginning or if this new girl isn;t going it right. Also. when I take off my bandages, I have areas where the swelling is down, but then it goes right back up after a half hour or so. I'm I missing something?

Also, who had all their nodes taken  out instead of just snb? Is that fairly common? My surgeon is taking them all on one side because they already biopsied an enlarged node and it was positive. They way I picture them scooping them and all the surrounding tissue does not sound very nice. I guess I thought she would be taking each and every one out individually, but last night she said she wouldn't even know how many she took out until she gets the final path reports back.  Does that sound right?

PS says that if she removes the dead tissue, she will reach the tissue expander.  She said that the living tissue around the dead tissue might work its way through and around and under and over the dead tissue and we will be okay.  Does that even make any sense to anyone?

On another note, my DH planned a recovery party for me in Havasu the first weekend of December with a pretty big PARTY group.  He was quite relieved to hear that my chemo won't start until the week after the party, so I should be able to attend this 'recovery' party.   I don't really have an interest in going to a party with every one drinking while I am still in the middle of recovering, but he is so excited, that I am trying to not sound too negative about it.  I am also having trouble deciding if I want to go back to work during chemo.  I pay for salary protection insurance, so I will still get paid after my sick days run out, Oncologist said the worst side effect (besides the hair loss, which isnt that important to me) is fatigue.  He said you must rest when you get tired.  I teach 30 nine year olds.  They are a great class, and I can certainly sit in my chair and do lessons from the computer,  but there isn't really an option to go to the break room and rest if I get tired.  ",

I asked about a port before I began chemo and my med onc said it was up to his nurses, if they could find a vein, we wouldn't need a port. For my second tx, one nurse (if she even is a nurse) needed the  help of the other nurse (who later told me she is a medical assistant) After the assistant got it in, the first gal asked her why  it was so hard to get in.  Was there a valve in the way? When I told them it was really hurting my wrist and arm, she said that it is in the vein.  If it wasn't in the vein, then my hand would be swelling up. Then they said it probably hurt because the meds just came out of the fridge.  I took percocet and started feeling better after a bit.  I'm not sure if it would have kept hurting or not.... I complained a week later to the onc that my arm was swollen and red and hurt and he put me on antibiotics.  He said, \"I don't think it is infected but we will try the antibiotics\" He also said \"It isn't that the iv went into the tissues, or it would have swelled up immediately.\" While having a debridement (sp?) surgery, I asked the anesthesiologist if she didn't think I should have a port.  She agreed and then stopped short and said, \"Wait, you are here because you are not healing.  You probably shouldn't get a port.\" Anyway, PS is in surgery all day, Onc is on vacation, BS will see me on Tuesday and maybe get me a referal for LE specialist then. And, PCP won't give me one without me coming in next week. So, I struck out for today, but maybe next week I can get a referal. I am completely dreading chemo 3 on Thursday.  I just don't see how my hand/arm can handle one more. I guess I should get in to onc on Monday and complain AGAIN about my hand and arm.  Oh and, I'm diabetic, so a foot IV probably isn't recommended.  I've never heard of a neck IV.  Maybe that is what I should have...... Thanks again for all the input.  I will keep you updated.",

Yes.   One thing that I was worried about, and still enters my mind occassionally is.....If the chemo is supposed to kill the fast growing cells, and it only killed 95% of my hair, did it only kill 95% of any remaining cancer cells? I would have felt better if 100%  of my hair fell out!",

      "Content": "AnnetteS wrote: I've had two chemo infusions, six blood draws and quite a few blood pressure readings on my left arm, since that side only had two nodes taken out.  (the right side had 22 taken out) My left arm is swollen on the top of my hand where it is also red and burns from the chemo infusions.  My wrist is swollen as is the upper arm.  My PS and oncologist both said it wouldn't be LE because I only had two lymph nodes taken out.   Both times I had chemo, my arm hurt for the entire infusion. My oncologist said that it shouldn't hurt.  But it DOES hurt.  Tomorrow I will be calling PS BS oncologist and PCP to see if I can get a referal to LE Specialist. Any suggestions on what I should say when they tell me again, that since I only had two nodes taken out, LE isn't an issue. I understand that this might not be LE, but there is definately something wrong with my arm and Onc and PS have no idea what is wrong with it.  Just that it isn't LE.
