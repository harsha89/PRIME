I had discoloration and turned pretty red about a week after treatment ended, but there was no pain involoved for me. I wasn't tired either. Hope this eases the fear of those about to begin treatment! I know how nice words of encouragement can be before you begin each new phase! Good luck to all!",

I find it hard to get moving in the morning...and things seem to be getting worse not better.  I keep thinking it must be the Herceptin, but my MO says no. She doesn't seem concerned at all, but it's really bothersome. I have a lot of edema, really swollen fingers and feet. I wonder if that has anything to edo with it?",

Mormine, I agree with you about photos. I'm the photographer of the family and I don't have many photos of myself. Always was having a bad hair day, or wanted to shed ten pounds...how silly! Now I'm taking photos of myself every chance I get - hair or no hair, it doesn't really matter.",

Mine glowed a bit on a MRI but it was so small the doctors didn't think it would be malignant, but it was. Nothing else in my nodes lit up, but I did have a spot on my rib that did. That scares the heck out of me!!! They are treating me as though I am IIB....MO, BS, head of radiology, and a bone expert didn't think the spot looked like any cancer met they'd ever seen. I guess a lot of things show up in PET scans..keep telling myself that anyway.  Still scares the heck out of me. I get my next MRI this Friday....gah...this whole process is so scary! The uncertainty of everything is just so hard to deal with! Looks like you and I are about on the same time track for everything. Hoping the best for you :)",

I didn't feel it at all during A/C, but I did during the last couple of Taxol treatments. I mentioned it to my MO last Wednesday and she said something about it forming scar tissue. They think I had quite a bit of DCIS in my tumor...in fact preliminary results pointed to stage 0 for me. They took 6 samples of the tumor during biopsy and the first 5 showed DCIS only...the last slide is where they saw the cancer. I've read that after the cancer is gone, DCIS can remain as scar tissue. Maybe that is what we are feeling??? After A/C ultra sound showed tumor under 1cm...as of last Taxol we can't feel the lump at all. That is the part of neoadjuvant chemo that is hard for me...I'll never know my staging exactly. We THINK I'm IIB, but we'll never know for sure. ",

I could feel my tumor shrinking during the A/C and after my Taxol treatments we can't feel it at all anymore. I have an MRI this Friday and meet with my BS to determine our surgery plan next week. I am feeling hopeful (today, anyway!) We now will know how my body responded to the chemo. If there is any cancer left in the nodes, as there is sometimes, there is a trial of a drug called TDM1 that I'll be put on....it delivers Herceptin and chemo straight to the Her2+ cells.",
