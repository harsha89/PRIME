      "Content": "Mar 21, 2016 09:43AM - edited Mar 24, 2016 08:41PM by lxcarr I'm had a bilateral Mastectomy in July 2015. My left side had a high grade cancer and 4 lymphnodes removed. I continue with chronic nerve pain across my chest on left. I have this tennis ball effect under my left arm which is so annoying. I was told that is nerve pain. I am on medication. Have limited arm motion and will be going to physical therapy in early April 2016. I had my breast Expanders removed on both sides. The left where all the problems are had an extender that was inflamed and literally had to be cut out in 3 sections and a seroma. I was hoping that removing the extender would relieve my nerve pain. It did not relieve any pain. I'm chronic fatigued from chemo and radiation and have bone and hip pain. My fingers are stiff and getting up in the am is Hell. My meds kick in and I have unpredictable days. At times it is rest in bed and other times I feel well enough to do light house duty. I am being forced by Hartford long term to apply for social security. A stress I don't need. Anyone here have similar nightmare with chronic pain and fatigue along with bone pain.",
