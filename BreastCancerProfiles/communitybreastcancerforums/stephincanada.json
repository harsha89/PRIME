    "Content": "stephincanada wrote: Hi all, I am planning on flying two weeks after completing radiation (whole breast and supraclavicular &axillary nodes). I had three nodes removed during the biopsy. Has anyone been told not to fly that soon after radiation? Do I need to wear a compression sleeve? I am not seeing my RO until next week, and thought I should figure this out sooner rather than later. Thank you!
