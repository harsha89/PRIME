There is so much to cope with mentally with the cancer and surgery, there is no need to stress yourself more. And immediately post op there is extra swelling and bruising so we aren't really seeing an accurate picture until more time passes. For now, pamper yourself, nap, and snuggle your dogs! <3",

I'm also trying to change my perspective from \"I lose my adorable breast on Tuesday\" to \"I get to remove this gross tumor Tuesday\". I'm working on it. I had a hysterectomy 4 years ago and I thought I had already walked my journey... I had no idea God had an even bigger journey in store for me. Thank you PMR53, I will remember your words \"... it's just a pain in the ass for a year\". I like that. lovingisliving, we are surgery sisters! Like you, I'm having surgery first. My oncologist anticipates me having issues with chemo so he wants the cancer out ASAP. I won't be allowed to shower with my drains, but I did buy a front closing post-mastectomy bra, drain pockets, and a shirt that buttons up the front (why do they all seem to be plaid?!) I am concerned the tissue expander will be painful... my brother had one placed on his face/side of head after a car accident and it caused him a lot of discomfort. I go tomorrow for my first injection of dye to light up my lymph nodes... Am I wrong in guessing they inject this directly into the breast? Ouch.",

My heart was set on lumpectomy but since I had lymphatic invasion and a very large tumor, I realized for my own peace of mind I needed a mastectomy. I don't ever want to go through this again. But my doctors certainly would have done lumpectomy if that's what I decided. And my family's only job right now is to support me and my decisions. Perhaps some of the comments you're getting are founded in their concern for you or their lack of understanding of the recommended treatments. Stick to your guns and try to have patience. I have not been able to shave my right underarm since a week before my surgery and it's driving me nuts! But I figure since I can't lift my right arm very much anyway, no one is likely to notice! Congrats on the clear SL node!! <3",

I am only 6 weeks into my journey and I already feel so poked and prodded and can't imagine another 15 months or so of this. I'm really not a strong or brave person and find going to the dentist a little traumatic so this is very difficult for me. DH is trying to understand and does well most of the time... but in my really low moments he is completely at a loss which often leaves me feeling utterly alone and unbelievably unhappy. Last night I was horrified by the appearance of my incision which is very gnarly, puckered and dented. Both PS and BS say it looks great. I feel like Frankenstein. Lovingisliving: I expect chemo, the meds are listed below. I have ILC with lymphatic invasion, 6cm tumor. I had my mastectomy the same day as you and just received my path report. My nodes were all clear and I had clear margins so I am hoping he tells me chemo is no longer necessary, although that is highly unlikely. I expect 6 months of chemo and another 9 months of herceptin. A very long journey indeed. I have never had short hair so I can't imagine being bald 8 months or so.",

I have 2 more sleeps with my right breast. I am concerned about caring for my drain post op, how much pain I may have and what I will look and feel like. I expect diminished range of motion with my right arm and since I am right handed I'm not sure what I'll do with myself post op. I am still trying to process that this is actually happening.",

I woke in Recovery crying from the pain. I was discharged 4 hours after surgery (for some reason it's day surgery where I live - ridiculous) and I had a horrible night last night with pain off the charts. I wept all night long and finally drifted off at 5:30am. Tylenol 3 doesn't begin to touch it. I have two drains which are collecting thick red discharge. Ick. I have a binder on, which is getting stained with blood and other fluids from my drain insertion site. Plastic surgeon told me to remove nothing until I see her next Monday, so I will call the office tomorrow to see if I can wash it and change the dirty gauze pads. It's strange and upsetting to me how concave the right side of my chest is. I am not enjoying my journey so far...",

Low-level nausea and discomfort at drain site. The binder feels so tight at times it's difficult to breathe deeply but then when I sit up, it feels like it's sliding down... so can't be too tight. TE causing discomfort but not too bad. Lying down is the worst and I can only sleep a few hours at a time. I desperately want to sleep on my side (my back is sore from lying on it) but my armpit/drain site can't seem to tolerate the weight of my arm for more than 5 minutes (even if I put a pillow under my arm). If I do manage to fall asleep on my side, the pain is excruciating and my hubby has to help me sit up, as I can hardly move. I have finally looked down at my chest but I still can't bring myself to look in the mirror. The large incision where my breast used to be is what seems to be bothering me the least. I am praying for a good pathology report.",

My 2 drains were removed on Wednesday and I also got my path report: Stage 3, 6cm x 5cm x 3cm tumor removed with clear margins. The 3 lymph nodes taken were all clear. Excellent news! Last night I slept my first night through since the surgery, but still have to sleep in a semi-sitting position. I did amazingly well emotionally my first week post op, but now it's hitting me. Very weepy day yesterday wondering if I'll ever feel sexy or like \"me\" again. Just got up the nerve to look at myself in the mirror and the incision is gnarly, puckered and has a dent on one end. I'm still very black and blue. It feels so strange to have only one breast. My TE has a small amount of fill in it so I have a hint of a breast there... feel like my nickname should be Stumpy. I can't tolerate my soft post op bra yet, so I'm going commando for now. Hoping my underarm stops hurting soon. Thank you everyone for sharing your stories. I am sending hugs and love to those having surgery this coming week. <3",
