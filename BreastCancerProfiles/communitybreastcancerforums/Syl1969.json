I decided a single mastectomy, but I think it would have been better a bilateral mastectomy. I think your mother should make their own decision. So sorry that you and your mother are going through this.",

My diagnosis was in September. I often come to this forum and has been very helpful in the dark days, thank you very much for all the wonderful stories. Being in a stage IIIC has been very hard for me and i'm scared to death. I just finished the twelve weeks of taxol and had the first AC last week, I hope to be many years here.",

I think of the word cancer many times a day, i have even confused the words on the billboards and read \"cancer\" everywhere!. \"I'm sure I have post-traumatic stress\". It is also very hard to talk about it with our family, only those who have had cancer can understand. My mother who was a fenomal woman, had two primary cancers, one in each breast, she passed away eight years ago of a heart attack. He survived 33 years to his first diagnosis and 10 the second (there is always hope). So until now that I have this terrible disease I can understand how she really felt and how lonely he was. More lymph nodes involved, worst prognosis? certainly, i had 14 (scared), but as said Momine, this disease is not predictable and i have read wonderful stories of women who do very well for many years and i hope do my best, and I hope with all my heart and all my faith that we can be together for many years in this forum.",
