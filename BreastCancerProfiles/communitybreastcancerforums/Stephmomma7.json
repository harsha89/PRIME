Prior to that I had an ultrasound on it where the doctor said \u201cit's probably not cancer\" with that my surgeon took action and removed it. It was a tumor but benign! Fast forward to 2017. I had a baby and had a really hard time nursing and was painful. I was told it was due to the scar tissue from my lumpectomy. So I nursed for a year painfully. 2018 I finished breastfeeding and felt pain STILL. I examined my breast and felt a lump again. We to the ER due to being in so much pain and the doc found another mass. She referred me to surgery who referred me to the breast clinic. Today I am 2 weeks from getting both breast mammogramed and an intensive ultrasound on the left breast where my 2 new masses are. I am feeling scared, anxious, and exhausted! I am trying to remain positive but also not blind sided if I was to be diagnosed with BC... I think I'm mostly frustrated on how long it's taking to get appointments Anyone in a similar situation? Since I\u2019ve had a benign mass am i more likely to have benign ones or malignant ones Log in to post a reply",
