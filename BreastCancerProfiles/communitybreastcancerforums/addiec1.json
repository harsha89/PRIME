In March I discovered an underarm lump.  I was pretty sure it came from using a really old and nasty razor but I went to my Dr. just to be on the safe side.  I am 34 and my Mom had breast cancer at the age of 36 so my Drs take any lumps I have very seriously.  She sent me for an ultrasound (which I've had before) and my first mammogram.  The ultrasound revealed a slightly suspicious lump and the mammogram revealed a 4 mm cluster of microcalcifications in the breast opposite the armpit.  I was referred to a surgeon.  He recommended a stereotactic biopsy of the microcalcifications.  He felt the underarm lump and felt it was nothing.  The day before my stereotactic biopsy I discovered I was pregnant.  We went ahead and attempted the biopsy but due to my small, dense breast and a location near the chest wall they were unable to locate the microcalcifications.  He felt that I should wait till the 2nd trimester and then do a needle guided excisional biopsy.  I sought a 2nd opinion because waiting seemed scary.  She agreed with the original surgeon, the armpit was nothing and waiting a few weeks was fine.  In the meantime I miscarried.  I scheduled my surgical biopsy.  It was a failure as well.  I went to get the wire implanted and they were unable to find the calcifications after an hour of mammograming me in a variety of positions They attempted to locate it by ultrasound and couldn't find it either.  The surgeon's current recommendation is trying to get insurance to go for an MRI, if insurance won't pay for an MRI, have a repeat mammogram in 6 months.  I'm so confused by this change.  Initially these microcalcifications were serious enough to do a surgical biopsy on it... but now its ok to wait 6 months??  I'm glad they didn't biopsy an area they weren't sure of because then it would just give me false reassurance but why were these calcifications so easy to see in the original mammogram and can't be seen clearly now.  Has anyone had anything like this happen to you?  What are your recommendations?
