My final path report agreed with the preliminary so no second surgery.   Nao - Good luck with your decision on which BS to go with, I hope you find a sense of confidence with one of them!  ",

I\u2019m 47, divorced, no kids and have no dear one in my life at this time.  I do have supportive family and friends, but I\u2019m not the type to ask for help easily.  So the scary part for me is getting through this without burdening other people.  My sister is the type to dive into projects and she is all over this, doing research and asking to go to appts with me (bless her heart).  I just don\u2019t want to wear her out before things get rough.  I\u2019m a logical person, not prone to emotional outbreaks and don't wear my emotions on my sleeve, so I feel a need to put on that \u201cI\u2019m ok\u201d face when telling the family, which I expect will eventually become too difficult and tiresome to keep up. Any suggestions on dealing with BC when you don\u2019t know how to ask for or accept help?

I like the idea of a page, if I find the time to learn how.  And I really like the idea of taking a break on the weekends, eventually, as I'll be getting my notes in order and putting my list of questions together this weekend. Have appt with BS Monday afternoon and sis is going with me. BS mentioned he might send me for a second opinion - is that common that the doc recos that before the patient does? And I have no idea how quick things will happen after Monday.  One thing I've noticed by everyone's dates is things happen rapidly with BC.",

Results could have been better, but could have also been worse.  I'm doing ok with the info so far (praying for HER2-, LN- and staying stage I).  Sis went with me, BS spent 2-1/2 hours with us answering questions and then Sis and I went out to dinner.  Tomorrow I'll organize all those notes and see what info I missed.  Looks like I'm sticking around this forum - the education and support are fantastic and I was really touched to read that you were all thinking of and pulling for me today! Thanks to all!",

Cindy - I love the tip about the soft sock, think I'll go try that now - for some reason today's bra bothered me when it was ok a few days ago!  I must have fickle breasts!   ",
