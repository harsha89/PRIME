He referred me onto a specialist who referred me to have an ultrasound. The ultrasound results meant that I needed a mammogram (this was last Friday). then on Monday I went back to the consultant who said the mammogram had shown up something \"suspicious\" so he wanted me to have various further tests done.  I then had an MRI (in the big tube for about 1/2 hour - horrid, dark and noisy), a further ultrasound and then two core biopsies as they said there were two sites they wanted to look at. As I was also under general anaesthetic at that point they put a MRI coil into one of the lumps.  I am now waiting for my results tomorrow and I am absolutely terrified as I have no idea what to expect. I've tried not to look things up on the internet as I keep scaring myself :(  If anyone can offer some words of advice they'd be gratefully received x thelittlestjojo.blogspot.co.uk/ Dx 6/22/2012, ILC/IDC, Left, 3cm, Stage IIB, Grade 3, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Chemotherapy 7/5/2012 Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), Ellence (epirubicin), Fluorouracil (5-fluorouracil, 5-FU, Adrucil), Taxotere (docetaxel) Surgery 12/12/2012 Lumpectomy: Left Hormonal Therapy 2/1/2013 Tamoxifen pills (Nolvadex, Apo-Tamox, Tamofen, Tamone) Radiation Therapy 3/12/2013 Whole-breast: Breast Dx 5/17/2017, ILC, Left, Stage IV, metastasized to bone/other, ER+/PR+, HER2- Radiation Therapy 5/30/2017 Whole-breast: Breast, Chest wall, Bone Hormonal Therapy 7/27/2017 Femara (letrozole) Targeted Therapy Log in to post a reply",
