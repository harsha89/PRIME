I have had an ultrasound which says it's normal breast tissue. The doctor told me it was hormones but it hasn't gone down or changed in several weeks. I was thinking about getting a mammogram but wasn't sure if that would be helpful or not. Does a mammogram take pictures of just the breast or can it also take pictures of above the breast/in the armpit as well? thanks! Log in to post a reply",

It was a friday so I researched what it  could be to determine whether i should get it checked out. That monday, I looked in the mirror and noticed it looked bigger. It had started hurting more over the weekend.. So i made an appointment for the next day.  The doctor i saw didn't know what was causing it to swell. and thought it was swelling down towards my right breast. She did some blood work CBC and WBC exc. and all came back normal. She referred me to a breast specialist wel, it was a general surgeon who delt with breast issues. I went and saw her a couple days later. she said my breasts look fine and the swelling wasn't under my arm but above mybreast. She didn't think it was breast cancer but ordered an ultrasound . Last night, I felt my right breast and it felt like something was there...and my husband thought so as well.. I just did the ultrasound and they checked the area above my breast and determined that there was no cancer.  They didn't say if anything else was causing it.  I will be following up with my doctor  Did anyone else have random swelling above breast and it turn out to be cancer?  Log in to post a reply",
