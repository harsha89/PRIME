      "Content": "Nksrn wrote: I have an unusually high incidence of cancer on my maternal side for several cancers. I've lost a sister to an adenocarcinoma that was cervical. Another sister just finished treatment for breast cancer. Because of all of this I am tested every 6 months, alternating mammogram with MRI. My most recent MRI was just Wednesday. I got the report yesterday. They found a 6mm round enhancing mass. It has circumscribed margins which I understand to be highly suggestive for it being a benign mass. It also says the mass demonstrates rapid enhancement with washout which I understand is a pretty strong predictor of malignancy. In addition there is a intramammary enlarged lymph node in the same area with a preserved fatty hilum. I don't know what that means. I'm trying to figure out which is a stronger predictor, the round shape with circumscribed margins (good thing) or the rapid enhancement with washout (not so good). My biopsy is on Monday. I've really been very positive about it but would like to be prepared for what I might hear. I'm a nurse but never worked oncology and have been working in management outside of acute care so my knowledge base isn't helpingme much. Any experts in MRI indicators out there?

The sister that just finished breast cancer treatment and reconstruction surgery just returned from a wonderful cruise. Unfortunately they found another palpable lump. They think it is more likely scar tissue from surgery. She is having an ultrasound on Monday. Ironically enough at the same time as my biopsy. All of this after losing our mother in November. Sometimes it just feels like too much. I appreciate your encouraging words as I have decided not to tell my siblings until I know what I'm dealing with and know what my sister is dealing with again. In the meantime I am going to take your advice and distract myself with a good playoff hockey game! Thank you",
