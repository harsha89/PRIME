My mum has just been diagnosed a few days ago and it has come with a complete shock to our family. I know very little about any kind of cancer and so im trying to get as much information as i can so that we can give my mum the right treatment. She had a tumor which was infected, but that has been removed and from what we know so far no other part of the body is infected, so the doctors suggest she will require chemo, but we will only know more about the plan of attack after she visits the Oncologist. As for now she is recovering from her surgery.  I shall be visiting the site frequently as she will be going through her treatment. again thank you all so much....",
