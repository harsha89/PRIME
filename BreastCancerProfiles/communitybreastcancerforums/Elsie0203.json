When I found a suspicious mass a year or so ago I received an appointment to attend Derriford Hospital in Plymouth within the week.  I was impressed but I have been told not to expect such a rapid response this time probably because of NHS cuts.  I had a mammogram and think I had an ultra sound as well which showed nothing abnormal.  I did however have a CT scan a few months ago when I started having chest pains (could this have been the start?) and my consultant did  advise that there was a 'slightly increased risk' of developing breast cancer from the radiation.  I was more concerned about potential heart problems at the time.  So stupid. Anyway I will look out for your posts.  My symptoms seem to be very similar to yours at the moment - though swelling always seems to go down a bit overnight.  I can feel a small lump under my left nipple which wasn't there before.  I too have taken loads of photos with my mobile phone and the pics seem to show up shadows under the skin that aren't obvious to the naked eye.  I'm just frightening myself even more I know. Take care and good luck. ",

Just feel sick and can't sleep.  Horrible.",

I hope mine turn out the same. I've found a couple of lumps, one behind my left nipple  and another to the side of of my left breast plus some some lumpiness that wasn't there before.  But like you Alicki I've lost so much weight my breasts feel different anyway.  All I can stomach is fruit and water. Rash has gone right down and so has swelling but still painful lymph nodes on rib cage and now groin as well as armpits. Did either of you experience same problem with the lymph nodes?",

My GP prescribed sleeping tablets and I actually managed to get a reasonable nights sleep for the first time since Thursday.  Also managed to eat some breakfast. Have lost a lot of weight just with the worry - no weight loss before this began - so my boobs seem more floppy and soft; I can't feel any hardened masses at the moment, rash is still pink but not inflamed.  Found some painful lymph nodes on my ride cage and my arm still feels odd but no longer swollen.  Very strange. ",

Too long to wait so will call them on Monday and see if I an get it moved forward.  My left breast, where this started is getting bigger and redder; nipple has started to invert (never had this before so clearly swelling is getting worse) Skin is looking mottled. The right breast in contrast seems more settled.  This is so crazy.  I think once I know and treatment starts I can get on with my life bizarre as that sounds.  It will be a different life though. Are you from the UK originally as I noticed you looking to get treatment in the UK.  I looked up Royal Marsden but I am at the bottom of the country though moving back to Wiltshire in few weeks.  Will ask the oncologist if I can be referred.",

He/she might be able to reassure you.  If you have an infection lymph nodes can pop up all over the place  I found some on my rib cage which have gone down now.  They can also come up if you are run down and stressed which you are.  I've been looking up disorders of the lympathic system and there are conditons like cellulitis which cause rash and bacterial infections that can affect the breast through entering the skin via small cuts and spots.  I found some spots where the band of my bra sits and wondered if bacteria could have got through via those.  My partner is a chef and twice now he has had extreme inflammation to the hands where bacteria has got in via cuts and has needed antibiotics. Once his hand swelled up massively.  Another thing is if you haven't done so already ask your GP for a thyroid check.  Under active thyroid plays havoc with hormones.  I'm sure it will be fine but I understand what you are going through.  You are not wasting your time trying to get answers  Take care xx",
