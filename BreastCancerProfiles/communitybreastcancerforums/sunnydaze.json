I also go completely neutropenic between sessions- which doesn't help - because I have to do the neupogen shots, which also cause, as you probably know, intense bone pain.  Better than ending up in the hospital with neutropenia and strep though (that happened after my first round).     Big hug to you - you are not alone!  I didn't see how many tx's of the taxotere you have left?  Stay on top of your pain meds... it will subside - though never completely.  I have to take narcotics almost every day between sessions just to be able to live.  If it doesn't subside enough for you there is a pain patch called fentanyl or phentanyl you can get. I have a friend on this and she said it changed her life.  I can still manage with the pills so my doc wants me to try to do continue that since I am nearing the end of my treatment.  But if it were going to go on much longer I would def request those patches. Take care of yourself.  xoxoxo ",

Reconstruction planned for after chemo.  I wanted everything to be the same when I'm finished. I don't know if there was any especially skin sparing technique used on me.  I do know that in comparison to my mom's mastectomy it looks like I have quite a bit more skin left than she did.  And I am certain today that I will not go back to Ds.  This feels really good.  I am a runner and have always had to have a lot of support for \"the girls\" and could never wear the cute tank tops that leaner girls could wear - well, i could wear them but might likely be arrested.  :) Soooo... here we go... Sunny 2.0.   Pain virtually gone except for right side where they took the nodes.  I am showering and even prepared my own lunch today. Only took 3 vicodin today versus 7 yesterday...  these are good things! I'm ready to heal up and start chemo and be done with this stuff.   ",

BMX scheduled July 14... 5 days and a wake up... lots to do yet to prepare but I've gotten a lot done this week.  Feels almost like nesting... for a baby... except without getting the baby.  Ha!   I'm in pretty good spirits... kinda getting used to the idea of losing the tah-tahs, for saving my life.  :) Anyway - thought I would introduce myself. I'm 37 yrs old... newly single mom (actually still not officially divorced but close enough for me)... have two boys ages 3 and 4.  Just moved us all into my parents' place so they can help me with the kiddos while I do this cancer thing. Tonight I feel oddly at peace with it all.  Which is strange because I'm typically PI$$ED about the whole deal.  lol Time to put our rally caps on and go kick some butt! Love this board to pieces... thank goodness we're in this together. ",

I would be totally satisfied if I could just look healthy and proportionate. pm me anytime! ",

See you on the flip side... I'm 5 days out and doing well (but didn't do immed recon like you)... hang in there you'll be great!  and check in with us when you're back on the grid and let us know how you're doing.  We're here for you.",

My night nurse was an ANGEL - kept me on the iv dilotted since she took over around 8 pm to 8am.   Vicodin sucks and I will be off the stuff as soon as I can tolerate the pain.  I have virtually no pain on the left side... just have pain on right where they took nodes.  And that pain is about a 5. Path report not back yet but surgeon said nodes looked and felt normal - so I am cautiously optimistic we're in good shape there. That's about all I got - too dopey to write more.  I'll check in later. Love you all!  This surgery was not that bad -at least for me.  So if you haven't gone yet, don't be scared.   ",
