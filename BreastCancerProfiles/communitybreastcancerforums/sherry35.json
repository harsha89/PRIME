Then it's a pain in the but.Â  I've had 6 treatments so far and you don't feel a thing, you just hear noise like a high pitched whirrr. It's hard to believe that something i can't see or feel is blasting away at those little buggers. I'm using the generic brand of glaxal base cream.Â  When I went to the pharmacy I thought glaxal was an ingrediant so i was picking up all the creams and looking for it. LOLÂ  \"Glaxal Base\" is the name of the cream. Duh!!!Â  The generic brand is just called base cream.Â  For you canadian girls I got it at shopper's drug mart last week- double the size container for the same price as the name brand.Â  I think I paid $16 for the big jar of it. NICE!!! I've spent the week away from home having treatments and hubby is coming to pick me up tomorrow afternoon.Â  YAY! one week down only 5 more to go. Cheers, Sherry",
