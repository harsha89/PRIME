I was diagnosed at Stage IV in 2005 with extensive mets to my bones and liver. I've since had progression to my brain and peritoneum. Since diagnosis I have received pretty much continuous treatment, and a lot of chemotherapy. The good thing is I am alive, the bad thing is I am now trying to manage the complications of liver disease in addition to my cancer. An individual who participates on the BCmets list and also on this forum suggested that I might share some of the work that I am doing with you all. I hope that is OK. I am trying to do some small-scale advocacy to increase awareness of patients and oncologists about complications to the liver from chemotherapy (whether or not you have liver mets), and I am hoping you will help me. I'm asking all men and women with metastatic breast cancer, whether you are a poster or a reader only, to please take the following survey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/bcmets_liver_survey Also, if you participate in other networks that reach men and women who have metastatic breast cancer please would you forward the link to these networks. The survey is not very long, and the more people who participate the more useful it will be, so please try it. If you have any questions or difficulties please do not hesitate to contact me via email at: ksgeorge@mac.com Thanks so much, Katrina Log in to post a reply",

In total, 113 women completed the survey, and I wanted to share some of the results.  111 out of 113 women reported having been diagnosed with metastases. The length of time since their initial diagnoses with mets are:",
