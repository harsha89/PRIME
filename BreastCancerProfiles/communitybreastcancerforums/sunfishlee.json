It woke me up with in terror from it at night. It was unbelievably awful.  I thought it would never stop and then at about 5 weeks it started to disappear. Now I have none of this feeling at all. the only remianing nerve sensation is in my right hand , which always feels like ice. You are the only other person I have seen who has described  this sesnation. Hang in there, I believe it will pass. Good Luck, Lee ",

I could tell that with every mammogram there would be new calcifications and another surgery. As my surgeon put it, I would be getting a mastectomy a slice at a time.  I decided not to continue the watchful waiting/surgery route and had a PBM with TE in January.My family was 100% behind me. Because I did it before dx, I was able to have skin and nipple sparing. When I woke up in the recovery room, the relief was overwhelming. The results are also amazing. My doctor told me, no one will believe me if they looked at me. After two fills, I I believe it also. Please be aware, this is a very tough decision. I was torn up to the last minute. The surgery was ok, but the TE are very uncomfortable and I have had severe \"phantom\" pain. But through all of it, I feel lucky to have had the choice and not face BC. Good Luck, Lee  The pathology came back with ALH and ADH in both breasts, so  ",
