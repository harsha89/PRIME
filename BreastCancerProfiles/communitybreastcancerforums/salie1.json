I had a core needle biopsy 4 days ago and got the results yesterday... I have a fibroadenoma (huge relief.) It is about 16mm and painful - shooting, stabbing sharp pain. It is very close to the chest wall. I completely stopped all caffeine intake. I was wondering if anyone has any advice as to what else I can do to help with the pain. My nurse practitioner (I don't have health insurance, and go to a health clinic.) pretty much said that we will just leave it alone since it's benign. Tylenol and advil doesn't do anything for the pain. Is there any herbs or supplements that can help? Any other foods I should avoid? Also, I am looking into maybe taking birth control pills, will taking this make my breast pain worst? The biopsy was extremley painful by the way. Maybe they didn't give me enough lidocaine, but I felt everything especially the core needle going in and puncturing the lump. And after the lidocaine wore off, I was in agony for hours. They told me to take Tylenol, but it didn't help. Thank you for any advice you can give me! Log in to post a reply",
