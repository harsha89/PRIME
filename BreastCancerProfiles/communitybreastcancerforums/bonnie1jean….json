Good luck to both of you.",

      "Content": "Jan 16, 2010 02:08PM - edited Jan 16, 2010 02:12PM by bonnie1jean I am a very strong believer in stress being the cause of major illnesses.  I was just diagnosed in December 2009. For the last  3 years I have been under tremendous stress.  Three years ago my mom, who was my best friend, became very ill and suffered horribly for 4 months before passing away.  It was the worst time of my life.  Then to add to the stress, my boss has continuously done despicable things to me, making my work life an absolute nightmare.  I only continue to work there because of the bad economy and poor job market.  He has more mood swings than a woman with PMS.  When I was diagnosed I said to everyone that if there is one absolute cause for this, I would have to say it is the stress of working for this man.  Also of note is that 18 months ago I developed high blood pressure which I am sure was brought on by stress.",
