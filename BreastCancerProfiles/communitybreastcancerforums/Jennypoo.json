I was told to eat first as it helps? I have no clue what I am in for, I have no clue what the name for the bc i have or drugs I am taking. I was high on mucle relaxers when i was there, my girlfriend was there but she is out of town this week, so have to wait till she comes back to ask the questions. Got my fingers crossed that this will not make me sooo sick",

So I have been down graded to stage 3, hoping to loose another stage here. But I start chemo next week, they are not doing surgery first because it is huge. So I get my pic line next wednesday sounds like ouch to me, then they are doing chemo boot camp with me, and then I start chemo thrusday, she is just juggling chairs for me. So I have no idea what to excpect or if I should bring anything with me. Any advice on whats to come? Jenny Log in to post a reply",

I said fine, but you cant make me wait two more weeks to get the results from my core biopsy and ultra sound report. So I was transfered and told, yes you do have Cancer, but we are sending your biopsy off to another hospital to get their opinion as thiers wasnt clear as to what type of aggresive cancer I have. I am 38yrs old just went thru a complete hysteractomy in Oct, never felt like I bounced back from it, I also have a host of chronic pain issues. My thing is, they want me to get a MRI on the 13th and see them again on the 21st to get the results to everything. I am thinking should I stop taking my estrogene? I read it feeds Cancer, is that true. Also thinking shouldnt they want to cut this masive Lump out of my left breast, last messurement it was over 4cm by 3.5 cm. and growing fast. I called and left a message with my family Dr to call me tomorrow hoping she can help clear up some confusion. I havent even let it sink in yet. I am just confused Jenny Jenny Log in to post a reply",
