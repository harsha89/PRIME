Like you, I was not happy, but also knew it could be worse! After the MRI - I was moved to stage 3 as the tumor appeared to be on my chest wall and 4 nodes looked invaded. Also, two other tumors were discovered. I opted for a double mast with expanders placed. I made sure both the surgeon and PS understood that if clean margins were NOT obtained, no expanders (as radiation would be needed). I woke from surgery 2 weeks ago with expanders and lots of pain! I do not regret my choice for the double... here is why: They removed 32 nodes, as they were sure the cancer was there... however, the pathology showed no lymph invasion. The other two tumors were indeed cancer, but nothing was on the chest wall! I went back to stage 1. My other breast which looked perfectly clear had pre-cancer cells.  Depiste all the good news, I am told that chemo is still needed as my tumor was over 1cm. I am waiting for the results of the Oncotype DX to help me determine if chemo is really right for me.  I am sure there are a lot of stories like mine out there, and getting news with the word CANCER in it totally sucks! But remember, until the final pathology comes in, it is very hard to plan! I will pray for you to recover quickly and have amazing labs... ",

He offered the test because I started freaking out over the need of an extra operation. He said if I come back low, then hormone treatment is fine. He did say that anything else, and he would like me to get the chemo... it is really my family that wants the chemo. I get it... and feel blessed they want me around. I just got done reading the Steve Jobs book, and certainly DON'T want to ignor treatment if needed... just want to make sure it is needed is all! You guys are so great! I love that we can all interact together, so helpful! ",

My TE's were filled with 350cc's, which is a lot for my size, so I woke up with cleavage. It was still shocking for me. I lost both nipples and I don't think I knew about that loss before surgery. Anyway - I was totally thinking that I could do the no boob route, then I lost the TE on the bad side, and realized that I really do want boobs if I can have them. I am on this site almost everyday. There are so many different stories, strengths, weaknesses... all so very helpful. I am so sorry you had to join us, but we are all here to help you if we can. As for your pain... I was not one of the lucky one's like several that have posted here. I had horrible pain, but I do feel so much of that was brought on by the recon and my refusal to take the pain meds... That being said, I made it through the roughest part, and I know you will too.  ",

But after hearing what you wrote, maybe it is not so bad that she did. I have had several showers since my first one. It is getting easier. I never really thought my boobs defined me, and to be frank, they were such a hassle that I don't mind them gone. Still on the fence about the expanders... I am sure when everything is finished, I will feel better about my choice. I hope everyone had an awesome holiday! WE ALL HAVE SO MUCH TO BE THANKFUL FOR!   ",

The second day after surgery was the worst day ever, and I am glad I made it through all that pain. I think a large part of the pain was caused because they filled my TE's with 350cc, and it felt like my ribs were broken. 5 weeks later, I lost my TE on the cancer side due to necrosis. That was very traumatic for me. I had to clean my wound for a week, twice a day, before I was able to have surgery. I have been living with one TE and one flat. The TE side feels great. I almost feel like I have a real boob (aside from the hardness of the TE) but the sensation is good. The cancer side is a totally different matter. If I touch one area, I get pain in another - almost as if all my nerves got mixed up or something. I too have total numbness on the backside of my arm where the nodes were taken. My DH does not understand, and grabs me there sometimes, which is most uncomfortable. I was told the numbness would most likely never go away. Got fitted for a sleeve and it should be here this week. I am looking forward to that because I think it might help my arm feel better. Sometimes, when I move in certain directions, I get what feels like an insane Charlie Horse on the outside part of my upper arm... really hurts. Still have a ton of swelling on my torso where my arm falls, and worry that it will never go away! I am having my TE replaced this next week on the 17th. I thought I would be okay without having a boob, but turns out I do want it back! My big concerns are necrosis again and the drain! I think part of the swelling is from when they pulled my last drain out! Oh, did that hurt! I so hope I won't have a drain this next week!  I am looking forward to moving on with my life and being able to handle simple chores around the house. I am thinking maybe in a year I will start to be able to really put all this behind me.       Just thankful the cancer is out!  ",
