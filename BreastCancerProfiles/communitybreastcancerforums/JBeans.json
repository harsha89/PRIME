Although everyone is different I felt mentally a bit calmer as soon as my surgery was complete. I too arranged things so I didn't miss much work and in hindsight maybe that wasn't the best for my mental health. I didn't tell my mom about me until a week after my surgery. I grappled with waiting so long but decided to do it that way as she had been going through so much already and wasn't handling what she already had on her plate all that well. You'll know best when and how. You also may want to talk to your neice about what is happening to you once you have a plan in place. I told my 2 and 5 year olds (at the time) that I had an \"ouchy that had to get cut off by the doctor or it would make me sick\". Both accepted that without any problem. A few months later I told my now 6 year old that it was cancer after he pestered me about why I was going to see the doctor again and again. Good-luck!",

Exercise , themedication, and the surgery make me feel empowered to handle this. I only last week found out that my tumors were grade 2 and I've not been told a stage by my doctors either. You will move forward and get on, you can handle this. Good luck.",
