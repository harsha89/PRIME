As I had a holiday Booked with my 3 Kids aged 3, 7 and 14, to florida, the surgeon told me to go ahead on hols and she would operate to remove all nodes on the 15th aug,(I'm back in ireland on the 10th aug, she also wants to do a second incision as the clearance was only half mm. After reading your posts I'm now more frightened as I am beginning to think my surgeon is to laid back and that I should have pushed her to operate sooner so I could get treatment started. Also s he told me she was doing a routine cat scan, however I've read this is only done if they think the cancer has spread. The surgeon told me I wasn't a stage iv, but might be a stage 3, when I looked panicked she told me I could still be a 2 or maybe a 1. I'm beginning to think she is telling me anything and I am defo regretting coming on holidays before treatment. Has anyone any advice as I am cried out.",
