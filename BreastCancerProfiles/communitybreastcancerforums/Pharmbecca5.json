I will pray for us both in the days coming forth because this waiting is so horrible! I am trying to think on the positive side and think of the statistics. Try to get rest as much as u can and hopefully this time will pass quickly for both of us!",

I looked up what it means and understand the numbers but my doc never told me what number I am. I even called the nurse and had her read the report. Should I be worried she didn't give me more info? At this point I'm pretty much driving myself crazy. Hoping for news by Friday! Log in to post a reply",

The nurse called to check on me and said the labs haven't come back yet so I have another night to get thru. I've changed my mind so many times in the last few days over whether it will come back benign or not. I wish I could just give this one over to God but I'm really struggling. Log in to post a reply",

I'm trying to not think negatively but that's all I seem to be capable of right now. I'm getting married this year and I've been so happy for the last couple of years with the love of my life that all I can think is maybe I was just too happy. I'm only 32 and I think about the babies we want to have and how this changes everything. I remember the night my mom got diagnosed like yesterday. I was 17 and I stayed up with her all night. I have never seen my mother like that before or since. Is it so wrong to not want to endure that too? Anyway I'm incredibly tired so nothing makes sense right now...
