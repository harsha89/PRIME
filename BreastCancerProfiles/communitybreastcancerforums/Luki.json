I've had shooting pain in my breasts for years, with or without a bra. Also the skin now has a bit of a shine to it and seems drier than usual. I have also just been diagnosed with PCOS (if relevant, I was told it may increase the risk of breast cancer). I have tried to self-check but they are so large that it's a bit more than a single handed job. Should I be concerned? Or is this normal? Log in to post a reply",

Unfortunately, my doctor has just retired. I'm currently looking for another one. My last doctor was slightly concerned about my breasts growing so much over such a long period of time and from such a young age.",
