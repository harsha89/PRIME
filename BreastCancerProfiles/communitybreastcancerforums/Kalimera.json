Who knows how it would go if they let her alone - with good energy level, with untuched breast, with good blood test... She feels now like this medical assistant distroyed her in a very quick and strong way. I feel quilty that I didn't force her to do the check up earlier and now because I force her to start it all... ",

Only think I got - it's a paperwork after the hospitalization. I try my best to translate it. The question is: Do you really see the signs that situation is hopless and it's too late to perform any surgery? They took a painful biopsy from her breast only. They seemed like theye did pretty big cut and a few stiches. After that her breast is not feeling and looking as good as it was before, started to feel some pain. The discribed sizes of the tumers doesn't look very big. She doesn't feel any other discomfot any where in her body. Ocasional low temp and lowered appetite lately.     I feel like her doctor didn't do enough to help her. Is it because of the age??? She is very strong lady, her blood results were very good before the start of treatments. ....Also she is planing to stop the chemotherapy.... I'm not sure if it is a right desision. Also she was NOT prescribed to ANY other madication or hormonal treatment. Just 6 chemotherapy's  every 3 weeks and NOTHING in between. Does it mean that doctors can not do much in her age or just neglected her? Time is passing by I'm planing my trip very soon.  Do you think there is some possible medicine/  surgery or different chemo would be beter to extend and to improve her life quality?

Abviously she got some cold. In her age and after the chemo she is so vulnerable. She is very unlucky to get this cancer at her age. Dispite how strong she is she still doesn't have enough energy to deal with all chemo treatments. It's very scary when I read your story. You are very strong to fight and to come back for the next treatment again. Please stay strong and safe for yourself and for your family. Best wishes!",
