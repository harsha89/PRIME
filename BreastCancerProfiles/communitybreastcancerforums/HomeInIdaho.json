My grandmother died of this disease.  I am post-menopausal due to surgery and am using the Estring.  Prior to using this I was having severe yeast infections and moderate to severe vaginal dryness.  My PA at my gynocologist is fine with me using this as she says the Estring does not give out high dosages of estrogen and it does not involve the bloodstream to the extent that it would raise my estrogen levels.  I just started going to a new family practice doctor who is right out of med school and an extremely thorough doctor.  She is wanting me to remove the Estring as she says with my family history she would have nothing resembling estrogen anywhere near me.  I am confused - do I give up the benefits of the Estring which has made my quality of life better or remove it?
