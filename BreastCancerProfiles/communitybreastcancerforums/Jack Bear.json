I just noticed that one underarm is noticably more swollen than the other. There is also a tender lump on my upper arm, above the armpit, when I raise my arms. There is no corresponding lump on the other side. I'm trying to figure out if I should call my GYN office to see if they want to take a look before my mammogram, or if I should just wait until after my mammogram. The lumps are not new. However I just noticed the easy to see difference in size. I want to be smart and not sound like a hypochrondiac. Thanks♥️",
