My question to my doctor, because of what I've read in studies, is that some of the mets do not respond to the type of treatment I was receiving for my breast (estrogen positive) and that the mets could actually need different type of treatment.  the only way to do it is to biopsy some of the mets.  If they are on the spine, it can be too dangerous.  But I still want to check this path as I'd like to life a few more years! hope this info is helpful.  ",

I am still wondering though if anyone decided not to do radiation after a lumpectomy or mastectomy? thanks again! love,Christine",
