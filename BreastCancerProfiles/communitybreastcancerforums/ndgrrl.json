I have not posted in quite awhile here as I had surgery then internal radiation and didn't have to have chemo( Oncho Score 18) I realize from reading all your posts that if I had had to have chemo you all would have been there for me. I feel bad as I can not offer advise to anyone about chemo or external rads, as my journey was a lil different. That article about sadness and about the uncertainty of the future really hit home. I sometimes practically make myself ill thinking it will come back since I didn't have chemo or because of internal radiation. Nothing is guaranteed and really truly its all scarey!!! I think of all of my Aug sisters and wish you all well..:)",

      "Content": "Oct 25, 2013 06:18PM - edited Oct 25, 2013 06:20PM by ndgrrl I have posted this on other boards so if you havseen it before I appologize.I was finally out and about today- Had my fluid in my breast aspired on Wed- feeling a bit better but sore. But my mood was better today. Someone told me I should write down my story- so I thought I would start.. The story I am posting here really did happen to me- It just shows that sometimes though U want to cry U can laugh... My sister nearly fell off her chair when I came back from the clinic that day and I told her what happened. She said - well if something unusual is gonna happen- it will happen to you. I guess I keep her and my life interesting!! I hope you can read it and Laugh with me!!! My clinic definitely must think I am some kind of hysterical freak. I went to have a pap had not had one in 5 years, because my GP passed away and I just never wanted to have the new GP give me one (I am extremely conservative) So after I was diagnosed with breast cancer I thought I best have one- so it took all I could do (I so HATE paps) to go to the clinic. I anxiously waited a half hour in the regular waiting room.  I finally get called back and put into an examining room- gown on- boobs poking out the front- I have to re-dress to hunt down a nurse for an adult size gown. Shamoo himself could have fit into the gown I got. But boobs covered OK- all set.  I wait and wait and wait- 45 more minutes goes by- no magazines-no books, only thing to look at is the tray of contraptions, which my eyes are riveted to, that will soon be used in my HOO HAA. I was not too thrilled to be looking at them in such great detail! Some of the tools I would look at and think WTH is that for??  Finally after all this time I cannot stand it anymore and I remember a bathroom next door, so Shamoo gown wrapped around me 3 times, I head next door to the bathroom. A little while later, I open the bathroom door only to hear the nurses say-\" Let\u2019s go straighten up room 7. I hurry back next door and LOW AND BEHOLD I am room 7!!  The nurse finds me in room 7 a few min later and says- \"whaaa- you are still here?\" I said yes and my panic and anxiety are in over drive by this point!!! I say, \u201cI am just leaving.\u201d  My appointment was at 3:45 and it is now 5:00 and I still need to go to the lab for my blood work and I figure the lab is closing at 5. So I proceed to tell the nurse she can clean up the room as I am leaving anyway as soon as I can get dressed. The nurse grabs me by the arm puts her other arm across my shoulders will not let me dress or leave and says real close to my face, I feel like I am a 90 year old crazy deaf lady-- \u201cYou have cancer. You need this pap. I promise you he will be quick, I won't leave you, you cannot leave, and you have to get this done. Let\u2019s get you on the table.\u201d She is acting like I am scared of the doctor and a lunatic to boot!!  I am not scared of the doctor. I just do not want to be naked anymore and I don\u2019t want my HOO HAAA subjected to any of those torture devices that I had been staring at all this time!! Plus I really did not want to miss going to lab for my blood tests. I did not tell her this though. She was too busy trying to keep me from running out the door Shamoo gown and all, I was to that point!  Meanwhile the doctor walks in with a baffled look on his face wondering, I am sure, what all the commotion is about, and she slams the door practically in his face and says, \"We are having a little anxiety problem here, it will be ok soon, come back later\u201d. At this moment I wanted nothing more than to be gone. I told that nurse over and over but she insisted lab would wait for me and this would soon be done.  Finally she talks me into sitting on the torture (in my mind it is) table- puts my butt on the very edge- feet in the stirrups puts the table up to highest position ( I guess she felt I would not jump off it when it was far in the air) and covers my legs with a blanket- but I am certain my HOO HAA is feeling a breeze.. Nurse says\" Let me grab the Doctor-I will be right back.\"  I wait and wait and wait - thinking OMG the janitor is going to walk in at any moment and get the full view of my Hoo Haaa-- 15 minutes goes by, my back cannot handle those stirrups anymore and I pull my tush slowly up to the top of the table crab walking as I go so I can get my legs out of those stirrups!! I thought to myself, what happens if I fall off this table with my Hoo Haa in the air? Will this Shamoo gown cover it all?  I am sitting there when the nurse comes in again- she says \u201cOh, you were not comfortable?\" I wanted to say YA THINK?? Hoo Haaa in the breeze with my legs apart- how comfy is this - U have to ask? But nice me stays silent. She said.\" Well I cannot find the doctor but when I do we will be right in\" ( I figured he ran for the hills after the conversation he had come across earlier) .  I then sat there seriously debating how to dive off the table without tripping over the Shamoo gown when the Doctor kind of squeamishly does finally come back in. I will say he was quick!!- I heard him say something to the effect that \" He only had one chance at this so he best do it right\" Then he was ready to run out the door and he decided last minute to check my ovaries and the nurse - said-- Aren\u2019t U going to do her breast exam?  I had just that very day told that nurse I had just recently been diagnosed with breast cancer and had been examined the last three weeks by every mammogram, ultra sound, doctor and intern out there and that I DID NOT need another breast exam! I proceeded to tell her again and the doctor just that. The doctor said. \"She is fine\" and this time did run out the door!  My girlfriend said he usually talks to her while wearing the gown but he came back after I was fully dressed and we had a chat where he stayed far across the room. I must have appeared like I would bolt out the door if he came close to me. I asked if I could have some Ativan for anxiety and before I could get the words all the way out of my mouth he had prescription pad in hand writing out a large dosage.    I never did tell him I had been forgotten in a room and then left in the stirrups. I probably should have, but by that time it was near 5:30 and I still needed lab work.  My appointment that day was 3:45 and I got out of the clinic at nearly 6 pm. I do not know if I can ever muster up enough courage to go through all that again!!  So I can imagine what that clinic must think of me- They must think \" How did she ever birth two children when she acts like a 16 year old virgin getting her first pap!!\"  So yup- when it comes to clinics thinking I am nuts- I think I rank right up there!!

I did just that today and they told me I was supposed to have a 6 month follow up on right breast( the breast I had the lumpectomy in) So I got ahold of the breast center and the nurse there rattles off that I had a suspicous looking complicated cyst at 11:00 in my breast that they noticed when they did the biopsy at 12:00. The same breast that cancer was found in( this was just in July) Now they just want to watch the 11:00 mass. WTH??? is what I am thinking- NO ONE told me about any of this. I mean couldnt they just have biopsied it while I was there if it was suspicious and taken care of it when I had surgery in that same breast- what is this 6 month waiting thing, and then if it is something, does that mean I have to go through all this again? They did put me through to the doctor who had did my biopsy and she talked to me for quite awhile and I also mentioned to her about the ball of hardness under my incision and she is suspecting I have a seroma. She told me when I see the NP( was able to up that appt to this Wed) and if she thinks that it is also a seroma that they could possibly check out the other mass at the same time if I can get fitted in for an appointment. I am two hours from the facility so I really do hope they can \"fit me in\" I really really really thought this was getting better and it was past- but what the heck!!! I just do not understand their reasoning behind waiting 6 months when I was having surgery anyway! Any one else heard of anything like this? Talk about FREAKING OUT!!! Sigh..:(",

Finally after all this time I cannot stand it in that room anymore and I remember a bathroom next door, so Shamoo gown wrapped around me 3 times, I cautiously head next door to the bathroom, in my state of half dress I am leery of running into other patients. A little while later, I open the bathroom door only to hear the nurses say-\" Let\u2019s go straighten up room 7.\u201dÂ  I hurry back next door and LOW AND BEHOLD I am room 7!! The nurse finds me there a few min later and says, \"whaaa- you are still here?\" My panic and anxiety are in over drive by this point!!! I say, \u201cI am just leaving.\u201d Little did I know the struggle that would ensue from those three simple words that didn\u2019t seem to set well with the nurse. My appointment was at 3:45 and it is now 5:00 and I still need to go to lab for my blood work before it closed, I assumed, at 5:00. So I proceed to tell the nurse she can clean up the room as I am leaving anyway as soon as I can getÂ dressed to go to lab before it closed. The nurse grabs me by the arm puts her other arm across my shoulders will not let me dress or leave and says real close looking into my face--I now feel like I am a 90 year old crazy deaf lady-- \u201cYou have cancer. You need this pap. I promise you he will be quick, I won't leave you, you cannot leave, and you have to get this done. Let\u2019s get you on the table.\u201d She is acting like I am scared of the doctor and a lunatic to boot!! I am not scared of the doctor. I just do not want to be naked anymore and I don\u2019t want my hoo haa subjected to any of those torture devices that I had been staring at all this time!! Plus I really did not want to miss going to lab for my blood tests. I live an hour from the clinic, so coming back was not really an option. I did not tell her this though. She was too busy trying to keep me from running out the door Shamoo gown and all, I was to that point! Meanwhile the doctor walks in with a baffled look on his face wondering, I am sure, what all the commotion is about, and the nurse shuts the door practically in his face and says, \"We are having a little anxiety problem here, it will be ok soon, come back later.\u201d At this moment I was embarrassed, and near tears and wanted nothing more than to be gone. I told that nurse this over and over but she insisted lab would wait for me and this would soon be done. Finally she talks me into sitting on the torture (in my mind it is) table- puts my butt on the very edge, feet in the stirrups, puts the table up to highest position (I guess she felt I would not jump off it when it was so far in the air) and covers my legs with a blanket, but I am certain my hoo haa is feeling a breeze. She has the room set up like a pit crew tire change at Nascar, packages were open, hoo haa contraption lights were on, gloves were out, garbage can lid was open, she had it ready to go. Nurse says\" Let me grab the doctor-I will be right back.\" I wait and wait - thinking OMG the janitor is going to walk in at any moment and get the full view of my half blanketed hoo haa-- 15 minutes goes by, my back cannot handle those stirrups anymore and I slowly pull my tush up to the top of the table crab walking as I go so I can get my legs out of those stirrups!! I peer over the edge of the table and think to myself, \u201cWhat happens if I fall off this table with my hoo haa in the air? Will this Shamoo gown cover it all?\u201d I am sitting there when the nurse comes in again- she says \u201cOh, you were not comfortable?\" I wanted to say YA THINK?? hoo haa in the breeze with my legs apart- how comfy is this - U have to ask? But I am nice and stay silent. She then said.\" Well I cannot find the doctor but when I do we will be right in\" (I figured he had ran for the hills after the conversation he had come across earlier between the nurse and I.) I then sat there seriously debating how to dive off the table without being tripped up in Shamoo gown when the Doctor, seeming nervous, finally comes back in. I will say he was quick! I heard him say something to the effect that \" He only had one chance at this so he best do it right\" Then he was ready to run out the door and decided last minute to check my ovaries by poking my bellyÂ when the nurse - said-- Aren\u2019t U going to do her breast exam? That statement had just opened up a new wave of anxiety and my face and the white knuckled death grip on the front of Shamoo gown must have told it all. Maybe to most women this wouldn\u2019t be a problem, but to me taa taaas and hoo haa exams go hand and hand.(no pun intended)Â  I do not like one as well as the other. I had thatÂ very day justÂ told that nurse I had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer and had been examined the last three weeks by every mammogram, ultra sound, doctor, nurse practitioner and intern out there and that I DID NOT need another breast exam! I proceeded to tell her and the doctor just that. The doctor simply said. \"She is fine\" and this time did run out the door! My girlfriend said the doctor usually talks to her while she is still wearing the gown but he came back after I was fully dressed and we had a chat where he stayed far across the room. I must have appeared like I would bolt out the door if he came close to me. I asked if I could have some Ativan for anxiety for my upcoming surgery and before I could hardly get the words all the way out of my mouth he had prescription pad in hand writing out a large dosage. I never did tell him I had been forgotten in a room and then left in the stirrups. I probably should have, but by that time it was past 5:30 and I still needed lab work. My appointment that day was 3:45 and I got out of the clinic at nearly 6 pm. I truly do not know if I can ever muster up enough courage to go through all that again!! So I can imagine what that clinic must think of me. They probably think \" How did she ever birth two children when she acts like a 16 year old virgin getting a first pap!!\" So yup- when it comes to clinics thinking people are nuts- I think I rank right up there!!

I qualified for high dose internal radiation so that was done twice a day for 5 days and then a trip to the ER and a couple days in the hospital for dehydration.Â  My sister was diagnosed with breast cancer the day I went to the ER, but she is also doing well.

As I look back I realize how nothing is cut and dry- everyone is different and every decision has to be made quickly for what you want for yourself. No one can tell us what to do. I have had people come up to me and say why didn't you just cut them off?Â  Then you would be done. and I just say that is not what I wanted. if I need to at some point then I will decide that now. Its been one learning year for sure!! I wish everyone well!! :)",

I have had numerous surgeries while on my meds and the meds keeps my bp under control. My bp is always a bit high when I go to the clinic even on my meds because of my nerves but they never have worried about that and know its nerves. The BP meds made me sleepy at first so I just took them at night before I went to bed. I would ask the surgeon to wait until the meds kick in. If I remember correctly it didn't take very long for them to work. I remember having to go in a month after I was put on them and they were working already at that time. I have been on the same one- same dose since and that was about 10 yrs ago. Good luck.",

I was bruised for about 4 weeks from our local mammo truck. She got a good picture. My surgeon was appalled and said that was unacceptable. I had heard rumors on how painful it was to get a Mammo and it was. They are scaring women away because of it. The breast center is far less painful. I was 44 when DXed",

This coming Friday Sept 6th they will be inserting a contura balloon into the cavity that is left from the cancer. I will then start internal radiation twice a day forÂ 5 days and they will then take out the balloon. I have yet to meet anyone else who has had internel radiation.I was wondering if anyone out there has had it and what the side effects were for them?",
