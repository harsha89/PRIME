I tell everyone newly diagnosed to get a double mastectomy and get your centinal nodes biopsied. Also, get a complete hysterectomy. AND because you are pr er positive, get on hormone therapy. I have a nine year old and I was just diagnosed with advanced stage 4 metastatic. I started with a stage 1 and then a stage 11 in 2003 and then 2014. I wished I had done a double mastectomy in 2003 and a hysterectomy. I seriously do not thing I would be faced with this if I had done that in the begining. AND no reconstruction. No matter what people say, it covers up new or recurrances. It does. Save your life and do all the most extreme treatment. I wish I had. You can do this! You have an early stage. Get it taken care of. Best wishes to you.",
