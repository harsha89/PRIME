I underent the normal chemo treatment, bilateral mastectomies, implants, radiation and finally felt that part of my life was over. I scanned every 6 months and always clean scans. My last was Oct 2008. I started anaesthesia school and got pregnant with my third, first since breast cancer. I was considered Cured. Then 7 months into my pregnancy I discovered a rather large lump on my chest that continued to grow. I was certain it was cancer but kept quite to all because my sons health was all that mattered. I delivered a healthy baby boy jan 6, 2011. Week later had ct scan that showed mets to my lungs, chest wall, 3rd rib and lots of lymph nodes. Iv had every test known to man and everything else is well. I did 6 doses of abraxain and gemzar with zometa. had another set of scans and it shrunk 40%. so i have continued to sta on this regamind while Im trying to get approved for mass dose chemo with stem cell transplant. I know this research is unclear but some women did get cureed just the not majority. But lets face it a 1% cure rate is worth trying for. If i dont do this I will be on chemo forever because I am tripple negative. I have looked at all of the research and lets face it it sucks for us stage 4 woman, but I refuse to die. I am going to somehow find the cure. But its hard. Its hard to deal with the emotions of all this. I have a 7, 5, and 4 month old. they are my life and deserve a mother. Im not scared to die I am scared for them, I dont want this for them. I was just wanting to know what others are on, what their response has been. Also how to deal with the though I may die soon. I am completley healthy looking and feeling besides the chemo. I also was five years out and it came back, not fair. Dx 1/21/2011, IDC, Stage IV, Grade 3, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Of course everyone is individualized.  That takes into account the ones to die and they found out they had mets and the ones who live 20 years. Its just an average.  I had my doctor tell me several times if this treatment doesnt work you have less than 3 months.  lucky for me both times the treatment worked well. I am 30 with 3 kids the youngest is 18 months. I was dx in nov 2006 with stage 2 did treatment and was fine will i gave birth jan 2011. I knew it was back just didn't realize it was so bad.  It was just about to crush my heart and i was put on gemzar and abraxaine.  It worked well shrinking it by 50% in that 3 month time frame they gave me. I then underwent a stem cell transplant, and a trial drug after that failed. In April I was told it was bad again and if this next treatment doesnt work 3 months. Lucky for me it worked it is completley out of my lungs and has shrunk in my sternum and lymph node by 80%. Although this is great news, my tumor markers are starting to climb so most likely time to switch treatments again.  He said we have about 6 options. I m willining to try all 6 and then some. I beleive attitude and will determin when it beats us. I refuse to not live and absolutly normal active life and I will not die. On days im real sick I can see how ppl die from it. If it wasn't for my kids and hubby I would just give up. It would be easier. But for the next 30 years Iv chosen to fight!",

Each week it seems to be harder and harder for me.  I of course have good and bad days, and I spend the good days full of fun and memories the kids will have, but the bad days like today are so hard. I made it to my sons track meet, but slept from the time we got home till now. I feel like I miss so much. I try my hardest to stay awake and push through the pain so they dont notice anythind is wrong. But the older they get the smarter they get.",

THe emotions of the thought of motherless are so are to deal with. I know I am leaving them with a wonderful father, but I honestly feels it take two loving parents. I know my husband does his best and he is WONDERFUL. just tonight after my oldests sons track meet I was so tired I feel asleep at five. He fixed dinner, cleaned, did homework, and made their lunches, woke me up when it was time to say good night so I could see them.  He took care of out seven year old, fiver year old and four month old during the ardest time of the day. Few short hours to get it all in. He also then spent the next hour helping me feel better and getting me back to sleep. I am blessed to have him. Everyday he gives me strength to go on, and helps me maximize my time with the kids. Hes completely taken over the house hold duties for me to conserve my energy for the kids. He was laid off of work a month ago. Its great having home, not sure how I could do it otherwise, but unemployment wont last forever. Im hopeing to do the mass does chemotherapy and stem cell transplant in July now. Insurance company wont pay so I have a 175,000 bill that I have to pay 1/4 next month and then monthly payments for the next 24 months. Im gonna do it, I think it will be worth it. I feel the cure is in this research they just havent figured out who it works on yet. I pray everynight it will work for me. It has to. I can not imagine my kids growing up with out me. From the day my oldest was concieved my life has been for them, I wouldnt want life any other way. No one else can be a mother to them.",

I know it cured some women in the past, they just cant pin point who and when it cures. I was in nurse anaesthesia school this timewith diagnoses, so I did my own research on treatments. I beleive in it so much that I am paying for it with all I amd everyone else in my family had after the insurance comany has denied it. I am not willing to accept I must endure chemo for the rest of my life and that I have a 2 year expetancy to live. I have to live till Im 80, or atleast 50.",

I find myself not wanting to make plans to far out, and cram everything into today. I have chemo every week for two weeks then off one. My off weeks I am always taking the kids somethwere. We have been to jamacia, flordia, wisconsin dells, have  aarizona trip planned and another huge family fl vacation. I just want them to have a great memoris and this house just makes me feel sicker. I love the warm sone and sand, but will run out of vacation money soon. The insurance company denied my mass does chemo with stemcell transpant, so I am paying for it on my own. Of course going to throw bennefits to help with the cost, but my entier family will be broke after this. I pray it works, I need that cure, atleast till my kids are grown. If nothing else I will get to go off chemo for a couple years. That alone is worth the money. Side effects are horrible.",
