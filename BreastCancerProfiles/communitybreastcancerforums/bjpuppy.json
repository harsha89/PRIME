I'm having major nail problems too but my onc doesn't want me to see a podiatrist until I see him first.  In the meantime I'm using anti fungal medicine (otc) in hopes of preventing what may be inevitable (nail loss).  I'm a teacher and heading back to work next week.  I hope I can keep up the pace. Thanks again for being there.  It helps to know I'm not alone.",
