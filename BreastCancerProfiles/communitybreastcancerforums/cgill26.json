I know many ladies personally who did well with some difficulty but it worked and they got through it a lot better then they imagined.  They have been free for yrs. of cancer.  People are very compassionate don't try to hold all this in on your own,  Some of the side effects could make this not such a secret!  I have seen good looking re-construction too!  You will be surprised of how many of us are out there and you'd have no idea! Chin up, get the junk out and enjoy something devilish like choc. cake.  It isn't going to hurt you!!!!!!!!!  Wash it down with an ice cold coke too.I will think of you daily.  I have been CA free for almost seven yrs.  I still have brief panic moments it will return and think I will till something else gets me.  There are many out there like me too!!  Hang In, CG",
