But I do not criticize her for it. If I knew about my genetic mutation beforehand, I would have done the same. I had never even heard about it before I was diagnosed 3 years ago. At least she has made more public awareness about Genetic Mutations and breast cancer, and how to reduce your risk. Now she will have to follow up with her children later on I life too. Maybe by then they can find a way to block the gene. We can always hope. Envy is one thing, but jealousy is never healthy....you can tell by reading some of these threads.",

However, this is a great way to chat with others in the same situation. I had my journey last year this time. Mastectomy, chemo (AC Taxol), radiation. I had hair down to my low back. I cut it to the chin level, then a bit of a longer pixie when I started treatment. As it fell out to almost bald, I shaved it all. Got a wig. Now have a full head of brown wavy hair that is about 2 inches!  No fancy drugs or caps.  I lived in my scarves. They were comfortable. At home, my two young teen boys got used to the bald head. My son used to rub it like a Genie Lamp. Said he was making wishes for recovery! ha ha.....You will get through it. It is a tiring journey, but with friends or family...or both...you will get through it.  My only comment with AC Taxol (and everyone is different)...the vomiting was terrible. So I got an RX for \" Emend\".   No vomiting after that first week without it!  Wonder drug.   The constipation is brutal!  Benefibre, prunes, water water water.   Keep moving. Go for walks. Learn to paint. And only take it one cycle at a time.   Good luck, and I pray everyday for every woman that is diagnosed, that her journey will be a smooth one.",
