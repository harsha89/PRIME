A week ago today, during the treatment, I had an excruciating pain in my rib (not from the radiation - from the ridiculously hard table). I couldn't move or flinch because I was in the middle of being zapped with the radiation. Afterwards, I told the technicians and they said that all the women complain about rib bruising. I said \"it was not a bruise - something broke\". I spoke to the doctor, who sent me for rib x-rays - which didn't show anything. But rib fractures don't always show up on x-rays. The doctor said that since there is no treatment for fractured ribs (they don't tape it up or anything), they would continue to do the radiation sessions the same way whether the rib was broken or not. So I have, indeed, continued lying on the rib for my radiation sessions all this past week. I was in agony this weekend. But the alternative would be having them re-simulate my therapy in a supine position and doing the radiation on my back. Since I'm large-breasted and the tumor was in my left breast, close to the chest, there is no way that I want to do supine radiation. So I'm forced to \"tough it out\". I hate this. I'm not 100% sure that it's the bone itself that is broken or the cartilage surrounding the rib. Apparently, they are both excruciating and take a while to heal. I googled pictures of prone breast radiation and saw some beautiful comfortable-looking tables (including cushioned face cradles - mine is just a flat board and I have to turn my poor neck all the way to the side). I showed the pictures to the doctor and she said that a number of the manufacturers have been demonstrating those types of tables to the hospital staff but the staff members don't feel that these tables would work appropriately. Of course they could simply explain the shortcomings to the manufacturers and have them re-design the tables. In the meantime, they will not allow me to use any sort of cushioning on the table. Oh, and by the way, I'm having my cancer treatment at one of the world's top cancer hospitals: Sloan Kettering. You would think they'd have a better setup, no? I'm so sorry for what you're going through, Dauna. This really hurts and I hope we both feel better soon. In the meantime, ice packs feel good but you have to make sure you don't put them on your breast - just your rib (we're not supposed to use ice packs on our radiated ribs because it affects the blood flow).

It's completely open. I'm also claustrophobic so I can tell you that's not an issue. For the prone breast MRI and the MRI-guided needle biopsy, I had to take Atavan because I was going to be inside the MRI tube. That said, though, the breast MRI bothered me less than a normal one when you're on your back. With the breast MRI, you're facing down with your face in a cradle so if you open your eyes, you see a lot more space between you and the machine than you do when you're lying face-up. Anyway, the prone breast table is just a hard table with an open space for your breast to hang down. The machine that radiates you stays to the side of the machine and zaps your breast underneath the table. The table itself is hard and it's very uncomfortable on your ribs (see my last post about breaking my rib). So THAT sucks, but you won't be claustrophobic!",

Now I'm just back to worrying about my boob!",

      "Content": "Apr 11, 2018 06:45PM - edited Apr 11, 2018 06:48PM by OwMahBoob Hiya... I am having mine done at Memorial Sloan Kettering in NY. No face cradle and my head is turned to the right and flat on the table, which is really uncomfortable on my neck because I have a herniated disk. It's the worst the first day because they have you in that position much longer getting you set up. And then once a week, they take X-rays, and you have to stay still in that position longer again. The rest of the time is tolerable. 3 more sessions and then they will flip me onto my back for the boosts. Frozen, the reason for the bruising/fracturing is because your body weight is pretty much concentrated in your rib area which is pressing against the hard table as well as the edge of the hard table, which, in my case, pressed between two ribs. Dauna, where did you have yours done when you broke your ribs? VLH, you're smart to keep your arm like that. Yesterday I was favoring my rib and had my right arm up over my head and pressed down on it to try to take weight off of my rib. I also have capsulitis history in that shoulder and when we finished, my shoulder was in agony. : ( I came home and held ice on it for 3 hours and then my wonderful hubby gave me a neck/shoulder massage and I love him forever because it helped so much!!

I have to say that it was a lot more comfortable being on my back for the boosts. Nevertheless, if I had to do it over, I'd still do the full-breast radiation prone. Yes, my rib still hurts (well, not nearly as bad as it did a few weeks ago). But I had zero skin damage and I'm not worried about having had exposure to my heart and/or lungs. So for anyone considering doing the prone, just make sure that when you're lying on the table you try to arrange yourself so that your rib isn't taking the brunt of your body weight. Press with your stomach or leg muscles to have them take more of the weight. It's not easy to do that - it's subtle but it does help.",
