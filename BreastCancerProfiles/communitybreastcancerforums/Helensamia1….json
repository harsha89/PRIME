Over the last few years my legs have become weaker and over the last few months walking has become very difficult... Before Christmas I could no longer manage at home so came into this rehabilitation hospital in Sydney...

Trouble is she does not believe in the diagnosis even though given by two Neurologists and after ayear of tests... She says she spoke to a radiologist and they have nevr seen it in the lower limbs!!!! Though rare it does exist but one battles the lack if knowledge and there lack if how to treat you... I had heard before the use of wafarin and was going to start on this before I came into hospital... My neurologist was going to prescribe this so I am sure he would do the Pentitoxifyline as it is far more stable than wafarin and does not require blood tests.. ... The vitamin E is to thin the blood too??? Will look at the link you included... Not sure how I feel about surgery as it is quite experimental and looking on the internet there is far more on upper body even for Quadraplegics with different diagnosis... At least there is a little hope here even if a slight improvement",

I was diagnosed with Lumbar Plexopathy two weeks ago .... A late effect of radiation to the pelvis 12 years ago!!! Very rare 0.03% world wide... My cancer did not reoccure but I have had Lymphedema for 12 years ... And now this.. I have numbness, pins and needles and weakness in my legs that has gradually progressed over past two years... For most of that I blamed the  symptoms on Lymphedema.. I have difficulty walking upstairs and walk in general very slowly now... If anyone has links to info that would be great it has been near impossible to find info on this... I am I touch with a lady in the USA... She is now in a wheel chair ten years after diagnosis ... I feel like I try to fix the LE by a LNT and I have another issue pop up.. ",

This is one link to Dr Sylvie Delanian but not sure if you can open it https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23270723_... i have some info as PDF files that Dr Delanian sent me if you would like to read them I could email them to you .. Interesting thing is that those I have connected with some have LE as well.. DR Delanian has been working on this research for more than 14 years.. It seems she started with the Vitamin E and Pentoxifylline and has then added the other medications as trials have progressed. It is thought that it is to late to see a reversal of my situation as the nerves are so badly damaged but the hope is that the protocol could help the nerve pain, lymphoedema, future bowel or bladder problems and stop any further damage, although I do feel the degeneration has stopped.. The feeling is that if peole could have access to this early in there diagnosis that it could be more beneficial.. I am to start for 6 months and report back and then decide if I should continue though it seems results take a few years .. I have started another blog about this too https://lifeinawheelchairblog.wordpress.com happy to share any info on this for those with RIBP as the protocol is the same .. Combined treatment for 6 MONTHS: 1.toco 500 (tocopherol 500) vit E 1 tab x2/ day,MORNING/ EVENING, 7 days 2.pentoflux 400 (pentoxifylline 400) : 1 tab x2/ dayMORNING/ EVENING, 7 days Beginning with 1 tab/day during one or two weeks Then take 2/day if well tolerated 3.bonefos 800 (clodronate 800) :2 tab/day at one time in the Morning at breakfast But without milk and calcium one hour before or after 5 days, from Monday to Friday 4.cortancyl 20 (prednisone 20): 1 tab/d in the morning 2 days,Saturday and Sunday 5.omeprazole 20 (or Ranitidine 300): 1 tab/d before sleeping2 days Saturday and Sunday",

I have started Dr Delanians protocol but it maybe is to late for me as I am in a wheelchair.. Pelvic radiation... She says though that it may help with pain, lymphedema and any bowel or bladder issues.. It really is just me giving it a go.. My body ..my life .. I should not have to argue with a dr to be allowed to try.. My Radiation Oncologist is very supportive of me doing this he feels it is worth a try.. I am just sad and Angry not to have been given the chance to try this two years ago when there was not so much damage.. Why do the doctors not know of these things and why do we have to print up articles from the internet to show them!!! I had a LNT three years ago.. It has helped my Lymphedema but not cured it .. Did not help the RILP.. It seems like these medications work for some people and not for others.. Maybe that is due to the level of radiation damage to the area.. I wish that our doctor could see that our quality of life is effected and take care if us when the late stage side effects hit.... Using these medications has ro be an individual decision.. I also believe you need to take them for up to a year to see real progress and maybe even longer.. I will keep you posted on how I go plus another lady I know who has started on them .. Helen",

In Australia they are doing LNT and liposuction for more difficult cases.. I have to say that all the people I have contact with, world wide with various doctors, no one has thrown their compression away yet!!! For legs it looks as if two transfers may be needed as it is a larger area than the arms.. If anyone would like to share their surgery story with me, so I can create a post, that would be great please email me at helenbrd@bigpond.net.au This way we can create our own much needed info base where people can find out what surgery is like from a patients point of view... For me 8 months after surgery I wear a 30-40 compression stocking during the day and non at night.. My lower leg looks good the thigh could be better.. When I had the Lymphasytagraph 6 months after surgery, the tracer moved up my leg 20 minutes faster than pre surgery.... It is a slow process but I hope the nodes will grow but as they are placed in the knee I do wonder if they are needed in the groin as well... The scar on my neck where nodes were taken has nearly disappeared.. So yes I still have Lymphoedema but at this stage easier to manage but a long way from a cure!!!

My therapist also used a hand held laser on the scar tissue after the surgery where nodes were placed in knee.. It is supposed to stimulate the cells.. ie. stimulate the nodes to grow!!! Trouble is it is hard to measure outcomes as you have no idea what it would be like without!!! There is also another lady taking about her year and a half spent in Italy having surgery with Dr Campisi!!! Will put the link up for that too... She was an Australian lady who just stayed there!!!!",

Everyone is an individual and results are different for everyone so it is difficult to make comparisons with the various surgeries... Post surgery care is what most if us were not prepared for... The bandaging and MLD the first few months... Anyway this is an ongoing story and if others will join me that would be great.. Hugs to you to Binney...",

I had a LNT to my leg 14 months ago..in Australia..lower leg is the same size as my good leg and having treatment to work on the knee and lower thigh that had some fibrous tissue that needed softening.. I wear compression during the day but not at night.. So i am also heading in the right direction and hope one day to get rid of compression!! One important thing is I have not had an infection since the surgery and the Lymphasytagraph showed the dye going up my leg faster than before surgery .. In Australia we do not have the machine that does the specialist MRI to show the nodes and vessels growing.. I wish they did!!  Have my fingers crossed for you Happy Trisha that you are a candidate.. Very exciting.. Dr Chang is a good Doctor too... ",
