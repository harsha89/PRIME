I will be undergoing brachytherapy to save the breast on September 24th, followed by 5 days (2x/day) radiation delivered with the SAVI device (pending the results from pathology). I am nervous and keep second guessing my decision to save the breast rather than choosing to have a MX. At appointments, the surgeon and medical oncologist ask about pain and there had not been any... but now there is, in both the breast and armpit. I\u2019ll definitely be letting them both know tomorrow when the offices are open, but am a bit freaked out that the disease could be progressing.",
