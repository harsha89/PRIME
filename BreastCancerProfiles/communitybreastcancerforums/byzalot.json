I am a nail technician so I use my arms quite a bit. I was a little uncomfortable, but nothing that motrin didn't take care of. I think each person is different as far as recovery.  My surgeon kept using the same incision for each subsequent excision, so I have a 3 inch incision under the nipple.My SNB incision is about 2 inches. I was highly motivated to keep my breast so I kept choosing for lumpectomies. I am happy I made that decision. My Oncotype came back 18, that darn grey area, I am choosing rads followed by hormonal therapy.",
