Mass is halfway between rubbery and soft, somewhat mobile, seems fixed to subcutaneous tissue but not to skin or muscle. Feels like it is wrapped around a tendon. Node is small, hard, round and fixed. The mass was visible on ultrasound two weeks ago but the node is new. Sigh. I know it has to come out. I feel it in my gut. Should I push for dissection if my GP suggests simple excision ?

Not so great :( LUQ shows 3 separate regions with clustered punctate microcalcifications, & some focal density in the region. 2 clusters are outer LUQ. 1 is more centrally positioned within the LUQ. Microcalcifications are punctate and do not layer on the mediolateral view. ( What does that mean ?) Immediate referral for MRI followed by stereotactic core biopsy as these microcalcifications cannot be considered benign. I am 35, n/s, no relevant family history. No history of injury to my chest which might contribute to calcifications. No prior surgery or other invasive procedures. Ultrasound taken in the same area was negative. Can anyone translate this for me ? So I guess this means a high degree of suspicion and probable malignancy ? The report did not give a BiRad score. I am Canadian and have no clue if we even use that system here. My GP made a referral to a rapid assessment facility in Vancouver. Apparently they see you on avg 6 days after referral.
