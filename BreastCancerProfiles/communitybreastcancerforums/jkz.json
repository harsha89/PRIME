I got them removed on a Thursday, took my last anitbiotic on Thursday evening and ended up in the ER with 102.7 fever and redness and swelling under my breast. It looked huge and the skin on the outside side looked like and orange peel. I was in the hospital for 7 days on both IV and oral antibiotics. I am now home and continue to go daily for IV anitbiotics (I have a pic-line). Al my test for cellulitis are coming back clear. I am still a bit swollen but the PS said that this is from the second surgery that I had on April 2nd where he went in to check on the te to make sure it did not look infected. I went to the PS yesterday and though I still have a drain he did give me my first fill and seems to think everything looks great. He told me that he actually thinks that the swelling was caused by a seroma and if he was not 2000 miles (on vacation) away this could have been and out-patient procedure..He did drain 150 cc's of fluid. This was a build up from the prior 8 days when the drains were removed.  Anyway I see him again on Monday and am in no rush to have the drains removed..I'd rather be sure the fluid is gone! Thinking and praying for all og of bc friends in need :) Jennifer",
