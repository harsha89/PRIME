SCO a punch biopsy measuring 0.2 x 02. cms Microscopic: Centrally the epidermis demonstrates one nest of melanocytes at the dermo-epidermal junction compatible with junctional nevus.  The subepidermal tissues demonstrate a superficial and deep perivascular and interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate mixed with some eosinophils. Diagnosis: Junctional nevus with superficial and deep perivascular mixed dermatitis. So my question is - I don't have a mole and according to Wikipedia junctional nevus is a mole!  It was a red rash.  It was a small one - then it started to go away, and then it came back much bigger and in a few little patches that are close to each other.  It's sort of itchy at times, but my boob still feels funny.  My Dr didnt give me any referall to a dermatologist and he didnt think I needed an appt to see him.  I just picked up these reports this morning.  This biopsy was done 3 weeks ago.
