I have a large mass in left breast and just started seeing changes to nipple, yellow discharge and feeling itchiness/ pain under armpits (feels like razor burn) - presume this is swelling as well. I had thought it was just a complex cyst as I had had one in that spot several years ago. I am 51 yrs old and convinced that it is BC from all that I have read here. I have other symptoms like weight gain for past several years no matter how much I dieted and foggy brain. I have an appointment next week but I am afraid it is bad and advanced. I am driving everyone crazy with this but I am distraught at the thought. I am alone and have no one to help me. I just lost both my parents and I was their caregiver and did not have time for myself. I know I need courage but I have none and just want to move on with my life and not have to deal with anything anymore. E Log in to post a reply",
