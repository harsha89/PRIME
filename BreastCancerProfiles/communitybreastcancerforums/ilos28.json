Your father can do it surely. Well, I'm 26. I'm a young woman too, but probably because I see this things a lot (people with cancer), sometimes it worries me. I had a fibroadenoma when I was 13. It was 7cm (a very big one). It was removed a year later. All of this issue was happened at the same time that my grandma (my mother's mom) was dx with pancreatic cancer. In that time I was a child, and this things didn't bother me (I didn't know about them). In march of 2005, my grandma died of her disease (8 months after she was dx). A month later I had my operation to remove the fibroadenoma (and it was well). By the way, I didn't mention that my grandpa (my mother's dad) died in november of 2004 (he died by an ictus). So, you could say that my grandma and my grandpa died with 4-5 months apart. Anyway, right now I looked to that years and I think that my mom had to be very worried, and I feel so bad because of her. Not only because of her mother of her father but due to me too. And that's not all. My grandma's brothers (my mother's uncles too), died by stomach cancer and by throat cancer. One of my mom's brothers had brain cancer when he was 12. Well... this issue is different, because doctors said that he wouldn't live longer than a few months, and he is 53 right now. The last year, in june, the oldest one of my father's siblings, died by lung cancer. The last year, another of my dad's siblings, was dx by lung cancer too, though his tumor was removed and he was treated with chemo and radio. He is \"well\" now, but his physical condition is bad (he always has been skinny). And, well, right about now my father has told me that another of his siblings has been hospitalized due to a throat cancer (very advanced). Actually, about my uncles' cancer, (my father's siblings) the three I mentioned were men. They led a bad life or, how we say where I live, they are \"jacosos\" or \"yonkies\". They used to took drugs a lot, used to drink quite alcohol, keep smoking, etc, well, all of that things that doctors say that we shouldn't do. So, it was a matter of time that they reach their limit.  With all of this, I just want to say that, unfortunately, all of us live surrounded by people with cancer. Someone of them are our relatives, but it doesn't have why bother you. You should live your life, and as much as possible, try to eat a healthy diet and do exercise (this could help you with your fears, especially if you could practice meditation or tai-chi or something like that). Well, that you do this things it doesn't mean that you will never have cancer, but your risk is way lower. In spite of my family history, I'm trying it doesn't change my life. I want to live well and I'm going to live well.",
