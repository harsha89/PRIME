I had a breast center radiologist suggest the biopsy, and then I found a breast surgeon with a great rep and got a second opinion before I even had my stereotactic. I have a family history of BC and have my own history of abnormalities in my breast tissue prior to early menopause. I have increased change in microcalcifications from my last mam. I'm hoping to have the pathology report in the next 48 hours. One step at a time :) I didn't want to worry too much, and meditated and tried to be less anxious, but it was hard. I love these boards. I love hearing the experience of those who have gone through it before me. Best wishes.",
