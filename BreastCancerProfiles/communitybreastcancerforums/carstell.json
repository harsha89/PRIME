My biggest complaint is pain in my shoulder and around my collar bone. The PICC line is a good option. It needs more care and has a higher risk of infection because it is out of the body. Also limits some activities. I have used them in the past (as a nurse) People tend to be happy with them. I chose the port because I like to swim and it just seems less conspicuous.",

It was my first mammogram vevr.   I don't really have any magic words of wisdom. Just believe in yourself and never give up fighting!! I wish you all the best. ",

After a second biopsy that spot was also ilc with lcis. I didn't have actual lumps, but the mri was able to see something the mammo didn't. My doc also warned that the MRI could show false spots.My right breast looked clear. Not quite the same scenario, but hope it's helpful.",
