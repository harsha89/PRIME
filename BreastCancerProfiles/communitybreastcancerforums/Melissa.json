Joint Commission 7. State Board of Surgeons. 8) the CEO of the hospital- settle for none other that the CEO- they will probably have Risk Management at their side but who cares? 9) get the other two woman as suggested- there are always power in numbers but do not let one another read your letters or make them sound alike- they will be judgmental and think you 3 have a \"Bond\" which you do bit again so what?  Write one concussive letter with the addresses of each of these agencies and persons, show it to the attorney and mail it to all with Certified mail receipt that someone must sign so that you can prove you notified them.",
