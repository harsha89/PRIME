Since bc doesn't run in my family and my grade is 0 I figured I would be conservative, think positive and pray often!   Originally I planned to go with bilateral mastectomy so that everything would be symmetrical but it is a huge operation with a long recovery and since the doc thought I needed it mostly for cosmetic reasons I decided to take one thing at a time. If lumpectomy and rads take care of the problem I will count my blessings and deal with whatever I look like.  My teenage daughters are tiny and they wear \"chicken cutlets\" to enhance themselves- I can always borrow them if need be!! Thanks,  Lynne",

Both happened to be women and both said they didn't believe that I would necessarily have a problem if I chose lumpectomy and rads. I understand that the surgery and rads will make my breast smaller and there is a chance of scar tissue developing but I want to know what will happen to the implant itself. Either way, I scheduled lumpectomy for July 8th.  If margins aren't clear then I will rethink my decision.  Wondering if anyone has had rads with implants and what your experience was?
