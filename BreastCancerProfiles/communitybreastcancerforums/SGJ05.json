Anyway my onco. switched me to 5 days of Neupogen rather than 1 day of Neulasta due to my possible kidney disease and I start today. Can anyone answer a few questions for me? 1. How is the bone pain on Neupogen and does Claritin help? It helped me tremendously with the Neulasta. 2. How much is it? I know we all have different insurances and means of payment, but anyone wiling to throw an approximate out? I swear I won't hold you to it, lol--just trying to get the just? 3. How bout injection pain? And where have you self administered? I was thinking stomach or thigh? Thanks in advance for your help:) I hate having to switch, but then again, I hate the bloody urine and flank pain for 2 weeks even more,LOL:) Have a great Friday girls:)",

I had my port placed on March 24th and will be done with the TC portion of chemo. on July 15th, then Herceptin until next April:) I am going to talk to my oncologist at the next appointment. I am sure he will want to keep it in, especially since I can't use my right arm for IVs. However, if it continues to bother I am not sure what I will do? Funny how something that is supposed to help can be such a major pain too!! Thanks for replying:) I am excited to see you are almost done with your treatment too!!!! Emme--I have the EMLA cream and use it for every treatment:) I had it accessed a couple of times without it--OUCH!! Sorry you had trouble with yours too. Congrats on being done with the A/C portion of chemo., sorry about the taste disturbances. I have had major taste disturbances and metal mouth; I chew Trident Spermint gum after I eat and it has helped a ton, perhaps that may help you too.

I am doing 6X TCH every 3 weeks, Herceptin for a year, followed by Rads, as well as Tamoxifan:)  A lil background:) I am 35 y/o Mom of 3 beautiful daughters: 14 y/o, 8 y/o, and 5 y/o. I had a bilateral mastecomy with immediate reconstruction on Feb. 23rd and a port placed on March 24th. I have had 3 tissue expander fills and hope I will only need a few more to get me where I want to be. Even though this is a crummy way to meet you all, I look forward to supporting one another through this difficult process.  If you all have any questions about your first chemo. feel free to ask:) I have only had one, but am more than willing to share my experience thus far. Good Luck to those who have their first chemo. tomorrow!! May you all have minimal side effects!",

For constipation I used Sennokot S!! I took 2 the night of chemo., and 3 the day after and have not had any constipation issues. I did have some diarrhea for a couple of days, but it was not bad enough to take any meds. Metal mouth--I got the dreaded metal mouth a couple days after chemo. and it made me want to gag. I found chewing on peppermints and Big Red Gum helped take the taste away. I would not suggest Big Red if you develop mouth sores since it is so spicey. I hope this help!!! Good Luck ToughMom38 and Amosonzan-may you have an uneventful infusion day:)",

I am sorry you got sick:( But hope the worst is behind you and your side effects remain mild. I have them flush my port slowly because I too can taste it--it helped a bit:) I am going to try sucking on a mint or chewing gum next time and seeing if that works. Congrats tpcjkk on completing your first treatment:) I am sorry you have that general quesy feeling. I had that for the first few days, but it did go away for me by day 5:) I hope you are able to eat soon. I found that I did well eating potatoes, bagels, anything in the bread family. To all of you experincing side effects I hope you all feel better soon (HUGS)!!",

Unfortunately,  a week after chemo. and I am still dealing with mild back pain and mild blood in the urine. The onc. says he does not think it is from the chemo., but I find it ironic that 3 days after the last 2 chemo's I have had this problem. Thankfully I have been able to manage the pain with Darvocet on the bad days and tylenol on the mild days and have avoided anotheer hospitalization. I also scheduled an appt. with a Nephrologist next Tuesday--would you all keep your fingers crossed that we can figure this out.

      "Content": "May 28, 2010 10:31AM - edited May 29, 2010 09:47AM by SGJ05 Finally saw a Nephrologist about the blood in my urine after chemo. He believes I have IgA Nephropathy and the neulasta is setting off the bleeding! It makes sense since I have had protein in my urine since I was a little girl and was told I had a kidney condition, but that the counts were not high enough to warrant a biopsy. So it looks like after chemo. I will have a kidney biopsy and finally be given an official diagnosis. It is kind of a bummer to be dx with this. but if I do have it, I have had it all my life and have no kidney damage thus far. The only bummer about the bleeding is the pain:( I thought I was done bleeding this time round, but it started again last night and the flank pain stinks. I am taking aleve and keeping my fingers crossed it works!!! My nephrologist thought about me not having the Neulasta next time, but still needs to talk to my onc. about this. Do any of you not get Neulasta or Neupogen? I am on TCH x 6:) If you do not get it, how have your counts been?",

And I am still shaving the legs too, but am not having to do it everyday anymore. It would be nice if we could just loose the leg and arm hair, but keep our head hair, wouldn't it:) I hope you are able to enjoy the weekend. Thanks for your reponses:) I am going to ask my onc. if we could try a round without the Neulasta or at half dose. I am still having bouts of blood in my urine and I would love to avoid making it worse next week after my next cycle! I wouldn't mind so much if I had it, but the pain is a pain. Hope everyone is having a great saturday with no side effects!!!!",

To make sure I had a good night sleep before chemo, I took an Ambien. In the morning I took another dose of dex. and off I went to the Cancer center. Upon arriving, they flushed my port (have them flush slowly--I actually tasted the saline-blech) and started my pre-meds (Zofran and more lovely Dex.)--this took about 30 minutes. Once I was done with the pre-meds, they started my Herceptin. I had a larger dose for my first round, so this took about an hour and half to finish. Then came the Taxotere-about an hour, followed by carboplatin-30 minutes:) The only side effect I had on chemo. day was some blurred vision and muscle pain in my legs from the Taxotere--other than that absolutely no side effects on chemo day:) I had my Neulasta shot the following day and have been taking Claritin -- zero bone pain:) So no worries on chemo. day. Just think of it as one down!! Good Luck everyone!! May your treatment days be uneventful:)",
