Whether or not you are using any antidepressants, a little physical activity and daylight on your face can help. I am still dealing with a pain situation 8 weeks after surgery, and I have those days, I don't even want to get dressed. But I've found if all I do that day is go for a walk, I feel better, maybe not immediately, but if I try to do it almost every day, it helps. Give yourself permission to not feel pressured to pretend for anyone, especially yourself. Believe me you have earned it.",

I'll be doing 7 boosts, I have no idea what that even means, I hope they won't be worse than the regular treatments. my last day will be July 2, just in time for \"independance\" day.  Judy",
