Also with radiation you will get instructions to care for your skin because towards the end it will be like sunburn. So if you treat it the way they tell you it will not get that bad. I was told I can use corn starch and I did that this weekend and it helped.",

Ask for pain pills you will need them for a while depending on your tolerance for pain. It will get better in time. Lost my nipple. It was right under it so couldn't be helped. I have low tolerance for pain but it has gotten better as time goes by. You can email me if you want to keep in touch. The blackness doesn't hurt and the color will change back or stay. You can do research. It is from the radiation.  Radiation doesn't hurt. I did not have to go for chemo.",

I read that can happen. In the crease it is still raw. My upper arm swells and part of my upper arm seems numb. My shoulder and back hurt too. Asked doctor about sleeve and he said don't use. I am using corn starch and the moisturizer I am allowed to use. Wondering if there is anything else I can do. I can't sleep. Anti inflammatory helps for a while but who wants to live on them.  Seems like a great place to ask for help. thanks Dx 1/3/2012, IDC, 1cm, Stage I, Grade 3, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR- Log in to post a reply",
