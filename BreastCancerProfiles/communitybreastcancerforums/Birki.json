      "Content": "Birki wrote: Hi everyone. I recently found out that my BC spread to my brain. Had rads to entire brain. Waiting for follow-up MRI and maybe Gamma rads if necessary. In the  meantime, my onc is going to put me on Cisplatin every week for 9 weeks. Tykerb daily and Avastin.  I also get Herceptin every 3 weeks (no side effects).  I'm wondering about the side effects of the Cisplatin and Avastin.  I've yet to take them and I know everyone's experience can be different, but just wondering.  The Tykerb gave me a bad itchy red rash which wasn't fun so my onc took me off of it temporarily, but putting me back on it this week.  Thanks!

Thanks for the response!!!  PJB - Thank you so much for the info.  I'm so worried about being able to work during the Cisplatin. Just 9 treatments, but you just never know how bad it can get.  ",

I've heard gals say theirs stayed in shorter and some longer, it all just depends on the amount of fluid coming out.  The yellowish fluid is actually a good sign.  That's the color of the fluid that didnt' come out of me until toward the end of the 3 weeks. My surgeon said it was \"straw\" color.  I can't comment on what my incision sight looked like soon after surgery because I didn't look for a very long time.  My sister helped me with changing the dressings, bandages, etc.  She would tell me \"it looks better today\", etc.  I was so thankful that I didn't have to look in the early stages.  By the way, I found that maxi pads worked wonderful once the drain came out and I was still leaking fluid. Hang in there. It sounds like you are doing GREAT.  Let me know if you have any other questions. Marianne \"Birki\"",
