I started this journey as my youngest daughter was graduating college from biomedical engineering. I thought I might not even be able to go to her graduation. As things turned out my surgery was after her graduation and she was there for me. Unfortunately during this she was also planning on moving out of state for her PhD, she was able to cancel her summer work & just start in the fall. It has been very difficult for her also as she is also learning about this and her natural curiosity brings her to do much research. I'm sharing this only to say that you are not alone in this type of situation. Perhaps there is a type of support group you could attend or just confide Ina friend. It is never good to let your fears sit inside, better to express them. You sound like a wonderful young lady & special daughter, I wish you & your mom the best!! Positive thinking goes a long way....",

I was sick for at least 4 days, temp 103.4, severe headache, flu like symptoms. I told him this week when I saw him & he said he switched his patients to Prolia now because of the SE's. 6 months ago he says this is the best treatment for me & now he changes his mind. I started on eligard(lupron) & femera in August. This was to prevent bone loss. My bone scan was normal 5/11. Wouldn't it be better to try supplements and then follow up with a bone scan in 6-12 months to see if there is bone loss? any thoughts? Anyone switch to Prolia?",

In the whirl wind of being diagnosed & with lack of experience in this journey, I called to try & get an appointment for a MO the day after my surgery. I was told that I couldn't get an appointment for 2 months & then I would be past the time line they will accept patients after they have surgery. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I live on Long Island & always heard that it was a premier facility. Well my thoughts have changed about that.",
