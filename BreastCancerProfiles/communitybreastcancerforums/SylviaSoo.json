Then they did a sentinel lymph biopsy and removed 4 lymph nodes found out cancer had spread to two of them. Then I had a mastectomy and 11 more lymph nodes removed. Before I went into chemotherapy I had a bunch of scans done to my body ... bone scan, heart scan, etc. It'll be a lot of tests, but she'll get through it, especially with love and support from family. :)",
