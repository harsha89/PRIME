I started chemo in June of 06. I did okay with it. I had some bad days but most of the time I could get up and do what I needed to do. I just wanted to let you know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I am a year removed and I feel like my old self again. I wore scaves most of the time and now I have a head full of curly hair. And, I mean curly hair. It's fun though since I always had straight hair. I want to wish you all good luck. Take good care of yourself.",
