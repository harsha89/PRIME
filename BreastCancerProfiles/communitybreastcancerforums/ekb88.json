Today dh went back to work and I did the usual getting kids to school, lunches, pickup, homework help, dishes, dinner prep, etc. I was just getting dinner in the oven and felt overwhelmed and had to come lie down for a few minutes. I thought I was okay, but maybe I'm not? Should I have rested another day? I cooked a double portion so we could eat leftovers tomorrow - gonna count my blessings there at least!

In hindsight, I was just coming down with some sort of bug when I wrote my post. My husband had the same symptoms a few days later, poor guy! We're all much better now. My incision is healing, though I'm finding I still need the support of the sports bra, as unattractive as they are :).",

The mother of the family had died in her early 40's of ovarian cancer. There were four daughters, one being my friend. One was diagnosed with oc after experiencing an episode of severe abdominal pain. Two of the sisters had prophylactic ooopherectomies. One, my friend, was fine. The other was found to actually have oc during surgery. In hindsight, her CA-125 levels had increased, though were still in the normal range. I supported my friend through this time, having lost my own mother to ovarian cancer. Now I'm in my forties, the science has advanced, and I'm trying to decide on my own oophorectomy. My genetic testing is negative but my family history is strong and troubling. My friend's family story does haunt me, especially since there is still no reliable ovarian cancer screening.",
