      "Content": "IllinoisNancy wrote: Hi Ladies, I don't know if I have checked in this site.  I used to be Stage I, Pleomorphic ILC in 2006 but in October of 2010 I had a local recurrence in the same area where I had the lumpectomy and rads. Because it also went to a couple of small spots on the breast skin it turned me into a Stage IIIB, I think.  The BS said they don't like to stage local recurrences but because it surfaced on the skin I'm Stage III.  I'm so scared it will spread to other parts.  I had chemo followed by BLMX and now I'm on Armidex.  My PET scan was clear but so was the mammogram that was taken the day I was dx with the new cancer.  Also, after my BLMX, they said there was still some ILC in the breast that they removed even though I had received chemo.  I can't seem to find any women who have had PILC on the breast skin.  Am I a freak who is one of a kind?  I really wish I could find someone who has been through a similar type of recurrence.  Thanks for listening ladies.  I pray we all have long lives.  Pleomorphic Invasive Breast cancer three times 2006, 2010 and 2016, IBrance and Femara, NET Cancer in stomach and liver 2015, Sandostatin Log in to post a reply",
