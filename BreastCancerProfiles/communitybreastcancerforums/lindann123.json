    "Content": "lindann123 wrote: I had a lumpectomy and sentinel node removal over 2 years ago. My underarm has always been sore sine, but now my arm (shoulder to just below elbow) has been in a lot of pain for 3 weeks. I don't see any swelling in my arm, but the pain is terrible. Maybe I pinched a nerve and this has nothing to do with post surgery. I'll see my onco next week, but wondered if anyone else has comments about this. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
