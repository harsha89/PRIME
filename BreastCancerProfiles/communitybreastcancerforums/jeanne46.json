He also ground down the edges of some molars to make my bite more even from side to side. I know it's another doc appointment, but I would urge you to get your mouth checked out by your dentist - or if insurance pays only for doc visits, then see an oral surgeon with an MD degree.  Just what you need - another problem. Best of luck!",

I did \"Classic CMF\" which meant a 5 minute IV push of Methotre. and 5FU on days 1 and 8, and oral cyto an on days 1-15, then two weeks off (28-day cycle).  My hair thinned a little; I was tired, and I dealt with the nausea effectively with sub-lingual ativan (.5 mg). The other anti-nausea drugs available then did not help me. It was not too bad. I also got decadron as a pre-med with each IV push. CMF is an old, tried and true drug.  It was the standard of care for adjuvant chemo for stage 1 disease then. I've heard that oncologists are starting to use it again. In fact, yesterday I had a long consultation with one of my medical oncologists and he wants me to try CMF again. The recent drug I tried knocked me out for almost 10 days.  So this a new option for me. He thinks there's a possibility that CMF may have kept me in remission from 1992 to Dec. 2005. Who knows?  Best of luck to you.  Let us know how you are doing. ",

The other fact to know is that it is difficult to compare same test results from different labs because each seems to have its own criterium for normal range.  The most reliable information on disease status is from test scans. Check with your oncologist if you want to know why she/he prefers one (15-3) over the other (27-29).  CTC (circulating tumor count) is a different test altogether.  It is not usually done on a regular basis. And while my disease showed progression on scans and TMs, my CTC was under 5.  Go figure. ",

The two narcotic drugs helped the most, but was always accompanied with hyperactivity and/ shortness of breath. The last six days days the pain has not stopped and it's been difficult to gett sleep.

Your doc's office should be able to appeal the scan denial. But you can also call and try the same. One note of advice: every time you talk with someone, get their name, their office location and make sure you also write down the date and time of the call. If you can, also get their supervisor's name. Good luck. Try to do the calls on a speaker phone and then you can read or do a crossword puzzle or something else while you wait.

I have been on Navelbine for about 51/2 months.  When I started I got infused once every week for three weeks, then off week 4.  The infusions take about 15 minutes (then add time for CBC, and if you have a port, saline before and after).  I was told this was going to be an easy chemo - but found it difficult, especially at first.  Had stomach upset, felt achy and slightly feverish after day 2-3, and extremely fatigued.  I also experienced muscle weakness and am now in physical therapy to try to improve core muscle performance and balance.  I also needed Neulasta after third infusion of each cycle due to low WBC and occasionally Aranesp for low RBC, and the combination of the third infusion of the cycle and the Neulasta made me a very unhappy camper. Navelbine is notorious for causing constipation because it somehow slows the motility in the colon. If you've managed to miss that, then YEA!  I tried many different proton pump inhibitors (Protonix, Prilosec, Aciphex) also added in Zantac and occasionally chewed some TUMS. Sometimes you have to experiment a bit in order to find something that is effective in reducing the symptoms of acid stomach. I found my local pharmacist to be really helpful in this area. Lately I've been getting Navelbine every other week and managing to skip the neulasta.  My stomach issues have gotten much better and except for the first few days after each infusion, SEs are hardly apparent. Best of luck.  Hope your SEs get easier to tolerate. ",

OK, I\u2019m tired!! July 13, 2009 by pinehouse I\u2019m weeping for the sisters that we recently lost.. FLLoriK, VickiG.  May they rest in peace and the families are given strength to go through this difficult time. I\u2019m also wondering if I will ever feel reasonably comfortable again.  No, I don\u2019t have a searing pain, but a lot of things are uncomfortable.  I wonder why most deaths can\u2019t be more peaceful. Trying to work out chemo (hoping to relief some symptoms) but nothing works out well yet.

Some insurance companies will cover the expense; others not.  It costs about $1-2K. There is another type of testing that is done on tissue to determine its characteristics and apply that information to determine what chemos it may be sensitive to.  Check out Caris Labs in ARizona.  There you can send either fresh or tissue that has been preserved in blocks from a previous biopsy.  When I had that done it was free, but my onc. had to order it.  I believe they were in a testing phase at the time.  Others may come along with more information.  This is all I know about personally.

You should be getting that for free, since it's in trial, and for a few months (you'd know by then) I don't think Avastin would be harmful and it could be helpful.  I've taken it twice. The worst thing was high blood pressure (after about 5 months) and I took meds to keep that under control. When I stopped the Avastin, blood pressure returned to normal.  The bloody nose is also pretty common, but not really a big deal. Having been in a trial before, you do get a lot of extra attention and are watched very closely. Just MHO. Best of luck.  Jeanne ",

I'd go straight to biopsy (core biopsy is a possibility) - or at least to an MRI if your insurance covers that.  Best of luck,  You will be in my thoughts and prayers.   There are a few ladies who have done WBR and done well.  When I remember who they are I will pm you.

Many like me, who were initially node negative, had their cancer recur (stage IV). I'm sorry I don't have any statistics.  I highly recommend a skilled, informed onco or breast surgeon who can answer your questions with more knowledge and detail. Best of luck, Ms Javelina Breath.  (There are some current studies that are not so abysmal with regard to triple neg status.)  Have you gone on the triple neg boards?  Also there was a recent (June) discussion with Drs. Hope Rugo, John Link and someone else who specifically addressed the triple neg issue. I will try to find that thread for you. In the meantime, I don't think I will ever see a laundry shute without a picture of it in my head holding excised boobs! Jeanne ",

Each seemed to show something different in terms of metastatic involvement. I asked the onc at one point why the difference, and his response was that each test often dx separate issues/areas. Huh? TMs are helpful but not always exact. Sometimes they will go up for a month or two while on a new treatment before going down. It's the overall trend you want to take note of. I do believe it does matter where the mets are and the size - how else can one measure if a treatment is working? Am glad you fired the clueless doc and found one who will \"work\" for you. Best of luck with the your next treatment. BTW have recently read that neurontin can sometimes be helpful for the hand/foot neuropathy from xeloda and that acupuncture has proved to be very helpful too. Wishing you well, Jeanne",

Commonweal alums and friends were invited to attend the first day of the three-day professional conference (attendees were from US and abroad) and we were privileged to hear from many presenters who spoke on the current direction and recent findings on integrative cancer care (translation: incorporating practices such as mind-body meditation, guided imagery, nutrition, herbal and nutritional supplements, exercise, spirituality exercise, chronotherapy, etc.) with traditional chemotherapy, surgery and/or radiation therapy. There were some giants there (Dr. Keith Block \u2013 out of Evanston IL \u2013 a pioneer of integrative psychobiological cancer therapies ( www.blockmd.com), Dr. Mark Renneker, (a pioneer in providing services as a medical consultant for people with serious illnesses, including cancer, who can thoroughly research every aspect of your particular case and can coordinate care or find practitioners who will), Dr. Jeremy Geffen (a medical oncologist and founder of Geffen Visions in Boulder, CO (www.geffenvisions.com), Dr.Dean Ornish, (a real pioneer in implementing an integrative approach to heart disease treatment and who has actually proven that by incorporating good nutrition, diet, exercise, stress reduction and support groups, heart disease can be reversed), and many other experts too numerous to name here.. The conference was lead by, Michael Lerner, co-founder of Commonweal and Smith Farm Center for Healing and the Arts and co-founder of both centers\u2019 Cancer Help Programs and author of Choices in Healing (a highly recommended book for those of you interested in strongly academically-researched traditional and alternative approaches to treatment and healing. For those of us metsters with active disease, who daily tread the line between hope and hopelessness, this conference was a shot of hope and optimism and, for at least one day, \u201cit was a very good day,\u201d as Watson has often reminded us of our beloved Joanne\u2019s remark. Integrative medicine is not a panacea. There are limitations in any kind of treatment and sometimes no matter what one does, disease progression continues. But, I think what really helped me, is realizing that there are options that we have (other than just another chemo) and things we can do to improve our quality, and maybe quantity, of life. Without taking up all the \u201cpaper\u201d here, I just want to let you all know there is possibility. Alternative approaches include stress reduction, good nutrition, spirituality, herbal and nutritional supplementation designed to your specific need, exercise, acupuncture and others\u2013 all working together with traditional medical approaches to enhance a synergistic response for a positive outcome. The real issue and the one that needs the most attention right now, is how to get all these services available in one center, with all practitioners working together to devise an individualized plan AND (ta-da) covered by Medicare and the insurance companies. I have only touched the surface, so to speak, but I wanted to share this incredible event with you and am happy to answer more questions, should there be any. If your oncologist doesn\u2019t think outside the box, there are places and professionals to turn to that might help the process along - if you want. Best wishes and blessings to all.

Robin, that's the place and that's the doc.  Checked her out on the internet and was impressed.  Don't think the trial is ongoing, but do believe that the onc.s who participated in the trial have been able to get \"compassionate use\" for the drug from the manufacturer, Eisai. It was fast tracked for FDA approval with the hopes of getting that by end of October, but there was an obstacle that now indicates approval no sooner than first of the year (2011). Hope we can get in now!! How did your call go today?? ",

Miralax likely does the same, without the stomach aid.

But age caught up with me and then I needed reading glasses.  Now I reach for my glasses first thing after getting out of bed in the morning. I'm sure the chemo has affecting the sight degradation too. The biggest issue I've had is the constant teariness. My optometrist said it's due to dry eye. I sometimes remember to use saline or other OTC eye drops, but I don't think it makes that much of a difference. Since I'll probably be on some form of chemo for the rest of my life I don't even consider that my eyesight will improve.  The few times I've had a break from chemo (for a month to 3 months) I did not notice a change in vision.

I had to stop taking zometa - but the area is still affected and the bone loss continues. \"They\" say that if bone mets are really bad, to continue with zometa anyway. ONJ will not kill you is the reasoning. I'm currently taking an inhalant for calcium that is not in the bisphosphonate family. I'm sure you all know this - but it does bear repeating: get any dental work you need BEFORE starting a bisphosphonate (zometa, aredia). Get your teeth cleaned frequently and use a soft toothbrush, floss daily and see your dentist at the first sign of any trouble. Good luck to all.",

Now it's just a filled in chemo head look. I hope your hair starts to show some growth soon. My onc only does TMs at the beginning of each cycle.  So I have no idea what the TMs were today BUT I do have GOOD NEWS! While showering this morning before going to the onc for my second infusion, I discovered that a huge swollen cancerous lymph node above my left clavicle, which we have been using to measure treatment response, was either gone or way, way, way shrunk. I'm afraid to jinx myself, because I still have palpable tumors that were in the rads field, but they too have shrunk as well (due to rads). The only sour note was that my WBC was 3.3 (normal range is 4.1 - 10.9)  and I have to have the crappy Neulasta injection tomorrow. Hopefully this provides some hope for those about to start Halaven and those who are on it but have no palpable way of measuring a response. According to the PA in my onc's office, the two other ladies on Halaven in my clinic also seem to be doing well.  And no hair loss yet!",

A friend of mine tried using it for nausea, but the \"high\" made her feel kind of freaky.

I'm sorry I don't know if the low platelets mix into decision making regarding the Neulasta dose. Maybe your oncologist would let you try it once to see how you do. I think you'll have a lot more energy after the infusion. I'm also anemic and take iron pills twice a day. Am not as sluggish as I was a few months ago.",

If you are getting some form of steroids in your pre-meds before taxol infusion, that may be enough to keep you \"up\" for at least a day. When steroids kept me awake right after infusion, I would take extra meds for sleep that night (I'm also not a good sleeper in the best of situations). Check with your onc about possibilities. As for nosebleeds, there are a few chemo drugs (notably avastin) that often cause nosebleeds. It's a good idea to let your oncologist know about them- either by leaving a message today or contacting the office tomorrow. (I'm back on avastin and think I will try Brenda's nasal irrigation suggestion.)",

I think partly that has to do with it being such a new drug. When I was about to enter the trial last November (before it was FDA approved) there were no pre-meds involved. I think that was true of the original trials too, but am not positive about that. Personally I think steroids are overdoing it, but don't know your medical hx and am certainly not a medical professional.  Maybe you can ask that you skip the dex at the next infusion and see how it goes.  Aloxi (anti-emetic) was given at my onc's office to the first two patients. However I didn't get any pre-meds (I am patient #3). I also think that fatigue is pretty common with us Halavenites (all 5-6 of us!!!) but for me I felt much better the few days before the second injection and fully look forward to the two weeks off and having more energy after my second infusion on Wednesday. I do hate the Neulasta injections, but my body has been through so many chemos, my onc's PA thinks my bone marrow is struggling along. And my WBC did drop under normal for the first time in months.",

Finnaly it dawned on me to take some ibuprofen and by dinnertime I was feeling much better. The second day after my first infusion of second cycle, I did okay.  No real problems with fatigue (of course I did't do too much either).  However, I'm embarrassed to say that I didn't wake up until 9:30 this a.m.  My onc's office has three gals on Halaven at one office and two at another site. Reports seem to be all over the place, but one consensus (but not mine) appears to be complaints of tumor pains about days 4-5. One gal has extensive bone mets, so she is pretty uncomfortable those days.  Thanks Paula for your good thoughts. (How's your hair doing?)  It's like paradise here this weekend - so plan on soaking up some sun (Vitamin D officially!!), playing in a bridge tourney this afternoon, and seeing a good movie!

Anyone know what happens if it's two days or more? This was Day 8 of my cycle. Next week was supposed to be my week off, too. Yech. Am still waiting for the neurosurgeon to get the actual CD of the MRI films so he can compare it to the last one in early November.  They did offer to prescribe some sort of steroid packet that you take for 5 days (6 the first, 5, the second, etc.) that should help the decreased hearing and increased whooshing and ringing in my left ear.  I thought I would try it next week after the Eribulin wore off. ",

From then on I only used my right arm for blood tests and blood pressure cuffs (which was the arm I had also received chemo in). Those veins are very small and always difficult to get a good \"stick\" from. Recently I had two lymph nodes removed from the right arm. Although part of the arm is still numb, I have to use it for blood pressure and blood tests if the person doing the test isn't qualified to access my port. I would try to avoid the arm (if you have only one) that has had the nodes removed. If you get a port, I would highly recommend the Bard power port, (or another version of same) that allows the MRI/PET/CT contrast dye to be put in the port (some of those procedures require the dyes to be put in with pressure. which the Bard port can accommodate). Before I had a power port I once had to have dye put into my ankle because they couldn't find a suitable vein in my right arm. Good luck to you.",

That sealed the deal. It could be that neupogen is easier on the body - but the cost can be prohibitive.  If insurance requires that you get that from the oncologist it would cost (me) $15 a day times 5-7 (or however many shots are required) days vs. just one $15 co-pay for the Neulasta.  If insurance allows you to self-inject, the neupogen shots are very expensive if ordered from a pharmacy. Also, just a heads up.  The last time I got an Aranesp injection (actually a week AFTER) , I was handed one of those \"warning\" waivers about Aranesp and all the terrible things that could happen.  Honestly it was a dire looking document. Made me almost think a transfusion would be better.  I think there must have been some problems because the company is now requiring patients to sign the waiver.    Started to see a few hairs flying around today.  I certainly hope they were errant strands (well, petite errant strands).   ",

      "Content": "May 30, 2008 02:59AM - edited May 30, 2008 05:36AM by jeanne46 The problem with the study you cited is that it suggests that miso soup can PREVENT breast cancer, not prevent recurrence. Also, the Japanese tend to eat far less meat than we do, and less milk products as well. It may also be that those who ate more miso soup ate less meat and more vegetables. There was a study done a while ago in China (The Cancer Project). Again, for groups that ate very little or no meat and no dairy (in other words a diet rich in vegetables) the incidence of breast cancer was far less than in the cities where diets were richer in animal products. Supposedly, if you are ER+ soy is more of an issue (it has estrogenic qualities) than if one is ER-. But I don't think the jury is out on that subject. If you like miso soup, and have no problems with sodium and make sure there is no MSG in the soup, go for it. I especially like miso soup on cold days. But you can also include lots of dark leafy green veggies in your diet, BBQ tofu (buy the firm kind and be sure to marinate first) instead of beef or make your own soup rich in veggies with some tofu added and have control over how much salt or sodium to add. (BTW: sea salt is much better for you than regular salt because of the minerals in the sea salt.) Nothing is ever as easy as it seems! Jeanne",

But one of these days you will find that you have overcome the initial shock and then, hopefully, you will find ways to live each day that gives you some meaning and happiness. It's not easy. And it helps to keep in contact with people who are going through similar experiences as you are. Eventually I realized that I had no other choice than to try to live each day as stress-free as possible and not waste valuable time on cancer. Like, \"today's just not a good day for cancer!\" You will get through this. Don't beat yourself up because of your reaction. Everyone experiences similar feelings. Your body hasn't betrayed you - cancer has. It is your body that will help you destroy the cancer cells with the help of chemo. Treat your body well and make sure it gets plenty of rest, good nutrition, exercise, laughter, and lots of hugs. Sending a virtual hug your way - along with best wishes for some good days ahead.

I also want to add that I also experienced hip pain that went down the side of my leg to my foot and it turned to be sciatica. That's another possibility for your Mom. I found the pain unrelenting and had to take vicodin for relief. Saw an orthopedist and he ordered physical therapy and some anti-inflammatory meds. Luckily it subsided fairly quickly. If it turns out to be bone mets, it's one of the least threatening areas to treat. Some ladies just take anti-hormonals and zometa (or aredia) for bone health and protection. Good luck to your Mom.

Infections are possible, and that would be bad news. I don't have many eyebrow hairs (they are noticeable, but sparse); it seems that after my hair returned from Abraxane treatment, my eyebrows didn't grow back as much (nor my eyelashes).  I use a powder eyebrow liner - and usually it managers to stay on well all day.  I have also used a pencil.  You might go to a make-up counter and ask about long lasting eyebrow liners. For everyday eyelash \"look\" try lining the top of your eyelid, close to the lash line, with a gel liner. It helps give the look of eyelashes and for me, they last longer than a pencil. Soem of these tricks I learned in an American Cancer Society \"Look Good Feel Good\" class. They also hand out free make-up. ",

The problem with pic lines or passport ports (in arm) is that the tubing still goes through the vena cava.  It's a dilemma.  Hopefully you will do well on the xeloda and get any other IV through your arm. I've been squeezing a soft rubber ball 4-5 times a day to try and strengthen my arm veins. It doesn't sound like you had any symptoms.  I had pressure along each side of my neck and my head felt like it was upside down. Perhaps the Xeloda will solve all these problems.  Am keeping my fingers crossed for you.",

Otherwise, why would anyone contribute money if they thought Stage IV could happen to anyone. So lucky ladies who've been cancer-free (and were Stage I, II, or III) can explain how they \"fought\" and \"struggled\" and \"refused to give up\" in order to beat breast cancer. The rest of us didn't get our mammos in time, didn't follow up on a palpable lump, didn't go for yearly exams, didn't have health insurance, didn't eat the right foods, didn't keep a positive attitude and didn't \"keep the faith.\" It's even possible we didn't go to the right cancer center either. The public does not want to hear bad news. It doesn't sell well. And I believe our friends and family often just want a way to keep hope alive. The only Stage IV ladies that would be shown would likely be in remission. I really resent Pink October. I want to be cancer-free, too. Hugs to all. ",

Often, if you have a gradual increase in numbers over a period of time or a sudden noticeable increase your onc will request scans for more definitive assessment.  Then there are people whose 27-29 or 15-3 TM tests always fall in normal range even though they have active disease.",

Did they get enough tissue from the biopsy of the abdominal nodes? Usually breast cancer cells show up as breast cancer cells, wherever the spots are. There is a possibility, from what you report, that this is something else. I'm not qualified to hazard a guess, but unless the tissue has been identified as cancer for sure, there's always the chance it is benign. It sounds like your oncologist is being thorough in ordering a comparison from your slides of '06 to your recent biopsy. Before you jump ahead of yourself (I know it's really hard NOT to do), you need to find out what this tissue is and what the characteristics, if it is breast cancer, are. Sometimes the ER/PR changes, etc. You ask good questions about the PET scan. Since you haven't had one before, it's possible these \"hot\" nodes have been there for a while. There are other tests that can sometimes be used to compare - like CT of abdomen, whole body bone scan, and or PET/CT. Hang in there. This is the worst time of all. Waiting, not knowing, expecting the worst, etc. Your bc sisters here will be pulling for you. Drop in any time to share thoughts, ask questions, or whatever you need.

And they certainly don't want to see bald, round-faced ladies tell their devastating tales. Nor healthy-looking ladies who have the same prognosis.  Just buy something pink and feel good.  I think that's the basic message. OK, I've had my rant.  Thank You. ",

I was treated with antibiotics and the port was also checked for leakage. Nothing showed up. I was on avastin and abraxane (paclitaxel) at the time. When I switched to oral meds (unrelated to the port!) I had the port removed. A few months later, and back on chemo infusions, I had a new port inserted (a Bard power port) on the same side of my chest, but to the left of the location of the previous port. So far I've had no problems and no red lines. My first port was put in by a radiologist and he didn't do a very pretty job. The second one was implanted by a wonderful surgeon who made it look less noticeable and placed the tube UNDER my clavicle. I would only have an experienced surgeon do that procedure again if I needed it. I have had friends whose first port insertions got infected and required removal and reinsertion of a new one. You should probably take a break from the avastin to give your body some time to heal, if that's what you choose. There's something called vasculitis that can occur with port tubes. What does your onc or surgeon say? I haven't had any experience with PICC lines but that also sounds like an option, especially if you and your onc. decide it's more important for you to remain on avastin.

But (and there's always a BUT it seems) I've had some problems getting the qualified personnel to access my port for scans. First of all, they need a special needle for the port - and only nurses can access it. It must be flushed out, the dye inserted, then flushed out again. When you schedule a scan, be sure to tell the personnel that you want the dye inserted through your port and therefore need an interventional nurse. Sometimes you have to be insistent. The last time I had surgery, I wanted them to use my port instead of my veins because they are so difficult to find, and at first everyone said, \"NO.\" But in the end, the anesthesiologist agreed to do it. Good luck. If you want any more info, just PM me.",

Sometimes the biopsies are not read correctly.  I might suggest sending your biopsy sample to a third lab for confirmation.  Also, tumor markers can bounce around and when they dropped to 50 that may have been a result of the initial round of rads or just an anomaly.  It does sound like it's time to find a new onc.  One who will be around and one with whom you have more trust.

The current facility (related to the other one) doesn't care if I read. Usually I just try to sleep because I'm so grumpy and hungry.  The original radiologist still does not require a pre-prep (he's at a major cancer center here).  Go figure.  About a year or so ago I posted a question on this forum about PET/CT prep.  The answers were all over the place.",

I was only on xeloda for three cycles, but the whole time it made me nauseous. I found the next cocktail easier to bear, just more time consuming because it was by IV. It also caused me to lose my hair. I learned to get over that - but it wasn't easy. However, popping on a wig right after a quick shower is much faster than blow-drying, etc. And I saved a bunch of money on shampoo. (Like you, I gave the leftover xeloda away - to the chemo nurses to give to any patients that needed it - unofficially, of course!). Hang in there. There's plenty of chemo choices out there and one that will certainly work for you. I'm in the middle of getting all my scans right now, too, and then figuring out what my next tx is going to be. Someone on these boards described the scan waiting as \"scanic attacks.\" I can identify with that! Good luck to you. I hope you have the best possible outcome.",

I took avastin and abraxane for almost 11 months without any problems. Then tried a few hormonals that didn't work. Then was part of a clinical trial involving a non-chemo drug. Am now taking navelbine and avastin and suddenly my leg muscles (especially the upper back thighs) are weaker. On my right side, it's difficult to go upstairs without really using the rail for support. So far, at least, I have not developed any neuropathy. My oncologist said it's a side effect and probably reversible when I stop the medication (which is working presently so I hope I don't have to stop it any time soon). I feel like an old lady and am starting to walk like one, too. I do occasionally freak out that I'm starting to develop some other disease. Would love to hear from anyone who's experienced this.

Of course I haven't heard from her yet either. (It's only 10:30 PDT). The MRI part really scares me.  The cancer seems to have just gone crazy.  If I have brain mets again it'll put me at least two months out of the trial. Friday night DH snd I did some research into \"green\" burials/cemeteries.  Thought we'd found one near San Francisco that sounded perfect, but a friend did some research for me and it turns out the owners of this cemetery have had some questionable legal problems with other cemeteries they also own regarding spending the pre-paid money and then not being able to fulfill the contract. Then the cost (after some probing) doubled from the stated amount. At least I felt in control of something for a while. Now I feel like I'm almost back to square one. I did finish my Five Wishes form, and that felt good.  This whole thing seems so \"out-of-body.\"  Thanks for all your support.  It means more than I can express. ",

Edited to add: I do not go to a large center.  My doc is the only oncologist at the clinic I attend. ",

Once the bone has been biopsied, and the pathologists can define the ER/PR/HER2 status, you may be able to start on something like hormonals and herceptin, and a bisphosphonate for bone health. The hardest part is waiting to get your plan in place. I think I lost 5 lbs. overnight when I first found out. But it does get easier and once you get started, life will look a little more normal. It's been two years for me (I found out right before Christmas in '05) since my bc recurred and I'm still doing regular stuff and those 5 lbs I lost have come back threefold! There are lots of inspiring stories on this board. The ladies here are truly caring and full of love and empathy. Best of luck to you and keep in touch. Sending gentle hugs and positive thoughts.",

I personally know of a well-respected lab that made a huge mistake that was caught when the patient had the sample tested at another center, then reconfirmed at the first lab.  Unless there's an issue of not getting enough bone to study the pathology, there should be no reason that the pathologist can't tell you if it's breast cancer or not.

I found acupuncture really helpful for energy and immune response the first time around - and think I will start again. If acupuncture is available to you, I recommend trying it.

Before your husband goes above the boss's head and risks further insult, give the guy another chance.  That would certainly be the Verizon protocol. Best of luck and keep us informed. ",

Rich,  there is a lot of controversy with the chemosensitivity assay.  I had it done by the Weisenthal lab and all but two drugs came back \"Resistant.\" You can imagine how devastated I was.  However I recently was on a drug that my assay showed resistance to,  but which I had some good response.  My onc seems to feel that molecular profiling (currently in experimental phase by CARIS/MPI in Arizona) offers better information because it offers  an immunohistochemical analysis of patient tissue.  The chemosensitivity assay test can be helpful to some.  I've spoken with Dr. Weisenthal and met with Dr. Nagourney.  But most cancer center docs do not have much faith in the tests.  No need to respond; I know there are arguments on either side.  Just not  black and white. And there are variables (besides high cost) depending on the amount of tissue available and if solid tissue can be resected and how long ago the assay was done. There is an oncologist outside of Chicago (in Evanston) - Dr. Richard Bloch who does timed therapy with his patients and claims to have gotten very good results.  I've seen him speak and he's quite dynamic.  He also practices integrative therapy (using nutrition, supplements, exercise, emotional therapy, yoga) to compliment the chemo protocol.

I'm finally beginning to feel a little better - but get my next infusion tomorrow.  I'll let you all know if the hydration improves my symptoms.  Anyone out there that also gets hydrated the day after?? Did it help? Thanks for all the care and support. It means a lot. As far as the MUGA testing goes,  my onc not only does a baseline MUGA, but will monitor me during treatment to make sure the LVEF factor (measured by the MUGA) has not dropped below normal (50% ejection fraction).  I didn't start too much above normal (57% ejection fraction) and hope I can hold there.  I am also taking a lot of Vit. D and COQ10 for heart health.  I know some docs use an echo instead of the MUGA.  Mine feels the MUGA is more sensitive. (Boo Hiss - it also requires a stick to infuse contrast dye).  Who knows.  I also had a MUGA before I started Herceptin (no longer taking it).",

Tamoxifen can be a life saving drug if your Mom's cancer is ER/PR+ - that is, fueled by estrogen. There are other types of anti-estrogen drugs that your Mom can discuss with her oncologist - but if your Mom is followed closely while on the tamoxifen, she should do just fine. Perhaps your Dad could join your Mom at her next appointment and have his questions about tamoxifen answered. Good luck to her and to all of you.

Sounds lovely. The chemo room is a square room with 5 or 6 chairs arranged in a semi-circle. The chairs aren't even as comfortable as the facility we used to be in.  There's no TV.  You have to bring you're own ipod or DVD player, but rarely do I see anyone hooked up to either.  If you cry it's in front of everyone; if you are bitchy or grumpy it's in front of everyone.  If you're loud and giggly, it's also very public.  Unfortunately there is no where else to go.

Joanie, I might want to rip those bells out of the wall (still grumpy as you can tell).  I think we StageIV ladies ought to have discussions with the RNs, PAs and oncs who treat us to let them know we need encouragement, acknowledgement and support, too.  Don't hide us, don't write us off, don't pretend we don't see what's going on.",

What really jumped out to me was the artist saying that the physical side of breast cancer treatment was outweighed by the emotional. Not for me.  After I got over the initial shock, the physical tolls have far-outweighed my emotional ones. It seems that once again, those with terminal illness have been ignored.  Or am I just speaking for myself?",

This trial is being run by the FDA and they have a ton of rules and regulations that are quite confusing. I also need to get CT scans done before I can begin the trial - and my PA is working on that. I am crossing fingers and toes that all this can be accomplished by the end of this week or the beginning of the next so I can start the trial by the middle of next week (and that I don't need a brain MRI).

The avastin caused some nosebleeds, and runny eyes and nose and high blood pressure that returned to normal when I quit taking it. Abraxane has the advantage of not requiring pre-med with steroid because it is suspended in nano-particles that make it much easier for your body to accept. There are lots of other chemo drugs out there - the platinums [cisplatin, carboplatin], gemcitabine [gemzar], CMF [an old cocktail that seems to be used occasionally today], cyto- somethings - sorry that's my chemo brain today, etc. I think your onc needs an attitude adjustment and perhaps some more information - or perhaps you could find a more compassionate and caring onc.

Nurses are trained not only to access ports, but to flush as well (which is really imortant with a port). I am also a hard stick, and last time (pre-Bard) I had my CT scans done, and after being stuck 4 times, I finally got really pushy and requested an \"intervention nurse.\" Most centers that do CTs (mine happened to be at a hospital) have intervention nurses for just that reason. She was able to find a vein in one stick. I have to have blood tests weekly and have finally decided that I will only be stuck by one particular phlebotomist. You really have to stand up for yourself or the risk of getting multiple sticks is constant. The other thing I found to be helpful is to use a heating pad or some other warm device to help plump the veins beforehand. However, I also agree, that sometimes it is a crap shoot. Once at the imaging center where I get PET/CT scans, even the doc couldn't find a vein. They finally went into my ankle - and I understand that is risky for blood clot complications. It seems that for us \"hard sticks\" there should be specially trained nurses or techs who can get \"blood from a turnip.\"",

It's been 6-8 weeks since I've been off adriamycin and my hair has continued to fall out and look crappy. So today I took out out the wig because now my hair is really falling out (the Day 14 rule) from taxotere, and OMG. The hair is so much darker than my hair color now, (at the time it seemed that we even went outside to match hair color when I bought the wig). When I tried it on this morning, I looked like I was wearing a very dark MOP HEAD.  Geeesh.  I took it to the gal who sold it to me and she washed it and then restyled it and tried to thin it.  But now, everyone I see will immediately know I'm wearing a wig (mostly I'm referring to the people I do NOT want knowing about my cancer) - even my friends will need some getting used to it. IT\"S NOT ME! If you didn't know me, it would probably look okay - just a lot more hair than I ever had - but definitely more natural than some of the \"styled\" synthetic wigs. I would have gone that route but the last time I lost my hair, the synthetic wigs itched so badly that I was uncomfortable most of the year I wore one. The other issue is that I have this ominous feeling that I will be bald from now on - and the idea of being bald in a hospital bed just makes me cringe. Somewhere between vanity and overwhelming sadness about my mets progression I have fixated on the \"look.\"  It's so much easier to float down DeNile with a full head of hair (or even thinned crummy hair). I worry about my husband and my kids. It will be hard to look into their eyes and see their sadness too. I'm just really down at the moment - trying to find some ladder rungs to hitch myself up on.  I know life is not fair or none of us would have cancer. But the double whammy of weight gain, unhealthy skin, and no hair just adds another dimension of unfairness to our being. BOO HISS. Thanks for letting me rant.

With that said, I also believe that Shepgirl is correct in that some research centers are looking into stem cell transplant with breast cancer patients. I believe those cases are for patients with a small amount of disease or at very high risk for occurrence from a primary diagnosis. The other issue is whether you are talking about an autologous stem cell transplant (from your bone marrow) or from a donor match. My only experience was a dear friend who had an autologous stem cell transplant in 1994 and her disease continued to progress anyway. It's a good question.

The result is bone loss and constant irritation - no pain - and my oral surgeon said that eventually the implant will fall out, and most likely the tooth next to it - whose root is also affected. Regular cleanings and filling cavities should not be a problem. Root canal, tooth extraction, and trauma to the tooth or surrounding tissue should cause concern while on a bisphosphonate. I have heard that there are some new protocols now giving IV bisphosphonates (aredia or zometa) every three months instead of monthly. All this should be discussed with your oncologist, of course, and as someone else mentioned, I do not know if this makes a difference in ONJ risk. I think ONJ has been under-reported, as does my regular dentist. Although I have seen an oral surgeon familiar with ONJ and he is certain I have ONJ, no one can identify it as such with 100% accuracy (to do so would involve invasive tests that could make the condition worse). Some dentists manage it with clondomycin (an antibiotic) and may not always report it to the drug companies for various reasons, even if there are open wounds that are more clearly seen as ONJ. Sorry to be the spoiler here, but thought you should know the other side.",

After a year I started regularly bleeding from the gum surrounding the implanted tooth.  Many anti-biotics and dx followed until we realized it was ONJ. It occured in the maxilla (top jaw) which is rare.  It usually presents in the mandilla or lower jaw and often as an open sore that exposes bone.  In my case I lost two teeth.  It doesn't seem to be affecting any other area right now.  If you need any dental work, definitely do it now - especially any invasive work.  And do try to see a dentist or oral surgeon who is familiar with ONJ.  It might be a good idea to have a panorama x-ray as a baseline before you begin bisphosphonate therapy. That said, remember that ONJ is still pretty uncommon.  Many many ladies takes bisphosphonates with no problem at all.  As with all chemo and other drugs, there's always a risk. It's a decision we all make as to which risk we choose!",

Personally I was quite lucky and didn't suffer any side effects from the IV. Make sure you have all dental work done (if necessary) before starting the Aredia and let your dentist know you are on Aredia..  Also brush frequently with a soft toothbrush and use dental floss to keep teeth and gums as clean as possible.  One nasty side effect of bisphosphonates (only occurs to a small minority of which I'm a unhappy member) is osteonecrosis of the jaw. Sorry about the progression - but rest assured there's lots of drugs in the chemo arsenal and hopefully this new combo will work wonders. Don't worry about the pity party - we all have them.

I just had scans on Monday and today the chemo nurse called to tell me that the onc wants to talk to me tomorrow about the scan, but hold off on the chemo.  Now, what do you think that means?  Crap.  Am currently on my 7th cocktail (in December I reached the 4-year mark) and now I'm really scared about what lies ahead. So, I guess the best we can do is move on and keep hoping.  There's a 5-part article running in the New York Times about an oncologist/researcher who started a clinical trial with patients in late stage melanoma.  One was so close to death they almost didn't include him in the trial. And within weeks all of the patients started to improve and their tumors shrunk dramatically - to the point that some appeared to be without disease.  Perhaps a new drug awaits us too - and could be just around the corner.  It's important to keep hope alive. ",

First of all, if your cancer is in bone only, that's a good thing.  Mets to bone is rarely life-threatening. Often patients are treated with AIs (like Femara or Arimidex) or Faslodex along with an IV bisphosphonate (like Zometa).   My onc only radiates if there is pain or some other compelling reason (location is near a vital nerve, etc.). I have not heard of a 4-month infusion of taxotere.  But for your peace of mind, and your family's, I would suggest a second opinion ASAP (before you begin any treatment) and also find an oncologist who is much more optimistic and compassionate.  Since you are ER/PR+ there is every possibility that you can do well on AIs for a long time. LuAnn will come along shortly and tell you her story.  She has bone only mets as well, and has only done AIs, faslodex and zometa. Best of luck to you.  Hang in there.  You have every reason for hope. Jeanne ",

I expected maybe to feel bad for a day or two.  But crappity crap, I am scheduled to get infused once a week for three weeks, then off a week.  My infusion schedule includes the last two weeks of December.  I don't want to leave home - I know moping around is NOT good, but the effort to get up and out is challenging. Last week I managed an errand or appointment or two, then had to come home and take a long nap. Have any of you had a reaction to Aloxi (or any anti-emetic)?  How about the lose-dose adriamycin on a weekly basis?   I'm also approaching my 4-year metsaversary.

Don't give up.  I know it sucks to have to fight for something you need - but that's another road we don't need to go down right now!   CT's and bone scans are pretty accurate for what they picture.  Especially if you have bone mets, whole body bone scans can pinpoint areas of activity.  However, it would be best if the radiologist had the same type of films to compare from the last set of scans. While whole body bone scans do cover most of the body (including arms and legs) CTs are specific to the area being scanned (i.e., chest, abdomen, pelvis). Gentle hugs, Jeanne ",

Hard cheese was okay.  Lots of water was also suggested. I was told this gives the radiologists a better scan to read. I don't know how much difference it makes.  For sure it helps to go to the same facility or to have your scan read by the same radiologists each time. I figured it wouldn't hurt to prep the more stringent way and if that produced a more reliable scan, then it was worth it.",

They both look for left ventricular ejection fraction - a marker for heart disease. Some docs think that the MUGA is more definitive, but the echo does not involve any radioactive exposure.   As for Adria and Cytoxan - I'm sure that's a good option.  However, it seems that a lot of Stage IV ladies are often treated first with a taxol and avastin.  If you can, maybe it would be a good idea to get a second opinion.  There are also other anti-hormonals such as faslodex and aromasin that might also work for you. What is your HER/2 status? Best of luck to you. I'm sure whatever you choose you will be in good hands and I hope you get another nice long dance with NED (no evidence of disease)! ",

Results confirmed just sciatica - so he sent me to an orthopedist who recommended physical therapy and gave me some anti-inflammatory meds. Sciatica involves a pinched nerve and perhaps your particular area gets compression when you are lying down. Mine was okay when lying down, just really painful when I stood up and or walked around. The pain ran all the way down my leg and across my foot from the outside to my big toe. I was quite lucky that it didn't last too long. While you made a good decision to see your doc, bone pain is not always associated with bone mets. When my bone mets were discovered, I was pretty much asymptomatic. Let us know how you are doing.

Ritalin is used primarily for adolescent ADHD, and in adults has the effect of an \"upper.\"  I imagine for some it's really helpful. But check with your onc about the iron, and the white and red cell counts first. Your level of fatigue doesn't sound as worrisome as someone who might not be able to function at all (can't get off the couch; can't stop sleeping...).  But since you are used to much more activity, I understand your concern.   Perhaps you could start at a lower outdoor pace and work up to more mileage.  If .3 mile is all you can do right now, then do that for a week.  Then see if you can push it up higher. Best of luck.  I hope the Cisplatin takes you to a long dance with Ned!",

We're told to keep up a cheery face, congratulated that we are so brave and courageous, implored to maintain a positive attitude because that can affect our outcome; we try to protect our family, close friends and hide our condition from fellow workers or acquaintances because we don't want to be pitied. (Do you think your message hit a chord with me??) Well, some days are just crappy. Some days we just don't feel like being all those wonderful, peppy things. So I say - call it a pity party, or missing our happy place, or just feeling off-game - whatever - it's a bad day and sometimes not worth the struggle to fight. My frequent answer is to go to bed, pull up the covers and watch something really idiotic on TV. Others may choose taking a walk, working on a project or shopping. Whatever works. I think we need to give ourselves a break, a chance to feel sad, to feel frustrated, to feel out of sorts, to be sick and tired of being filled up with chemos and drugs and side effects and ordinary (of course, when you have cancer NOTHING is ordinary!) aches and pains This is another side of our life, too. Don't be hard on yourself. You'll get your game back. Just nurture yourself, forgive yourself, hug yourself and let others do the same for you. And I also vote with LuAnn. Anti-depressants can be really helpful! Not all drugs make us feel bad. Hugs, Jeanne",

However, with that being said, I highly recommend that you have a surgeon put in the port and ask them to make sure incision doesn't show if you've wearing a scoop or V-neck shirt/ etc. Also make sure the line leading from the port is inserted UNDER your clavicle (my first one, inserted by a radiologist, went OVER the clavicle and not only showed, but occasionally rubbed against clothing. My new port is a Bard Power port, which allows the use of contrast dye (inserted with pressure) for an MRI or CT scan. Now to the most important thing - ask the ons's office for a scrip for EMLA cream. Two hours before you are scheduled for a stick, put a small, pea-sized blob of emla cream (lidocaine derivative) over the port, and cover with a square of sticky saran wrap (the kind that sticks to itself). You will feel absolutely no \"ouchies\" upon insertion of the port needle!! Best of luck. I know the existence of the port is a constant reminder of why it's there, but it really is very helpful - and will significantly reduce the sticks to the arm/hand.. NOTE: Not all people are licensed or qualified to access a port - so if you're getting blood drawn and want to use your port, be sure to request a qualified nurse (even for scans... sometimes they're referred to as an interventional radiology nurses).",

As to CEA markers - some docs use CEA, some use CA15-3 (or CA 27-29) or both - and some oncs don't use markers at all. In cases of metastatic breast cancer, markers are sometimes used to monitor a particular drug therapy, or as a possible indicator of disease progression. Those markers can be reliable and they can also be very unreliable. In my case, I had a normal CEA count, but my CA 15-3 was way up there and my scans showed active disease. If your doc is using the markers, he should also be comparing those to your recent scans (and your upcoming ones). As for the pain in your hip, you should definitely discuss that with your doc and find out what he can do to help make you more comfortable. You didn't mention what your ER/PR and Her2 status is. If you are a triple negative, like I am, then chemo is the only weapon they currently have to fight the cancer. You must be quite a strong lady to have withstood so many years of chemo. Let me know how your MRI scans come out. I hope my information has been helpful. Good luck and take care,",

I'm not positive on that, but that's my understanding. I've probably had four injections in the last five years and have never had any problems. That is, of course, merely anecdotal evidence.

The roller coaster ride isn't a lot of fun. As to ER/PR status - after two years of thinking I was a triple neg, I had a biopsy and it showed I was ER+ (highly). The same tissue was re-examined by a pathologist friend and his report showed only medium ER positivity. Then I had a core biopsy of another spot and it showed an even lower ER+ number. When asked why - I was told that they look at the slide under microscope and sort of eyeball the percentage of ER+ cells in the slide. So, it's not an exact science and seems to depend on which part of the tissue the slide is representative of. With all that said, I was also told that not all ER+ cancers respond to anti-hormonal therapy. I tried two (femara, faslodex) and had some progression on both. Best of luck to you.

Rib resection confirmed breast ca mets. Your onc can also order some bloodwork to see if there any elevated tumor marker levels that might lead one to suggest further investigation. (Normal levels do not necessarily mean anything and some oncologists don't even use tumor markers). The really good news is that with the PET and bone scans NOTHING else turned up. It could likely be trauma, but if the anxiety is causing great discomfort, then request that your oncologist follow-up now. Sometimes, without any other evidence to the contrary, they prefer to wait a month or two rather than order an invasive biopsy if unnecessary. Other option is to request another radiologist to read the bone scan. Good luck to you and let us know what happens. Wishing you the best possible outcome!",

I am on the same chemo you will be starting.  Most people find that Navelbine is an easy chemo to take - it does not cause hair loss, rarely causes much nausea, and does not require pre-meds (especially steroids).  Avastin usually doesn't have many SEs, although some ladies have reported some bone pain right after the infusion.  I have not experienced that. Avastin can eventually cause high blood pressure, so they will check your blood pressure regularly (they do anyway). It also can delay healing and cause nosebleeds.  My urine is checked regularly to make sure my kidney function is normal.  You do not want to have a surgery of any kind while on Avastin. My experience with Navelbine was that it was more difficult that I expected.  My white counts got really low and I always required a Neulasta injection and occastionally an injection of Aranesp for red cell counts  I was fatigued and had a lot of stomach acid.  I experienced some weakness in my core muscles (hips and shoulders). That was on a schedule of infusions once a week for three weeks, then one week off.  When my oncologist changed the plan to every other week, the above problems went away. Generally, if you do experience SEs, it occurs during the first few days after your infusion.  For me, having a port has been great.  My veins are very small and hard to find.  The port works well and you can't tell I have it when I'm in clothes (even with a V-neck top). I can also use it for some scans which means less endless sticking to find a good vein. Best of luck to you. Let us know how you are doing. ",

I'm not sure of the technical reason why the jaws (upper and lower) can develop loss of bone density and necrosis while the other bones in the body are being strengthened. A dentist once explained it to me, but chemo brain (last in, first out) has made the info irretrievable! In my case it developed in an area where I had a dental implant put it 3-4 years before I started the bisphosphonate therapy. I am getting a night guard - not only to help with jaw clenching, but also to keep the teeth in place at night (I have a few that are loose due to the bone resorbtion). My dental insurance would only pay for 50% I would definitely recommend a night guard if any of you are grinding at night. The other thing you might consider for the discoloration are the OTC white strips. I also believe that chemo itself can cause discoloration of teeth. I remember the first time I went through chemo years ago my teeth got more yellow. I was not taking any kind of bisphosphonates then. Jeanne",

I'm also hoping to see an onc in the northern part of my state (second opinion) who's quite well-researched in triple neg disease. Am at a crossroads in treatment plans right now and feel like I'm on a tight wire without a net. I guess the bottom line is that's is really important to stay involved in your treatment plans and current research and to be your own advocate.",

I was lucky - needed no pre-treatment with steroids (that's one great advantage with abraxane vs. taxol) nor anti-emitics (kytril gave me a headache anyway). Besides losing my hair, I often had a metallic taste in my mouth, occasional nosebleeds from the avastin, and some energy loss. Otherwise it was not too bad. At first my numbers dropped rather well - but when my CA 15-3 hit 30 (and I got really excited) it then started to increase and after another few months my onc switched my tx to another cocktail.

Your onc sounds like a gem, watching you so carefully all these years, and ready now to give your errant cells all the big guns. It's not easy recovering from a diagnosis and going right into chemotherapy.  But as many here will tell you, it's doable.  Pamper yourself, let your family and friends wait on you.  Often anti-depressants can be helpful as can psychotherapy and or a local support group (check with your onc's office or the local ACS chapter for referrals).  And avail yourself of all the information from the knowledgeable ladies on these boards. And yes, we all ride the emotional roller coaster.   Just know you are not alone! Gentle hugs, Jeanne ",

Best to discuss this issue with your Mom's oncologist. Since your Mom is starting next week, see how she does. We each respond to a given treatment in many different ways. How your fiance's mother reacted and what she was taking may be very different from your Mom's experiences. If your Mom does attend your wedding in Bermuda, you may want to make sure she gets lots of rest if she's tired and save up her energy for the ceremony itself. Congratulations on your upcoming wedding. I do hope your Mom will be able to attend. If not, perhaps you could have another special ceremony at home that she could share with you.",
