But it turned out that through a wellness mammogram that \"there was something there\" which bore watching. I was supposed to go back for another mammo and ultrasound about which I had been cavalier in scheduling until I felt the lump, and upon the new mammo and ultrasound I was immediately scheduled to see the surgeon. I was not worried, figuring no sense in being concerned until I got the results of the needle biopsy which I will be having next week. The practice my insurance covered was factory-like, and the doctor was quite rapid fire with instructions for the biopsy and informing me about the bit of titanium that would be inserted in preparation for a lumpectomy. I asked him if the bioposy result was normal what would happen in terms of watching it in the future, and his response was that from the size and shape of the lump he would be surprised if it were not malignant, and if the biopsy result was normal he would continuing looking for \"something else.\" I was quite surprised to hear this and am now embarking on getting as much info as I can about possible futures. But I am wondering if this is a common thing\u2014that the surgeon can tell ahead of time if the lump is a malignant one. TIA for any info.

Next step is an MRI for better info regarding the lumpectomy, to further check the other breast, and to determine if I'm a candidate for balloon radiation (5 days, 5 treatments and done)\u2014tumor must be 3 cm or smaller and the mammo & ultrasound say it's 2.5 but was told the latter are not so reliable regarding size. Told that there is virtually no advantage to having a mastectomy rather than a lumpectomy. Do you agree? I don't have the best insurance (Medicare Advantage) so that will hold things up a bit as all approvals need to be requested via my PCP's office and they're not too on the ball there. Also I cannot have the MRI in any place but a hospital which didn't make the doc too happy. I wasn't offered the results of the biopsy so far. Any point in asking for them or should I just wait until everything is in?

Why is there both an in-situ and an invasive? What are the Histologic Grades and the MIB-1 (Ki-67) Haven't talked to doctor since the day he told me the biopsy was malignant and further info would come, but forgot to ask for that portion of the path that day. He went out of town for a week and I was not able to get any of the path reports because the doctor had to \"sign off\" on them when he returned, so that was today and I picked them up. Having MRI tomorrow and will see surgeon the following Wednesday. This is, well, worse than I feared, but I guess I'm not alone in that.
