I am not going to post stats because there are others here who will chime in that are better at that than me. I can only speak from experience and tell you that worrying all weekend will do you NO good. I was in the same position and my husband told me not to put that much energy into it because if it was something to be concerned about I would need that energy later. So keep it stored up for a time when you can invest it better. That being said, it is okay to be scared and worried but don't let it consume you. Check out info on this site which I am sure you have, check out john hopkins breast cancer center expert site which is awesome too. Komen.org has great info as well. There is nothing wrong with getting yourself informed. The breast smear is a test to check for what is in the fluid that discharges. In my case I tested positive for epithelial cells, squamous cells and red blood cells. No malignant or atypical cells were found. I was told it is very rare to find malignant cells in a breast smear. good Luck and keep us posted. Sending really good vibes to you. Karen ",

I did not have a lump and had the diagnostic mam because of bloody nipple discharge. I still have not resolved that issue but I have surgery set for 4/23. I hope all goes well with you. My biopsy was benign but they found atypical cells. From what I understand this is much like ADH but not so much the H which is hyperplasia. Unfortunately my surgeon would not do an open excisional biopsy to rule out anything else there near the atypia. So.. when you get your benign results () if there is atypia please pursue further and have the peace of mind that there is nothing brewing nearby. Good luck girlfriend.  If you don't mind me asking, what hospital are you going to down there? If you went recently did you take a boat? LOL... I am over the rain.. Where is the SUN?

I know quite a few more than 10. They were not round but indeterminate. I had a biopsy which was benign ..most are 80% :) I did however have a diagnosis of atypia but no hyperplasia. So I don't have ADH just epithelial atypia. The hyperplasia means there are alot in the sample.. I didn't have a lot.. just a few in the sample. I am not sure but have you received that actual report from the mamogram? If so what is your birads score? that would tell you if the radiologists felt if they were suspicious. If the rating is 4 or 5 you are on your way to a biopsy. If it is a 3 then they will check your boob again in 6 months. Now all surgeons vary in their opinion on monitoring and/or doing a biopsy. So get your report for confirmation on the concern the radiologist has. If there is concern (Birads 4 or 5) then your next step is to see a breast surgeon. In my situation I moved on to the biopsy before I met with the surgeon as it was all set up by my pcp. I met with the surgeon after the biopsy to discuss the results and next step. Good luck and feel free to ask questions until you have peace of mind.",

There is nothing to be done but wait for f/u mam and take it from there. I also feel there is nothing wrong with getting your path report/path slides, films and getting a 2nd opinion on what was found. There is nothing there now to look at further because your margins were clear. You are very fortunate that you don't need additional treatment like tamox, surgery or radiation etc. Please give yourself an emotional break and be happy that what ever was there is now out. At this time be delligent in getting your f/u mam as suggested and do your monthly bse. Enjoy your monday because it is a new day and you are in the clear. If you have additional questions right them down and call the office and tell them you need to talk with the dr for clarification on some concerns you have about your findings. That is okay too.

As soon as the insurance would allow I went begging for a baseline mammo. Unfortunately for me they found a mass. The good news was they felt it was benign, gave me a birad 3 and a 6 month f/u script. The beginning of the wait game. What a fun game to play. This is a team sport so rely on your team mates to pull you through. In October I went for my f/u mammo which confirmed the mass was still there and changed ever so slightly. I was given another birad 3 and told to f/u in 6 months again. Oh no I knew I couldn't wait another 6 months... I wanted this baby out. Well I went to the best bc surgeon here and he refused to take it out. I asked for a biopsy and reluctantly he obliged and gave me a script for it. Okay it was a benign fibroadenoma and  it still remains in there. UGH. In February I started having dark brown discharge out of the same breast. After a few episodes I went to my pcp and she ordered a diagnostic mammo. Like you they found a are of tiny clustered microcalcifications. Birad 4 for a cluster of indeterminate microcalcifications. I had a stereotactic biopsy (not that bad) and it came back benign but atypia cells were found.  For me.. this was not a perfect benign finding. After all my research I learned that the standard of care is to do an excisional biopsy after atypical cells found on stereotactic  biopsy. My bc did not agree and told me to wait 6 months for f/u. Several words were exchanged and my husband and I were not pleased. After this appt I sought a 2nd opinion (very common when dealing with the fear of bc) at a well known cancer hospital. My new breast surgeon ordered an MRI and advised that f/u surgical excision was necessary. I had my MRI which was not too impressive and I am set to have surgery tomorrow. Like dukemom I learned early on to keep my thoughts to myself except when I come here. This was a painful lesson to learn for me. Monkeys.... oh how the monkeys and I have bonded. when they wake me up at night we go and have a party. I move blankets to the couch and we watch movies together until they fall asleep. I try to leave them sleeping on the couch while I slip back under the bed covers. Sometimes they follow me shortly thereafter but most of the time they are passed out and away from me!  During the day they try to bother me but I keep busy and they get bored with me running around so they leave me alone for the most part. Waiting... the waiting stinks and there is nothing more to say! You have some control though. Like dukemom I am an advocate for getting your stuff yourself. Your records are yours so get them and hold onto them. I have every report for every test that was done. Sometimes I got my reports before the doctor called me to give them. I push for appointments, results and anything else I can have an effect on. I don't call it being pushy. I just want to make sure I get tests, appts and results as soon as possible. Hang in there and be your own advocate for your health.  Good luck today getting everything in order. Go girl! Hugs to you (sorry so long) KED ",

I was so busy this past weekend that I was wiped out before surgery so my body is loving the rest. The pain is another thing. I am having alot of pain and I can't lower my rt arm all the way to my side. Sleeping is a real trick because I always sleep on my right side and I have to sleep on my back which I hate. I am loving the vicodin so far. I hate drugs so I am going to try tylenol today and take vic at night. We will see. My surgery was in the 10 o'clock area and there is little larger than a 2 inch incision. She got alot out of me, both my clips and I think the newer mass that was growing. She told my hubby the masses looked good and that I have a mess in there, lots of dense tissue and cysts. Glad to know. I hope to get my results within the week and don't follow up with the dr. until 7/1. I feel good about the outcome. Beth I agree the steps up to surgery were not that bad. the wire insertion was interesting but I got to sit the entire time in front of the mam machine but boy do they keep you locked in there tight. And the best part of it all was the nubming before the iv needle insertion. Never had that before and I loved it. My nurse was so nice. Well I am off to eat something and go back to rest again. Beth.. I pray we both get quick benign results. Hugs to you but ever so gentley. KED ",

Okay that leaves me a 70% chance nothing is there. I am unsure as to whether I should continue seeking a 2nd opinion regarding doing a re-excision of that area to see if there is anything else there. Anyone here ever have this type of finding and take a wait and see approach? I know this is a really silly battle I am having but I just don't know what to do. I am already having a major duct excision on 4/23 for spont bloody discharge which hasn't been spontaneous in several weeks and is only on expression now. I thought of cancelling that surgery but my dear husband said not to. I really am tearing myself up over this bc I don't have anyone knowledgable to talk with about it. I tried my pcp but she said I need to talk with the surgeon. He said no to the re-excision but is putting me on the table anyway and I have the 2nd opinion scheduled but am having second thoughts because I am thinking I am stupid for looking for something that may or may not be there and if it is there it will show in time.

Up until yesterday were you still having discharge? If so what color and was it spontaneous or only upon manual expression. I am asking because I cancelled my surgery because we did not see anything in the dialated duct on u/s and the bleeding had stopped. This past week I noticed a small dot on my nice new bra (another story) and knew it was back. I expressed a little that night too. I had an MRI 2 1/2 weeks ago and they did not find any mass in the duct either. I am wondering now if I should have just had the surgery. I am going in for re-excision this month to remove the old mass that was confirmed a fibroadenoma, a new mass they found and then the atypical area they found on biopsy. Maybe if I tell her about the bleeding she will do the ductal excision at the same time. I have not had any since but that is how it has been; on and off. I hope you have a good recovery and bounce back with b9 results. If your results are not so b9 then at least you know you have a place to turn to.

I just tell her what is going on and don't discuss my feelings with anyone anymore. Well except for you ladies and the few ladies from this board that I have come to chat with off board. You did not discourage me from having the surgery. If I had atypical cells found on cytology I would have moved forward with it. With only the blood and excess epithelial cells showing on cytology and no evidence of anything on u/s I decided to take the wait and see approach. I didn't want to deal with the pain from surgery, the issues with the nipple and the fact that I homeschool and didn't want to be out of commission just yet. Now summer is here I sing a different tune. I go on Thursday to meet with the surgeon and will discuss this with her. I am thinking she is going in to take out 2 masses and an area of tissue where atypical cells were found why not go in and take the ducts too.  Please keep us posted on your results.

My final wide excision/lumpectomy diagnosis was a buffet of terms... FEA, CCLA, ALH widespread over my tissue samples. I also have several dialated ducts but so far nothing is showing in them. I have had periodic bloody discharge on that side too. I am telling you all this because like you I am up for f/u tests in October. I have a MRI, mamm, u/s all scheduled. I am also seeing a specialist to discuss my risks. ALH is tricky and sneaky and from what I have read very scary. It doesn't like pictures so it hides. If and when it becomes invasive (ILC) it may not come in the form of a lump but more like thickening or what some describe as a pencil shape lump running along the ducts from lobules.  I am with you and will be thinking of you.
