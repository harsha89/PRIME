The first indication was hairline fractures in my neck (cervical spine) and like a robot, I said, \"OK\" when my medical oncologist advised me to get on my radiation oncologist's schedule--for 10 treatments.\" Foolishly, I thought since I endure 33 radiation treatments for my Stage IIIA breast cancer in 2004--these 10 would be a 'walk in the park'--by comparison. Not even close--devastating, as was wearing cervical neck collars for six months. It's taken me a long time to \"process\" this new reality. At first, I just couldn't imagine our carefree life coming to a halt. We had been full-time RVers for eight years, and now do that, part-time, along with Christian Volunteer RV work. I'll be 75 this weekend, and it really gripes me that the cancer-related fatigue has me under it's spell. I try not to \"fight it\" but gracefully come upstairs and stretch out for at least an hour. I hate the way I can't move as quickly as I used to, and while my IDEAS are still running rampant, I just run out of steam and don't accomplish a lot each day. I agree with Shetland Pony--we need to raise our collective voices for more $$, more research, more support to MBC--it's like a disease that's hidden in the closet! It's not our fault--we did nothing wrong! ",
