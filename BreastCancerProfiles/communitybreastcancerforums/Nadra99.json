In addition, my mom had secondary sarcoma of the breast almost 3 years ago.  She is NED (No evidence of disease) and doing great. It is definitely very important to discuss the treatment options with a specialist. My mom is in San Francisco and had all her treatment here. First, her breast was removed so that clear margins could be achieved.  Next, she did about 5 months of weekly chemo at CPMC in SF, then 4 weeks of twice daily targeted radiation at Stanford.  Not everyone agrees on the order of things or whether radiation should be part of the regimen, so do not worry. In the end, you just have to decide. Doctors disagree, people disagree, so talk to as many experts as you can and do what you think sounds the best for you.  You got this!",
