It's def not a fun ride but look at it as I did when I embarked on this journey. 10 or so months for me(which is the projected time frame for the entire treatment including surgeries, chemo and rads) s nothing compared to the rest of your life. We need to tackle this beast with all that is avail as one person also said. Try to stay positive. I told myself I would have more good days than bad and I expect nothing less because I owe it to myself and my 6 year old twin boys! God is with you each and every step of the way as well as this support group and your family. If you speak spanish, which I'm sure you do going by your name on here, sige viviendo tu vida y defruta. Todo esto va a pasar y Dios ya te tiene en sus manos. Besos. May",
