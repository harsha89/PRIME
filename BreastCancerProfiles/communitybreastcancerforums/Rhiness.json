I'm no expert on anything but worrying.. and that i know is often a lot harder on you than the actual problem.. Try just keep telling yourself \"I'm gonna be fine\".. If possible try not to let the other thoughts in.. because it's hugely  likely u will be coming home with a nice medicine to make it better..  and if they take a bit of time before they come with that result well they probably are just making sure u are going to be ok... If u don't feel confident of the answers u are given you don't have to just go home and worry.. u can get a second opinion.. it may cost but you are worth it.. oh and do come back and tell the gals online here exactly what u are told cos some have became very knowledgeable.. so u are not alone with this worry.. Good luck for tomorrow..",
