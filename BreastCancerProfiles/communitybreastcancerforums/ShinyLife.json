Doc called the next day to share that the path findings were again benign. I don\u2019t have a copy of the path report yet. A rare tumor can still be benign, so hopefully that\u2019s all it is. Good luck.",

They gave me the results that were in, benign. But then has to follow up the next week that it\u2019s discordant. Almost might have been easier waiting until radiology and pathology had finished conferring. Hang in there",

I'm sure three weeks seems like an eternity right now, but it's not. I'm approaching two months since my architectural distortion finding and will hopefully have a final answer next week after tomorrow's excisional biopsy. So you're not alone. I've been trying to focus on being present with my family during the holidays, but that's easier said than done.",
