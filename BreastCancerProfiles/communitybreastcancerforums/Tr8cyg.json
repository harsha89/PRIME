I'm totally in the dark and everything is just sinking in. Is it normal to be very nauseous? Or is it just nerves? When is the best time to tell the kids? I'm so worried about them. I can tell they know something is up. Their only 6 & 11. I'm scared and feel so alone even though I have friends and family by my side. Any suggestions on how to cope during this waiting game?

She is emailing me links for my area. I love your approach with having the children play a role. That's exactly what my 11 yr old would insist upon. He's already asking to do things for me because he knows something is up. So sweet.",
