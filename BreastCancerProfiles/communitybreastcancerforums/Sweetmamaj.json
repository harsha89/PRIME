Most likely, if you were told to not use Al containing products, they would want you to refrain during your treatment weeks. But your RO may say it's okay after rads, or wait several hours, or only use on unaffected underarm, or a number of other things. My RO personally does not think it interferes with rads but the handout from the center that I go to says to refrain from using it. I've been using non-alumimun products for years, which works--somewhat. There are a lot of products out there---try to get ones that have relatively simple ingredients --simply because some dyes, perfumes, etc can be hard on your soon-to-be sensitive and radiated skin. Basically, I try to think of my radiated areas as super sensitive newborn skin--which means laundry detergents, soaps, etc are free of blah blah stuff, just like the deodorant. Maybe carry wet wipes for sensitive skin (like for newborns) if you feel that your deodorant is not working, but make sure you gently pat dry.",

QMC and Horsegirl, I don't know what I would do without these boards! It's great validation that this fatigue is real, and not because I'm feeling puny, or getting a cold, or something else. When my RO casually mentioned fatigue, I though it would be gradual and feel like a minor inconvenience. Definitely did NOT expect to be smacked down feeling like suddenly half my red blood cells had disappeared in a matter of hours. I guess I should take advantage of any bursts of energy in anticipation of things to come. Ok, just remembered that I've also been feeling dehydrated--like stand up and see stars dehydrated. Normally I drink tons of water, but have been adding gatorade powder. On another note, my throat has also been sore, even though my field does not reach that high. They let me leave on my earrings and sometime a small necklace. So I asked the techs why they don't use those thyroid shields anymore (for you younger gals, it's a type of lead apron that just drapes across your neck), and was told that the type of rads they use \"doesn't cause radiation scatter\". She said I didn't have to worry about other parts of my body (aside from what my RO already said: \"only the top part of the L lung and hardly any part of your heart\") receiving unwanted radiation. It was somewhat reassuring, but they still run behind the lead wall :) ",

Anyhow, when I imagine telling that google-eyes story to the friends who know that I have cancer, most of them would chuckle. Some with big guffaws and snickers.

Got the certificate, and rang the very anticlimactic bell. But another chapter is finished. (hopefully). Last week I asked how long each zap was and was told it was not measured in time, but in \"metered dosage\". Each measured dose of cGy's was the same for me (279.0 cGy), but there are factors that change the length of time (was told it was mili-seconds). The factors include my breathing rate (the machine will pause if I'm holding my breath too long, or if I take a huge breath), the temperature outside, and the temperature inside the room. Apparently the machine is fussy and operates at an optimum ambient temperature range--one of the reasons why the room is always so cool. Anyhow, the older (and now newer Cobalt -Gamma Knife Rad) Cobalt rads were based on time, but these txs are measured in metered doses. At least that's was I was told! ",

When you go on Monday, try and get as comfortable as you can before they start the sim, because you might have to hold that position for a while. My hands got numb because they were falling backwards out of the arm rests during the sim and I was not allowed to move them. Also, they inked me 3 times (sims, 2 weeks later at the start of rads, and a week after that) because the ink \"kept disappearing\" despite the stickers they put over tats. So I asked if they could use a bolder color and larger dots. Response? \"We don't want to make big marks for cosmetic reasons.\" Hello? Have you seen the incisional scars? Not to mention the derm reaction from the stickers. Anyway, I hope the neosporin does the trick for you. I imagine it would be weird to feel nothing when touching a part of yourself.

Please don't shout at me, those of you who have had BMX or UMX w/or w/o reconstruction...I hope I did not offend, and obviously do not have your perspective. Anyway... <tiptoes quietly off into the sideline> Ltam16, thank you! I hope the eucerin /aquaphor treatment helps. My nipple was itching like mad and the RO suggested aloe but said it was ok to use a steroid cream. She didn't give me an Rx, so I suppose any OTC one might work. I actually had an Rx at home and it was so much better! great relief! KKjmck, yes, you will probably get burned. How intense will be determined by lots of factors that probably only time will tell. Just try and be proactive re: skin care and clothing, and let your RO know if you're having problems. Keys-Plea, the machine had multiple beams of light that picked up on my movements and breathing. I figured out that one screen showed my breathing and the color would change from green to red when I would hold my breath or take really deep breaths. I asked if I could exhale and hold that during the zapping sounds but was told that since my CT sim was planned while I was breathing, that I could not hold my breath during the rad tx. (otherwise I think the machine would just stop and wait for me to breathe). It's weird.. I recall that someone indicated the machine picks up on breathing to help predict when to zap and it also helps to avoid zapping my lungs and heart \"more than necessary\". I still wanted to exhale and hold still but the techs would instruct me to breathe normally. ",
