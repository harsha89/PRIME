I am on two blockers daily.  I may try taking something before I go.  Also I will make sure I am hydrated before I go for the next one. I didn't know I was going to get this one until I was at the Dr.'s. He gave it to me before I left. This was the same day he told me it was stage IV. I am hoping this was a one time thing since no else has had this experince.  Thanks ladies.",
