I am sorry you are having to go through this, Take a deep breathe and try and relax. If the stress stays this bad you might need to talk to your doctor about giving you something to help you relax. They can give you a small dose that you only take when you really need it and it really does help. I would not have made it with out them. I will be sending good thoughts your way and B9 thoughts too. HUGS to you.",

Since the discharge is worse I decided to see a specialist. She order a new ultrasound and a ductagram. This time they found a mass. I have been told they want to do a core biopsy. I asked why that instead of just a surgical biopsy and they said they need to know if it is cancerous to know how to remove it.

Each time they took a sample they told me so I was ready. After they were finished they placed a marker so if they need to do anything else they can find the same spot easier I guess. Then after wards they did a mammo. When the told me they would going to do one I about freaked out because I thought how would I able to handle that but they do not fully compress it.

I woke up in recovery with a fever of 101.8. my normal temp is 97.4 and it takes a lot for me to run a fever. They were worried about infection so stuck me in for over night. My PS came to see me Thursday morning talking about sending me home with antibiotics since I was no longer running a fever. Then he takes a look at the fluid in the drain and decides he wants to culture it. then after looking at the sight which he says looks good but feels warm he has decided I need to be seen by an infectious disease doctor. They have determined I have a staph infection they just do not know which strand so basically which antibiotic to treat it with. This morning the nurse tells me I have reached the \"danger level\" for Tylenol so I have only taken muscle relaxers today and what do you know my fever spikes this afternoon. back up to 101.5. The put me back on the pain pills and it drops down to 100 last check. I am so tired of all of this. My PS said if they could not get the infection cleared up they might have to take out the TE till they do. But he left to go out of town for the week so one of his partners is following it. I think I am ready for them just to take it and be done with it just so I do not have to worry about it any more. They have not started fills yet so we are now two weeks late on that.

I wish I could talk to my BS but the way they do it is she handles all path. reports and the PS handles all the surgery.  The area around where the tupe was is all red and hot to the touch I tould him this but he said it would be fine till monday. So I guess I wait till monday and call first thing. One of my other drains is still draining a lot about 70 cc every 12 hours the other one hardly has 5 to 10 cc in 12 hours. If it was not for the drains I would be doing great. I have had very little pain today and am not as tired as I have been.  Best wishes to all. ",

I saw my BS to day and found out that they got it all. I will not have to do radiation. They did find quite a bit more DCIS then they thought was there so it is a good thing I went this route because they i would have ended up here in the long run. They did test the tissue they removed from the right side during the reduction and it was clear. I was very pleased . I then saw my PS he removed one drain but left the other because of the amount of fluid. He also said the skin around the incision has died and has to be removed so I head back to surgery tomorrow at 8:30. I am starting to feel that each time I take one step forward I get pull back two. Thanks everyone for your support. HUGS to all. ",

I rejoice with each of you who have are getting along well and I prayer for each of you going through hardship. While I count my blessing because I am lucky they got all my DCIS out during my mastectomy. I have had so many set back that now I am feel good I look back and wonder where the last two weeks went. After I came home from the hospital last Wednesday I was rush to the ER Thursday night were I was readmitted to the hospital. I was there till yesterday. My bowels had basically shut down because of all the meds I have been on. I finally feel better than I have in two weeks. My PS took out my last drain today. I will have to wait at least six months for reconstruction. I know what I have gone through does not compare to what many of you are going through and I pray for each of you. Sending each of you blessing and lots of HUGS. Thanks for all the support. ",
