Golfergirl, I have put on about 6 pounds, it is very frustrating.  Hopefully, when this is over it will come off as quickly as it seems to have been gained. Leanna, the wig place I went to first wanted to charge me $25.00 for helping me, right....I just walked out.  Happy to hear your treatment went so quickly. Day, sounds like to you a like of 'natural' foods, drinks.  I admire you for that.  I don't know what half of what you are talking about, but think I may make a visit to the store to look around. My sister came for a visit, which is why I have not been blogging.  Anyway, she gave me the best 'feel better' card.  It had a turtle with a bandage on it.  Thing is my dad used to stop and pick up turtles on the road and carry them across to 'safety'.  She wrote in it that she sawa it and felt like my Dad was guiding her hand to it.  (He passed away 3 years ago)  It really hit home, that he is up there looking down, willing me to get better.  Little things like that make all the difference, don't you think?  Feel good everyone!

It burnt a bit, but they healed right away and have stayed away. Irishtess, good sense of humor and we need that.  Good luck with the next treatment.

Summer, Glad to hear from you.  I have been suffering the extreme fatigue around days 5-7.  So,  I am kind of expecting it this weekend.  When you are tired, you need to rest, it is as simple as that. I take lorazepam for anxiety.   I don't take it often, but when I need it, it helps.   Had to take two pills the night I shaved my head.  Golfer Girl, you must be thrilled to be nearing the end of the chemo.  They are giving me 6 treatments of the TC, and having finished #3 tonight and being  half way through, I am very excited. Well, it is an early night for me.  Stay well, love to all of you. Judy",

Congrats on getting 1/2  way there.  That's me  tomorrow. I can't wait. Hi Fotopet, are you doing okay?

On a great note, I too found out how wonderful friends and coworkers are...yesterday almost the entire staff came to school wearing scarves.  I was so touched. We took pictures after the kids left.  I will never forget the feeling of love, support and concern. And my \u2018buzz' went as well as can be expected.  My sons and husband were great.  My youngest son clipped it short and then my husband shaved my head.   Today woke up thinking - I'm really bald.  Not wearing anything around the house, went to the store wearing a hat.

Xray girl, welcome,  you are sure to learn alot, and I have never heard any complaints of any kind. You and I are on the same plan, I started 5/10.  I have had three and my next is July 12. To answer some of you questions, yes, I eat more and attribute it to the steroids.  I crave salty more than sweet.  I also think the water weight is a factor and once this is over things may even out. Fotopet, sounds like you to have a fun weekend plan.  Enjoy and stay away from the 14 days. NJ Girl, passing out really, how scary and dangerous is that - just hang in there. The drs will work with you on getting through the SE. Drim, I am glad you are doing so well, this third TC did me in.  How many are you having?  My dr wants 6, but says we will see how we do after 4. JennyB, CONGRATULATIONS, you are done, I am so happy for you. You will be able to lead us down the path of rads......

Day - I too have not received the neulasta shot or even spoken to a dr. about it.  I will at my next treatment.  I can't imagine dealing with what you have to be going through - the very least you expect is someone to listen.  I love your idea of the dark glasses and earrings! Jen- hope you are feeling better.  The drs. told me my numbers were 2400 and that if they were 500, I would have been admitted.  Happy they were high. DancerMel - Good luck to you this Friday! Sunflower - as I said above, no neulasta so far for me.  You are just a few days ahead of me.  I am on day 9 today.  My hair is okay so far, but it is the biggest thing I am concerned about.  I too have very thick hair and I finally love my haircut.... Claudette - Keeping you in my thoughts today, hope it went well. Countryfrau - So glad your treatment was uneventful...that is what is best! JennyB - I hear what you are saying about going out in public with a wig...everyone says, don't worry, you'll look great, but I am not looking forward to it.  Hang in there, I am feeling your pain and hoping knowing others feel the same, makes it a little more tolerable. Sacphotomom - hope your treatment goes well tomorrow. Welcome to Mommyto4!  I know you will enjoy being on this blog, it has the best women in the world!!!!! Hi Drim, hope you are having a great day. Everyone have a great Wednesday!",

Redbarb,  you have a great attitude,  I am actually liking getting out of the shower and not having to do my hair....AND  what an amazing weekend.  You have such a great support group.  Winning the meet just caps off how great you are and how loved you are! Snipinfool, it must be so much worse when you have to deal with a \u2018period'.  Being through menopause makes this easier.  It just gives me more cause to hold all of you up as heros!  Love the mohawk story, this too will be memories for you and your family - making it stronger. Leanna, so glad you are getting to put this aside for a little bit and enjoy your vacation.  Disney is such fun. Three year olds are so amazing.  My grandson is nine and I so remember all of the wonderful things he would say at that age....I loved it. NJgirl, you sound amazing, taking your 19 year old to Universal, such fun.  He'll never forget it!  Our kids went places with us well into their 20's.  Still do, just harder now, having their own families and schedules. Irishtess, you are amazing, one cancer should be enough.  I admire your strength and courage. I have taken the Zofran and have not had any nausea at all. Packjen, sorry to hear about the allergy - rash.  Do hope they figure it out, so you can stay on this path to recovery sooner. Summer38 - as I said earlier, felt like crying most of the weekend.  I think it is okay to have our dips - every so often. Cleob, way to let nothing hold you down. - you're amazing and an inspiration to all of us! Day, pray everything gets on course for you now that you have confidence in your dr. It makes all the difference. Have a great day - off to get dressed for work!",

Once again, I don't know how you moms do it all.  He is only 8 weeks old so there was a lot of holding and rocking.  Tomorrow back to my real job..... Latte, sorry for the late post, I do have a port and it works beautifully, but it was put in before I started.  Hope you can get one, I think it makes it easier, but it is also what I am used to doing so, who knows? Jenny, I too take the Ativan at night, it helps me sleep. Paxton, love the pictures of you and the baby! Kim, Love that hubby shaved his head too, what a guy! I'm going to use the website you sent too, thanks! You and golfergirl are ahead of us.  Best wishes for a full and  speedy recovery. NJ Girl, I know this is late, but hope all is went well with your treatment.. Sacphotomom, love the youtube video, thanks. I think you can tell, when blood levels are low, no one knows our bodies, like we do. Laura, sorry to hear about the sore throat, when is this ever enough already?  Will you need radiation too? Patricia, congrats to you for still walking, I get short of breath and lay on the couch. Day, I too got my Good Wishes scarf, and I love it.  What a wonderful organization.  It is so nice to know there are very good people in the world. Also, glad to hear you won't have to do more treatments after the chemo, other than the tamoxifen. Golfergirl, Things are winding down for you on the chemo., I am very happy for you.  You will have to let us know how the radiation goes. You will be in the fore front for most of us. Barb, sorry to hear about your feet and hands.  I haven't had that SE.  How did the treatment go? Mel, to be so close to finishing, I agree, try to stick with the regimen you started,  just listen to the dr.  too,... Jen, I get the hives too.   Rashes sporadically all over, stomach, legs, back, I have begun  to  use iodine.  It burns, but it dries it up quickly. Summer, a daughter graduating, high emotions! Leanna, thanks for the advice on the cleaning and wow; how lucky to win. Stay well everyone, have no SE this week and breeze through any of your treatments. Judy ...",

I also saw my onc., he is stopping the last two chemo treatments due to some severe low blood pressure 80/37 and a rapid heart rate.  So, now I am gearing up for the radiation.  I will go to two doctors tomorrow - my radiologist for the CT and my eye doctor for a check up on how things are progressing. You have all been in my thoughts and prayers.  Hope to never be away this long again. I seriously missed reading and writing to everyone.  Hang in there, we are all so important to our families, friends and especially to each other. Judy",
