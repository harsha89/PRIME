I had 4 rounds of chemo with Neulasta after each one. I tolerated the whole thing quite well, thankfully. I am a little tired, but that's really not my complain. What I worry about is the bone pain that's always in the same areas (lefy upper leg and left side in what seems to be the stomach area). Anyone else experience some pain that is lasting after chemo? Mon onc said not to worry on my last visit, a week after last chemo, that it would go away. I just dont like the fact that it's in a specific area. It's not constant pain, more like a dull pain that feels almost like a bruise (the leg hurts more but it comes and goes).

If that can help you at all, it has been 6 months since my surgery (so 7 months since diagnosis and coming up on 3 months since last chemo) and I am doing great. I remember wondering how would life ever go back to normal, worrying about my 3 young kids, my mind going to dark places, trying to figure out how this could have happened, analyzing every little detail about my life, nutrition, medication, past x-rays, fertility drugs, contraceptive pill, alocohol consumption, etc. How could this happen to me, I am young, healthy, active, had recently switched to a vegetatian diet?! You have just been traumatised. What you are feeling is normal and I promise that it will pass. Let the eomotions come to you, allow yourself to feel what ever it is that you are feeling. If you feel crapy, so be it. If you're worried, that's ok too. Scared... confused... just let it all come to you. Some of the best things I have done were being part of a groupd of woman at the hospital that met once a week, we all had breat cancer and just talked. The hospital also offered a free consultations service and talking with the person one on one there has really helped me deal with the emotions. The more steps I took, the more secure I felt. Surgery & treatment choice and end of treatments were big mile stones for me. Life has certainly changed and \"normal\" is not the same as it was, but I can honestly say that I feel stronger now. You will be amazed at the wonderful people in your life. Things will settle down. On day at a time, this too shall pass. Right now, you're still in the middle of it.

We live in a small town and the option to get second opinions that could vary greatly isn't really here. I trust my dr's and my onco is very kind and has a very human approach, but I dont like that she seems to want to stick to the book so closely. She doesn't really want to talk about me not getting  a port or choosing between such and such drugs. It has me wondering \"is it because it trully is the best option for my health or is it because that's standard procedure and (yes, I do wonder) also more $ for the hospital\". She did mention that it could ruin my veins and I do understand that. But how big is the risk? I respect everyone's choice because in the end it really comes down to what you can live with as an individual. I personnaly feel that if I need a scar to remind me of what I survived, I can lift my shirt up and see the scar that goes from the middle of my chest all the way to my armpit, LOL!

Mri showed satellites around those too lumps... it just kept getting worse with every test they did. Then a phone call with the positive results from the 1st biopsy and a few days later, the secons one was positive too. My tumors were 1.9 and 1.2mm. Bigger than Joan's. After all that negative stuff, the good news came after mastectomy that my nodes were negative. So I was stage 1. I had to decide if I was going to do chemo or not. I too had been told that I might not need it at all but efter a few dr's opinions, I decided to go for 4 rounds (I had some LVI... another way cancer could have spread). Chemo was no fun, but it was certainly doable and not at all as bad as I expected it to be. I am now on Tamoxifen...

Mine were seen on a breast MRI but not on u/s. My tumors were in fact bigger than Joan's (1.9cm/19mm and 1.2cm/12mm). The size of your tumor, as I am sure you know, is one of the factors that determines what stage your cancer is. The fact that I had 2 tumors did not change my statistics. The dr's looked at my bigger tumor and that's how they staged me. If both of Joan's tumor (and maybe the second one wont even be cancerous) are under 1cm/10mm that is really good news. I think survival rates are very close to 100% at that stage. Good luck with surgery on Thursday. Is Joan going to have a lumpectomy or mastectomy?

My dr is recommanding 4 rounds of chemo (TC) and we discussed me getting a port. She says that I can also just get it through my veins if I dont mind needles but that there is a chance that my veins get damaged. But if I get a port, that's one more scar (and I already lost my whole breast ;-) ) and my dear friend said it really hurt when hers was taken out. I would love to hear from you and see what you have to say about your choice. Gosh I am glad to heave found these boards... thanks all!

You ladies are so strong and so inspirering.. thanks forsharing all this info and your journeys with me; it is so encouraging! A tatoo is such a nice idea, what a way to make the most of it. I will most certainly keep that one in mind! Christina, your story proves that everyone is different. I hope that talking some more with my dr will help me feel confident with the choice I make (still dont know what it would be... so cant wait to know what I will be doing exactly, I do hope it will ease the fear and bring me some peace of mind).",

We discussed the big lines and my dr said I would be getting Neulasta after chemo to help with my immune system. I thought I once heard my friend tell me that I should really stay away from the shot, but my onc seems to be telling me that it is pretty much standard procedure.  I would be curious to see what you have to say about it. Did any of you opt not to have it? I have read about the bone pain... how bad is it? I am very curious to hear the pros and the cons.

LOL!  Is it possible to get blood drawn to see what your count is and have the neulasta only if needed then?",
