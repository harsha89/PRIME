I'm a newbie, and couldn't find the place you're supposed to introduce yourself (is there one?), so I hope I'm not being rude, \"jumping right in\" with 2 questions. I'm 3 months shy of 59, and just got back mammo and ult.sd. results:  I already knew from self-exams that I had a lump in my left breast, but only after I got home today did I find the lump in my lymph node area (quite deep in at the lower end of the underarm).  I only found this bec. the u.s. results indicated \"lymph node involvement.\" My first question is:  has anyone ever heard of whether a lymph node in this kind of situation could be swollen yet not malignant?  Because if it is malignant, then evidently (from what I've been able to gather from research so far) it's metastatic b.c. which means bigtime trouble up ahead, even after I get the breast removed and the lump excised. My other question is:  does anyone know whether painful lymph nodes are a definite sign of cancer in them (bec. I have pain there off and on, though fortunately not excruciating)? I have an MRI-biopsy (90 min. of lying on your stomach!!!! Gonna do wonders for my bad neck and bad back!) Thursday in a week, but I'm trying to get a jump start on the big picture, so I can start planning (planning makes me feel a bit less threatened {snort}). Thanx in advance for any input!  (I'm posing both questions to cover the field thoroughly.)
