I'm really nervous about recurrence, because the treatment has been ultra-conservative.  At the same time, because my body over-reacts to just about everything - I'm VERY thankful I didn't have either rads or chemo. ",

      "Content": "Jul 24, 2013 01:09PM - edited Jul 24, 2013 01:09PM by gardengumby I don't see how it could be fat necrosis with no reconstruction.  Fat necrosis comes from the fat that they use to build your new breast not getting enough blood supply and hardening.  But I'm no surgeon, nor nurse, so that's just my opinion - I wouldn't take it to the bank or anything. I would assume scar tissue, but as all of us have paranoia issues at this point, I would hie thee to the dr as soon as he/she is available.",
