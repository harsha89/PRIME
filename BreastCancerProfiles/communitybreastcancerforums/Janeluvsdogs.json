Although the lymph node dissection group experienced fewer recurrences in the treated lymph node basin, this improvement in local control did not translate to a benefit in overall survival. In fact, when these patients did have recurrences, these were more likely to be distant disease. Since Fisher's landmark study, five RCTs evaluating ELND in breast cancer patients have failed to reveal a statistically significant survival advantage for patients treated with ELND.[16] The lack of evidence supporting the value of ELND for breast cancer patients in these five trials raised significant questions regarding the dogmatic but unproven traditional approach to surgical management in patients with cancer.
