After experimenting with different heart drugs we got that under control after about a week. I had 20 treatments scheduled, but my radiation oncologist wanted me to come back and do 9 more for a total of 16. He said the 7 would not be effective, but the 16 would. So I did go back. So ask you oncologist what the minimum number is recommended for you. Mine was willing to adjust.",

My local breast center automatically assigned a surgeon to me, who is very nice, but a general surgeon, not specifically a breast surgeon. He has ordered three biopsies for me and has been managing the process so far. Everyone I have talked to who has been through this experience in my area has been to a group of surgeons who are just breast cancer surgeons and I would rather go to them. How and when do I make the switch? Do I go in for a consultation with the first surgeon , or do I have him give all my reports to the other group and go to them first? Not sure how this works !",
