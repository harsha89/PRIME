I had surgery (UMX with immediate DIEP) the following March and then he started to tell people.  Also my hair was coming back and I was sick of wigs so I started just wearing a baseball cap.  I live in an area of the NE with very high breast cancer rates so no one really seemed shocked at my diagnosis and treatment. As far as work, I was already telecommuting most days anyway and telecommuted full time during treatment, I told only the co-workers I needed to.  I was fortunate to mostly feel well and I worked, worked out at the gym and pretty much just carried on with normal life.  Being diagnosed in the fall, I kept a goal in my mind that by Memorial Day, it would all be over, I would sit on the beach and have hair.  And while it was chilly I did sit on the beach that day happily with my inch of hair. It is hard to believe its been 2 years this month.  I read these boards and I remember people saying you'll look back and not believe you actually went through it and they were right.  I feel great and continue on working, running, biking and skiing.",

Herceptin alone was very easy.  I felt a little tired after the infusion and the next day but other than that I was fine. ",

I have received 3 infusions so far, every other week and no SEs except for the occasional runny nose and a slightly horse voice a day or two after treatment. Unfortunately, the SRT left me with severe peripheral neuropathy affecting my right arm and leg. I was doing well and then regressed rapidly. An MRI pointed to the increase in necrosis. You will be monitored for high blood pressure and increased protein in your urine. I try to not post here as I do not have an official stage 4 diagnosis. The lesion was found by accident during a cervical spine MRI taken due to some carpel tunnel symptoms I had. It did not present as cancerous on the first brain MRI and could not be biopsied due to the location. The lesion has been called everything from a random finding to a breast cancer met depending on who you ask and is officially diagnosed as a pituitary adenoma. So far while the Avastin quickly alleviated the return of symptoms such as nausea, the neuropathy remains. My neuro-onc wants to add Xeloda which I am willing to try. My MO is hesitant due to the lack of cancer diagnosis. He would like to add Herceptin-Perjeta due to my original Her2+++ breast cancer and my pCR from 6 rounds of TCH and less SEs. The HP combo will be a really tough sell to my insurance co because they would be going on the assumption that not only is it a met, it is also Her2+++. My doctors were all in agreement that Tykerb \"doesn't work\". Reading these boards there does seem to be mixed reviews.",

Except for some fatigue and alterted taste buds she did fine. Her hair grew back quickly too. She is now almost 85, she takes letrozole and is completely independent, still driving, etc. My MO said that often older patients do better on chemo because they have low hormone levels. Her oncotype score came in borderline but because of a positive node she opted for chemo. Best wishes to you and your mom and whatever decision is made will be the right one for her.",

I am very nervous about the SEs but I am currently suffering from severe neuropathy from a possible brain met so I am hoping this combo helps. I'e purchased the Immodeum, Pepto, probiotic and lotions to combat potential hand/foot syndrome. My MO is only giving me 500mg of Xeloda because my initial BC diagnosis was Her2+++ so the feeling is the Tykerb will do the job but it works better with Xeloda. I plan on eating lots of pasta, rice and bananas. I am cautiously optimistic that this combo does the trick.",
