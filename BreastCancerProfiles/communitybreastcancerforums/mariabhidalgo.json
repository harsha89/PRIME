I started trying to figure out if I had the same on y other breast and see if i was imagining things, but it definitely was different. while searching i found a bigger longer lump on the same left side so i thought that maybe that was the pain that was radiating to the smaller lump. i went to my gyno and told my symptoms, also i mentioned upper back pain for the last month, and a milk let down feeling (i have not breast fed in 8 years), she felt the lump and sent me to a mammo and ultrasound. when the radiologist asked i mentioned the bigger lump because in my head i thought the bigger one was the one to worry about and i thought the other was maybe my imagination. it turns out the big one is nothing and the small one is a 1.7cm mass that they diagnosed as a birad 3, probably bening mass that appears to be a fibroadenoma and sent me to come back in 6 months, they marked it as incidental finding because i was not assertive enough to mention it. they also told me i have dense breasts. i am 38 i have three kids i have had skin cancer and and cervical dysplacia. I don't know if i want to wait 6 months or ask for a biopsy, any thoughts or similar experiences would be be greatly appreciated. thanks maria Log in to post a reply",
