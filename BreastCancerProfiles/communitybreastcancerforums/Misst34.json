      "Content": "Misst34 wrote: Hi yesterday I had a mammogram and ultrasound done on my right breast. I have a lump at 12:00 on my outer breast, it is long and narrow. I am 34 years old and everyone I dealt with yesterday seemed off. And I felt like I got \"sugar coated\" answers. When I first went in the tech said if the mammo was fine and they could see it was a cyst I would be on my way. The next thing I know they couldn't tell so I needed an ultra sound. Then I went to ultra sound where they said the dr would be in to either look again or just let me know. The dr came in and said go ahead and sit up, I don't know what it is. Wait what? Then why not look at it again? Then he said I will need a biopsy. So then he left and the tech stayed and I had some tears in my eyes, she said something to me and started crying, and gave me a hug. I just thought, she must have had a bad day. Then it was like wait why does she have more tears then I? Am I the one having the bad day? So after that she left and i am baffled, I see a paper lying there and in big letters I see Malignant mass vs Cyst. Then I see my name. Not sure if that was the reading from my mammogram or the ultrasound...My question is how often do they use \"malignant mass\" and can they determine that from an ultra sound? After I saw that my mind went to the worst... Log in to post a reply",
