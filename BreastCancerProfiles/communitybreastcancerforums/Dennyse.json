However I fell from the dizziness of the side effects of the drugs. I threw my back out and boy did I hurt. But today I was able to get up and around, took a half shower, and had lunch with family in the patio. I do not know if I did any damage to the surgical site or implants, but nothing tells me there's a problem What a journey this is! How are other early Aug surgeries doing?
