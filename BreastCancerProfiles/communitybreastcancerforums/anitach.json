My face, neck and chest looked like I had a sunburn every time. It usually went away within 2 days. I did actually have an allergice reaction on my 4th taxotere treatment where my throat started to close up and I actually passed out for a minute in the middle of the infusion so they switched me to Abraxane which was a lot easier to handle for me. However, even with the Abraxane I still got the Chemo Flush.... I think it is a side effect of all the taxanes.  Hope this helps and you are doing well with the treatments. Anita",

I am wondering how long it takes to feel back to \"normal\". I told my husband just last week that I still feel like I'm on chemo. I'm fatigued and still feel that kind of achiness that I can't describe to people but I know you women know what I'm talking about. I have been taking a 7.5 mg Lortab every evening after work to get help me enjoy my family time in the evenings. I'm afraid now that I am addicted to the Lortab. I just wish I felt \"good\" again and wonder if it will ever happen. BTW, I am Stage IV with mets to lymph nodes and will probably be on Herceptin forever. I keep hoping that this feeling is just residual from chemo and not due to the Herceptin. Is anyone else feeling like me???

About three weeks ago I started having a pain on my left side starting in my neck and going all the way down and across my collar bone. I told my onc. about it the Thursday before last but he didn't feel anything. I never could pinpoint the pain so I thought it must be a pinched nerve. When I went shopping it got worse, I guess from carrying bags, but then about the middle of last week I didn't notice any pain anymore. I have had a cold with a lot of sinus and chest congestion for over a week. A few days ago I was feeling all over my neck again just in case and found a tiny lump on the left side of my neck. At first I thought I was just rolling a tendon but then I could definitely tell it was like a marble rolling under my fingers. It is about the size of a pea. Then yesterday I was feeling more and found another one similar in size right above my right collarbone. I have been NED since Aug. '07 and now I'm scared to death this is a recurrence. I can't believe the Herceptin has stopped working for me. Please someone tell me this could be anything but cancer. I'm so scared. Has anyone else had enlarged nodes that caused pain?

I think when you are on a chemo treatment having surgery is ten times harder on your body. When I first started chemo they started my out on cytoxin and taxotere. During my fourth infusion of taxotere I had an allergic reaction to the taxotere. My throat started closing up and I passed out for a minute. After that my insurance agreed to pay for the abraxane. Even after just the four doses of the taxotere I can tell you without a doubt that the abraxane is MUCH easier than the taxotere. Still lose your hair but the fatigue and joint pain were much less severe. I would fight hard for the abraxane if I were you.' Wishing you the best and hoping you have pain free days soon!! Anita",

      "Content": "anitach wrote: So Thursday will go down as a day from hell for me. Please bear with me, I'll try to make this fiasco as short as possible, but I really need to share. I am on Herceptin every 3 weeks.... I go in Thursday morning for my Herceptin treatment. Because we have had a major ice storm here I actually hadn't had a treatment in 4 weeks. The treatment room was packed and I usually go straight from there to work so I seriously considered leaving and rescheduling for the next week. Just as that thought crossed my mind they called me back..... the first preemptive strike by the angel on my shoulder! The nurse sticks my port as usual but when she does it is unusually painful and blood squirts into the syringe immediately. She notices that the blood is brown indicating that it seems old. She tries to push the syringe to flush the port and I feel a pressure in the cath in my chest like it is going to blow. She calls over the more experienced nurse who determines that they should not touch the port anymore (preemptive strike #2!) and starts the infusion in my arm. Luckily the surgeon that put my port in is right across the hall so I go over to his office as soon as my Herceptin infusion is done. He determines that the port needs to just come out and proceeds to do that right there in his office with some numbing medication (still OUCH!). So after he gets the port out I asked him what was wrong with it. He says he doesn't see anything wrong with it and they flushed it out just fine.... that didn't seem right to me. I get dressed and am on my way out the door to go to work. Just as I get to the door he calls out my name to come back (preemptive strike #3!). He notices that the catheter that he pulled out was slightly jagged on the end, he worries that part of it may have broken off. Sends me over for an xray. I have the xray and go back to his office to wait. He calls me into his office and shows that there is indeed a piece of catheter broken off of the port. Only it's not just a little piece - it is in fact 12 cm long and it is in my HEART!!! He calls my cardiologist who wants me transported to Vanderbilt in Nashville via ambulance to remove the cath from my heart immediately. In Nashville they do a procedure where they went through my femural artery up to my heart and fished the cath out with a \"hook\". I stayed overnight for observation and am now home and portless. Needless to say, I am just feeling so very fortunate that the cath was found the easy way via xray as opposed to the hard way - heart attack or pulmonary embolism! The nearly 6 inch piece of catheter was in my left atrium and pulmonary artery. Today I am just very sore in my chest where the port was. Last week I had started having heart palpitations but I chalked them up to anxiety from the power outage and ice storm that we had here. I guess this just serves as yet another reminder to listen to our bodies and not take any chances... if you all are like me you get tired of constantly telling a doctor or nurse of all our aches and pains and feel like you are being a hypochondriac. That is why I didn't go to the Dr. about the heart palpitations.... I didn't want to be a complainer!! The bottom line for me today is I praise God (HE is able tripleneg!!) and for one more day am so so happy to be alive!!!

If it weren't for the constant ball games and practices and play dates and parties I would plop my butt on the couch every evening and not get up except to go to bed! I have found that for the week of my treatment (I am on every 3 weeks) pain pills help give me a boost at the end of the work day to carry on with the rest of the evening.

I was diagnosed in May '07 at the age of 35 with IDC and mets to axillary, subclavicular, intermammary, and one mediastinal lymph node. They told me that the mediastinal node made me a Stage IV. After 3 round of chemo with Herceptin a PET scan showed me to be NED. I finished 5 more rounds of chemo and another PET scan in January showed still NED. I am now on Herceptin only for at least another year. I always thought from the beginning that if the cancer went away that I would be looking at having a mastectomy. However, after the second NED report came back my onc decided that there was not reason to remove \"healthy breast\" or radiate \"healthy nodes\". I still am not sure about this decision. I know some say that there is no point in surgery for a Stave IV patient but since I am NED I wonder if it could still benefit me, especially since my Mets were confined to lymph nodes. Any input or opinions from you knowledgeable ladies out there would be great.... Anita",

I am now on Herceptin only. I still worry a little about the decision - like am I asking for a reoccurance by not having my breasts removed? But then again I understand my Dr's. reasoning that there really is nothing to remove, ie. no tumor to take out anymore! So for now I'm going to go with that!",

I lost my hair but not my periods!! However, I am Er/PR- so the doctors never were concerned about it. They said that my body is hard to trick. You being hormone positive might be a problem since estrogen may affect your cancer. I know a lot of women who are ER+ have an oopherectomey to have their ovaries removed. It might be something for you to look into. Hoping for lots of luck in treatment coming your way!  Anita ",

I had an allergic reaction to the Taxotere after 3 treatments so they switched me to Abraxane. I found the Abraxane to be a lot easier to handle than the Taxotere. No steroids, a lot less joint pain and fatigue. I got my treatments on Thursdays and usually would feel pretty fatigued starting Saturday night and all day Sunday. The rest of the week felt pretty good actually. I never even had to miss a day of work through the 8 rounds of treatment. It did take a while for my hair to fall out as well and I actually went ahead and shaved before it all came out as it was getting in my food. I actually shaved it in July and it started growing back in September. My head is now completely covered with hair and is about a 1/2 inch long, maybe a little longer in some places. Came back wavy too so that is a plus!! Another side effect I had from the Abraxane was what I call the chemo flush. My face and chest were always beat red the day after treatment but would go away my Saturday. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that after 3 rounds of treatment my PET came back NED! I wish you the best and know that you can beat this thing!!",
