So I thought what could I do to give her comfort at this very difficult time in her life, I thought of how children when small sometimes carried a blanket around with them for security and thought that this might be a good idea to make something like this for her. I then thought about the Cole's quilts project for SMA children where squares were stitched by people all over the world then sent off to be made into quilts for them.  I thought, \"What a good idea, maybe I could get stitchers together to stitch squares for people suffering or surviving this terrible disease!\"  I asked around for requests of people who were suffering or surviving the disease and within the first day had 2 requests. We asked for stitchers to stitch squares for the quilts and had a great response. Since January 08 we now have completed and delivered over 100 quilts, and best of all, this goes up every week. If you would like to visit the group's message board please feel free, you will also be able to see pictures of the quilts that have been made so far and pictures of the squares that will be used for the upcoming quilts. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/QuiltsforBreastCancer/ (Edited by Mods to remove member's personal email address.
