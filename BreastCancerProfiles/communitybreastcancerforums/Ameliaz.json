    "Content": "Ameliaz wrote: Hello everyone, one of the signs I ve noticed before diagnosis was my left breast very veiny. I told my surgeon about the veins the first time before diagnosis. Then I was diagnosed with ILC and had lumpectomy the first week of November. The veins are still there after surgery, every time I have an appointment I tell her, she says everything is ok and she doesnt even look at them. She focus only on what she saw in the MRI before surgery, and the pathology report after surgery and nothing else seems to be relevant. Anyone is familiar with this thing of veiny breast?
