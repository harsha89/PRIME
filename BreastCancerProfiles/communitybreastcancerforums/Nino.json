I am going to have dual mastectomy with reconstruction on Feb 24. A couple of things that I cannot decide on:  (i) if I should keep my areola or not (the nipple has to be removed in any case); and (ii) if I should do an expander versus an implant plus latissimus dorsi flap. Also, I will be done with my chemo on Feb 9th and my oncologist is inclined to put me on tamoxifen even though I am between 1and 5% EP positive, plus I am going to have my ovaries removed in Nov 2009. Any advice that any of you can provide on these subjects would be appreciated! Thanks, Nino",
