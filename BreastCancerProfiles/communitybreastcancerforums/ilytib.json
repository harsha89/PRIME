If I am posting on the wrong forum, please forgive, I apologize. Then perhaps someone could direct me where I should be? I need help, advice, information.... the whole caboodle! I am looking for information about re-routing the lymphatic fluids after mastectomy. My double mastectomy was in April 2014, with complete Axillary Lymphectomy on the left. I do not have lymphedema in my arm, I have a different issue, that I cannot find ANY information on. I have had ongoing seroma in my left chest wall, My lymphatic fluids are dumping into the chest cavity where my breast USED to be. It builds up and is quite painful. I have had to have it expelled at the doctor\u2019s office repeatedly. I went about two months without issues, but now it\u2019s started again. I\u2019ve had to be \u201cemptied\u201d twice already this week, and will have to go again on Monday, as I feel it filling up. They are finally sending me to a Lymphedema therapist next week. But from what I've read this technique is only effective 50% of the time. I cannot heal as long as the fluids continue to dump. There has to be some information somewhere out there. I am lost and confused and desperately seeking information. I have had no luck with web searches or talking at \u201cgroup\u201d. I am scared. I\u2019ve beat the cancer, I\u2019ve adjusted to the mastectomies, but I have to get back to living. I can\u2019t work until I do not have open wounds. The Doc has used a syringe a couple of times, but he has also had to make incisions, 6 times so far. Thank you in advance for your attention to this or any information you might be able to share. ilytib Log in to post a reply",

To answer some of the questions or statements: Yes I have constant compression, have had it since April.(And here I thought I'd not need a bra after all this!). They have mentioned the drainage tubes, but said it was a poor alternative, as it would not encourage my lymphatic system to re-route, which is their ultimate goal. The Doc has used a syringe to expel the fluid a few times, but the \"pocket\" as he calls it, is deep, so most times they have needed to cut in order to get all or as much of it as possible.  My chest is starting to look a  little like a tic-tac-toe board.  Forgive the humor if it offends you, its just my way of attempting to deal with all this. I want to find a way to help my own situation. I just have no idea what to do, to teach my own body to re-route this. I'm not opposed to standing on my head everyday if it would work! Thank you all again. I'm so grateful to have found this forum, I wish I had known about it when I found out about my cancer. Bless you all for your kindness. ilytib",
