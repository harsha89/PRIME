Here's some of my story:  I received a Birads of 5 and that has a 95% chance of being malignent. Thank the Good Lord the doctor didn't tell me my Birads # until After she said my tumor was benign. Because I would have been going nutts!- and it would have all been understandable but in the end, a lot of wasted energy. It's hard. You can't help but worry but try to focus on the now, things you can control, rather than things that are out of your hands at this point. You have seen the doctor in a timely manner, been a responsible young lady, now keep yourself busy with doing fun things that maybe you wouldn't even normally do- I ate a whole meal of pizza, rootbeer and m&m's and didn't allow myself a tinge of guilt and it felt great!!! When I focused too much on the \"what if\" I felt terrible, jittery and cranky!! I know it's hard I was scared too!! still kinda am of the surgery, but I've done what I can do, I'm not going to spoil the here & now, life's too short! I don't know if this helps but you are SO not alone. I did feel better after the ultrasound/ mammo eventhough it wasn't the best outcome, because I felt like I was Doing something. Best wishes to you, please chime in again if you need more support!! also there's Xanex and Benadryl to help sleep if you need it :) ",

Yes Leaf you are so right on! Saying the wrong thing does hurt. I have friends that had a child born with severe abnormalities. Hannah had a life expectancy of a few months, tops. She showed those docs by living to almost 4 years, and she was the apple of her parent's eye. However after she passed some people said things to the effect of, \"well at least that's over.\" Just what every grieving parent wants to hear. (Luckily the parents are both very grounded, intelligent people so there were no fist fights at the funeral.) But I thought, boy they just didn't get how awesome that precious little girl was!! And  what an absolutely horrid thing to say.  Yeah that may be part of why I don't want to tell people either, no matter the diagnosis. Of coarse I would tell my family, but I don't want to get get well cards either, I don't want to be talked about, I don't want to be stared at, and if I do decide to share it with someone I want to know that they won't be weird about it and I just can't predict that.I don't want people feeling sorry for me!! People do get better! But I also don't want the dismissive, \"oh I had that 10 years ago you'll be fine\" Don't tell me they weren't scared at the beginning too! Why do some people have to pretend they're so tough. As far as telling my boys, that was necessary because my older one had done a history of searches on the computer. He came up to me with a nervous look on his face and said, \"so do you have cancer?\" I hadn't even told him I had a mammogram yet. I was caught off guard and said, no I don't have cancer, but my husband felt they should know what's up so we had a little talk. I would tell the girls if they lived closer. I want to be able to just tell them hey, make sure you get checked because I have a lump and although it turned out benign, I am so glad I have the peace of mind now that I'm healthy. But how am I going to tell them if it's malignant? I mean what do people actually say? I don't want to cry and scare them but I don't want to be too casual... guess I will cross that bridge when and IF I come to it.  Julie I Love how the people at work support you! I know that isn't everyone's experience. I have only been at my new job for 5 months so I haven't really had a chance to develop solid relationships. Incredibly enough, I switched jobs because the school district I worked for didn't offer health insurance, and with the real estate market being so bad, my husband isn't able to pay for it out of pocket. (I think that was a very good move on my part! Phew!) I work with special needs adults which I totally love. I have wanted to go back to school for nursing for a long time but financially it's not happening. Anyway!- so should I expect the Radiologist to call me after the biopsy? Do they just give you a yes/no type thing or do they tell you the stages and all of that? I am sorry Carpediem that you don't feel you have close friends to share this with. I had a close friend that got a little too close to my husband (yes this has been One Heck of a year) so now I have friends that are good but I don't know, I think I keep people an arm's length away as they say. My husband and I are good btw, actually probably better than ever, after lots of work, and he has been very supportive through the whole little scare. I really hope this is benign. I could use a break!!! But then again I feel like I do have a break in life because I have this discussion board and you guys who read my stuff and give me advice and I do have huge faith in God and I know that I will get through the whole thing... listen to me, I get so dramatic! haha. I imagine I will feel pretty silly when I get the good news. But I know you guys won't laugh at me because you have been there. Thank you thank you thank you, Cybersisters!! Hugs back at you guys too!! :) ",

However the doctor went on to sound pretty much just as worried as ever, saying something about the reports not matching?- (I lost concentration after the word \"benign\"!) She talked about how I was a Birad 4 and that my tumor didn't look good, something about irregular shape, size, and growth rate- plus my age, I'm 45- that was fun-  then she called me right back and said Oh I meant to say you are a Birad 5. So I went around all happy until my mind started to ask, if it was that abnormal, are they sure it's benign? Why the hurry to scoop it out if it's benign-? I don't know much about BC, I think I know just enough as they say to get myself into trouble. Thank you again everyone for the concern, believe me all the good thoughts & vibes are totally returned!!! ",

Basically I found a lump, doc sent me for a Mammogram/ Ultrasound, the lump turned out to be a mass, 2 cm, (they didn't even have to tell me, I could tell it was a mass by the abrupt hault of conversation and the concentrated looks on their faces...you'd think they would have developed  pretty good poker faces by now, but no!) and now I go on Tuesday for a biopsy. Yes I am worried but I know the chances of this little guy being cancer are only about 20%.  I told my mom about the whole thing, wouldn't have ordinarily but I happened to be visiting her out of town for Mother's Day and that's the day I found it. My husband went with me to the appointments so he knows. My boys, 17 and 23, apparently could tell something was up so I told them the facts too. My girls however, who are 19 and 21, no longer live at home and I'm not sure I need to let them know anything. I will tell them Thursday if it's good news or bad, that's the day I should get my results. So anyway!- haha like I mentioned, I would like to know how other women told their families. I haven't actually been diagnosed with anything but a mass yet, and I don't want to worry people needlessly...would be nice to talk to my friends but I really do not want to tell them either. One of my daughters is out of the country for the next 4 months, don't want to tell her over skype or worse yet Facebook, (her cell doesn't work in England), but what are my choices? Aah! Advice please :) Thank you in advance!! And thank goodness for this web site, I wouldn't have a clue who to ask!! Wabi-sabi Log in to post a reply",
