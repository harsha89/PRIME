It has gradually gotten a little bigger over the last few weeks and I have had a few sharp shooting pains in the area. The area around my breast has also been aching a little. I feel like I am just being paranoid and don't want to go to the doctor as they will just think I'm being a hypochondriac. Plus I don't trust my doctor as I have recently been to her with persistent headaches and she immediately jumped to the conclusion that I thought I had a Brain tumour and just laughed at me. I in fact did not think this at all. So now I feel stupid asking about it. Also 2 of my friends, one 50 years old and one around my age, have been diagnosed with breast cancer after being repeatidly ignored for over a year and unfortunately one of them is now terminally ill. Can anyone advise me of whether they think it may be cancer. Thanks Laura Log in to post a reply",
