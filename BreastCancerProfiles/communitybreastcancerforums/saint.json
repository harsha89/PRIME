I never considered it cancer, but understood it MAY become a problem in the future. I think it became a lung met when the AI's I was initially treated with failed (about 3 years after mets dx) Previous to that my onc did not want to put me thru any bx for something that was not showing any growth---I agreed & still do--I think sometimes they don't want to stir anything up & just let sleeping dogs lie-ya know? The whole point of what we are doing is holding things at bay & trying to maintain QOL---lung mets tx is not necessary unless it is dx'd--and that's IMHO due to my personal experience!

What we face is continuance thru poison---what a choice!  I totally agree with LuAnn---you & your onc should be creative in adjusting you tx to minimize se's......no way to insure maximizing effect, right? I was very sick with se's last winter. I was spending most of my time in bed (between transfusions) & wondering to what end my \"stable\" status was a benefit. I realized my kids were accepting of my absence at their functions. They told me they KNEW where I was & wanted to be able to come lie in bed with me & talk or watch a movie. I told my onc I thought the tx would kill me b4 the cancer got a chance! One year ago, scheduling issues over Memorial Day would have made it impossible to get my transfusion, so it forced me to finally take a ONE WEEK break & everything changed. One week grew to summer-long! I could not have imagined regaining my life! I left my bed & thoughts of my demise. I had a slight progression & changed tx. It has been a wonderful year, but I now face another issue that could change tx & that makes me think I will NOT accept the garbage I lived last year. It CAN happen that things CAN improve ---if only for a short while. This last year has been worth so much! I accept the reality of this dx--it WILL get me! But as long as life is worth living I'll fight. Lying about wondering when/how it will end AIN'T worth it to me. Follow your gut----we are all different & what works for me may not be right for you---but for me, QOL will likely win out in the end from now on. Pookie--I prayed for those 5 years at dx & my oldest graduates HS in 2 weeks--I think I'll see it & up my ante to another 2 to see dd do the same---HUGS all---you inspire me with your honesty.

I think the trial part of your study is combining it with AI's alone--previously it has only been given in conjunction with certain chemos. I was given Avastin b4 it was approved OUTSIDE a study. My onc petitioned my ins co & explained why I was a good candidate for the combo we wanted to use & they agreed---as my dh says--there doesn't seem to be a drug police checking up on what they choose to give us! My onc seems inclined to listen to my desires & try things as long as they are not outside acceptable treatments currently being tried around the country. You may want to ask your onc about doing the same & then you don't have to make a choice, but get just what you want~~~~~~~ I also was told that each drug has an AVERAGE efficacy. The last time I checked they were saying that avastin averages 8 months---just a stat & they can change. I generally don't feel bound by them, but worth checking these things b4 you start! Obviously Bobbie's dh has gone way beyond that stat!! YEAH! I was on avastin for 10 months when I stopped it & I can still go back on it if/when I choose. Femara averages 18 months for mets stability, but I got 28---so there's stats for ya..... Keep in mind that if you choose to have surgery you have to stop the avastin for 21 days prior to & 21 days following sx (at least all this was true when I broke my leg last year--I had major sx & did NOT bleed out!

Only you can determine what is right for you, but you have to feel it is right & NOT waver once you choose. Contrary to most who already posted, I have chosen not to do the clinical trials offered to me as I want to exhaust the KNOWN tx's first. I am not comfortable not knowing IF I am getting the drugs--I want to continue to actively fight this beast.

I want to hear & share with honesty where mets can take us & how we deal.I have been fighting mets for over 4 1/2 years. When I spent most of last winter in bed & was getting transfusions every other week this question really stuck in my head. Janis addressed this beautifully as did everyone else! I believe that God is giving me ALL the lessons I need to progress to the next level. As yet, I have much to learn, but I feel my feet getting lighter & lighter as wisdom & knowledge take root. I am not ready-YET. I don't want to be ready yet!  I, too have kids that make me want to be here for them. They were 7 & 9 when I was first dx'd. THEY got me thru that. They are almost 16 & 18 now. When I was in bed most of last winter I told them: When I am gone it will be just like this has been. I won't be part of your everyday life, but I'll be close by: just a little farther away than upstairs. They answered by telling me: they want me here, even if I'm only upstairs they know I'm here & can still come up & lay with me & talk to me! So I keep fighting. I have been down, sick & discouarged, but got back up. I have been unable to walk, but walk now. I know I will be down again, but the pattern has been set--like a phoenix-I will get up again. That is the lesson that I must remind myself of when I'm kcocked down each time. I trust that God IS able (what beautiful words!) & He will make me able to face whatever I need to--whenever I need to. The good days are part of my lesson: to help me recognize how defeating the beast can be when he has me in his grip. HOPE is what keeps me believing in the next good day. I pray you will have more good days & soon. Do not be discouraged, for He will make YOU able & will give you courage. I accept the reality that at some point we don't get up again. When that happens we will know it is time. When it is we will recognize it. I don't think we will have to ask, we will inform others that it is so....... I keep a candle burning in my church 24/7 for all here--be well & stay strong. ",

So it is a very do-able combo! Happy for that gf that his mom is such a great help to her---prom is soooooo fun-but ours is in May!!! Homecoming will be in Oct----your part of the world must be reversed in the school year as well! Never thought about it b4 but it makes sense!! I want to see your pix! (my kids are 15 & 17 so we are in the thick of formal dances! I love it) Had scans today--results Mon so hoping oz & I get to post some happy news. Either way-we are not alone on this journey! Be well & stay strong! hugs,saint ",

I believe that the pain needs to be addressed & I don't mean with drugs, but with dx! I think you should send all tests/scans back for different docs to read & compare them. I have had odd results on scans & sent them back for clarification B4 I would agree to further dx procedures. Sometimes having someone else look at them makes a big difference. Don't forget that OTHER health problems can still befall us that are NOT bc related! I pray that is the explanation for this problem!!!!

There are LOTS of options for you, so choose what YOU feel is best & give it a try, Do not get discouraged, my onc always say, \"If one doesn't work, we'll just move to another!\" Tumor markers are not \"universal\", but a personal trend, so you have to watch them to know what they mean (if anything) for YOU. Some here know there is progression if their numbers go up 20 or LESS--others can go up by many 100's!!! Watch your own over a period of months/years & see if there is a trend. They are not considered trustworthy by many oncs, but some of us have found they work for us. Mine doesn't generally do them for bc, but does mine at my request. Your liver numbers can change, too. Our livers can regenerate-so keep that in mind! Keep walking the walk! We can do it & live WITH bc.There are lots here to attest to that! I started xeloda in Sept. I am on it every other week. So far it has been the easiest chemo I've done, tho I know that since it is cumulative I will have to wait to see what is going to happen with se's.

In recent months it has become clear to me that when we are together there is something different between us than what used to be there....that thing is un-nameable, but it is special & good. I can't know what the future holds for any of us. But I DO feel where my journey has intersected theirs, something very blessed has happened. I don't know if this makes any sense to you, but when my dh said, \"this IS what I signed on for......and everything else when I took those vows!\" it changed my point of view. Maybe my kids are such wonderful teenagers because of my cancer....maybe one of them won't discover a cure.....but just be a better person for it!  So it is possible to see this journey as horrid, but littered with gifts--or am I too much of a Pollyanna?

I figure that doing it that way increased my se's & if BOTH were working I may have wasted 14 months efficacy of one of them! I am having GREAT luck on xeloda (a 6mm lesion shrunk to 4 since I started it in Sept)  Don't loose heart---we are out here & we're all kicking & b*tchin! PM me anytime---be well & stay strong ",

I am er/pr+ & her2-  My onc's first tx was AI (femara worked best for me--over 28 months) with zometa--that worked for about 3 years b4 I had a progression to my lung at which time he stopped the Ai's & added chemo. It is my understanding that they \"save the big guns for later\" especially with bone mets only, but will add chemo once soft tissue organs are involved. I have had few side effects with AI's or zometa. You DO need to take care with dental procedures on zometa (as well as with avastin) I made sure my dentist read the materials my onc gave me...... The chemo combo (I chose) was gemzar (2 weeks on 1 off) & abraxane (1 week on 2 off). I was on this combo for over 6 months b4 adding avastin. My dh believes avastin is a miracle drug as I had my first real shrinkage on it. I opted to discontinue that combo after about 30 tx's due to severe problems with tanking counts & transfusions every other week. The avastin did give me a number of se's, but I tend to get all se's & my body even makes up some of it's own! I had high blood pressure (NEVER a problem b4) that required a high dose of enalaprill. I had nose bleeds & had my nose cauterized, but they continued. It was an inconvenience, buit in light of how well it seemed to work I just bent to the task & figured out HOW to get around it. They were somewhat severe in the winter & I found the steam from sitting in a hot tub gave me relief, but it was a problem for me...... I strongly suggest waiting to see scans 3 months after starting any new tx B4 you add another-unless you have symptoms. The idea here is to extend possible tx & not use it all up at once cuz it WILL be needed later. I wanted to go big when I chose my tx, but I now understand the wisdom in trying one at a time. The beauty of it (for me) is that the chemos & avastin did not \"fail me.\"  Necause I stopped them due to se's I CAN go back on them in the future (& I will likely do them one at a time.) Right now I am on xeloda every other week (newer protocol) & enjoying the feeling of being well again. I will be happy to share any of my personal experiences with anyone--just ask! I keep a candle burning in my church 24/7 for everyone here & I will keep you in my prayers. Be well & stay strong ",

I was so sad to know that just downstairs; outside life was going on without me. After a while that didn't even matter anymore & I just hoped it would all end soon! I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN!   BUT.........do you know what \"they\" mean?? My kids & I talked during those months. At one point I told them that when I was \"gone\" it would be just like it had been all winter: I wouldn't be making dinner or joining them at the table; not at their functions or giving them parties or or or.....but I'd still be \"with\" them like I was all winter only I'd be a little further away. I just wouldn't be upstairs! They made sure I understood that they didn't care WHAT I attended or WHAT I did as long as they could know at the end of the day they could come into my room & lay in bed with me & talk with me!!!  Honey, you are NOT a lousy mom! You love them & they love you & the bottom line is---that is the most important thing!! I understand that you are such a wonderful mom you feel lousy for all the things you are USED to doing for them, but can't now. So...you are no longer wonder-mom---just a loving & much loved mom! Your friends & family love you & it hurts to see you hurting! Speeding up your demise is not going to make it any less painful for them or you; probably the opposite! I think you already know this in your core..... Despite what your onc said--you CAN take a break. As you have already figured out--you can quit if you want to!!  It is YOUR life & your choices! Many will tell you how you just can't give up......but you are the only one who knows if is IS giving up or accepting a different route that gives you more control & makes more sense to you! I have a chat friend who quit chemo for the reasons you & I have experienced. She did it with the specific intent of having BETTER quality time with her family (knowing full well that it would be shorter)....months later she is doing very well off chemo & her onc is baffled!!!!!!!! We never know what will happen...or as they say in Benjamen Buttons. \"You never know what's comin for ya!\" I respect your decisoin to quit, delay or change tx. I know you love your kids enough to do what you feel is best for all of you!! Let me just give you this little encouragement: after weeks of transfusions & feeling at the bottom of my life I changed to xeloda a few months ago---I have hair & have lost some steroid weight. I've had minimal/manageable se's & my scans were better than hoped for! I feel & look like me again ---  it COULD happen for you too! ...like the phoenix, we rise again from the ashes....

I agree--no one should think that se's are an indication of how well a drug is or isn't working! That's hoo-ha! Greta- I agree with jerseymaria-when I am THAT cold I usually have a fever.

We talked today about options--not really any for him to offer (like doing steroids for a while since they are \"working\" or doing fewer rads & \"banking\" some for future)...so rads start on Thurs & I feel pretty good about all this. I have made it over 5 years since I was first dx'd with bone mets B4 I had to undergo more intense tx. I count that a lucky thing--if you saw my scans you would, too! EXTENSIVE sites & never any symptoms or pains b4 now! BTW-the area marked for rads is NOT in the same place as my old injury tho I suspect there may be some correlation....will have to ask him about that when I see him again (they think of me as the \"arguer!\" LOL) I have some reservations about how much trust I would put in bone scans from here out. After having them every 3 months for 5 years they never gave us an inkling that anything was afoot. The scan is just too gross in detail to measure such things so I think we will choose a specific bone lesion site to use as a kind of sentinel & just do bone scans once or twice a year.

I was on a combo with gemzar & zometa for about 16 months (for the last few months we threw in avastin) In spite of the number of drugs I was getting I did remarkably well for over 20 tx's. Then my WBC tanked for months & I had to have transfusions every other week so I took a chemo break & have now changed to Xeloda. It would not be inappropriate for you/her to ask her onc about other chemo options. At this point we deserve Quality of life & the less se's we have the better! My onc tries to find drugs that give me less se's & that is what it is all about in My book! I do NOT want to \"take to my bed\" but LIVE life while fighting the beast! If she does take this drug you may want to ask onc to prescribe some drugs prophylactically. For example-acyclovere can ward off mouth sores. If she was prone to them in the past then they are more likely to be an se now. She is lucky to have such a great daughter--keep us posted. Be well & stay strong! ",

I can honestly say that the only mistake she made posting here was over-simplifying her explanation of laughter therapy-----YOU DO NOT GET HER CONCEPT!!!  She NEVER claimed it would cure anything!! SWe are all drawn to ppl on this board who are perfect examples of what laughter therapy CAN doThey are upbeat in the face of all ills, an example & inspiration to all of us. Laughter therapy is a vehicle to reach that level, to gain some of that magic they seem to embody.It will unlikely change my dx--but laughter DOES help me deal with it day-to-day!  I will not try to explain it further. I will simply say that this board has offered support & love in keeping vigil for dying sisters. The ppl here pulled together financially with love to get a scooter for another sister-----it is unbecoming to US to attack a \"fellow-sister\" who only wanted to offer another therapy that MIGHT help someone!!!  Linda--you do good work---laugh off those who were unkind-they don't understand!

I can understand that the chat with the new widower was dicey, yet if you go to a bc chat room you probably expect that it isn't going to be a bed of roses!

The great thing is that I still have $1000's worth of stuff & my college & teen age \"friends\" love to come & make things that I can talk them thru! I LOVE that......I like your sewing projects too. I used to make Daisy Kingdom outfits for my dd at Christmas & Easter every year. They were SO cute, but what she loved was the matching doll dresses!!! I can tell you that a doll dress can take longer than a child's dress.......the things we do for our kids! LOL I have kept ALL those clothes (including the matching ties & vests I made for her brother) so one day their kids may get to wear them........ Sharon-don't sell yourself short! EVERYONE has talents-I already know you are a good friend & great conversationalist! I think you told me you like to cook too! THAT is my current passion! I consider a great meal TRUE art.......and animal management is also an ART of the highest degree. Hugs all-be well & stawy strong! ",

I eat at least one banana a day & other \"hardeners\" like potatoes or rice in hopes of avoiding stool issues. I had slight feelings of indigestion the first week, but otherwise I am doing well so far. My hair is growing & I feel pretty damned good! My onc nurse says that xeloda is NOT one of the drugs that requires urea in the lotion you use, but she gave me a sample & it is working well. It is called Dermal Therapy & is 25% urea---so who knows, but its working for me----you can check it out at dermaltherapy.com (I ordered some last weekend, but still have not received it---it is made in Canada so maybe it will take a bit longer to arrive)  As with any chemo--drink & pee, drink & pee......good for your system anyway! Good luck--be well & stay strong!!",
