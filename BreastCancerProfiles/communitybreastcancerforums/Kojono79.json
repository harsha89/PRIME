I do have couple of questions though.. Is a lumpectomy typical if no cancer is present? Or do you think my surgeon thinks this may be the case and just didn't want to say anything during my exam yesterday to cause any more stress? He said he would tell me day of surgery whether or not it was cancerous.. Just a little concerned about this. Thank you again! ‚ù§Ô∏è",

Went to my OB on Friday, and the lumps are so big, she felt them immediately and said they were about 5mm...and wrote up referrals for Mammo, and U.S. For Monday and a referral to breast surgeon. Woke up this morning to a blood stained shirt. So very concerned at this point, and squeezed nipple to see if more came out.. Still very painful. More did come out, but only from one particular spot in nipple... Need opinions!! Had stereotactic biopsy in February/BIRADS 4; benign. Log in to post a reply",

Went on Monday for Mammo and U.S. Later that evening, breast surgeon's office called, and wanted to see me yesterday..(6/23) Oh the nerves.. Spoke with surgeon, and have a 12mmx9mmx13mm mass at 12 o'clock behind nipple. Scheduled for ductogram?, lumpectomy, and removal of one of the milk ducts on July 6th. Said it doesn't present itself as cancer, but needs to come out because his concerns of how fast and pretty size able this has grown in 4 months since my mammogram, U.S. and biopsy in February, and the discharge are concerning. Says he won't really know for sure until he gets in there. Any thoughts or opinions? Thank you all for advice, and just kind words of encouragement. ‚ù§Ô∏è",

He removed the \"bad\" duct, the mass, and some surrounding tissue. Still have to wait until the 21st for post op visit, and will have to see what the surgeon says about what will be the next course of action. I'm assuming just regular check ups as it seems to be just a completely benign issue. But still very anxious of what he has to say. Mild bruising, and pain first two days, but just a little more of discomfort now. Id like to thank all of you for your interest, input, advice, and most of all your support. This has all just been a whirlwind, but very elated with the results.. I'll keep you posted after post op visit. üòä‚ù§Ô∏è",
