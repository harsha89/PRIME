I have just recently started having an irregular heart beat. When I went to the doctor they called them PVCs and said they were not life threatening but can be uncomfortable. They make me feel as though I can't quite catch my breath and tire me out. Has anyone else had these symptoms after Adriamycin and Cytoxin treatments? Log in to post a reply",
