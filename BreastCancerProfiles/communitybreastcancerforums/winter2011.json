Thank you to everyone for your help. It is so nice for all of you to take the time to help me understand everything and to realize that others are going through the same thoughts and processes as I am. Holly",

I just had an excisional biopsy and everything in this duct has been removed. My mother was diagnosed with Breast Cancer at 27 and passed away at 28...both of these factors making my risk of breast cancer higher. I am now trying to decide which prevention strategy I should go with....Tamoxifen or Mastectomy. Are there any individuals on this site that have been on Tamoxifen or had a mastectomy and can tell me how they felt/feel, please. I just need to gather some more information before I decide. Thank you. Log in to post a reply",

I am just confused as I am not sure what path I should take. I have time to decide because I just had my excisional biopsy...but I am just at a loss...I really want to do everything in my power to prevent anything further from happening. Can you give me any insight???  Holly :) ",
