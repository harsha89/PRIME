The ultrasound tech. said my lump and i quote \"doesn't look suspicious.\" but did confirm that they are not cysts. because that is real reassuring; but she did say if we are truly concerned with it to pursue it. But that was enough for my mother to use as an excuse not to let me do what I feel is needed...despite the fact that my gyno was very concerned and with the first lump by breast specialist said it needed to come out. I am truly worried about this right now especially because I am experiencing strange chest pains. My mother thinks I am a hypochondriac anyway so I am very hesitant to bring up any ailments around her =/ It's a sticky situation. I feel powerless. I'm glad for you, LoveWell, that youre family it taking care of you. No offense Kathy, but I cannot for a second believe in any biopsy at being 'fruitless..' Biopsies save lives. And to tell you all the truth I'd rather just have a mastecomy rather than a lumpectomy if I am able to get the biopsy I want. Yes i'm young and blah blah blah I can never get my body back but I don't care. I rather not live with fear and concern because lumps keep sprouting in my boobs...",

My mother will not allow me to have the surgery to biospy these. It very possible to have on good one and one bad one, is it not? My mother's sister died of breast cancer..So why are you we not checking this out when if one or both of those lumps are cancerous, my cancer is just advancing? How can I afford to go ahead with the surgery myself when I am 18 and in charge of my own health decisions? Any advice at all? Log in to post a reply",

Anyone who was ever been a teenager should know thats one way sure fire way to bring anger out of one. I seems a few women are a bit jaded by having had cancer and think they know it all. But for thos of you who have posted positively and informatively, I thank you. I apologized if I offended anyone beside the person my post was intended for. \"Language\" is just words. Some think more of them than others. all they do is add emphasis and feeling if you ask me.  to answer some of the questions.. - i didn't plan or reconstruction. don't want it. i also dont care about pain and what not. my goal would be no lumps=no worry. no i dont know what it is going to be like but who does? i dont live my life in fear. thats not living at all -  since i have new lumps in my neck, i asked my mother for a dr's appt. so im seeing my pediatrician for a phsycial, she says and i quote \"there is no rush.\" so i wont be able to share how that goes for a bit. - i recently dug for the ultrasound papers myself. they basically say 'no findings'? -  the dr just said we could pursue it if we felt strongly -  sorry to disagree but i dont think oh we have so much time. Time for what? to let cancer spread and advance? thatsss silly.",
