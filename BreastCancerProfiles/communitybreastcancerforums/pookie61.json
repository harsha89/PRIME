Marybe, thanks for sharing your story.  I found it to be full of hope.  I am hopeful, but for me it has to be a realistic kind of hope.  Now I wish for five more years to see my daughter graduate high school.  When I was first diagnosed I never dreamed this goal would be so hard to achieve.

Several things come to find.  First, it could be that your mother is feeling depressed and overwhelmed.  The depression could be making her pain worse.  She should not be resigned to a poor quality of life.  I know you say she won't join a support group or post here, but maybe if you print out the responses to your post and get her to read them she will feel differently.  If you feel as though her current oncologist is not being responsive to her quality of life issues, it might be time to find someone else.  My oncologist is very concerned with my qol and refuses to allow me to live in pain.  She knows about the reality of this disease and will do anything to ensure my life is as good as possible.  Your mother deserves the same Take care and let us know how she is doing.  I hope you and your mom have a wonderful holiday season.",

There are other chemo options for you to try.  Maybe you and your husband are at a place where either you or both of you need someone else you can really talk to.  It could be anyone who helps you-friends, family, professional, or religous.   For me it really needs to be someone who can both listen to me and help guide me, but not make decisions for me.  Luckily for me my husband's aunt works in a hospice as an aide, and she is so supportive.  She does not try to tell me eveything is going to be all right.  She mainly listens, but occasionally will make a supportive suggestion.

I am surprised you take Tylenol for pain, but I don't know if you are on chemo right now.  I am on Taxol and Avastin, and am not allowed to take any pain relievers that mask a fever.  You need more effective pain relief asap.  The problem with the pain is that not only does it affect our physical well being, it takes a huge toll on our emotional well being.  When we are in pain our minds tend to assume the worst, whether true or not.  Since what you are taking is not working, you need something better.  I take dilalid (sp?) which works well for me.  I take a small dose, and it works great.  No side effects except a small amt. of constipation.  When my liver pain starts to kick in, I take one.  Not only does the physical pain go away, but I stop worrying about the cancer.  This is very helpful to me. If you have something stronger in the house, take it.  Don't waste time being in pain!  If you don't, it is time to call the on call onc and maybe get something stronger.  Maybe they can get in touch with you onc who can call something in.  Otherwise you might have to get through the weekend or go to the ER for better pain relief. But I would get some better pain relief soon.  Take care and let us know how you feel.",

Take care. ",
