High school football players and cheer leaders wearing pink does nothing to help the cause. All it did is made money for the people making those pink things.  Everyone knows that breast cancer is there and everyone knows that mammograms can screen for them.  How about having pamphlets in doctors offices that tell about other signs (example retracted nipples, discharge from nipples, puckered skin) that people may not be aware could be signs of cancer. How about not reminding chemo patients with no hair by waving pink curling irons and blow dryers in front of them. How about not having giant pink bras to remind women that they have no breasts? Insensitive!",

It is a hassle getting in and out of the city, but I think I want surgeons that only do breasts as opposed to ones that do hemorroids (sp?), hernias, and gall bladders. Do you think stick with local surgeon for biopsy and if it is cancer, then switch?  This is so stressful! Log in to post a reply",

I had the mammogram and they called me to come in for further magnified views and ultrasound. I scheduled that for 2 weeks later. When I went to my doctor's office, she looked at the initial mammogram report (from the first one) and said that I had calcifications.  She told me to move up the followup views and that she would have her office do that for me. She also had me booked with a surgeon.  My followup views are 2 days from now and the surgeon visit 6 days after that.  I have myself convinced that it must be cancer due to the outward signs and the fact that she booked me with a surgeon even before the followup views were done and that she though an extra week or so was a problem.

The radiologist said I definitely still need the biopsy, but she said I should have an MRI first because the biopsy changes how things appear on the MRI. She said that the breast surgeon had to order the MRI. I spent almost 2 days trying to talk to people in the BS office to get the MrI sceduled and they said to wait until my appt which was scheduled for Oct 6.  When I mentioned the difficulty I was having trying to reach anyone n that office, the nurse laughed. Yes laughed. I went there today and what a waste of waiting a week. He said I needed the MRI (no kidding) and that he wouldn't even know what method of biopsy until the results of the MRI.  Then about 5 days to get results of the MRI. (HUH?) Then he said he probably wouldn't even be the one to do the biopsy, the radiologist would.  Well, why did I even need to go to him, then? Why couldn't my primary just order the MRI and the biopsy?  Anyhow now another week to wait for the MRI. I am so annoyed. I am calling a Boston hospital and hopefully get more efficient treatment. On top of being so very worried, I shouldn't have to deal with this aggravation. Sorry, just needed to vent! PS on ultrasound report it said they also noticed debris under the nipple, but said no evidence of solid and also said no evidence of liquid. How can that be? Are there not only 3 states of matter? Certainly, it is not a gas!",
