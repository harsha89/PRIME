The cancer has not spread outside of the duct or other tissues.  I had an MRI October 5th to see if it has spread elsewhere, since I would like to save the lymph nodes on my left. For the right side I'm having the sentinel lymph nodes removed.  I meet with my BS on the 22nd to go over everything for the surgery.  I would have liked to meet with her sooner rather than 3 days before. I feel like I need more time than 3 days to prepare! As for coping, I had my mammo/ultrasound on October 18th, was told to return on the 21st for biopsies, one of them being my lymph node.  On the 26th I got the call that it was cancer. For about 5 days I spent my nights in my room upset, wondering how many more times will I hug my kids, scold them for bad grades, ask them to clean their rooms, tell them I love them etc...I kept telling myself to stop thinking that way.  I got up to grab a tissue and looked at myself, more specifically my boob and just got angry and started yelling at it. Well, it was more of a whispering yell with my teeth clenched so my kids wouldn't hear me. It went a little like this (pardon my sailor mouth) F-YOU CANCER, F-YOU. I HAVE A LIFE TO LIVE AND YOU'RE NOT A PART OF IT. I HAVE KIDS TO RAISE AND A LIFE TO LIVE. I'M GONNA KICK YOUR ASS!   I've done that a few times and it feels pretty damn good.  However today was a crappy day, just felt so darn emotional. Tomorrow will be a great day! Well, it better be or I'm gonna have to grit my teeth and yell at that cancer again!... Ladies, thank you so much for being here! Hugs & Kisses",

I wasn't prepared when my BS gave me the results and saying that I will have to do chemo. Now just waiting on the HER2 results to see if I'm doing 4 or 6 rounds of chemo. As for healing... With soap dispensers, I just put it closer on the counter instead of reaching and using both hands to pump helps a ton.. Before I left the hospital, there are a group of survivors who put together gift bags which included a hand made drain holder with 2 pockets and ties around the waist like a little apron (very cute) they also make heart shaped pillows which I've kept with me at all times. They are perfect for the seatbelt, fit right under your arms etc... I have to say they are the best gifts I've ever received (aside from stuff my kids made!) Absolute life savers and so comforting.  I've been working on my \"wall crawls\" to stretch my arms but every morning is like groundhog day.. It's the worst part of the day, wake up sore and stiff. But once I'm up and move around it's not too bad.  Going in for my first fill next Tuesday... First drain was out on the 1st and the other drain came out on the 6th (thank God I only had 2) I'm about to make a quick drive to the school for the first time.  I've been lucky enough to stay at my Dads for the past couple of weeks.  I gotta say he and my kids have been AWESOME!..

It's taken me a couple of nights to get through the posts since I didn't have the energy to pop on in a week.  I would read a couple of pages then doze off, so I'm finally caught up.. Most of you sound like you've done ok with pain and such. Where to begin.. Started chemo on the 27th, had 2 \"good days\" until it hit me. I was down, worse than a man complaining about having the flu.On day 3 my joints were in such pain. I tried a claritin but that did absolutely nothing. The pain lasted for 4 days, hardly slept then on day 5 the only way for me to describe it is.. It felt like all of my organs were throbbing. I almost went to the ER, it scared me so bad. I tried calling the MO but the nurse didn't return the call. Went in this past Tuesday for blood work (finally feeling better) everything came back normal, thank God!... Had anyone else experienced the throbbing sensations?.. Still haven't noticed any additional hairloss yet. If anything it seems like the last 2 washes that less hair has come out than normal.  I feel a little sensitivitybut that's about it. As I type this I can feel myself about to nod off again.. Going to try and finish this before I do though.. Another quick vent... Mom took me to my appointment and on the way home she says.. \"See, so now you know how I feel after having my radiation for my thyroid.\" (1 round of radiation last year) She continues to tell me that no one came to visit her (mind you, she told us she had to be confined for 3 days) and at no point did I say anything about people visiting me... I didn't want anyone around feeling the way I was.  Why she keeps trying to compare and \"know\" what I'm going thru just trips me out. I'm sorry if that didn't make much sense, I keep nodding off.. I'm so thankful for you ladies. I really wish we had some sort of video chat for all of us to chat on...  Mama LuvBugs, a big hug would be awesome.

Right after posting (day 12) suddenly it was coming out by the handfuls. I just kept finger combing my hair and lost about half of it that day. By that night I put it into a pony tail and had my daughter cut it off.  Next day, I lost a ton more.  Today, I've only got about 25% of it left, if that.  To compensate for the hair loss, I've gone heavier on the eye makeup and dolling myself up that way instead.  If there is such thing as a \"good\" side effect from chemo, I'd say it has to be this Brazillian I've got going on downstairs!

Wendy- I'm \"happy\" to see you here Thankful- Give your daughter a fist bump for me, she sounds like an awesome young lady! I feel the same as you. The BMX was \"nothing\" compared to what's about to happen with my hair. I have always been a hair twirler, my friends even joke about it! In regards to hair loss, I've always lost \"gobs\" of hair on a regular basis.  Even when my aunt helped wash my hair after the BMX she was shocked at the amount of hair I lose daily.. Now it's time to vent... My mom has been gone for a 3 month \"vacation\" in Japan visiting friends and family. Just after she left is when I went for the mammo/ultrasounds, biopsies, diagnosis and then bmx... Everyone but me seemed to be pissed that she didn't cut her trip short to be with daughter.. Her only contact with me was an occasional email which were very short.  So finally we are at the airport to pick her up and as she walked up I broke down and started to cry (overwhelmed with everything) All she said was, you'll be fine, don't worry.. then as we walked towards the escalator she says to me.. \"Well I've always been an A cup until I gained all of this weight, so I know what that's like.\" (she's been like a C/D cup for the last 15 years)... I just ignored her.  I think I was hoping that she would come back a \"changed\" person but that didn't happen... In my last email, I asked if we could have a quiet Thanksgiving since she always invites her friends over... Her response in that email was.. Well I invited them several months ago, I'm not going to just cancel on them. (I'm sure they would have understood considering the circumstances) So here I am on the couch all snotty nosed and teary eyed since I wasn't up for being around a bunch of people who would be asking questions and how am I's and so on.. Plus all of the bandages would have just added to the effect.  Then to top it off, I've got my sliding glass door open since it's beautiful out. Meanwhile, my neighbors have family over and one of them is on the phone out back and begins to talk smack about my lanai which is very bare and a little dirty (the potted plumeria tree had fallen over and spilled mulch so I put the pot upright but I haven't been up to sweeping the mulch up yet) ... You gotta be effin kidding me?! I wanted to go out there and tell her off. Ok, it's off my chest. Thank you for letting me vent (sigh) I feel a little better, now only if a good ice cream joint were open! Hugs everyone, Happy Thanksgiving.  We are on the right side of the grass and that's what matters!",

It was my EMLA cream and Zofran.  If you put the EMLA cream on, apply it thicker. Like icing a cake just not as thick and cover with saran wrap. As for the port placement, I was awake just under a light anesthesia, I was even talking and joking around but I do that all the time. The pressure from the bandages were very uncomfortable especially when I would laugh, sneeze or cough but I took them off today and it feels better.  Although I don't know what this \"dried glue\" type of stuff is and I'm afraid to peel it off.  So I'll just leave it for now.  I go in for port education on Monday.  Was supposed to have a pet scan the other day but insurance won't cover it. Then was told I would be doing a ct scan but never heard back from the office so I suppose I'll find out on Monday. I did pick up an inexpensive ($32) wig today (on a whim) It's not as bad as I thought it would be... Ladies, we can become every fantasy! Blonde, Brunette, Red, Pink, Purple!

I had two but many of the women I've read about have 3 and 4... The drains don't hurt, they are annoying more than anything.  If you look under Surgeries before during and after, there are lots of helpful tips... For the shower you can use a lanyard to clip the drains (that's what I did) it makes it easier.  The first week I did get help from family. An electric toothbrush is a good idea.  Keeping the soap dispenser closer to you rather than reaching for it is good. I've also been doing \"wall crawls\" walking my hand up the wall to maintain range of motion.. If you have any other questions, ask away.  I've been reading the October Surgeries section since that's when I had mine.  Everyone has been very helpful on this site.  I don't know what I'd do with out everyone here!!

I've also been told that I won't be able to use the bathroom w/o someone else having to wipe me.  Is this correct? (sorry for being so blunt) Picked up a pair of \"silky\" p.j. pants.

Around everyone, I act like it's no big deal and that I'll just throw on a ball cap.  But inside I'm terrified.  And being here in FL, I'm thinking it's way too warm to think of a wig.. I also wonder, do I just keep it long until I notice the change then get rid of it or do I cut it shorter.. All I can do is toss it into a bun on top of my head since I don't have full range with my arms. Thank you guys for the welcome and thank you for the link to the abreviations!
