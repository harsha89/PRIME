I had 2 surgeon consults, first the breast surgeon and then the plastic surgeon. After those they coordinated their schedules and chose a date, I think it was about 3 weeks later. I am 10 days post surgery and I won't lie, it's not an easy recovery. My best advice is to allow others to wait on you. Even reaching for something is painful for the first few days. The drains are a pain, but necessary, and once those came out I felt a whole lot better. you will have good and bad days, and allow yourself to have both. I am 36 and usually very active. I'm tired of sitting on my butt, but I realize my body needs to heal. If you have kids, utilize them in your recovery too. My kids feel so much better about things when I allow them to help. It makes them feel good. I wish you the best with your consults and getting surgery scheduled. Let us know when you find out! Rita",

I was doing great and because I have implants (less invasive then either flap procedures) she discharged me home. I followed up with her on the 23rd (6 days after surgery). She removed my drains that day. I was having around 10cc of fluid per day at that point. I hear it's not typical for them to be removed that soon though. Even my nurses at the hospital were saying the day after surgery that I wouldn't have them for long, I was having less then 30cc per day per side the day I came home. Everyone's experience is different though. I suggest you take it all into consideration and expect the worst but hope for the best. I was pleasantly surprised when I was able to have them removed so soon! I don't have as much experience as some on here but I'm happy to answer any questions that I can help with. After you see your surgeon and have a plan you will feel much better. I hated the unknown.",

My first thought was \"how is this going to affect my kids?\" I wasn't worried about myself, I was worried about them. Although I haven't been on this journey for long I can say that kids are very resilliant. They understand and process more then we think they do. We were upfront and honest with both of our girls (ages 7 and 10) and let them ask all the questions they wanted. I had surgery on October 17 and they have been a huge help. I found they do better when allowed to help. It makes them feel good. It is a hard road, but in my opinion if you are honest with your kids (depending on ages) it helps them get trough. My mom bought my girls a book called Butterfly Kisses, that explains from a child's point of view what is happening as His mother goes through cancer treatment. It's a great book! Well wishes to you! I had a friend tell me that a scar is a reminder of a battle you WON and that has helped me get through some of my roughest days.",
