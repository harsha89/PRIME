Thanks.  Log in to post a reply",

I just thought I'd update.  I went for genetic counselling and I do not qualify for testing.  My paternal grandmother does, and my mother would have but she passed away in December.  If someone on my mother's side develops breast cancer in the future, he/she will qualify. ",

I saw my doc today and she said I would receive a questionaire from a hospital which will decide whether I need genetic testing.  Given that I have a history on my father's side as well, I would be tested instead of my mother getting tested first. I just need to ask though.  Given my age, are there any benefits to knowing right now?   What could I do about it now anyway?",
