Hope you don't mind that I am posting here.  I'm not exactly a Tennessean---but I'm mighty close!  I live in Bristol, VA.  We are a twin city in both VA & TN.  Lived here all my life.  I too am a triple negative girl.  I have finished with tx, but still have to finish up reconstruction, scheduled 9/24 in Johnson City, TN area. Of course still doing follow up care with Onc.  Like many others, I do lots of praying the closer it gets to my follow up visits.  I just pray that all will be well this time.    Bonny, you are right, we do need to stick together and there are some great women on this board.  Even though many of us have a great support group with our families, it's not quite the same as talking to someone who is going through it or has been through it.  Hope everyone has a good week and great weekend!  May God Bless You!  Karen",
