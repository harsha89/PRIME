Focally associated with calcification.  Flat epithelial atypia.  Please refer to comment. COMMENT:  One of the ducts is seen at the edge of the core, is partially filled with atypical cells with visible nucleoli and no definite necrosis. One atypical mitosis is seen.  The histopathological features are worrisome for ductal carcinoma in situ, however spindle cells are identified admixed with atypical cells and the focus is very small measuring 0.24mm all precluding a diagnosis of carcinoma.  Recommend appropriate follow up and complete removal of the lesion if clinically warranted. Does this rule out DCIS? Joan Dx 3/18/2011, IDC, <1cm, Stage IB, Grade 3, 0/2 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Finally went to my primary doc.  Ordered MRI of brain (looks great-no evidence of stroke etc).  Saw cardiologist.  Had echo, thalium stress, ekg showed pvc.  Stress showed polymorphic pvc's increasing on exertion. Had a heart cath.  Negative for blockage (thank goodness!!).  Started me on Atenolol for the pvc's.  The blurry spot that comes and goes is an optical aura (some have them without migraine, many with).  I do not have headaches so I just have the aura.  No one knows what triggered this stuff.  My cardiologist did say my pvc's were not caused by stress.  My opthalmologist says sometimes the body shows us stuff before something develops.  Well, all this, I know, is trivial from what many of you are going through.  I am sincerely thankful I have come through so well.  I just wonder if anyone else has any of these things happen post chemo.  Thanks in advance.  Joan Dx 3/18/2011, IDC, <1cm, Stage IB, Grade 3, 0/2 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
