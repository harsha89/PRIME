But after my right side mastectomy Jan 16th, my left breast started discharging a clear fluid---only a drop every few days, but i thought it was normal because my drain was still in and figured my chest was full of fluid.  Not so.  Surgeon scheduled an MRI last Monday, the result of which I had to get ASAP because my port was to be surgically placed on Weds (yesterday).  After waiting on pins and needles all day Tues (another Xanex day), the results finally came in and the dr  called after 6pm.  And it was clear!  That means I have one GOOD boob! For the last week I didn't know whether I'd be going in for another mastectomy or a port placement.  Thank goodness it was the latter.  It went great and I don't remember a thing! Today I'm feeling no pain and going to a Sewing/Quilting Festival this afternoon.  MUGA test is Tues of next wk and if I pass that, chemo will begin Thurs.  So having my fun until then!

A couple female relatives and I went to the wig store and had a ball picking out wigs and hair colors!  I ordered one and it'll be here in plenty of time before my hair falls out!  Also I want to order some hats and scarves from:   www.tlcdirect.org  While at the store an older woman came in alone.  Come to find out she'd had BC 5 yrs ago and her hair has never been the same so her husband and she had planned to pick out a wig for her.  But he died suddenly in December.  Poor thing started tearing up so we all gave her huigs and I invited her to join me and my Red Hatters who meet for Happy Hour (dinner) every Tuesday.  We helped her pick out a wig and she left with a huge smile on her face.  I'll call her tomorrow.",

Herceptin seems to affect your nails a lot, so they advised me to get Sally Hansens Hard As Nails clear polish for them.  I'll be giving myself a manicure while watching TV tonight!

Questions:  How long do you drain after surgery?  Dr office says not to make a post-op appt until my drainage is 25ml or less per day.  I just took the dressing off and it looks awful, of course.  Looks like blood settled in area below the incision.  Is that normal?  Parts look yellowish too, but I suppose that's the iodine stuff they use during surgery?

The pain isn't half as bad as I'd thought it would be.  Glad to hear you have help with your little ones.  I couldn't imagine.....I feel so lucky I'm retired and my kids are grown--I'm 60. Feeling depressed with the new info, chemo will definitely be in my future.   ",

Love it that I don't have to wear pockets to hold the 'grenade' anymore. ",

Take the valium!  I can't emphasize that enough!  My Xanex has been my best friend.  I don't use it all the time (except when I was at your stage of the journey--after diagnosis), but on my 'low' days I know it's there for me and it really helps.  Goodness, don't think of it as aiding cancer, STRESS aids cancer.  I promise once you're done with surgery and on a treatment plan your nerves will calm down.  You're at the most stressful time so take care of yourself and use the meds when you need them.  Also, keep visiting the boards.  We know what you're going through. Stay strong!  You can do this!",

Did you have surgery already?  Will you have a port surgically placed?  I had a mastectomy on Jan 16th and began chemo yesterday.  I'm on the same regimen:  taxotere, carboplatin and herceptin.  I started a thread on the Chemo board, so please join us there.  One other person just posted and she'll be starting her chemo March 1st.  Let's get through this together, k? I had a port in time for chemo and I swear, I never felt a thing!  The nurse sprayed and froze the skin on top of the port first and I never felt the needle go in.  She withdrew 3 vials of blood and then put in the IV.  Have someone go with you the first time.  I was a little more apprehensive than I thought I'd be.  But Xanex helps.  You DO have a prescription for Xanex, don't you?  Many of us use it and it's really helpful.  This a stressful time for all of us and we need all the help we can get!
