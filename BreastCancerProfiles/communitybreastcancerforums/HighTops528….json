Don't want a repeat. Zofran meant no nausea at all, thank goodness, but then there was the constipation from that. To keep it from getting too bad I started right away with Senokot S. My gut really hated it and after several miserable days I ended up combating diarrhea instead. Imodium didn't help at all; I should have filled the prescription for Lomotil right away but didn't. As a result I ended up back at the Cancer Center twice that week for saline infusions to rehydrate (lost 7 lbs). Once I started the Lomotil, there was almost instant relief. The lessons: Colace only, no Senokot. And Lomotil if needed. This week, week 3, I've felt just like the old normal me. Well, except for the hair. The morning of Day 14 my hair was fine. But by late afternoon, almost 14 days to the hour since the first treatment ended, I found I could pull out scary amounts of hair. I've always worn my hair pretty short, but I was still grossed out in the shower the next morning when I had to keep wiping loose hair off my face and couldn't seem to get it all rinsed out of the tub. Got it buzzed immediately to 1/4 inch. There were no tears; I was just relieved to not have to experience another shower like the first one. And yes, the sticky lint roller works wonders every day to pick out the loose stubble. Still haven't settled on a particular cap or scarf solution. I'm retired and dress very casual (it's Colorado, after all). Best thing so far seems to be a bandana tied do rag style or, a brilliant suggestion from my daughter-in-law, a buff. Hundreds of patterns and colors to choose from and several different ways to wear them. Oh, the Neulasta. Started Claritin the morning of the shot and took it daily for about 5 days. Took Tylenol or ibuprofen when the twinges in my hips bothered me on about 4th and 5th days. My MO said other antihistamines might work as well but Claritin is the only one that's been tested in study.",

My chemo is scheduled to start June 23 and my schedule between now and then looks crazy. Echocardiogram and PET/CT scans later this week. I'm really anxious about the echo because my MO hasn't decided on my regimen yet -- TC or AC-T. My HER-2 was \"equivocal\" on the first test and barely negative on the second. The decision rides on a pathology review tomorrow and the results of the echo. I'm actually trying not to read too much here. So afraid of seeing something I don't want to see or that conflicts with what my doctors tell me.",
