I know it's IDC well differentiated and er+/pr+ (not sure if I got the abbreviations right, but I'm sure I will in time.) Still waiting on the hers2. I expect to see the breast surgeon next week (the doctor is working on that for me), but what will she do? Does she order and MRI or other tests or do we just discuss what it is we're going to do in terms of surgery? I don't really want an MRI (more waiting.) I mean, we know it's there, just do something already. So I just wondered what happens when you see the breast surgeon. Any info is appreciated. Thanks, ladies. Chris Log in to post a reply",

No history of bc in my family at all. Have had complete hysterectomy a few years ago. Everything's been fine until 2 weeks ago. I felt a small seed-like lump in my left breast and went to dr. to check it out. Ended up a few days later having a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. The seed-thing had disappeared by then and I thought everything would be just fine. La la la. Not a care in the world. I had no idea the radiologist was going to come into the room and tell me in no uncertain terms that I had breast cancer. \"We caught it early,\" he said. I lay there speechless and almost turned my head to see if he was talking to someone else. \"We caught what early?\" He: \"It's very tiny about 1 to 1.1 cm. You'll be fine. You're going to live.\" Me: (seriously wondering if this was a nightmare) \"Are you saying you think it's cancer?\" He: \"Yes. I am.\" I lay there shaking and crying and they had to go get my cousin who had come with me to the appt. The past two weeks have been a horrible fog. All I can do is sleep (when I get upset, I sleep.) I've lost about 15 lbs from not eating and worrying so far (which I can stand to lose.) I do not know how I made it through work. Had my core biopsy on Monday and got partial results today - Invasive well-differentiated ductal carcinoma. That's all I know so far. I asked what the 'well-differentiated' meant and he said that is much better than 'poorly differentiated.' Thank God my sister was there with me. I just sat there and wept and she asked a lot of questions while the dr (who was very kind) made arrangements for me to see a specialist (I just can't write the name yet. I just can't do it.) She was on the phone with some friends who went through this and some friends who are nurses and had the name of a doctor in a minute flat. I go next Tuesday. Am terrified, but reading posts from this site is very comforting. Thank you to anyone who can let me know what to expect in the coming weeks. Chris Log in to post a reply",
