I found the lump in my breast almost two years to the day later. I had been on heavy antibiotics for two years (including intravenous). I told my LLMD about the lumps in my breast two years ago and he always said their just cysts you need to take more iodine, so I did. it wasn't until the new lump and my moms breast cancer returning that I insisted my doc send me for an ultrasound.",
