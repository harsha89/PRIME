It's a very personal decision and I too was very fortunate and did not have cancer and believe it or not sometimes that makes it harder than it should be because people who don't understand try to discourage you from proceeding since you are healthy and surgery is looked at as what it is - an elective and therefore many argue you really don't need to do it so no having cancer also throughs a bunch of obstacles at you. I hope you can come to your decision and be at piece with it. Best wishes!",
