My only risk factors were my sex and my age.  Although I have had moments of uncertainty, at this point I'm glad that I at least have one breast that has feeling and that feels normal.  I am very small breasted and some people joked that I should get \"two for the price of one\" or asked if I love my new boob!  While I'm still a work in progress (7 mos since implant and 1 month since fat grafting ) I am satisfied with the way things have gone so far.  I can't even believe I'm saying those words. I never thought I'd be satisfied with anything about this mess. Amazing how time lets you accept things. Good luck with your journey, ladies,  I've come to love this site.  ",
