Ask the nurse to give you a turniquet to clip your drainage bags to in the shower. This was an awesome tip I read on here and it worked so well and my nurses never heard of it. They gave me one to take home as well for showering at home. You just drape the turniquet around your neck and clip the drains on each end. Perfect and waterproof. Also, ask the nurse to give you a stack of those alcohol prep pads. They work super well for holding onto the tube and sliding your fingers down to strip them. Then you also have clean tubes and less chance for infection. I had to have help stripping the drains for about a week because it requires some arm strength I didn't have from surgery. I asked the nurse for a bottle of hand sanitizer for my hospital tray. It was REALLY hard to get up and this way I could clean my hand before eating and such. The hospital gave me an AWESOME camisole to wear home. It had removable little pockets to hold my drainage tubes. I spent alot of time wondering what I was going to do about the bra, cami, tube thing. I wish I would've known they had it all taken care of for me. A nice lady came around with a cart full of options for me in the hospital and helped me get what I needed. I still wear it 5 weeks out because it is great!
