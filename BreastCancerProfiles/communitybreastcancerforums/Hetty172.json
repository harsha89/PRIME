Has anyone gone through something similar?  Is there anything that I can do to better advocate for her at the hospital?  Now that she's finally lucid again, she's saying that she wished she never got the reconstruction and is having a lot of regret.  I feel so bad for her ... she's a pretty positive and vibrant woman on a normal day ... this just isn't like her.  Any advice/support would be appreciated ...

AnneW -- she had a bilateral mastectomy and a TRAM flap last week.  Back in April she had a double lumpectomy and sentinel node dissection in the right side. ",
