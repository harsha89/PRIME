Lived away from my husband and kids while caring for my father who had passed away from cancer, cleaned out his home while living long distance. which took two years back and forth.   Travelled across to the other side of the world to help my husband care for his mother who was dying of cancer, while undergoing a kitchen rennovation.  Returned and then received my dx. I'd say stress has something to do with it.",

I see no reason for not saving the nipple.    For a start, refer to the topic of where are the skin sparing nipple sparing procedures performed.  Ask the plastic surgeon , who the general surgeon they use who give the best outcome because its the surgical skill in preserving the most skin for the plastic surgeon to do his magic.   Also another reason this is usually not performed on a large breast, meaning obese is that the implant is only so big and if the skin/breast is so stretched out then the implant would not be able to fill out all the skin-there would be a huge sag between the implant and the nipple area.  The pec muscle can only stretch out so far.   In the county I live in, I know of only three surgeons that perform this, so If I had a consult with every general/breast surgeon in my own city I would have them all recommending the traditional route as they don't perform it, so I could have went to 5 or 6 surgeon consults and all would have said no, it doesn't mean that it is dangerous it only means that it wasn't an option when they were trained and they have no experience in this.  Ask your oncologist who has cosmetically good results with this procedure as they are the ones that see all the outcomes and ask the oncologist how many cancer of the nipples they have seen in their practice. I will predict that the next generation of surgeons coming out of the teaching hospitals will be offering this in their practice or will know of this option to refer us to, its just not happening now. I haven't heard of one woman who regrets saving their nipples.  It somehow makes everything feel like its all going to be ok.",
