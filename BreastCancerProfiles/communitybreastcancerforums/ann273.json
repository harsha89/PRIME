I also have some residual tumor. My onc has been saying ll along that considering I am Highly Er+ I wouldn't have a great path response, but I am just surprised to see so many micromets. I am just not sure if 11 micromets are the same as 11 positive lymph nodes. ",

So many people may have stopped it just because of side effects. I had that experience with Afinitor. After a couple of weeks I was ready to quit. I had a dose reduction and suddenly my life was back to normal. Lets hope that its the case for you with this drug and you feel back to normal real soon.

I changed treatment to Aromasin and within 3 months I went into complete remission. I had next to nil response to chemo and clearly tamoxifen did'nt work. I was told that a pretty significant percentage of tumors are tamoxifen resistant. I was exactly where you are now, and the only advice I can give you is to breathe and be gentle on yourself. It is very possible that your tumor being hormone positive was resistant to chemo. And it might have also fallen under the bracket of tamoxifen resistant ones. Please give AI's a chance before you lose hope. I wish you the very best. Hold on to every positive thought and stay strong.",

Most of us here understand the feeling of hopelessness but there are so many of us who are thriving. I am sure someone on here who is triple negative will chime in with their experiences.

Until the end of January I had a single lymph node met and tumor markers int he normal range. Over two months markers went up by about 25 points and I ended up with 5 bone mets and a single liver met. My MO is really surprised at the sudden turn as well. They're testing it again to check if the cancer turned Her2+ (Wouldnt that be nice? It would open up so many options, I'm not getting my hopes up, but worth a try). Have you had foundation one or any other genetic testing done before? Might be a good time to get a sample from the liver mets to see if you have targetable mutations. I see that you may not have tried afinitor yet. I know its generally terrible in terms of side effects for most people, but I was one of the few lucky ones who was able to manage it with a completely normal life for over 3 years. And like you I failed all other medicines within 12-15 months. Maybe you can check with your MO about that? Good luck to you. I hope you find something that works and works for a prolonged period of time. <3 Ann ",
