I have Stage IIa IDC, ER+PR+ Her2-.   Being larger breasted, I think it makes it more tempting for me to get the BMX, because like someone else said, I won't feel so unbalanced, and I could even just wear a tank as an undershirt and go w/o prostheses if I wished.   I know it is not the same...but when I began chemo, I thought I'd wear my wig all the time. But actually, I really only wear it when I feel I have to. It is getting old having no hair, but I haven't felt like I *had* to have my wig to make me feel normal. Perhaps the same will be true with prosthetics, but it would be harder to be unbalanced if I only got the single MX.   Anyway, I really, really am grateful to have found this site, and especially, this thread.  ",
