I'm waiting for the surgeon's office to call me to arrange the procedure.  I have experienced pain in there for a while but finally started investigating and felt a lump on 7/22- diagnosed with masses on 8/14.   Hope my story helps.",

      "Content": "Aug 20, 2014 12:29AM - edited Aug 20, 2014 12:36AM by Lionesse2 I found a lump on 7/22.  Luckily I had an apt with my PCP  the very next day. Personally, I don't deal with NPs or Physician Assistants and don't go to practices that have them. I will only see a physician.  He felt it, took me seriously and sent me for an US.  I had a clear mammo this past April.  The US came up negative.  Was told it was fibrocystic related to my period by the tech. The radiologist refused to come in.  IN the mean time, I set up an apt with a local general surgeon with a stellar rep.  I wasn't buying the fibrocystic banter, it's too hard to be fibrocystic. I felt if someone was going to tell me a hard lump was \"nothing\" it was going to be a BREAST SURGICAL ONCOLOGIST (usually found at major academic research universities).  The closest one for me is 3 hours away.  I called and they were able to get me in within 7 days.  Met with the surgeon and I asked what the US read.  She said there were only 5 pictures that were poorly done.  I immediately went to their imaging center and saw a radiologist.  She found a mass thankfully birads 4.  Since the lump is causing me pain, I'm having an excisional biopsy.  The surg oncologist can do it in September.  Found a lump on 7/22. Even with a clear mammo and clear US I was diagnosed with a mass on 8/14 because I, myself, insisted on seeing a breast surgical oncologist.  Thankfully, my insurance paid for everything; but I would have went and paid for everything out of my own pocket.",

I'm 41. I had my first mammo in April. I had to have a biopsy to confirm a fibroadenoma on the left.  I had an ultrasound guided biopsy.  Luckily, I knew the reputation of the radiologist who does them at that radiology center.  He more than exceeded his reputation.  The procedure and recovery were peaceful.  I was so happy that in this hurried world that I had a physician extend himself as a friend. He inspired to keep on top of things and always pursue concerns. He also inspired me to start self exams.  I did one and boom! I found a lump on the right on July 22 (mammo read negative for the right).  It felt like a piece of clay-not something that should be in a soft breast.  It was the 2nd day of my period. Luckily, I had an appt with a new internist the next day.  I decided to do some due diligence and find a great internist since I went through a biopsy and wanted a doctor who was going to be by my side during rough times. I brought all my radiology reports. I made sure I could locate the lump easily before my appt so I wouldn't waste time trying to find it.  He felt it and agreed it was a lump.  He was right on top of everything and easily agreed to send me for an ultrasound and we discussed seeing a local general surgeon. Luckily I know of the best in town.   But I can't get in until the end of September.  He's a super nice surgeon who would give patients the shirt off his back but I don't want to take advantage of his niceness and push my way in especially since the report wasn't marked as urgent. The next week the ultrasound showed just increased tissue density-basically cyclical engorged normal tissue.  I guess it made sense since I found it during my period.  I keep feeling it and does appear less firm but it's still there.  The US wasn't read by my friend but all the doctors at that site are excellent so I respect his opinion. I'm just not satisfied. So today, I made an appt with a breast surgical oncologist at a major city hospital breast care center.  No application, I just made the appt and I'm bringing in my paperwork on the 14th. I'm keeping my appt with my local surgeon. Tomorrow, I'm calling my internist and asking for an MRI since I've read on these boards that women found masses with MRIs even though the mammo and US were clear. I've kept my Gyn out of it since he appears to only want to pursue this to his satisfaction and not mine.  I know he won't support my decision to get an MRI so I'm not going to ask him. Good luck on your journey and keep us posted!",

      "Content": "Aug 22, 2014 09:40AM - edited Aug 22, 2014 10:20AM by Lionesse2 You need an immediate DIAGNOSTIC mammogram and ultrasound.  1) Call and demand they send an immediate order.  Don't take no for an answer.  Make sure when you talk to the scheduler at the imaging center to schedule the diagnostic mammogram and US at the same appt.  Don't take no for an answer.  If you get a hard time talk to the office managers of your dr's office and/or the imaging center.  If the doctor's office still gives you a hard time, show up and tell them you're not leaving until you have those orders in your hands.  When you go for the scans, make sure the breast center gets a copy. 2) Call the breast center and make sure the referral is there.  Make the appt yourself.  Don't wait until the doctor's office calls you.  If the referral isn't at the breast center demand the staff get it there.  If they give you a hard time show up and tell them you're not leaving until you have the referral to the breast clinic in your hand then hand deliver it yourself and don't leave until you have an appt. It's time to stop playing nice.  It's your health. I don't understand why the doctor didn't already send you for those scans.  The doctor at the breast center needs those studies before she sees you.   I also don't agree with the delay from the initial concern.  Also, a good doctor would have filled out the referral to the breast clinic while you were there and had it faxed by the time you left.  It seems like your doctor might have a klinker in her thinker. The odds are very high that you have a benign condition, but why let yourself be run through the system badly? You want answers and you have the right to get answers in a timely manner.  As you can see, there are many, many cracks you may fall through so you have to be on top of EVERYTHING! PS  have a copy of the imaging reports, CDs of the scans plus pictures of the mammogram (no CDs are not enough!) in your hand for your first appt.  If the imaging center gives you a hard time about any of these take it to the top.",
