I just had a cbc yesterday that showed HGB at 9.5 and RBC at 3.2. So as I have been watching it go down, I kept wondering what those magic numbers are for the docs. That gives me a better idea. I just finished 4 AC and now have 4 Taxol to go. From what I am reading, Taxol can continue to take wbc, rbc, hgb, hct and plt down right? I kept thinking that with Taxol all those issues would go away, until a nurse handed me a four page printout on the drug and side effects.  Thank you again everyone. ",

It is a thread that I had started before surgery when I had a similar question. The biggest differences are that A. my decision was all before surgery and B. I have never had any sign of cancer in my nodes. I wish you the best. I know how tough this decision can be. I think I might be tempted to do it, relying on the thought that saving your life and preventing further spread comes before lymphedema. However, this is your decision, not mine. When you read that thread linked above, you will see in my last post in it, that my surgeon was also finding that it is more common thinking now that rads and chemo will be enough. ",

My RO told me that I couldn't do rads yet because I can't lay with my arms up... So, some of the things that I do: I thought about my favorite TV shows when I was a kid. I was born in 71, so I loved Captain Kangaroo. I run around singing the \"Good Morning Sunshine\" song from that. I have shown some of the shows that I watched as a kid to my kids. The other day I showed them \"The Addams Family\" cartoon on YouTube after we had watched both the movies. I LOVED The Muppets when I was little, the TV show, not the movies. So I own Seasons 1-3 on dvd. There's nothing better than John Denver singing with the muppets. Then there's music. My parents divorced when I was 4-5 and my dad got custody of me and my two brothers. We lived with him and my stepmom. We were not allowed to listen to anything but Christian music. We did not have much of a relationship with my mom and almost none after about age11, due to dad and stepmom's issues. So, there is nothing better to me than pulling out some John Denver, Cat Stevens and Neil Diamond that my mom had filled the house with. I love to sing loudly with no one around. The best is Indigo Girls, Alanis Morrisette, Janis Joplin. These are all good cleaning music. I always do this before a job interview. It helps me feel strong and like I know my \"voice\".

She is the only doctor that I use that is outside the hospital system that I have been using. When I saw her yesterday she did not have access to the pathology report that showed the details of what was found last June. She got access to that today and said that she had no reservations now about cancelling the PET. I can't remember the details of what she said about what was found, but she said it made sense that that was not an area of concern.  So although I will never know my beginning stage as all of you do, I do know that right now, there is no reason to think that I am stage iv. I thought that I might find more women here who didn't know their stage. I guess I could know what my post-treatment stage would be, but that just doesn't make sense in the medical world. My chemo started before I had any surgery or lymph node disection, so those factors will not be known. I only know T size and no Metastasis. Node involvement at diagnosis will never be known. ",

Does your urologist actually perform the surgery or do you go to a specialist or general surgeon?  Anafoefana: You made a comment on the radiation thread about doing rads on the nodes when nothing was found in SNB. I am having that and the RO said that she is doing that because of tumor size. Has anyone else had this in their treatment? Also, did anyone here have AND instead of SNB because of tumor size? I had a debate with all my doctors about this before surgery and I can see you had the unfortunate experience of that discussion after surgery, ana. I had a thread about it that I did before surgery to try to get comfortable with my part in the decision on this. http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/91/topic/776527?page=1#idx_7 windlass: I have been focusing on giving that 1% to husband and both kids since we talked about that above. It is amazing how when I look them in the eye and want to know about their lives how much more they are attentive to mine. My son went with me to my first radiation treatment today. He had a doctor appointment right after mine. I asked the techs if he could check out the equipment because he wants to be an engineer. He is 15 and has Asperger's and several other labels. He was very intrigued and discussed it with me all the way to the next appointment. I didn't think rads could be so much fun! ",

He sewed things back down really well with a different thread, not the dissolving stuff, but some very firm external stitches. It feels a lot better already, but maybe that's the pain meds talking. : ) Also, I had been talking with PS about the bloating and he said that that is not bloating, that is my body under that layer of fat that he removed. I debated back that I cannot wear any of my old clothes, even my pants from days when I was heavier - that I had lost quite a bit from surgery, but nothing fits. I showed him how my lower abdomen was slightly warm and red. He checked it out during surgery and was able to aspirate over 300 cc of fluid. It may be the pain meds talking again, but I don't feel any pain in my abdomen or pelvic floor now! He said we will remove more at next week's appointment when I will be in a better position for it. At the time I was in surgery, so he was forced to work with my laying down. Something about sitting up is supposed to be better - I believe he said. So, I anticipate a couple days of pain meds and then back to getting functional. I get to shower in 48 hours again!! (I had to stop when everything opened up.) I am really excited about yesterday's progress!",

The PS told me that I would be able to work the next day. He was very wrong. I worked the day after, but I did have quite a few co-workers tell me that it looked apparent that I was back too soon and I knew that I was, but felt like I had no choice with the job being contract work and I had already told them that my doctor thought I could be back the next day. He also got rid of the dog ears on the hips and did liposuction. I had bruises over 12\" in diameter. Lipo is NO joke - I discovered. I had no idea how sore I would be from that. Tattoos will be next, but I belive he told me it would be six months from the last surgery before we do them. The new year brought me a new job. For the first time through this whole cancer treatment, I am done with contract work and into a full-time, permanant position. I am so excited about it and the growth prospects in that position.

I did contract design work all the way through diagnosis and treatments. It was really tough to keep trying to market myself as a valuable employee with wigs and prostheses, etc. So my next decision after all the testing and ER visit this week will be to do a D&C and something else (can't remember the name) or remove the ovaries or a hysterectomy.",

Same with the mammogram. They told me in the beginning that sometimes the doctor comes in to consult after and sometimes a nurse. A nurse came in and just said, \"The doctor says that you need to consult with a surgeon.\" That was it! I'm thinking, \"So we just take the boobs now?!!\" Isn't that why you go see a surgeon, to cut things out or off? As I am looking shocked and teary-eyed, she says why don't we have you change back into your clothes and we'll get that appointment scheduled. I had no idea that it would be the surgeon leading me through the process of getting biopsies and more diagnosis. I actually then got handed over to the oncologist because we are doing chemo first. Surgery will be in November. I have seen the surgeon quite a few times and he was extremely helpful in teaching me about my diagnosis. Love him! But, he has not removed anything yet, just inserted a medport for chemo which has been the best thing since sliced bread! I can't imagine chemo without it.",

You posted several times in a thread that I had started similar to this when I was first diagnosed. Capinva: Good luck with your Taxol. I just finished mine in October. I had such extreme joint pain and still do have quite a bit. My oncologist said it was unusual to have that level of pain. I wake up in the middle of the night and the joints in my hands feel misaligned and when I move my fingers I can feel bone and cartilage rubbing and my fingers won't bend correctly. It's kind of scary, but of course the nurses tell me that it's likely to go away. It isn't as bad during the day when I am moving around. damazon: I just had my bmx with snb on 11-09-11. My nodes were clear, but I had been doing 4 AC/ 4 Taxol, so I had a good opportunity for that. I was told that I am not a candidate for implants because so much was taken with bmx and then radiation which will be soon. I am planning on DIEP flap reconstruction after healing from radiation.",

Mine went from 8.6 cm to 2.5. windlass: I was not consistant about self exams. I mistakenly thought that breast cancer was not a threat to me because there was none in my family. Later I learned that only around 10% have a genetic link and then I also learned that there were three in my family who had it and on both sides of my family. So, how I found it: I had a yearly exam in April at my 40th birthday which included breast exam. The doctor found nothing. She advised me to get a mammogram scheduled because I had just turned 40. I said, yes, I want to get right on that because I did do my baseline at 35. A few weeks later I found a lump during a self exam near the nipple. The whole right side of my right breast was very thick and hard, but I did not notice that or realize that that could be a problem area at the time. I made a doctor appointment very soon because I thought that the sooner they can tell me that it is nothing, the better. Then I thought that I should prepare myself either way so I started searching for breast cancer symptoms online. I saw the list of things such as nipple inversion, dimpling on the breast, leakage, irregular shape... I had all of these things except leakage from the nipple. So I went into that appointment quietly knowing that something was seriously wrong. My husband had just been arrested in April for arson of a house that we were trying to move from in another state. We had been dealing with the insurance company on this for a year and a half. We knew that it wasn't possible that he had done it because he was not there when it started. However, the timeline was too close and they couldn't find any other likely person. It would have cost us $30,000 in attorney fees to fight this or $4,000 to accept a plea. Needing this to be done so that we could move on in my healing process and needing him here for me and our two special needs children and insurance, we took the plea. It's been a rough year but it has drawn us all closer than ever. I am looking forward to the new year and the hope it has to offer. ",

I do have to work to pull myself out of this computer to get some living done though. I get so sucked into everyone's stories and thinking that the other shoe will drop eventually. Then I think, it might but how did I live until it did? I do computer work for a living and am looking for a new job, so it is tough to fight the temptation. It is amazing to me how often I am seeing people say that mammogram missed it. I had my baseline at 35, but my 40th year mammogram was my first that was supposed to be routine.  ",

The plastic surgeon agreed with these two men as well. The amount of skin available was one, radiation destroying the implants and radiation tightening up the skin a lot. I am in limbo right now with treatment recently finished, but not able to do reconstruction yet. I have been doing contract work all through this and need to save up some money to be able to take the time off or get a permanent hire and then see when it fits in with the company to be able to take the time off for surgery. Either way, I think I am stuck waiting for a bit. In researching the different methods, this is the one I wanted before the docs all gave their opinions. It's so nice to hear more survival stories. I am glad that you ladies are doing well. I will be taking my very first Tamoxifen pill tonight. I have been waiting on it to come in the mail for over two weeks now. Exciting event! ",

Because my tumor was so large and the surgeon was saying he would not be able to get clear margins in surgery, we are doing neoadjuvent therapy. The tumor size puts me at a very significant risk for being stage iv. My oncologist spoke with me about a PET scan - the pros and cons and wanted to know how I felt about finding additional sites and having to do additional biopsies. Because I have two young children to think about, I wanted to know all I could know going into treatment. I understand that doing neoadjuvent and not surgery, we will not know precise staging until surgery, after things have been significantly changed by the chemo. So I thought that if we had a PET before it all started, we would know if the chemo is going after any other areas that may have cancer in the body. We found several additional areas and had to biopsy those as well, but they were all benign.  I have a friend who has been fighting bladder cancer for 10 years, has been stage iv from the beginning, and has never had a PET scan. ",

I stopped at the edge of the hill overlooking a river. I freaked out and said, \"I'll be damned if this cancer didn't get me, this river is not gonna get me either!\" I sat there refusing to take a foot off the break until I got help. I was too close to the edge to chance it and see where I could go without a guide. Are you able to work right now?

So is it denial or am I just ignoring some of the unhealthy aspects of my life? Either way, I didn't feel like I needed my surgeon reminding me that I could be back for a new primary or metastasis.",

AC is a rough road, but in a lot of ways, I felt better than I had in a long time as I could feel the tumor load decreasing. Some of the decrease in size that you will feel is also inflammation decreasing, which is still a good thing because it will help the surgeon be able to see which parts are cancer when it comes time for surgery.",

I will look it up again though to make sure I am not stretching things. I think most people need about 8 weeks. I mean, in the beginning, I couldn't reach to wipe after using the bathroom. I needed help with so many things! It is really nice though to not use prosthesis anymore. But, it was the toughest part of the entire experience for me, but I did not have a lot of help, two little ones and no vacation time to use - so there were a lot of stress points involved.

I am hesitant to offer a lot of advice in this area because my incisions on the under sides of the breasts came back open a couple of weeks after the surgery and they had to take me back in and put me back together. My incisions were gaping open and oozing for a couple of weeks before they got me back in. I kept diapers over them, getting help changing them often. It was traumatic. They couldn't fix it all completely so now one side is significantly larger than the other. The surgeon has a phenomenal reputation but he said that this just happens sometimes.  I hope you ladies are doing well. I just got a fitbit for Christmas and was wondering if anyone else uses one?

My doctor recommended CoQ10, Fish Oil and Vitamin B Complex. That was before the breast cancer diagnosis at age 39, but during a period of very high stress. Never hurts to continue to bring those things up. I feel a lot better with the supplements. After chemo, bmx and rads I found that I was extremely tired and mentally sluggish. I thought that it was just the treatments, but decided to check into it anyway. My doctor had all that great bloodwork available and saw that my blood sugar was consistantly just a little high, showing some resistance. She put me on Metformin as a preventive measure and my energy and capability to keep up mentally has come right back. Now I am working on my master's degree, learning programming...

Every time I have brought up staging with the docs they are all very quick to remind me that we will never know. That kind of frustrates me, but I get it. It is so strange how just having a \"label\" or diagnosis calms us to some extent. I have a nephew who is severely disabled. He has never been able to walk, talk, eat, etc. The docs have never been able to give him a diagnosis except that part of his brain did not develop. He is now 14. My sister-in-law commented that that caused so much alarm for people who wanted to discuss him. It's like if we can find a group of people who have the same symptoms, we are more relaxed because we know this has happened to someone else.",

It was to me. My bmx was on 11/09 and rads start next week so it will be a little while still. Funny story: I went to a cousin's house for a holiday party. I have another cousin who has always been extremely small breasted and thin. No one in the entire party had seen me since my cancer diagnosis except my mom and stepdad. I am still nearly bald from chemo and at that time a month after bmx. I was wearing a head scarf and looking very concave. My cousin has just had implants. She took me aside and tried to talk to me as a confidant about how much it would be good for me if I went ahead and had implants done. She said that it would make me feel so much better about myself... yeah, thanks, I'll get right on that for you. : ) This is the kind of stuff that teaches me to ask more questions, not spout opinions. I am sure I have said many equally uneducated things. ",

Do you have a huband/boyfriend/partner bringing in an income as well? For my story, I was 1/2 of the household income, so it is a big problem but not completely the end of the world. I have another month or two before I really have to have work or start missing bill payments. Let us know how things go. Take it one step at a time though. Focus on the broad strokes of information first and the part that you are in at the moment. If you get into too much of learning about everything, you will just be a big emotional mess. Antidepressants really do help ease the anxiety of it all and help you function if you think that is needed. I found Lexapro to leave me emotionally flat. Celexa seems to just take away the anxiety and let me be me but functional. Take care! ",

You will kick cancer's butt, I am not so sure about chemo's butt. : ) I have been feeling kind of down this week. I was fighting a cold again. I got my first one in well over a year right as radiation started in January. Just as I thought that that one was going away, I got hit again with a much worse one this week. I thought I was dying! (I exaggerate...) It was the whole nine yards all over again with sore throat, ear pain, nose running like a faucet... I finally got a job interview lined up and was scheduled for Thursday. Thursday morning I e-mailed my contact and told him that I had the flu and didn't want to bring that into their offices. He thanked me for my consideration and we rescheduled for Monday. My daughter said exactly what I was thinking, \"Who calls in SICK for a JOB interview??!!!\" Sad, she is 14. My RO gave me some Oxycodone and encouraged me to not try so hard to avoid pain meds, not that she wanted me to become a pill popper, but I was in the last couple of weeks of rads, not sleeping and in pain and not even taking Tylenol. I just didn't want to be sleeping all the time as I was at the end of chemo. I took one and started sleeping again. I am using a heating pad on the sore ear and that is getting better. I received another interview request and now I have to rest up to be able to kick butt next week!  I also have been trying to reign in my attitude this week. I keep reading things on here about people having problems with sore nipples or sore breasts from rads or things like that. I usually don't think about it too much, but this week I just keep thinking - you HAVE breasts and ALL you've done is a lumpectomy and radiation? Really? This week my MO recommended an oopherectomy along with Tamoxifen. I was trying to think about when I could sign up for DIEP flap reconstruction, not additional surgery. I didn't like going back into the MO's office this week. It made me feel like I had cancer or something! : ) I am sorry that my post is so grumbly. I always work to keep any bad attitude out of my posts because I know that we don't need to bring each other down. I will work on this and do better next time! Promise!!! ",

The struggle that I am having is feeling up to fighting to prove myself in the real world again. As a graphic designer, the employers demand a lot of you before hiring. For example, one that I interviewed with last week asked me if they could \"try me out for a bit\" by working with me on one project that would take about a week. He asked for some sketches last night to be in his e-mail by morning. Then I was up until 2am, up at 5:30 to get kids out to bus and me to radiation. I wanted rads to go fast, but they are checking me daily with the doctor right now because the wound is so open right now. So they decided to skip a treatment, but spend over an hour on wound care. After all that, I was too exhausted and nauseous to get to an interview that I had planned for this afternoon. I had to reschedule. It's so humiliating to not be able to keep up. Rads are over after six more treatments. I hope the energy will get better then. ",

It was something that wove its way through the ductal system, forming hardened tissue, appearing to be dense tissue. In us young ones, the dense tissue is even more expected, therefore, not questioned as often. My MO was very supportive of my desire to do bmx even though on the \"good side\" I had only had two biopsies that both came back clean. He said with the elusive nature of these tumors and how long it took to find, he thought that I would rest more easily with it being out of the question. He never once tried to make that decision for me, just seemed to be quite supportive when I did come to that decision.",

Radiation can be bad for implants and really tightens the skin down. I had to do a lot of physical therapy after the bmx, and then after the rads too. However, mine was IDC and I see yours is ILC. That kept them from saving the nipple as well because it was in the ductal system. I don't claim to be any kind of expert on this, but I thought I would throw those thoughts out there so you know you are doing the right kind of reconstruction. I did bmx on Nov 9th and finished rads at the end of Feb, and I will do a DIEP flap on Aug 22nd. They wanted six months of recovery before reconstruction.

This is the link to get you there: http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/71. You can also get there by going to the tab that says \"Forum Index\" and then scrolling down to \"Connecting to Others with a Similar Diagnosis\". You will also find that if you can get all the information together, mostly from your initial pathology report and fill out the profile information, you will find that people who have similar experiences to yours will find you more easily. They will read that diagnosis line below your posts and be able to relate to you better. I have an approach to all of this medical information that I am finding works for me. I have two kids with special needs, so I have some experience. First, I try to learn about the \"broad strokes\". I focus on the overall big picture information. For example, just learning basic information like chemo is a systemic (or treating the whole body system) treatment versus radiation and surgery treating a particular area. Oh, and before taking in all this information, I found Celexa to be extremely helpful with reducing my anxiety to be able to think clearly. That was the best thing I did in this process!! Then, as I am emotionally ready take in more information, I focus on the treatment that is next. I watch to see how overwhelmed I feel by the information. Now, as I am starting radiation I am bouncing around through the information fairly well because I am pretty far along in my treatment plan. I always take some time alone and quiet before every appointment to write a list of symptoms that are going on and a list of questions that pertains to that doctor that I am seeing. What is nice about all this is I can leave most appointments feeling like I am doing the most that I am able to work my way through to finding better health. There is a lot I cannot control, but I am looking for things on my lists that maybe I can make a difference with. After that, I have to let the other gripes go. I also am working really hard to talk about cancer less with my husband and kids. Since diagnosis, this has been all that is coming out of my mouth. It is hard to pull myself into their world and find out what is going on there. However, I have reached a new understanding lately that by talking about it constantly with them and not participating in their days, I am already robbing them of their mom and wife. In the end, they would probably be relieved for all the drama to end if that is how I lived the entire illness. So my focus right now is to step into their lives more and move back into living mine more. This is no easy task with all the change that has happened! How do you guys handle all the information? How do you see your role as a patient in the process?  ",

It is amazing to watch children with different needs face their challenges with so much tenacity.  I saw that you start your rads tomorrow. I do my simulation tomorrow and then my rads start Tuesday. Good luck! ",

See this link: http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/BreastCancer/DetailedGuide/breast-cancer-staging. Reading that link will also help you understand staging better.  The medical oncologist and surgeon told me that doing neoadjuvant therapy would help reduce swelling and shrink the tumor back from the skin and chest wall in order to have a better chance at clean margins. When it gets into the skin or chest wall it is a much bigger deal. Maybe you can ask your medical oncologist (MO) if that is a concern. My cancer was invasive ductal, and that could play into the onclogist's decision as well. I struggled with the bilateral mastectomy decision. I hope that you are at peace with that. What helped me was to focus on the bmx as a means of saving my life. I kept saying this is not about losing breasts, it's about gaining life. Being new to this, you might find a book, Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, to be very helpful. My surgeon gave me an older edition to borrow when I was first diagnosed. I bought the newest edition later. It is very well written and you can just use it as a reference tool, looking up what you need to know at the time so that it is not too overwhelming. ",

I was very scared at first when the doctor and I both thought that I was bleeding vaginally and rectally - and a LOT. Even after they could see that it was just extremely heavy cervical bleeding, it was still scary to think what this could mean - with the doctor ordering a PET scan I was worried that he thought there was another problem, worried that this would get in the way of my brand new job, etc. No one will understand those things as much as this group.

I love that your relationship with your parents, even though divorced, is comfortable that you have the ability to consider that option of changing homes to help out. I was raised with my dad and stepmom and was not permitted to have a relationship with my mom even though the court said differently. I did not start spending time with her again until I was in my 20's, and now each moment is just so invaluable to me. I think that Chrissyb's suggestion is good. Perhaps she may just need extra help a few days after each treatment, once she figures out which days will be her rough days. The best advice that I got when I was diagnosed was to learn the broad strokes first - the larger, more important chunks of information. Then when you feel like you can handle it, you take on learning more. A great resource is Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, a bible for breast cancer and given out at many physician's offices. My surgeon gave me one to borrow, then I went out and bought the most current version. You may find it at the library as well to see if she is interested in it. I agree that she will need help with your brothers, especially when dealing with autism and that young. She may already be working on finding resources for that, so be sure to just continue to communicate and find out what she needs and she figures out what she needs. She may not know yet. Then, I suggest you may enjoy reading a book called The Power of Now, by Eckhart Tolle. It can help pull you out of that fear and anxiety that is taking over your mind right now. It is something that I have really tried to soak up and practice in my daily life. She is here today and that is all that you have at this moment. I wish you the best on this new unexpected journey.  ",

Did you talk to a medical oncologist about your fears? They can really do so much about the side effects. And, not all drug regimens are as harsh as others. You have a hormone positive cancer which can be extremely receptive to chemo. The reason that I am concerned for you is that I see you have had positive nodes. If you use a systemic treatment like chemo that treats the entire body system, then it can get at any stray cells and increases your odds of not having recurrence. That is what reduces my fear of treatments, following all the treatments that my MO is showing me have had the best statistical results for my diagnosis. Just remember, being brave does not mean that you never feel fear. I wish you the very best through this! ",

I have pushed some stretching on days that I had a lot of really tight pain around my ribs, but I have had no problems going without the Oxycodone now. I started to go without the Aquaphor for the last couple of days and checked out my skin last night in the mirror and found a new area had opened up and was oozing a week and a half after treatment ending. It doesn't hurt at all. I didn't know it had happened. But other than that, it is healing extremely fast!  Congrats to all who are finishing! I am extremely busy job hunting and doing contract work, but I still check in and read and am happy for all who are getting through this. ",

The doctors asked me to wait at least four weeks after surgery so that I could lay with my arms above my head. I could not do that any sooner and had to work with a PT to accomplish that. Also, they are concerned about the skin healing properly from surgery. My RO has said that I will not need any creams or ointments. They want to give me the the things I will need for that.

The exit burn on my back is larger as well. They told me that this is the intention of the treatment to get into those layers on the skin and burn them, get them peeling, etc. They wanted to make sure that I didn't feel like this was a mistake. They said that some people just have a more dramatic reacation with their skin than others, no matter what they do for skin care. So I have been in a lot of pain this last two weeks. They gave me cooling gel sheets, which kept unpeeling and the edges would irritate my skin. They did some saltwater compresses. Those were wonderful until I had very open oozing areas, then it started to sting. Mostly through the beginning I used the Natural Care Gel with a huge thick layer of Aquaphor over it, like I was icing a cake. As it got extremely painful, they gave me silvadene cream. I put that on, let it dry for an hour or so, then put on the Aquaphor. Then they also gave me Oxycodone. There has been so much pain, that even that can't keep me sleeping, but it helps a lot. I found that it helped me to NOT count down the days too much. I didn't start counting until I had 6 left. In chemo it made sense to me to count because there were not as many. When I had rads, there were 28, so it seemed a little like getting to work at 8:00, looking at the clock at 8:15 and saying, \"Great! Only 7 hours and 45 minutes to go!\" So I tried to spend that same energy focused on a job search and getting household chores done that I had put aside while I was busy working. Best wishes to all of you who are still in the race! Ralston: I had blisters. I thought they looked so small and delicate that they would pop soon. But they stayed for about a week through all the Silvadene and Aquaphor and saltwater compresses. ",

That is what I was expecting and then mine at my visit on Friday said that she wanted to continue to follow up with me twice a year to be sure there was nothing else going on. Ardychan: Best wishes! I am following up on my PET scan tomorrow with my MO, due to high alk phos levels. I can relate to the worry. ",

I had to stay up all night catching up on the rest of my work Sunday night, but came right home after a morning appt with dropping off work and got caught up again. I did get a call back for a third interview with one company for tomorrow. I get my port out on Thursday. I am working hard on keeping balanced and letting go of the stress, as difficult as it is with so much going on. RIght now I am watching OWN tv with an interview with Oprah and Iyanla Vanzant, which has some awesome insights. I am so fortunate that I can work on my contract design work and listen to shows like this while I work. I am still looking forward to GOING to work all the time again though. It will be a much better balance. ",

Maybe it makes a difference if someone is getting treatment to an area that went through a mastectomy - my chest is hard as a rock with no breast tissue or fat. My bolus image is still as clearly defined as it was when radiation finished. Anyone else?",
