I came back from my post-op follow-up today and the BS says he wants to see me in 3 months as I have nipple itching/flaking and ADH.  He says he doesn't want to 'open a can of worms' by discovering other lumps that need to be biopsied.  The more I think about it, the more it feels like he is a camel with his head in the sand and I can't do that.  I am opting to see a breast specialist in the meantime.     I wish you luck on your journey.  Stay strong and breathe. xo ",

I am 31 years old and I have never had a mammogram and the breast surgeon said I don't need one until I am 35...Only the lump they removed was ever ultrasounded or biopsied. So who knows what else is going on in my chest...he wants me to come back in 3 months for a check up since I have an itchy flaky nipple as well...red flags going up The more I think about this and read on this site the more I see I need to take the reins here in my care. Planning to sera risk specialist at a cancer hospital. Anyway, to answer the question, I am also overweight by probably 100 pounds unfortunately. I used to be a very competitive athlete. I am thinking of joining a Planet Fitness near my work and going on my lunch breaks. Also, I ate healthy today. A first for me. I usually eat fast food every day I'm afraid and I am almost positive that my lifestyle is contributing to my breast issues... So, step one, join a gym. That is tomorrow's project. And it's less than $20 a month! I spend more than that a WEEK on fast food. This is definitely a no-brainer for me.",

Yikes, so needless to say I think I am going to go for a second opinion since this was through a local hospital.  I live near Philadelphia and I am thinking of scheduling an appt. at Fox Chase Cancer center. My maternal grandmother had breast cancer but she didn't develop it until after age 70. Glad to 'find' you guys on here!  If you have any suggestions for the 'newly diagnosed' please let me know! Hope all is well and thank you!! Bre",
